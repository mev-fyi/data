[Music] hi everyone just a quick heads up that i originally recorded this interview with kevin joe of galwa capital to release next tuesday but since news was moving quickly on ethereum's proof of work chain i decided to release it this friday so today will feature a long interview no weekly recap although i do provide some further updates on proof-of-work ethereum at the end we'll run a short interview with a recap on tuesday and now enjoy this incredibly interesting and illuminating interview with kevin one inch is a top decks aggregator that finds the best rates across multiple networks

the code laura link in the description today's guest is kevin joe co-founder of galwa capital welcome kevin hey how's it going thanks for having me back on right now you're known for being an ethereum gadfly and before that you were the most vocal voice projecting the death spiral of the terra luna ecosystem both of these things have made you uh pretty well known but before we get into all that i would like to actually just start with your history in crypto you're definitely an og as far as i can tell you've been in the crypto space for nine years can you tell us a little bit about how you got started and how you came to be where you are today yeah happy to talk about that so i've actually been in crypto for 11 years you know got started in 2011 i was mostly just a lurker on the forums and i didn't really join industry until uh two years later you know i think you know i just found bitcoin it was only big really bitcoin back then i mean there were some weird forks uh and alts but it was mostly bitcoin and uh you know i was just really fascinated by it and you know at some point decided to join industry where you know in 2013 i joined the small startup called buttercoin and i worked there for you know two years it was an early crypto exchange didn't make it through the winter of 2013 and among other reasons uh was ultimately you know closed down but you know through that experience i was able to get a job at kraken uh worked there for two years uh and then decided to go set up shop for myself uh and this was in you know i think this is like end of q1 2017 it took us a while to to get started but you know finally launched in you know 20 2018 uh beginning of the year and i've been working you know at galwa uh since then and in your role as head of trading at kraken what did you do i was mostly doing uh otc trading so there was an otc desk and uh you know back in those days you know there was uh sort of more of a use case and need i guess for white glove service so anytime people wanted to move a large block there'd be pretty significant slippage and execution costs and we would be there to basically execute on their behalf and then you know provide them with the price to get these large blocks done you know this was around the time that you know there was uh i guess there was it bit there was like drw with uh cumberland and then there was circle there was also octagon uh there there were a couple players but it wasn't really that big at that time and i should disclose that kraken as a former sponsor of my shows um so now what does gal walk capital do uh is it just you managing your own money so i i don't want to say um too much about the structure of it uh but it's basically a trading desk and we primarily focus on market neutral strategies and so far have been doing uh pretty well and what are your assets under management i can't i can't talk about i can't talk about that yeah there's um there's general solicitation rules uh where i'm not allowed to talk about certain things well what's your trading or investment thesis when it comes to galwa well generally the idea is that we try and take fairly low risk you know we're involved with otc trading basis trades yield farming you know we do a bit of discretionary long short we do a bit of special sits and some market making as well let's now talk about tara luna when it comes to what happened there why do you think that it that you were more comfortable being vocal about the likelihood of the death spiral than other people who also you know kind of felt like it was probably going to go that way but really didn't speak up as much yeah you know i think um really a lot of it is that you know from my private conversations with a lot of people at the time uh there was actually plenty of people who didn't think that it would work that the whole thing was doomed to implode but i think the reason that most people didn't speak out is because i think there's a lot of political considerations uh within crypto you know for the most part a lot of the money managers a lot of you know the the company founders ceos exchanges you know people high up there you know having grown up in this industry together a lot of people know each other and you know i guess there's always the sense of you know they don't want to talk badly about somebody else's bags right because there could be you know real money at stake over there so for the most part i think people are very polite and they're very politically correct and very diplomatic about things and i think that at that point i think i think you know to some degree i think that's okay um you know i think it's important to be civil uh for everybody to get along and um you know i think i think that does foster you know good positive outcomes but i think um with that with luna i think it got a little bit too far and you know it's one of those things where you know there's there's multiple incentives some of it is consideration for their friends bags some of it is consideration for well you know if they say any bad thing about any company that might reduce the deal flow that they get uh you know to invest into new allocations into new companies so i think all those things played into it quite a lot and so why were you more emboldened to speak up about it rather than to try to be polite yeah i mean i think honestly i think most of it has to do with our situation uh which is that we're fairly market neutral anyway so we're not really carrying heavy bags long or short um so it makes it a little bit easier incentive wise i think um to speak out i think part of it is just my own character i mean i just i felt like you know i thought that that was something that everybody needed to know i mean for the most part we're usually pretty quiet like uh you know we can we can just make money ourselves you know it's not we don't we don't need to do any of those those types of things but i think for this thing in particular i thought you know it was worthwhile for the entire space to know and it affected um so much and there was so much at stake that you know i wanted to do a bit of public service there but i think you know it's a combination of those two reasons i don't think it's just purely me being altruistic i also think that i didn't have the same kinds of vested interests and that made it easier for me to do and ultimately did you end up making money off the tara luna collapse uh yeah we made money on that that was good money and can you talk a little bit about how you traded it uh yeah so uh basically uh i forget exactly which day of the week it was but uh it was uh at some point ust had started to de-peg to about 0.998 and at this point uh the liquidity on the curve pools was starting to dry up and also i think liquidity on some of the centralized exchange was getting a little bit more on the shallower side um so we were farming anchor at the time we basically we found anchor ups until the last day and so basically we dumped all of our ust and then put on short positions for luna and for ust on that intermittently as basically throughout the next couple of days the price of both started tanking there were actually points in time we were actually long luna and long ust intermittently just because we thought at least in the very very short term it was oversold but for the most part almost all of it was on the short side and then also there were cases where we wanted some luna to facilitate i think we we basically bonded the luna as was going through hyperinflation or near that time to facilitate a lot of liquidations on anchor so in some ways we actually supported the protocol uh indirectly through trying to make money because the liquidations were very juicy so we actually had to be long luna i mean i think we did hedge also and some of them we didn't even hedge we just went long luna just so that we could facilitate those liquidations wow oh that's so fascinating wait and then and then when you liquidate then what are you getting out of that uh well i mean it's a you know anchors of our lending platform so you know people post up collateral uh like and they're able to borrow ust right so we're basically we're we're the ones uh cleaning up on that when people are blowing through their collateral right and then like you know luna's price is dropping they get margin called on their b luna somebody needs to go buy that ust back up right so then that's basically what we're doing but you know i have heavy discounts of course uh so that was uh also pretty lucrative so so it was mostly on the shorting side as well as uh playing some uh some of these liquidations that's that's the main bulk of it there were some smaller plays uh but that's basically the main bulk of it okay and then i'm sorry so it's at one point in there you said that you were long also for periods of it but that was just to do the liquidations and when you say for periods you're talking about literally from probably that saturday when the peg started to get wobbly and then by the next thursday when it had crashed so you mean within this five-day period or whatever it was yeah yeah within that five-day period and usually the holding times were extremely short it was just as we try to get rid of it as quickly as we could we just do the liquidation just get rid of everything do the liquidation get rid of everything uh try to recycle capital as much as possible and then there were also periods of time where we just actually long luna uh and it was just that we thought it was just very very very short-term oversold like we would have periods of time of like like a couple minutes where we were just long luna just because we thought it was oversold i mean we we did think that it would that spiraled to zero but you know there were periods which is really i feel like undervalued in minutes kinds of time frames wow and did you did those bets turn out well for you uh it went pretty well yeah actually wow yeah yeah because in my head it just seemed to you know uh go straight down while the while the supply was ballooning um but yeah there were some tiny wiggles in there there were some tiny wiggles up in there even though if you zoom out it looks like it fell off a cliff but there was tiny wiggles in there okay okay no i believe you because oftentimes when i look at for instance the price of like eath or btc i'll remember oh back in 2015 like this and that happened you know whatever but then now because everything's the price is so much greater like you know on on the the scale now it just looks like it was all flat but anyway okay so i know what you mean and do you mind revealing how much you made off of your trade center okay okay that's yeah that's that's proprietary okay so now let's discuss the merge this is you know what's been filling your twitter feed and a bunch of other people's and i should let people know that we're recording on monday august 1st because i expect there might be further developments on this issue between now and when this comes out so if you're wondering why we didn't discuss those developments that's the reason i did notice that not only obviously have you been tweeting a lot about potential different scenarios that could play out with the merge but then also already crypto miner chandler guo said that he plans to create a hard fork of ethereum's proof of work chain with the typica with the difficulty bomb removed and for those people who aren't aware the difficulty bomb was or is a mechanism in ethereum that was sort of like this deadline imposed where the difficulty would would uh just increase uh in a really challenging way and it was to sort of essentially give ethereum a deadline to try to force it to move to proof of stake in the end they just kept delaying it so whether or not it really ever did anything is as uh well you can you can decide what you think about that but anyway kevin so why don't you walk us through what do you see as all the potential scenarios that could happen when the merge occurs yeah so just you know going off on what you're saying about this whole delay thing you know i made this joke in one of my blog posts it's a little bit off color but i think what i said was uh you know this thing i've been waiting for this thing for seven years you know i don't even know if it's ever going to happen i mean what's the likelihood that proof of stake happens first or how finney's frozen body gets resurrected you know a little bit of color uh but in any case you know i think that you know with this merge i think really what my point that i'm trying to get across is that i think there's a lot of risks that uh the public don't uh that that aren't thinking about the public aren't thinking about and a lot of that is because everything is kind of hidden by this quote-unquote very bullish and optimistic narrative uh that the merge is going to go through i don't want to say that these are problems that the ethereum developers and theorem foundation haven't thought about because i'm actually pretty sure they have thought about a lot of these problems because they went through a lot of them had lived through the fork uh with f classic and you know they've had so much time too so what i think is that the the real the really the issue is that a lot of these things are kind of being um hand waved away i think almost kind of what what maybe what they believe is for like the benefit of you know just the normal average uh everyday ethereum holder and i think that's that's that's a bit dangerous and i also do think that there are some concerns there uh that maybe even they have not uh thought of so you know that's i think really what what what the thing is and and you know this this idea about having this new kind of like fork uh with like what i call eth1 which is going to be like a proof of workforce with the difficulty bomb removed you know as opposed to just a smooth merge into eth2 which is the proof of stake side of things you know that was something that i've been thinking about for many years now too because i always figured that the miners wouldn't just go quietly into the night that they would try and fight for their claim and their stake in the future of ethereum and not just you know peacefully kind of just go mine other chains or go to youth classic which i mean i think some of them would so you know that's something that i've always been thinking about for a while but it only recently kind of came to mind you know kind of refreshed in my memory when uh you know as i'm talking to other people in the space everybody seems to have the same mantra and the same kind of talking points they're all super long heath and they all believe that the merge will will just go smoothly right i mean at the end of the day the merge is really a fork right but you know i think even the nomenclature is very interesting right i can understand why they do it but i think i find it pretty interesting the words that they chose there so i think that gave me a bit of pause right because normally when everybody believes something there's a lot of fragility in the system right because if everybody is already long then like at any sign of trouble there's a lot of asymmetric downside because all those longs close out and the shorts pile in right and also on top of that if everything goes well well then some things have become de-risked new money may come in maybe price goes up a little bit right but but generally there's a lot of asymmetric payoffs when everybody is super crowded into the same position so that's you know the first thought and then the second thought is that why is everybody just saying the same narrative you know like couldn't there be like a proof of work fork wouldn't the miners try and do something like that so you know i started thinking about this maybe a couple weeks ago four or five weeks ago um and then uh you know at some point chandler growth says oh we're going to fork ethereum and i kind of know chandler from back in the day i think it was we had a dinner one time in palo alto in 2014 it was us chandler was there leon who's the founder of hobie was there ben davenport founder bitco was there a bunch of other people were there and uh you know i i know chandler because um he's sort of you know one of the very early kind of pioneers in in mining in china and he knows all the minors super well and and he's uh formerly a butcher actually i think he i think he was a butcher and then his wife got into crypto or somehow and then he got super involved and then you know did tons of mining deals uh and knows tons of the miners in china so when i saw that it was chandler uh doing this fork i thought well this looks actually pretty serious you know before it was just a hypothetical i did think that it was gonna happen but now it's starting to look a little bit more serious you know and then also you know he put together his wechat group um you know tons of people in that wechat group uh certainly a lot of the miners are in there uh themselves uh maybe even some of the you know asia crowd from like exchanges or funds or whatever uh i didn't take a look close look at that so but are you a member of it i'm not a member of it no but yeah i i know some people that are in there and they've been telling me what's going on it's for people who want to mine ethereum as a proof of work chain after the merge it's basically generally supporters of that cause i don't know if they actually all are minors but generally the supporters of that of that cause you know so it just definitely made it more real for me you know before i didn't want to like i didn't want to hypothesize on a thing that may not you know may not happen right even now it's uncertain if it happens it's just more likely you know i didn't want to just stake my reputation you know things like that but you know after chandler made that post uh publicly and it's not just you know private chat within a wechat group but publicly he came out on twitter he staked his own reputation on it uh that it was gonna happen uh then i thought you know this thing it looks like it's a lot more likely than people think it is at least here on the west so i might as well say something and if it is going to happen there's so much work to do between now and then if those things are not yet prepared for right so you mean on either side both sides on either side i would say i think on either side to be fair and and i think that uh there's a lot of considerations to be had it's not just the execution of the work but also uh the ideation of all the different hedge cases and all the possible failure cases and what could go wrong uh or what not even what could go wrong but how do things even play out um you know so i think there's a lot to be said on that point okay so let's actually so we're going to walk through kind of all these scenarios we'll just start i'll just kind of probably quickly explain at least in my estimation why it is that so much of the ethiopian community for a long time just felt the merch will probably go through pretty seamlessly i did mention this in my book but you know i feel like you know there's two kinds of hard forks and ethereum there's a very common one that occurs quite regularly where uh so hard fork in general is where the system makes a non-backwards compatible change meaning that if anyone continues to mine the version um that's not upgraded then suddenly they'll be on a different blockchain basically and those you know they're very carefully planned the whole community is notified given you know in fact lots of advance notice and a lot of the developers will you know prepare for that and um i think i described in my book as like them preparing basically for something as as big an undertaking as like a space a shuttle launch you could sort of argue that this is one of those right but you're right that what's different is that now we have a constituency that feels that it's going to sort of lose out these are people who've invested a lot of money a lot of you know basically just into their minors the gpu miners to mine ethereum uh which is like you know just solving the puzzle that enables them to add new blocks to the blockchain and so their investment sort of goes poof and so they you would say this is what you're arguing is that they're motivated to keep doing that to try to earn this money but i guess what i'm curious about is do you see any other group besides the miners interested in doing this because i'm just wondering what do you think the value is of fork of ethereum you know that continues to mine proof of proof of work if it does not have the same amount of developers if it doesn't have for instance you know just all these d5 protocols on it with all their developers even the stable coins perhaps the nfts there's a bunch of oracles on ethereum you know this whole like composable system of d phi on top of ethereum now if that doesn't continue then what really is the value proposition for other entities in ethereum to try to keep this proof of work chain going yeah so i think there's really um two classes of incentives the first is uh pure grift right so somebody can just make a fork they know it's probably not gonna work they don't plan to support it uh they're just gonna get some free coins uh all sorts of different copies of coins as well as the base coin ethereum fork abc d whatever and then just dump it right so then is that just a quick trade like they trade at once and make a killing and then move on or i don't even know if they can make a killing but but i think that you know there must be some money there as long as some exchange uh lists it maybe there's going to be some shady exchange that's willing to list it uh you know and then somebody can somebody inadvertently bids for it some somebody clueless you know uh hasn't followed through with things haven't hasn't looked at things too closely bids for this thing confusing with eth um you know all sorts of other things you know maybe you could just dump it on them right so that i think that's the first class and that's the more sort of nefarious class this is sort of the position of the eth maximalist in eth2 about what eth1 is right which is the proof of work chain um i don't entirely agree i think some of it is that but i don't think all of it is that and then on top of that there's going to be other forks probably where like kadena probably is going to go do their own fork and also there could be just a proof of work fork with the difficulty bomb still intact uh and there's all sorts of weird games that you can play with that and all sorts of weird grips that can happen there so i think it's not just limited to two forks it could be multiple forks um some of those forks probably are grips some of them may not be grips i think on the may not be griff side i think it's the idea that let's say you have what you have today which is ethereum but you don't have any of the developers or any any of the projects who created the project supporting the projects that they did right you don't have oracles and you don't have any stable coins or non-duplicable assets like wbtc uh you don't have bridges and you don't have uh nfts or at least very few nfts right is that still valuable well you could make an argument that it is because once it's been hollowed out and let's say there's some crazy defy liquidations on that chain because the oracles don't work because the price of then you know ether one or whatever is super low uh compared to everything else but once everything's been hollowed out all the quadrations are done and there's still some final resting price for eth1 which is not zero which i don't actually think it will be zero then like this chain still has some value there's a lot of infrastructure that's already built out nobody operating it but there's a lot of infrastructure still there right is that better than other l1 and is that better than if classic i think you can make a good argument that it is interesting but if you don't have all the developers to maintain it then i mean like it just feels like it would be a big undertaking to attract the sheer number of developers to maintain all those systems right uh sure i think for some other projects you would just find developers who are not the original developers of it who but understand the protocol and they can just kind of take over you know maybe there's some like whoever scoops up all the liquidations of let's say compound token on this you know compound one on ether one now they control the governance of compound or a collection of them do they create a new dev pool or something or you know something like that uh give it to these new developers they can maintain it and then the other thing too is that not all of these protocols need maintaining like for example uh uniswap v2 doesn't really need maintaining because we're already on unit swap v3 right so it's like if they're okay with unit swap v3 how it is and unit swap v2 which is already fine then nothing even needs to be maintained it just operates itself right uh they may not get an upgrade to unison b4 but you know they have something there at least right i mean but i just wonder like how many liquidity providers are they going to have on that and even you know for what you mentioned earlier why so why would anybody want to be part of a compound in which like one entity really controls it you know i it's just sure or maybe it's like multiple entities like i i i don't know all i'm saying is i think it's worth considering because given the state of some l ones out there and i don't want to name any names some of these are real ghost chains and it has exactly the same problems of this uh let's say bad scenario for eth one and yet still trade at very high market caps and still have some users on it i mean i don't i wouldn't be there i mean i don't know why they would be there but they're there you know and they do use it and there's money to be made and there is money for you know people to engage in liquidation to engage in market making to engage in borrow lending i think we can only look empirically to say that it's not unreasonable for this proof of work chain to be something like 5 billion 10 billion 20 billion yeah i don't even 50 billion who knows right i mean the market will determine that um i think you know when you look at the i think also as a side note not to just plug your book but i have actually been reading your book and i really appreciated all the detail particularly about the etc fork episode i had lived through that but there was a lot of stuff that i'd forgotten and also a lot of details that i didn't even know about especially within the ethereum foundation so i thought that was a super interesting read and also to refresh my memory too but yeah basically when that happened nobody thought that etc very few people thought that etc would survive as a chain they thought that at some point nobody would mine it it would just die off no no exchange would list it you know so on and so forth but it turns out and you know i think it's what's reflected in this um belief is that they did not implement replay protection right because they didn't even think it was gonna exist right but then eventually at some point it started trading otc a little bit on reddit uh across the otc desk on bitsquare which i think got renamed to bisque and then eventually polo listed it in the dead of night and i think according to the book it was saturday i remember it as a wednesday but my memory was actually wrong i think i think it was actually saturday so it got listed in a polo in the dead of night on saturday and then the price just started skyrocketing and also because there was no replay protection there was all sorts of crazy things that had happened right because like i think coinbase got trained uh for for a ton of e3 classic i forget which one uh just from all the replay attacks uh that happened uh and then people really quickly scrambled to create like prism contracts to do the splitting of the coins you know this this and that and then also a lot of the uh other exchanges the margin trading exchanges also had a huge headache to deal with because um you know with polo bitfinex and kraken they had these margin positions but they're all handle they were they were also constructed a little bit differently like certain ones of them had like you actually do the physical borrow before you can use the capital uh like with the our lending book like polo and uh miffin x and then crack it it's just like implied in the leverage uh when you trade so first of all they're constructed differently the margin training and then second of all the way that it would it was eventually handled was also different for all three exchanges it was different and it basically came down to who owed this token or who was supposed to get this like you know periphery kind of token this etc and i think between the three of them between the long shorts borrowers and lenders one of those demographics got screwed by each of the exchanges and all three were different um so i think there's first of all a lot to talk about even on uh dealing with contracts on exchanges that are not physical ether right because the physical ether here you know splits uh but how the contract settles could be very exchange dependent right but also it just goes to show that there's a lot of unforeseen consequences uh for things when we think that something can't happen or don't even think about it because it's so it's so far gone right like the possibility is so foregone in our minds that the idea never even gets generated i think that's when things are the most dangerous yeah and just for people who may be familiar with the term replay protection it refers to when you have these two or sorry when you have a blockchain and then it forks immediately after unless you uh create the fork in such a way that they truly get split the the addresses will be the same on both chains so if you uh suddenly now own both eth and etc you have the uh it's very likely unless you use a splitter or you can you know build in replay protection yourself that when you for instance sell the etc that you no longer want you will also sell the eth at the same time uh both coins will be sent out so this is what caused a lot of pandemonium at the time of the dow hard fork because um yeah people were scared of losing money that they didn't want to lose when they got rid of the coin that they didn't want or you know vice versa there were just so many shenanigans and yeah that that whole incident is well documented in my book if you're excited to check it out everybody buy laura's book yeah yeah there's i mean i just my mind was blown when i was researching all this because there was so much i was not aware of at the time yeah and maybe just also to just jump in and talk about the replay attacks actually remember now with coinbase what had happened which is that they didn't recognize etc originally um so what ended up happening is that like let's say they have a million eth and a million etc right so like i have like 100 eth on coinbase i withdraw it and then i replay that withdrawal transaction because it's all that transaction uh is also valid on the other chain so i replay it so now i get 100 etc from coinbase now i redeposit my 100 eth and coinbase recognizes it and then i withdraw it again so now i have my back my hundred eighth but i can replay that second transaction to get now an extra uh 100 etc so pretty soon i can just start draining coinbase of etc 100 at a time by just moving back and forth um this this eth uh you know in into their exchange so that's kind of how they got drained of a whole bunch of uh classic and and you know i think to the credit they made every good goal after all that but you know it's just one of those things where and you know you there's like leaked skype logs of this stuff but with all the exchange owners were talking with the uh devs and uh basically it was just pandemonium i mean it was just like okay you guys can stop trading now and everybody stops trading okay you guys can start trading again okay stop trading again no they they did they didn't allow the the stopping of the trading they they they were really basically pissed that the appearing foundation they were very pissed i remember they had to do that they were mad um and they refused so all right so in a moment we're going to talk a little bit more about the different scenarios that could play out but first a quick word from the sponsors

kevin so just really quickly because you've said this a couple times and it just makes no sense to me why is it that you're saying that it is a possibility that some group will want the proof of work chain but they won't want to remove the difficulty bomb they will keep it i have zero understanding of why anyone would want that yeah so um you know i was what i was thinking about is that are there very weird uh griffs that can be done with this and i think that uh the answer is yes which is that if there are certain exchanges which for example may be insolvent right like for example i think hitbtc is probably insolvent right i think they've been insolvent for a long time uh and just hiding it but my personal opinion i don't i can't verify it you know just just uh just for rumors on my i probably will not also be able to verify this before this goes out so yeah but uh but in any case some exchange might be hit btc or some other exchange uh decides to then just go short their own instruments unless they have like their futures or they have perps uh they have some kind of margin trading there short their own instruments uh start their own derivatives and then later recognize the original eth with the difficulty bomb with proof of work in place as what the contract settles to right in that case the price is going to plummet they can make tons of money from the shore hopefully dig themselves out of this insolvency hole right like because at the end of the day what do they even have to lose right they're already insolvent right maybe this is a way they're gonna piss off the customers right but in this way maybe they can just like kind of make themselves more whole or something like that right now there might be a play there right because you could also then just go to some of these exchanges who might do this and you could just go short these instruments themselves but then the the risk there is that now you're putting the more likely this is to happen the more also likely that the exchange is a solvent to begin with so do you really even want to put your money in exchange that probably is insolvent for them to even try some crazy stuff like this right um so you know that might be a reason uh for them to do it is to play like contract shenanigans uh and derivatives right so that that might be one reason you know another reason is just like maybe by accident maybe someone's running some really out of date software right and then they're just like completely their node is just completely on the wrong fork or whatever right like i don't know it just doesn't upgrade correctly it doesn't go to move on to one of the more uh main forks you know there's other um so like through error or through grift i think there are games to be played on why people might want to keep the proof of work with difficulty bomb you can even have frivolous lawsuits for example right you go to like the stable coin issue okay before i say this before i say this i want to say that i've been accused of speaking things into existence right but i by no means am i recommending that this is a good thing to do or that it should be done and i personally don't think that i speak things into existence because i think some of these guys the people that would do things like this probably have are already scheming about these things and probably have already thought about it and if they haven't they'll come to it anyway right so i don't i don't personally think that i'm speaking these things into existence and i'm certainly not recommending this as a good thing to do or that it should be done absolutely should not be done but it might be done i think that's worth considering out of curiosity so we've looked at a number of these possible edge cases that you think might happen but leaving those aside which scenario do you think is actually the most likely i think the most likely case is that there will be at least three forks with the difficulty bomb without the difficulty bomb and proof of stake i think that the proof of work chain the main one without the difficulty bond does not go to zero and i think maintains a decent amount of market cap my current prediction you know don't hold me to this is completely finger to the wind is something like two to ten percent of ethereum 2's market cap for the final kind of resting place for youth one's market cap now that being said in the very beginning during what i call the panamonium era or the panamonium blocks there's going to be a lot of liquidations and craziness that happens definitely on eth1 possibly also on eth2 and a lot of the eth2 holders are just going to dump their eth one a lot of their support is going to dump it so it could be massive amounts of selling pressure just from this kind of thing happening but i think as long as there's some expectation that eth1 does have some future value there will always be some bids that are willing to buy this kind of falling knife at some price it may not be a very high price but it may be some price and then once all of that selling pressure ends then there can be some kind of equilibrium price uh some kind of long-term uh price representing i guess more fundamental value uh for the coin so i think at least um at least those things uh will happen so in a way it almost sounds like you're saying the proof of work chain with a difficulty bomb will be kind of what you explained where it's maybe some exchange that's in trouble that's kind of trying to use this to dig themselves out of a hole that for the one with the difficulty bomb removed that that would almost in a way be like another version of ethereum classic like a quasi-ghost chain some activity nowhere near as kind of healthy and vibrant as actual ethereum but but like has ideological support and like some development activity is that kind of it and then what i would say is i think on the pessimistic side i would say that it's probably a bit worse than eth classic i think on the more optimistic side i think it could be many times better than heath classic so i i think it's really hard to say i i don't i don't i don't think it's necessarily a ghost chain and it would be better because it already has all this other stuff built on top that each classic doesn't have yeah and i think there's the token distribution too right it's just like you're literally forking over balances it's like almost like a vampire attack in that way right where you already have the demographic of users who already use all of these products and know how they work because it works exactly the same on one chain versus the other chain so you know you don't need to teach them anything new you know it's just like for example if you like brought over the eve classic users to ethereum that demographic is not as great because they're not as used to using a lot of the apps that are on ethereum right but when you actually fork the balances and i guess the state right now all the users are exactly the people who are currently using ethereum right in his current state i'm not even sure that it will be a ghost chain and i think all of these scenarios need to be considered right it's like this um kind of like this branching worlds kind of thing right each step of the way there's like a different branch and what i'm suggesting is i think we should inspect every little branch on every other branching tip and just like look at each of the different possible cases it's extremely tedious most likely you know all but one branch will play out right so you're wasting tons of effort and time but is it really wasted to exactly then figure out how to respond to the correct branch right doing all this preparatory work because when it actually happens it's going to be all out chaos and there's no time to figure out anything so to just do all the preparatory work yeah maybe 99 of the work that you do doesn't be wasted but that one person is going to be so valuable that by the time the fork happens uh you already know what to do and you don't have to spend the brain cycles to go think through all of these different steps when you already have a game plan laid out for all the different thousand you know not thousands let's say like 50 different possible weird you know sub-scenarios that could happen like basically um ethereum and many chains right now are highly dependent on stable coins and at least tether has stated publicly that they will support uh east 2 and um i imagine ustc will be the same those are the two biggest stable coins so how would a proof-of-work chain of ethereum continue without having these massively important stable coins yeah so what my thought there is is that uh with almost certainty and this also brings back another thing i wanted to talk about which are some weird grips with the original chain um but uh i think um with almost certainty i think circle and wbtc are just going to choose entirely uh eth2 as the chain where those coins can actually be redeemed by dollars in the bank account or btc tied up somewhere right pegg somewhere i think with tether i think it's most likely that they'll go with the proof of stake chain eth2 yeah i mean they already said that uh well i mean i think the language that they used was very ambiguous uh because i think i think paulo doesn't want to make any commitments that he needs to walk back right so the language that he said is that he said we will support eth too right but once again like reading the steam yeah i can read the exact quote he said support of eth2 will be seamless stable coins should act responsibly and avoid disruption for users especially for defy it's really delicate when he says that support for east too could it will be seamless either he what he's saying is and this is sort of like the maximalist reading right like two people can read the same thing interpret it differently right but the youth maximalist reading of this is that we support each two we do not support each one right integration will be with e2 will be seamless but we will not integrate with each one but a literal interpretation might be that they will support each two and they will support eth1 there will be usdt on both chains but still opens the question to where it will be redeemed where the resting balance at the pre-fork block though those usdt where will it be redeemed and most likely eth2 but there is some possibility that let's say um you know tether just decides well i'll tell you what we're going to let people decide where they want to transport their usdt we can't duplicate it but maybe for this account or for this protocol or whoever controls the private keys you can signal to our contract you want to port it over to eth1 you want to point it over to eth2 let's say five percent of people point it over to each one ninety-five percent people report it to e2 well then in that case you've not duplicated the money you've allowed people the choice maybe if people don't make a choice you defaulted to eth2 but that is a possibility now i'm not that's not i'm not advocating for that you know i'm gonna get a lot of hate for even suggesting that as a possibility that's not what i'm advocating what i'm saying is merely that we should consider that as a possibility because when we consider uh tethers incentives they have multiple incentives right the first incentive is to not lose the money right so that it actually doesn't get duplicated right so you can't just like get drained right do some kind of like manual kind of draining attack on it by redeeming too many coins so they can't duplicate the coins you gotta make sure that right they also have to make sure that the consensus mechanism is working correctly right so probably proof of stake ethereum works i mean they have you know seven seven test nest merged already i'm inclined to believe that probably there won't be consensus failures but who knows right we already know that proof of work works so there's just not going to be a consensus failures we're proof of stake probably not but there's a small chance right so maybe they just kind of wait they just kind of wait and see you know they don't announce free beforehand which i think is a mistake i think they should announce beforehand but maybe they just wait and see and you know maybe okay proof of stake one in a million chance something just goes wrong okay fine well then let's just you know let's just say that usdt converts to proof of proof of work one but the other thing too is that maybe they also don't want to get blamed politically for playing favorites and they say well you know i got a lot of business in china i got a lot of business in asia you know all these miners they trade on bifidex i don't piss them off so i'll tell you what i'll let people choose default should goes to proof of stake too uh you know eth2 but if some people want prove you know eighth one you know so be it you know uh and then the other consideration is that they don't want to anger the eth2 people right because even if they allow a single dollar to be redeemed in eth one you know it's going to be hell it's going to be held right he's they're going to get an earful they're going to be rage everywhere uh from from the e2 crowd some of them swearing that they would never use tether again i don't buy that argument right i think a lot of them would stop i think a lot of them switch to usdc i don't think i mean you know tether has a lot of liquidity they have to have a lot to say right so so i'm saying that all of these things are possible why is nobody talking about this stuff my issue isn't about people disagreeing you know saying that my ideas are wrong it's just that i feel that i am being censored by the very mention of these kinds of ideas and if these ideas are not talked about and something crazy happens then this will be just very devastating for people you know with you know there's a lot at stake a lot of people have a lot of money to lose you know let's now talk a little bit more about etc because you seem to you know imply this is not going to be as in demand but i'm curious about that because you probably saw that ant pool announced an investment of 10 million dollars into ethereum classic and uh that's going to continue to be mined by proof of work and i just wondered you know how you thought ethereum classic might be affected uh with with all that's going on i don't know if you think proof-of-work minors will want to just switch over to ethereum classic i i can't imagine this but maybe what developers want to go over there uh you know we haven't seen much development activity there but i just wondered kind of what you thought all of the fallout of this would be for ethereum classic i think if developers wanted to go that they would have gone there already i i just don't see that really happening but i do think that there is some uh possibilities for ith classic too right which is that if it can absorb a lot of this fallout of of hashing rate from this this merge this fork then you know there's greater security to the chain and there must be some value to that now there's always some kind of argument here that there's some level of security which is necessary and anything beyond that is in excess right so it's a lot driven by demand right as demand increases then the need for security also increases right so i think that there's some thought that eth classic can't absorb all of the mining capacity of eth right now and i think that's kind of true i think there are diminishing returns to excess security uh budget right because there's not enough transactions uh yeah because what are you securing against you know you just have like security budget of like you know 10 billion and then people are trading like a dollar a day people are moving a dollar a day you know you don't need that much security budget you know so so i so i think that like the two beyond a certain point the security budget um you know has super diminishing returns so there's there's no need for that but i do think that like if a lot of the mining power does stay on ether one then at least the capacity for demand to absorb demand uh is pretty high with that security budget right and then also there's another consideration which is that what exactly is the security budget of proof of stake right there's an argument to be made that it's all of the staked ether right there's another argument to be made that it's the opportunity cost of the staked ether that comparing liquid ether to staked ether you give up a certain opportunity cost which is the optionality of selling it right and if that's the case then you know that's a different way of considering security budget right so if if things were purely based on uh security budget concerns and not demand focus then you know we need to do some very careful calculations uh and analysis on what the actual security budgets are uh you know especially given the you know decrease in inflation uh on on eth2 right as they put that into place right the 99 reduction where i forget whatever much uh reduction it is right so first of all what is the security budget and the second where how much slack is there right because like excess security budget doesn't even matter anyway right so then it's all about demand side right and considering how much usage there might actually be now initially there's probably gonna be a lot of usage on ether1 just from people doing all the mev and all of the liquidations you know all that stuff right so so you know all this stuff is hard to say what i'm saying is that we should just start asking these questions i i think that it's just a little bit irresponsible not to talk about these kinds of things right because like at the end of the day the urban foundation all the youth devs uh vitalik they're very smart guys you know and they've all already done all sorts of tests and war games about adversarial environments within the closed on-chain ecosystem right but what about adversarial behavior and environments from outside of the uh you know outside of the on-chain ecosystem the off-chain world right the meat space right i feel like a lot of that has not or yet been talked about and not yet been wargamed out it's worthwhile to talk about those things and then and i just want to you know finally get back to one last thing that i was saying about another possibility which i don't want to speak into existence but you know but i don't think it is that's what's happening is that there could be litigation where um somebody keeps going and gets a whole bunch of usdt or some even usdc or even wbtc right some of these non-duplicable assets on the proof-of-work chain without the difficulty bomb uh diffused right so with the difficulty bomb intact saying that the initially the claims of you know the these tokens were issued against this original chain right and therefore they should be able to redeem it and therefore they're just gonna you know do some kind of frivolous lawsuit i do happen to think it's frivolous they'll probably lose but you know that's something that somebody might try right and for them it's the reason they might try that is because it's such a cheap option if you can buy usdt on this chain at 0.001 right then like you know for them it's such a cheap option they just have to pay you know legal fees or whatever right so it's like there's tons of reasons why you know these edge cases on why certain things like this can happen right and yet nobody is talking about it okay yeah i mean i take your point like you know as i mentioned in the book it was very clear that the developers thought about the world one way uh they you know viewed ethereum kind of through their lens and they really didn't understand how the trading community viewed ethereum and that was what resulted in etc being created after the dow hard fork i think you're right that you know that is a possibility that that could happen and or is is happening at the moment one thing i did want to ask about was you said that people will be motivated to like right after the hard fork just do simple things like liquidations on the proof of work chain so are you saying there that because a number of users will have abandoned the proof of work chain that they'll have certain positions indeed fire or whatever that get liquidated and so other people can profit from those is that what you're saying yeah so so the idea is that uh you know on a chain where let's say ether one let's say its value is like five percent of each value right and and that is being used as collateral to borrow certain other types of assets or other types of assets are used to borrow that then like all of a sudden the prices are completely different than the pre-fork block so then one side just gets liquidated right because there's not enough margin collateral right so there's like stuff like that there's also stuff that you can do where it's like if it's if it's sure that all these stable coins of wbtc go go to eth2 then all of that stuff is completely worthless on eth1 so everybody just dumps everything that they have on that side for the native token or for some other types of governance tokens compound one or ave one or whatever all these other types of tokens which actually have maybe have some value rather than these tokens which absolutely have no value right so um so there i think there's going to be a lot of that and probably a lot of that just goes into you know maybe some of the larger stuff you probably just do manually you know gas prices probably sky high but you know the bots are probably just going to try and scoop up as much of that as possible so the first couple blocks are just going to be filled to the brim with all sorts of crazy like that basically just people just trying to give away nothing for something basically um so i think that's basically what's gonna happen i i still feel that most of what you've said shows like a short-term benefit to doing all these things but i don't know if i've really heard a case for you know some kind of long-term value and a proof of work ethereum chain yeah so what i think there is that i think this is um basically the the current line and where the overton window has shifted uh with the eth maxis is that you know originally it's that one won't exist and then now it's that each one will exist but it'll plummet to zero and what i'm saying is i want to push that even further and say uh but it's possible that it's not zero right like why don't we even just consider that possibility right and let's say some people some people on the in that camp find some people some devs to run some of these projects and for other these projects don't run them at all everything just gets completely in pandemonium crazy liquidations people dumping all sorts of non-duplicable assets tons of selling pressure on eth1 and then what right and then what you know like maybe some value still right maybe having these contracts there may be having borrowed lending pools i mean arguably it's just saying that like when eth right now is hollowed out is it still better than other l ones but maybe you know that's possible right like i almost feel like it's kind of a weird argument for the e2 guys to make because it's it's almost like saying like well we'll feed this holly because they're kind of a hard spot right because if they say if they say oh this thing has no value then you're almost saying that like besides certain tvls and certain non-duplicable assets here and not having pandemonium that eth right now wouldn't be valuable if they say that it does have value then it almost gives credits to the other side on trying to do what they do i think really one of the biggest issues i think with the eth2 camp is that they don't have consideration beyond the world that they think they exist but besides the contained world that's within their view right they don't truly have considerations for the miners they don't really think about them as like real people there's like they're kind of like if you ask them are they real people they'll be like yeah but they don't really think about it like viscerally in that way right i guess people with families you know with uh you know you got to pay the bills you know like that right like it's just like some folks in a foreign land that do certain things that's currently secure the network now we've given them enough for warning they knew this was coming they shouldn't have invested into this hardware uh knowing that we would have switched to proof of stake right so it's sort of like it's it's i think it's really this kind of mentality that i think is um a little bit just dangerous right uh because then you're not if you don't think of them as like quote-unquote real people you don't think of them as having like real incentives right you don't think of them as like you almost kind of like you almost like disregard their intelligence right and their self-interest and what they might do you underestimate um the lengths that they will go to try and protect their claim on what they think should be theirs right and i'm not the arbiter for that right it's not up to me to decide who's right or who's wrong right i'm just saying that we should consider everybody's perspective and everybody's incentives like you know i'll give you another example on the lending desk there's a multi-prong approach to whether or not forked coins need to be returned right so like let's say i borrow from you uh abc right and then in the time that i'm borrowing it from you there's a fork and now there's x y z right if x y z is very very small in value i don't actually have to return it to you right i just when time comes up i just return to you abc but if xyz has a lot of value i do need to return it to you so how is that determined right it's determined by like there's usually this multi-prong approach has to do with like hash rate has to do with like exchanges and prices has to do with you know there's some five percent threshold somewhere in there i posted that on my twitter about all the different prongs uh that's an example some people do differently some people do it similarly but i think i find one thing interesting which is first of all oh two things interesting first of all one of the prongs actually talks about hashrate because the reason that that was written into the contract in the first place is because before we've only had proof of work and proof of workforce right like eth classic and eth were both at the time proof of work bch btc they were all proof of work there were two proof of work chains so it makes sense to compare hashtag right but what about like when one goes to proof of stake and one goes to proof of work then the language of contract doesn't quite make sense right yet that is actually the language and maybe there is some viability in holding that in court right like maybe there's some guy who just like doesn't return part of it and just goes hey look it's based on the hash rate it's not based on like whatever economic security or whatever right so there could be games that people are playing with these lenders themselves and i think on top of that there's also a question of what is the fork right what it says is that air drops and forks must be returned if they're above a certain threshold right but then it begs the question what is the original chain right what is the forked or air dropped asset and what is the original asset right now i think with bitcoin it was kind of obvious right bitcoin was original asset bch which made protocol changes was the form over here you can make an argument both ways you could say that proof of work ether is the original asset or you could say proof of stake either is original asset or you can even play the grift and say that proof of work with the difficulty bomb intact is um the state of the the original asset right and this whole has implications on how settlements and the borrowing lending will be done which i think people will resolve but i think people need to come out and say okay the galaxy you know genesis all these guys need to come out and say oh well this is how we're just gonna handle it right um or like you know or like this is these are the considerations here's the new four-prong approach everybody needs to resign contracts you know something like that you know so so i think there's just there's just a lot to be done there yeah yeah i mean i agree with you on all that that yeah there could be a lot of messiness i did want to ask you about what i consider your highly entertaining tweets they're often written in the manner of ancient times and they invoke terms from the video game starcraft or they invoke romans carthage etc um i'm just gonna read some of my favorite uh which i think were the tweets that you published after the collapse of tara and it began the sacking of crypto carthage i'm only going to do this victory lap once so gather around my name is kato scipio by another name breaker of pegs master of strategy distinguished orator best larper of crypto twitter arbiter of justice keeper of the autists servant of rome and humble farmer we are here today at the end of a lunar era i have said that carthage must be destroyed and so it has come to pass in victory let us remember to bear it with grace war is ugly and filled with many casualties on both sides mostly theirs and so on i often have to look up historical or video game references to even try to remotely understand your tweets why do you write in this manner yeah so i think it's really for two reasons the first is that um you know i think it's just kind of fun to be a little bit bombastic and to reference certain things in histories or uh culture that i think are appropriate metaphors for the current situation so you know i think with the with the whole luna thing um you know going off of the third punic war you know there was this guy the senator uh on the conservative faction in rome who always said and ended his speeches with uh and therefore carthage must be destroyed right and uh the basically the context of this is that uh carthage sometimes it wasn't their fault but they were always uprising they're also rebelling against rome this is why this is the third punic war right and uh basically every time they would get wealthy every time they would get powerful uh they would try and take rome so what keda was saying is that this will be forever a thorn on our side uh this thing is just really bad uh for our great empire and we must just completely destroy it once and for all right i think eventually convince the senate and that's why you know carthage was sacked and i think that was actually the correct decision from a military and strategic standpoint i think morally it was a little bit actually questionable but i think from a military and strategic standpoint it was correct i think that part of the analogy i think doesn't quite fit uh because i actually do think morally i should have been destroyed too but the idea is that there is this cancer that if we let it mestasticize uh it's just going to completely destroy the rest of us here in rome which is crypto right so that's kind of why i use that that metaphor now the reason i use a lot of starcraft metaphors for this one is because uh i don't think the goal here is to destroy ether i actually kind of like either and i'm long either right now like personally not not with the fun but you know my personal holdings um but but i think that there's um something very uh relevant about the analogy that i used which is about the protoss the protoss conclave which is a race in starcraft and the majority of them are bound to something called the kala it's basically a psionic bond a telepathic bond with all of these other individuals uh within uh the conclave right and at some point some of them rejected this collectivism right this collective thought and this kind of like mind melding and decided to sever their psionic chords which are these chords that are attached to their heads that give them this ability uh to meld uh into mind-meld with everybody else and to become an individual right and uh they were branded as heretics and they were cast out and uh you know basically exiled from the homeworld of ire uh to some other planet which is eventually the homework for these dark templars the nerezim uh which are uh which is uh which is called shakuras and i think that this the reason that i wanted to use this analogy is because i think that this was a lot more relevant to what was happening today you know wait so just like fully connect the analogy to what's happening in eighth one and eth2 or by the way these are your terms i i hopefully ethereum people won't be pissed at me for using those terms because i'm not sure what they're using um but yeah proof of stake coin or proof of stake ethereum versus a proof of work ethereum so just explain the the full analogy yeah so what i'm suggesting here is that the eth2 people they're like the uh coli protoss which are the ones that are completely mine melded because they're completely mind-melded into an echo chamber and they can't see beyond with their own world right and what i'm saying is that the reason that i'm like the dark templar is because i'm trying to think of all these things outside of their collective agreement and consensus about how things are going to be i'm trying to think as far outside the box as possible and because of this i'm branded as a heretic and exiled right and that's why i wanted to use that particular uh metaphor and that's why i thought it fit you know i i could have used some roman metaphor too i could use all sorts of random you know metaphors rap metaphor i would love to use some rap metaphors one day but uh you know that's why i thought that this was very relevant and i think the second reason is because i wanted to show them that at the end of the day i'm not really their enemy that at the end of the day both the dark templar and the protoss coli are brethren right at the end of the day they're they're part of the same group of people and i'm you know even though they exiled me that i'm not there to try and do them harm and in the story of starcraft basically eventually they banded together and uh you know uh were able to cooperate uh because what i'm saying is at the end of the day i don't see you guys like i can't as a cancer like i see luna right i don't see you guys as carthage i see you guys as my fellow brethren um but i just have different thoughts and i do not want to be a part of this collective group thing and the quote-unquote narrative and the narrative is what i call the kala i guess what i'm saying is that hopefully more people i think start to question things and to start thinking through a lot of implications for things that may or may not happen and i think that that's that's healthy i think one of the biggest problems that i've always had with ethereum even though i'm longing is that i feel like the brain trust that they've built has a lot of dogma and you know there it's it comes from this engineer kind of silicon valley mindset right in silicon valley there's tons of dogma which most of the time is true and that's why it's repeated and used but everyone smiles false for example growth at all costs right there's few things that determines a startup success besides its growth rate however there are some pathological cases where you can have extremely high growth but which is not monetizable at the end and becomes a bad business for example like the appio where you can text you know basically yo each other uh yo your friends text just text yo to everybody there's like wework right which had enormous growth but there's questions about the sustainability of business at the end of it right and you know just other other that i can't even think of right now just other other cases of that right like change tip for example that was another case of it hard to monetize the hyper growth startups there's another dogma that i think is interesting which is the builder versus the trader meme right and it is always it's always implied in all of these dogmas that builders are the heroes and traders are secondary and less right and i think that uh to be fair i do think that builders are very important right like i think most traders think that builders are very important but most builders don't think that highly of traders right because they think that they are on a moral or a moral high ground and they don't quite respect this the level of intelligence of of traders in general now obviously there's some better and some worse right so there's always something kind of like this this this permeating unexpressed unsaid silent agreement that it's the builders that matter and i think that that's sort of one of the reasons that i even proposed in the first place you know one of my tweets that hey i'm going to consult for either side i'm a mercenary i'll consult for either side for five mil and if you only want me to exclusively consult with your side you got to pay me an extra two and a half mil for for gun profits that i could have gotten maybe from the other side right and you know i changed my mind about this later but at the time i was thinking to myself you know why shouldn't i make money you know why i think my ideas are pretty good i think there's a lot of value there why should i just give them out for free you know they should pay me in fact i feel like it's symbolic right because like if you because what i was thinking is like what's the actual expected value of a lot of this stuff right like if things are done correctly versus things are done normally or averagely it probably affects the market cap of like total ethereum ethereum one plus two plus all the other forks by like probably more than 200 mil you know so i was thinking man you know five mil this is what a great deal for them you know they could just get that right and i almost i was kind of being a dick right because like i knew like the the eighth foundation they don't pay their debs like very well right so like all the devs make like only 100 grand right and then i'm like oh yeah i know this random trader just comes in just gets five mil just for his ideas he doesn't even do he doesn't even code it up he doesn't execute on these it's just for like just for idea right just for thinking about you know so i kind of wanted to like i wanted to uh you know i had some feeling about just really wanting to stick it to them uh a little bit there and uh you know and i think i think part of it also wasn't even so much about uh the money or even my own ego you know because like ever since i was growing up everybody has always told me that i was i was smart you know so like at this point i don't think what people's thoughts are about my intelligence are gonna move me either up or down on that i think i'm pretty set in my own beliefs about myself but it's almost like i wanted them to kind of like concede that they did not think of everything right and that that's why i wanted it to be a sizable amount but not so much because i kind of did want to help them you know i didn't want to price that at ev but i also didn't want it to be like insignificant i wanted to be that it was something where it was just like a public concession of that idea yeah well i i just have to say for people who didn't see this exchange so i'm not sure if vitalik was trolling you or if this was a real response because it could also be his reality but he wrote wait i read the above and i'm confused why does twitter say that so many people i know follow galwa capital is it a famous parody account and because of who he is i truly didn't know if he was being real or if he was trolling you but you you think he knows who you are and that he was just i'm pretty sure he's trolling me but but it's okay either way i mean i i still like the guy i still think he's a is a really smart guy but you know i guess i guess you know originally the reason i made this proposal is because i i did feel like there was a lot of dogma and i wanted them to publicly come down and out of that dogma because you know at the end of the day if they're on the same page we can all think through all this together they certainly know their own protocol better than i do right so if i'm the only one trying to come up with all sorts of weird uh cases i'm not gonna even get to all of them right so we should all work together but that can only happen if sort of the veil of dogma is parted and part of that i felt like was just concession that maybe they had not thought of everything right like and there's like tons of dogma out there right there's also like software will eat the world well it will but but not everything right there probably there are some weird cases where actually goes in the reverse where we start doing with more humans and less software right probably there's at least some weird cases like that there's like money is a shared illusion well that's true money is a shared illusion that's the property of all good money but is that the only thing like maybe there's some knock-on effects with the properties of the money itself which then also have feedback effects on it becoming a shared illusion and the shared illusion having feedback effects on it right like i think a lot of these common sayings are generally good heuristics to use but is eventually start to permeate what we do and our thoughts in the simple version and then we take it as true right i did want to like ask you specifically about this issue because i do agree that there's a disconnect kind of between traders and the ethereum foundation or developers in general and in my book i wrote about how immediately after the dow hard fork there was a trader at kraken who tried to obtain the coin that eventually became known as ethereum classic at an extremely cheap price and this was like in the few days like right after the hard fork but before etc was actually listed on exchanges i recently found out that that trader was you so i was wondering for the upcoming merge are you trying to do the same thing i don't personally think for the other so first i i do want to talk about that but i want to say that for the upcoming merge i don't think that i'll be able to get these coins that cheap right because like if i really wanted to get these these coins cheap then i would say yeah you're totally right uh each one goes to zero you know and i'll just scoop that stuff up myself right when it goes like really pennies on the dollar pennies on pennies on the dollar now about that uh particularly point about that uh with me at tracking yeah that definitely happened and uh you know what's funny about it is that i wonder if they're still sore about that right because uh it was still at a time where i was in a very aggressive make money mindset right so i was like well clearly these guys they're way too optimistic they think that this thing absolutely has no value but i think like it has some value right and i didn't even think it would have that much value this is like before polo listed it right so i if you even for me i was like maybe this is like 10 cents is it like 10 to 20 cents maybe okay so if i can get it cheaper than that that's probably a good idea right um so i reached out to a lot of these devs uh asked them to to otc it i actually got two i'm not going to name the names but one of them for 70 000 and another for i remember it was 200 000. i could be wrong it was bigger than 70 000. yeah ethan slash atc what was then being called dead eth but anyway yeah i guess entirely i didn't even know they were internally calling it daddy what we were calling it at the time was ethc so it wasn't even etc at the time um that came that came with polo listed they basically named named the coin ticker basically at the time we called it was eth classic ethc i basically got him to agree to sell uh seventy thousand and two hundred thousand uh etc at two pennies apiece and then basically they needed a longer settlement window i really i realized later from reading your book it was because uh the person was on vacation or didn't have access to it for a time but i remember that the other person they gave me the reason is that oh they'll get to it because they you know they need to do the splitting contract and all that so they get to it like i remember it was a friday that they were going to get to it but i could be wrong maybe it was actually wednesday and i got that confused with a listening day but for some short time afterwards now normally with otc trading you settle uh the trade within 24 hours now for this one i knew that i didn't want to bother i felt like i was getting already getting such a good deal you know so i was like i don't want to like rock the boat there so i was like okay you want longer settlement that's fine you know it's all it's all good you know okay i'll get it eventually you know so then basically in between the time where i did the trade and confirmed that i have receipts of them on on email confirming they i still think they owe me money by the way but i'll let it go but uh but anyway then the dead of night polo lists etc price skyrockets way higher than two cents i think i forgot what a rally to 150 or something uh after a number of days i forget but i think it went as high as 3.53 cents if i remember correctly yeah i mean some somewhere along the way so then in the end they you basically reneged out of their trades and uh i didn't get paid on on those trades which which i mean is extremely rare in otc when you word is deed when you do a trade when it's done it's done uh you know you know reverse out of that and i'll tell you another thing too uh one of the reasons i was actually thinking about this uh so i was i was already um kind of looking at the uh bit square and bisque markets right uh in reddit right but one of the reasons i was i was thinking about this is because i don't want to say who but there was somebody who approached kraken and said hey we want to buy all of your etc that's now worthless has no price for one penny each right and i was like wow this is way too much tail risk right so you know i talked it over there's way too much television like well what if like all of a sudden it revives and stuff and has value or whatever you know one cent is way too cheap right but i think looking back i might even even sold it to him for 10 cents right because that was my counteroffer i came back to him i said you know maybe for 10 cents we could do it you know i still have to think about i still got to talk with jesse and stuff and he's honest too too rich for us you know we can't do it you can't do it at 10 cents you know so uh that was very fortunate not uh not getting wrecked on that trade actually was really uh really fortunate but uh getting reneged on on the two cent trade was uh very unfortunate yeah well i have to say like it just amazes me um how i'm finding out this tidbit now because you know i mean yeah finding out even what i did about this offer from the kraken trader was it was not easy um let's just say you know people don't want to talk about stuff like that so um yeah it was kind of a fun nugget for me to to find out who was behind that well this has been an incredibly fascinating conversation i just you know really felt like you know you know whether or not any of this comes to pass i think you know i would agree that it's at least worthy thinking about these possibilities and having a game plan in place for any of them in the meantime well i guess we'll just have to see how things play out when the merge comes uh where can people learn more about you and your work um yeah so they can go to um at galwa underscore capital on twitter um yeah post a lot of my thoughts over there i did want to say actually one last thing if you don't mind which is that i did say that initially um i made these offers uh you know for consulting you know because of these reasons right and eventually i actually changed my mind that's why i kind of rescinded it because i thought at the end of the day i i still think that it's important that we get paid something for doing consulting but i think the way that i phrased it as two different sides going to battle with each other i think wasn't healthy for the space and i think at the end of the day it shouldn't be a kind of game where if you hire me i will also help you destroy the other side so i think that's basically off the table if people want to hire us and do consulting we'll still do that but not in an aggressive way to destroy the other side i personally think that both sides have a right to exist and it's not for me to judge which side is correct in this kind of moral or ethical debate you know in the markets in the end of the day i think it'll sort things out and will settle so we're still open for that i don't mean it in a way to say that you know it has to be this side or that side that pays whoever wants to pay uh we'll take it and but we'll only try and suggest constructive things that are actually good for the space without destroying anybody and i think that that was my mistake and that's what i i feel like i did wrong which is why you know at the time i was a little bit you know aggressive at the time but having thought about it and slept on it i think it really is important that the rome survive and we do what's best for the industry all right well we'll have to see if either side takes you up on it but in the meantime it's been such a pleasure having you on unchained yeah likewise it's always fun i appreciate it laura as mentioned earlier kevin joe and i recorded his analysis of the possibility of an ethereum proof of work chain on monday so there have been a few updates on the topic from the past few days first as mentioned during the show chandler guo an important and well-known chinese crypto miner announced on twitter that he would be attempting to fork the ethereum blockchain and create a proof of work chain back at the time of the dao hard fork he had initially said he would attack the ethereum classic chain and then a month later changed his mind he tweeted last week i forget therian once i will fork it again on monday the day this interview was recorded bitmex released a blog post outlining in detail many of the same theories kevin laid out here i highly recommend you read this for further information on tuesday a new group called ethereum proof of work tweeted that crypto exchange poloniex would be supporting the proof-of-work version of eth poloniex subsequently followed up with a blog post on thursday stating it would list two potential forked eth tokens eth s representing the proof of stake token and eth w representing the proof of work token all ethereum eath holders on poloniex will receive the forked assets at a one-to-one ratio when the upgrade is completed poloniex said following poloniex's announcement justin sun the owner of poloniex and founder of tron said that he would donate some of polo's eth w to the potential proof of work eth community and developers to help build the ecosystem also ethereum proof of work tweeted that usdd would be the first stablecoin of the ethereum proof of work community for those of you who have read my book you will see echoes of what happened at the time of the dao hard fork here including the involvement of chandler guo the fact that traders were a large driver of the interest in the old chain and that polo was the first exchange to give legitimacy to the old chain thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about kevin and the whole ethereum merge check
