iTunes App Store smart contracts are on the rise and that trend will only continue security has become an absolute necessity and quantum is B standard for smart contract security for the blockchain with a team of security experts dedicated to defeating the bad actors quant stamp is the gold standard for safer more reliable smart contracts find out more at quantum calm my guests today are Yaffa new CIA director of analysis at the Center on sanctions and illicit finance at the foundation for defense of democracies and Tom Robinson chief data officer and co-founder of washing analytics firm eliptic welcome Yaya and Tom thank you great to be here hi Laura yeah yeah let's start with you what's your background how did you get into crypto so I have a background as a counterterrorism analyst I actually started several years ago at the Central Intelligence Agency I was hired as an economic analyst and then got into counterterrorism and when I left the agency I worked in financial asset recovery basically working with the team to identify assets that were kleptocratic assets that were hidden around the globe and while I was doing that I got connected to FDD the foundation for defense of democracies which is a national security nonpartisan think tank here in Washington DC and became the director of analysis for this new Center which focuses on looking at economic security and u.s. national security issues and so since I got involved with FTD back in 2015 I started researching developing and new emerging illicit finance threats and risks and that sort of led me to crypto just sort of being very curious about how crypto was being used by illicit actors and for the past couple of years I've been doing some deep dives and helping to engage policymakers on the risks and the benefits of the technology and Tom what is your background and how did you get into crypto so originally I was a physicist so I did a PhD in physics so specializing in atomic and laser physics I was trying to build an x-ray laser so I did that for about 4 years eventually sold out and went to work in finance and then in about 2011 I heard about bitcoins from an economists friend became fascinated in the technology and eventually persuaded a couple of friends to co-found a lipstick with me and so we're really passionate about helping crypto currencies to go mainstream and the key issue that we saw was holding that back was the the criminal use of crypto currencies so our mission as a company is to work to detect and prevent more use of crypto currencies which we do in two main ways so first of all we work with law enforcement agencies to help them to trace crypto currency transactions that originate in criminal activity and we also work with financial institutions to prevent proceeds of crime in crypto from being laundered through their platforms so when we say financial institution that can mean everything from a small crypto currency exchange to a to a multinational bank so we've been doing that for about five years now working some of the largest law enforcement agencies and cryptocurrency exchanges in the world I love it I feel like you two would make great characters for some future movie about crypto it's like ex-cia x physicists working on lasers so you two co-authored a study on bitcoin laundering that kheema earlier this year and before we actually dive into the details of that study how big of a problem is laundering with crypto so I think it's becoming an increasingly important problem so in our study we were looking funds originating from cyber criminal activities such as dot marketplaces ransomware attacks thefts from Bitcoin exchanges which in itself is a big problem I think what we're starting to see in addition to this is proceeds of crime from non cyber criminal activity start being laundered through cryptocurrency is another crypto assets so I think it's starting as liquidity increases in these assets then the scale of the problem is really increasing and do you have any numbers that you can offer I'll jump in here I mean Tom may want to add to this but actually this was an issue that we dealt with when we you know started looking at the data because there's always this desire to list a number how much is being laundered through crypto or through Bitcoin we only looked at Bitcoin we looked at it from we looked at transactions from 2013 and 2016 and it was interesting because we said up front that you know our study was looking at data but we were not assessing the total or estimating the total amount of laundering that that is occurring because that's really a very it's very difficult just a complicated thing to try to actually pin down I think sometimes when you hear people talking about actual numbers they're pretty much guesstimates we decide we took the tak of looking at actual transactions coming emanating from specific illicit markets darknets dark net markets and similar illicit sources and then just identified how much of that or were out of the amounts going into conversion services like exchanges how much of that specifically was what was illicit so we don't we're not saying that that there is X amount of laundering happening in crypto but we're providing with the study an assessment of trends that have happened emanating from dark dark markets patterns geographical changes the US versus Europe versus Asia and that's what we were really trying to do because so much of the conversation in this space lacks data and people don't actually point to transactional data and that's what we were trying to do with the study I did see a number that I think a director of Europe all gave but it sounds like you're saying that that is probably some sort of estimate that maybe isn't least in really I guess detailed research so it's a one figure we did provide was that less than 1% of the funds going into these services these exchange services originated directly from these identifiable criminal entities I think that's an important figure because these are funds that the exchange in theory could identify as being illicit through software like ours and so it shows you the level of criminal funds going into those exchanges which could be avoided ok so so maybe we can I guess hang on to that a little bit although I do wonder if in the year 2017 of that changed because the since the years of your study covered 2013 to 2016 I feel like that was a much different time in crypto because everything changed last year good why don't we dive into the details of your study so you know obviously you mentioned that you were looking at very specific transactions that are going from these known addresses to other services but is that how you would define money-laundering and crypto generally or was that just for research purposes yeah I actually would say that it's interesting you pointed to the shift you know money laundering generally is a multi-layered process right that involves you know taking illicit proceeds putting them in the you know the either the banking system or putting them in another business moving them layering them and you know it's a very you know a process where you're going in between different ecosystems whereas with Bitcoin as we looked at it you know we're really talking about just one ecosystem so I think we have to think about laundering a bit differently it's sort of a different framework the interesting thing is you know maybe last year for example the question might have come up well will different illicit actors use and this is this is actually shifting a bit from our from our study but I hope you don't mind me just sort of going on a bit of a tangent you know people would ask you know are let's say drug cartels using are they money money laundering through Bitcoin right and you know we may assess that you know a lot of you know drug cartels aren't necessarily going to be exchanging they're not going to be shifting to Bitcoin when they have all these other methods of doing laundering but I think something that I've noticed the past six to seven months they've just been more reports of maybe not shifting to crypto to launder illicit proceeds right if you're from the Fiat world but actually experimenting using accessing crypto as part of the process of shifting funds moving funds so I think we have to look at crypto as being another tool kit for laundering for you know for from the perspective of illicit actors who are looking for different ways to mix and move funds around so in a way the way we should maybe think of your study is that you are looking at a subset of the type of money laundering activities that could be done in crypto and so your findings are sort of focused around around that one subset yes so I think we're focused focusing here on what we call Bitcoin laundering and this is where the illicit proceeds have originated in Bitcoin so for example ransomware or a dot marketplace the actual activity has been in Bitcoin as opposed to generic money laundering so for example if an organized crime gang in Europe is selling drugs for cash and then is trying to transfer that cash back to Colombia they might use Bitcoin as a means to transfer that value but the the funds didn't originate and cryptocurrency originally okay so what were the biggest takeaways from your study well there were a few I mean again looking at the 2013 to sixteen timeline some not surprising like as Tom mentioned that you know darknet markets being the the main origin of of most of these illicit funds but what was really interesting from a policy perspective was one the big difference between laundering that we saw on European exchanges versus North American exchanges there was a significant gap and I think that was one that was probably one of the biggest takeaways I mean evidence very clear you know by looking at the data that there was just much more illicit activity happening on European platforms and why do you think that was the case cuz I also noticed that and thought that was super interesting but I'm not sure of why was it really kind of well I had one theory but I'm interested to hear your take I think we concluded that one possible reason for this was the the difference in regulatory responses to cryptocurrencies so in the u.s. since then back in 2013 issued guidance that virtual currency exchanges as they called them were money transmitters and were therefore subject to anti money laundering and CFD requirements so for example exchanges had to identify who their customers were through kyc processors had to submit suspicious transaction reports to regulators and I think that probably did have a huge impact and prevented criminals from cashing out to some extent through exchanges bases new ass there was no such move in Europe so exchanges were freeze operate without identifying any of their clients and that's only changed very recently so the the fifth anti-money laundering directive has now been finalized in the EU which means that virtual currency exchanges and custodial wallet services now will have to identify their customers will have to submit suspicious transaction reports and so I would hopefully see that making a big difference to these figures but those controls still won't come into force and so probably the end of next year one other theory that I had was that I wondered what percentage of those transactions were going through btc-e which came down last summer because they were such a sketchy exchange so was that kind of a huge worth day or was that one exchanged accounting for a huge percentage of these transactions yeah I think so Tom I don't know if you yes a few big players who contributed a lot of that yes so there were a few bad actors who are disproportionately affected that figure Oh interesting something else that surprised me when I was looking at your study is that a huge percentage of these money launderers we're directly moving their dirty coins to an exchange rather than using a mixer or tumbler first why do you think they would do that just because they knew that these exchanges didn't care or I think back in 2013 which is when this the period of this study started people just weren't aware of how transparent Bitcoin is there weren't the same tools available to you exchanges of law enforcement they're now available and therefore the risk of sending your your dirty funds straight to an exchange was much lower we should also note that I mean so that's true and and also we did find that gambling sites and mixers as you might expect did have a high proportion of illicit funds going through them so it was sort of evidence that you know people do use these tools to took to launder to launder funds before they send them elsewhere yeah I guess I would have thought it would be a much higher percentage than it was but some thing I was curious about is have you guys looked into whether or not any I cos have been used for money laundering yes that's something we have looked into we have seen evidence that the proceeds of some criminal activity have been fed into ICS yes not on a large scale at the moment but we have seen it happen which makes sense how what does that mean meaning that the people who are trying to invest to get new tokens so you know to buy into the sale that they're using yes for example somebody has hacked an exchange stolen some ether we've seen in some cases that ether being transferred to a I see a crowd sale address and so they would have received tokens in exchange for that that stolen ether and that's useful for them because if no records are being kept if no kyc is being done by the by the issuer then that helps break that link to the illicit source of funds and how widespread of a problem do you think that is um so we haven't seen it a great deal but it's a risk that ICAO issuers and banks are actually quite sensitive to so a problem that's a lot of ICA issuers are having at the moment is that they raise these huge amounts through icos converted into fiat currency but they'll then unable to find a bank that will accept those funds and so a lot of them are turning to us to doing analysis on the source of funds and just verify that it hasn't come from chrome like 17 interesting well as we mentioned before you kept the study the focus of the study sort of narrow so what are their questions would you like to answer next time around if you you know look more into money laundering in cryptocurrencies I think you actually you you hit on one which is on our mind right now which is what does the landscape look like now that btc-e is gone I mean you're very right you know back in 2016 and even early part of 2017 you know btc-e was so prominent I mean they were just you know just many examples of volition activity going through there and so with with with that being shut down and also the shift in different dark net markets going down alpha Bay being shut down a big question is and I hate to say it like this but who is or what is the next btc-e that's I think the biggest question and something that we want to look at the data and and see what the answer is something else I'm curious about is I've heard this stat but tell me if I'm wrong but I heard that regulators catch less than 1% of all money laundering that uses Fiat so if that is true why would a criminal be motivated to use cryptocurrencies for money laundering oh I guess well in in this case of this study it's because they that's the crime that they like they were earning this money already in crypto yeah I mean I think you know they're different you so think of crypto as I mean as as we know right this is money native to the internet so although this is changed and I think in the earlier days you you're pretty much you were pretty much talking about folks who are involved in cyber crime involved in crimes that are purely on the internet and it would just make sense you know if you're dealing with the darknet market it just makes sense to to use crypto it's perfect for that but I think what's shifting and it's funny it's sort of a double-edged sword because adoption has been the biggest hurdle but as adoption increases it only makes sense that more people who maybe aren't just operating in cyber will eventually start start using crypto now there's one example which is you know it's not an outright sort of money laundering case but late last year there was a woman you know late 2017 there was a woman who Department of Justice indicted for sending money to Isis and she did so really through the banks and we she used you know wire transfers and she was trying to get money to to Syria basically but one of the things that she did was she used her credit cards and she used her credit cards to to purchase a crypto think Bitcoin and maybe some other cryptocurrencies but so so why would she do that what was the benefit well if you think about one thing if you are let's say you don't care about your credit and you're just trying to send money to Isis right and you get your a credit card now if you want to let's say get a cash advance you just max out your credit cards you can't do that you can't use a credit card and then just get cash you know now max out ten thousand twenty thousand dollars but what you could do at least I know at the time you could you could purchase ten thousand or twenty thousand dollars or fifty thousand dollars worth of of crypto and you know maybe if you had multiple credit cards so that's one way to quickly get value and then use it for an illicit purpose to send to send overseas now she didn't send crypto overseas she then you know went into the banking system but it just shows that this is just one additional tool one way of circumventing barriers and legal hurdles to try to transact illicitly interesting all right we're gonna talk about privacy coins bad state actors using crypto and more but first I'd like to take a quick break to tell you about our fabulous sponsors imagine this you dedicate countless hours of hard work to creating a smart contract only to be hacked in mere minutes if you think that can't happen think again we hear that ten billion dollars has been raised through smart contracts but over three hundred million of that has already been compromised hackers are hungry for more so security is not just critical to your success it's an absolute necessity and that is where quant stamp these standard for smart contract security comes in with a team of security audit experts dedicating to defeating the bad guys the quant stamp of approval is your solution for safer smart contracts find out how we can be the gold

with - you see and Tom Robinson how our privacy coins like Manero and Z cash affecting your ability to do this type of work so we all starting to see increased usage of Manero by some criminal actors so for example a number in fact most new darknet marketplaces now offer maneras payments option well they they are also branching out into Bitcoin cash like waiting and a few others we're also starting to see Manero start to be used during the laundering process so for example around somewhere operator might have managed to extract some bitcoins out of after their victims and in order to prevent people like us being able to trace those funds they might swap into manera at some point through an exchange and that means that we it's been very difficult to continue following the trail we don't see much joy in fact any illicit use of Z cash perhaps surprisingly other than the shadow brokers offering some of their dumps in return for Z cash payments we haven't really seen any dark net adoption of Z cash and what is a Shadow Broker so the shadow break is where a hacker group and who were able to steal some exploits and hacking tools from the NSA and I think some other groups and offer those for sale for protect currency so for example the exploit that led to the the wanna cry ransomware outbreak that came from that's that group and for manera when you said that a lot of them are may be performing ransomware and earning Bitcoin and then exchanging its Manero so you can't follow the trail can't you find out from the exchange who did that you can as long as the exchange is doing kyc ie they know who their clients are and that's simply not the case for some exchangers so for example shape-shift don't do kyc and for that reason for example the funds from the wanna cry ransomware we're in Bitcoin were sent to shape-shift and were then converted to Minari there's not much in that situation you can do to continue tracing the funds interesting and yeah I mean we've seen this we've seen examples of this hurdle from from an arrow for example since 2016 one of the things we've been doing at our Center is tracking some jihadist fundraising campaigns that have been you know openly running on social media and on telegram channels that haven't raised a whole lot of money but the thing is we've because some of these groups have been very open and have posted their bitcoin address we've been able to do analysis you know look at the transactions go to you know let's say even a blockchain a Bitcoin blockchain browser and just you know see what they have how much money they've raised and so there was this one a jihadist group that apparently is based in Syria operates on telegram and Twitter and late 2017 we were really just tracking them because they were saying hey send us money where we will use it for weapons and for supplies and so we were tracking them for several months just seeing what they were doing how much they were raising and at one point I remember they they posted a new graphic which said you know now you can pay us in Manero actually wasn't just Manero they said they had a couple of other crypto currencies but they listed their Manero address and so my head and personally i hadn't really been looking at Manero before i just hadn't had a case with Manero so i you know thought i said okay well this is great now we've got the Monaro address they're using so I went to the Monaro browser that you can look at and you you know can put in the address I put the wallet address in there and as opposed to the typical Bitcoin browser where you can see all the transactions see how much is there the Monaro browser gives you a prompt once you try to you know look at that address and it literally says something like are you trying to look at this guy's Manero address Manero says no so there's absolutely no access even though it's clear that that is an address but you know I you know we couldn't see what was in it if it how much it transacted so that's just a very real example of the difference between some of the privacy coins and Bitcoin and and more other public blockchains do you have a theory as to why C cash is not being taken up the creator of C cash by the way Zucco Wilcox he was on Unchained and that's a great episode if people haven't listened to it you should go back and check it out but he did say that but I I wasn't sure if you know if he was being totally honest no but it's interesting that you're confirming that yeah I think it's true and I think one of the reasons for that is in the criminal community there is a huge amount of distrust about Z cash it's seen as being part of the establishment you know it's backed by venture capital money it works with the big banks the whole ethos behind it is something that they they distrust as opposed of Monaro which is very much more just an open source project and which they are that therefore more willing to put that trust behind oh my god I can't believe it's ideological I don't know why I didn't think of that I had my theory was that I guess it's it's more expensive to use the privacy yeah side of it and just more you know gravitationally intensive and whatever and so maybe I just thought it's like a little bit more of a pain to use it in the private floor mat or something I I was thinking just a long purely practical huh yeah I mean I would personally use the the phonology that I thought was the most anonymous but I think ideology in some cases can confront that it's interesting and so just to draw out the thread there so if I am a hacker that obtains Manero Manero is not easily convertible to Fiat I imagine and so what I would do is maybe then use shape-shift again to turn it into Bitcoin and then cash out or something is that what you think is going on there yes yeah I think that does happen a lot there are exchanges though that accepts Manero deposits and where you can cash out in Sofia so it is possible in some places to do that directly interesting let's also talk about what the kind of governmental response has been like if you were to describe the spectrum of responses we're seeing from different countries what are you noting what are you noticing there and has there been an evolution in the state response yeah I mean if well it definitely depends on which country which jurisdiction you're you're talking about I mean you know here in the US as Tom mentioned there was a pretty you know early early on there was a worse guidance that was put out and and I think that you know our study shows that that actually impacted the amount of illicit activity you know I think some of the other states so for example one of the things that we've been looking at here has been Russia you know what what has Russia's reaction been and actually there is a really interesting pattern that we see with some particularly authoritarian governments I mean you can draw this parallel across jurisdictions which is people using crypto and then a lot of state you know some influential folks in states saying you know this should be banned or we need to really restrict this because you know one we can't control it whether it's concerns about capital flight or called concerns about illicit risks and you know back in 20 I think it was 2014 2015 in Russia there was talk about you know making it illegal to to have a Bitcoin business and then we saw in 2016 2017 there was a shift where instead of talk about banning Bitcoin the Russian government actually started talking about maybe we could use this technology maybe this blockchain technology and cryptocurrency is they said sometimes could be used to evade sanctions you see something similar in Venezuela where you know you know i you might have talked before about how you know venezuela has because of the cheap electricity Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining became very popular the government was trying to ban that and then what did it do in early to 20:18 it unveiled its own cryptocurrency based on the nem blockchain so and and there's even talk now about Iran Iran you know recently has started to crack down on Bitcoin and Bitcoin exchanging within the country as its currency has really gone down and is facing more financial pressure because of US sanctions so there is this pattern of some governments being afraid of crypto then seeing the technology maybe could be used to advance its aims and then you know they started embarking on projects or even investing in the technology and I think Russia is probably the biggest example of that right now yeah I actually just want to flag for listeners who maybe don't listen to my other podcast unconfirmed you should definitely check out the episode I did with Alex Gladstein of the human rights foundation oh my god oh such an interesting conversation but he talked about how Venezuela was what he considered the site of the first crypto war and he described you know what you just mentioned yaaaa which is people there obviously as the Bulevar has crashed they've been turning to cryptocurrencies and trying to mind them in different things and the government has been trying to confiscate their equipment and then of course now has try to launch their own cryptocurrency it was a really fascinating conversation and he goes into that a little bit and I do think that is what's going on there which is interesting um yaaaaa you also mentioned Russia what do you think because they are being maybe more proactive in and open toward this technology than a government like the u.s. at least for now what significance do you think that could have for for I guess our relations with that country well it's it's a huge geopolitical I won't say shift but I think it may have geopolitical implications depending on how things turn out so Russia just to sort of give more of a backdrop you know why is is Russia doing what it doing you know Russian baying several you huge Russian banks are under US and EU sanctions for you know for current for you know annexation of Crimea and so the Russia has sort of felt that it's you know this banking sector is being hindered by by these sanctions and so one of the things that that they started doing is you know like like they're doing like other countries are doing you know investing in pilot projects blockchain projects getting the banking sector to consider using blockchain technology which is again that's sort of par for the course I think we see that elsewhere and even in the US I think it's a little bit different I don't think the u.s. it's it's that Russia is is a better environment for for blockchain or for crypto just that there is a much stronger strategic intent by the leadership of the country to say okay we're really gonna ramp up and do this so that we don't have to deal with with sanctions so the implications are you know if if Russia were to develop and create an alternative system so like an alternative system to the Swift banking system which is how you know banks transfer money around the globe through it through the regular banking system you know if they were able to create a blockchain based system where financial institutions and businesses could transfer value around the globe without going through the traditional banking system theoretically it would make them maybe more more more impervious to to US sanctions to EU sanctions which means that you know maybe Russia can do what it wants without less fear of international repercussions and financial repercussions now I don't think that that's necessary even though Russia has pretty much said that it wants to do that I don't think that that necessarily means that it's gonna occur because it's much more difficult and it's easier said than done and also in order for that to work you know there would hat it couldn't just be something that Russia does Russia can't just build a alternative blockchain you know a financial Network and then you know and transact with the rest of the world other countries would have to buy in but that's what we're looking at there's even bins I think some signaling that Russia is talking to Iran now that that you know that the u.s. is has removed the the nuclear sanctions put back the the jcpoa the nuclear sanctions there is an environment where it might be in the interest of a country like Iran to actually cooperate with with Russia but again all of these things right now are still in play it's not clear how it's all gonna fall out yeah it's kind of interesting because it does make me think I totally agree with your point that Russia could develop that kind of assistant but it wouldn't be useful unless they had buy-in from other players because obviously these are networks and so you need you need other people on the network to make it useful but it just put in my mind the idea of potentially someday some sort of like crypto network that is just moving money between all the bad state actors I actually though wanted to circle back to this conversation around Venezuela as well I wanted to get your take have you looked into this sort of like crypto war as Alex Gladstein had described it that's going on there and do you have a sense of a kind of which side is sort of winning out because I think my main thing about the petrol is apparently you can't see the transactions there so do we have any visibility to how well that's doing we've been looking into the petrol because a lot of our us-based exchange clients are very concerned that they might have some exposure to funds originating from the patro and so we we've looked at the small contracts involved so originally the petrol was going to be based on aetherium it's going to be an ELC 20 token but then they switched over to turn them so there is a non contract which is called the petrol which people have referred to there have been some transactions on it but nothing on the scale that you would expect from a public crowd sale of tokens on the scale that's been reported we also have seen no evidence that anybody has actually successfully been able to pay for any tokens and the public crowd sales so it is overall very unclear what's actually going on here if anything at all yeah and I I agree and you know that's the way I'd also you know categorize it is you know the petrol right now it appears to be a failed experiment but I don't think that it is an insignificant one I actually think it's it's pretty significant because it's actually a test case it's the case of a government which is you know you know involved in human rights abuses massive corruption under under sanctions by the US trying to figure out a way to use this technology to undermine those sanctions and to bring value to to the regime and I actually think that you know the way Venezuela has done it it shows it's just you know very you know poorly poorly done and just it's it's been a disaster in terms of their execution but it actually provides I think lessons learned for unfortunately for other actors who may be in a similar situation in the future you know that there have been some reports that Russia has been very supportive of of this campaign of the petrol and and maybe even be involved or pulling the strings it's a little bit unclear but I'd say that this is something that other countries and and even other non-state actors could learn from you know the the mistakes and all and what would be some lessons that you think they might learn well you know you exactly you know which type of blockchain is is more advantageous and you know one one thing is just how they how they have structured it so looking at the the NEM blockchain you know I think what it looks like from our standpoint is they created the tokens now something called the petrol on the blockchain and then they said that they would be available for a pre-sale we can't we don't really see that it looks like they've deployed they've separated the tokens into wallets where from my for my standpoint it it seems like maybe these are the you know they've set up wallets which would be used to for people to purchase through exchanges or what-have-you but when you look at Venezuela's infrastructure they don't really have it they don't really have in a thriving or robust exchange industry yeah so it just really seems like a very like a fumble they put sort of put the cart before the horse I mean I think like with any ica in order for people to have confidence in your token and the value of it you need to show some basic level of technical aptitude otherwise people are going to lose faith and with the pad tray it's yeah just very unclear what's going on yeah and I think another lesson to learn would be if they couldn't manage the Bulevar well then it shouldn't give you a lot of faith in Petra and they also didn't they didn't get any public you know buy in there there was not there was no one country that said alright we'll support this you know maybe behind closed doors but nothing nothing publicly so without that I mean yeah it's it's really it really has no value yeah it's sort of like someone just going on the street and saying like this is valuable but you know if other people don't back you then nobody's gonna believe you one other and actually the last lesson that I would hope that people would take away and or you tell me if this should be a lesson but I would hope that people would also say that for a project that is centralized that creates a point of failure if there is kind of like this one organization that's controlling it but maybe that a decentralized crypto asset would be more successful do you think that could be another lesson people might learn I think so I mean I think this sort of the petro hit people out of nowhere and and you know people were sort of unsure what to think about it but it's I mean the way it's played out actually kind of proves the point that you know all all tokens are not created equal and just because someone you know some some entity says it's crazy creating a token doesn't mean that you know one it should be supported that you should try to you know that you should try to invest in it and and so hopefully this sort of raised that issue because I think mostly in the crypto space there's been this idea of okay you know for the for the in for those the folks who love crypto and right are trying to build the this ecosystem it's almost like okay we want to support this we want to support you know innovation and I think this sort of it brings home the point that you know every just because a token is created doesn't mean that it should be supported no such thing the idea behind the patch right a thing that was going to give it its value is the fact that each token was backed by Venezuelan state assets I think each one was backed by a barrel of oil and so if you're going to have that kind of backing I think it's difficult to do that in the decentralized way that needs to be this central party that you can go back to and redeem the token if you want to yea and trust that they actually will give you rose an oil or barrel of oil or know the same value so speaking of state bad state actors what about North Korea they were most likely behind the wanna cry attack which we mentioned earlier and some people say they may have been behind some of the hacks of South Korean exchanges what do you think that they're doing with cryptocurrencies and why what's their motivation Tom do you want to touch on this first I think the primary motivation is just to raise hard currency I think they are looking at ways that they can easily steal money and probably have identified things like ransomware and the hacking of exchanges being low-hanging fruits and so that's what they've targeted I think that probably also has implications for sanctions yoyo yes it does but I often sort of sort of temper people's expectations with the idea of major right at least I I think this the scope and scale is important to note because you know North Korea has a very robust sanctions evasion operation you know and it involves using we're actually using the banking system using Chiney you know partying with certain Chinese banks that allow it to operate shipping like so in so many other very real-world ways front companies right to launder funds and also to evade sanctions and like with many things with crypto this is an experimentation period so I think the implications are ok hmm so North Korea is stealing crypto they're doing ransomware they're they're stocking up probably so that does mean that there's going to be that they're going to use it right that's a way for them to gain capital but it doesn't compare to the the scope of what they're doing elsewhere I think it just it does mean that we have to you know those that are concerned about proliferation and what North Korea is doing you have to be mindful that it is trying to learn it is trying to to to get involved in this technology and so that the implications may be stronger in the horizon but you know but limited now I think one other interesting thing there is there are some indications that the people who perpetrated these attacks weren't necessarily in North Korea and that perhaps these attacks have been outsourced to hacker groups and I think that's a trend we're starting to see in which which has been enabled by crypto currencies this idea as cyber crime as a service so previously we would have had the people who are willing to make commits the criminal activity and the people who have the technical aptitude to actually do it and with cryptocurrencies and dot that marketplaces we now have the ability well there's no potential for these people to come together and pay each other to do part of the job for them so for examples you can buy ransom markets on dart marketplaces or you can Commission somebody to build some custom ransomware for you and that's being enabled through these semi-autonomous crypto currency payments oh well and when you see kit it's like a software program is that what you mean exactly yes you can specify for example what bitcoin address the the victims phone should be Center huh I would imagine that that kind of cybercrime as a service would be especially important for a country like North Korea they're essentially imprisoning all the citizens you know like blocking them off from the outside world not letting them travel outside the country brainwashing them like all those things because if any of their citizens were trained in how to obtain cryptocurrencies on their own then they couldn't very easily be like oh this is like my way out of the country I can raise enough money to pay my way out to South Korea or whatever it might be so I could see them hiring that out out of curiosity though so let's say that I am a North Korean or I'm North Korea and I've hacked people for or perform ransomware to obtain Bitcoin then maybe I convert that to Manero to kind of launder the money and then convert it back to Bitcoin in some fashion how do i cash out you know is it just a matter of finding an exchange that doesn't do kyc or what yeah you you probably have so because they are you you really just need to plug into the money-laundering apparatus that they already have so they already have individuals companies that serve as fronts in the shipping industry one of the things that that you know North Korea uses or one of the things that they do is you know they will get luxury goods so you know while the the country though the regular people are starving you know that the regime has luxury goods that it purchases and you know you could use you could you know easily find ways to you know integrate your funds within the regular banking system and make make those purchases so I mean using cutouts is what most illicit actors do so it cutouts being you know someone who's someone who is quote-unquote clean who is going to open up the bank account or open up the exchange account or run the business and that person because they don't have you know ostensibly any clay any connections to the illicit actor that person is your face that's your proxy but that happens in the money-laundering world in general and there's no reason why people can't do that in crypto and in fact they do and in fact say and most of the x-jet well that's all the exchanges in China have now been closed down but I understand there is a thriving peer-to-peer and network of cryptocurrency brokers there I would imagine it'd be fairly easy for North Korea to use one of those brokers in order to to get into cash Oh interesting so it's sort of like local bitcoins but in China right and probably I guess for a much bigger amounts of money so moving on from just bad state actors in general how much interest is there in state-sponsored cryptocurrencies I think that's I think there's a lot of interest I think there is a spectrum where some some states are saying you know let's say we don't want to do anything we don't want to do central bank crypto currencies or digital currencies but there's huge interest and in particular I think some of the countries that are becoming more cashless like some of the Scandinavian countries where there's not a lot of cash there's a lot of talk about you know or least there there there's discussion about using or creating central bank central bank sorry central bank digital currencies as sort of an all you know as something to just add on to the fiat world so there's actually even even the Fed has you know the Fed is looking at it you know there's several different folks in the Fed have talked about this I think most are skeptical about you know independent crypto currencies but it actually makes sense I mean the the argument of you know not Bitcoin but blockchain sort of resonates with with folks because there are a lot of risk I mean in central bank's it's their mission to sort of maintain the the monetary system they're not going to just open up and just latch on to a totally permissionless system but the idea of a permission system yes a lot of the advanced economies are or at least looking at it so I think I think it's fascinating I think you would have some massive implications so if everybody could effectively hold central bank money directly then we have to ask what is the point of traditional banks I wouldn't need to have an account on my local bank I could have a central bank digital currency wallets on my phone and so if that happens what is the process of credit creation who lends to businesses and individuals perhaps that is what authority is becoming more the case that peer-to-peer lending is taking of that role from banks so I think it's a fascinating topic I'm not sure what's gonna happen either yeah the one thing if I can add just to think about is a lot of times I think even governments you know think that this would be a way to go even let's say in Russia and China and trying to create their own digital currency they're thinking that hey this is a way to displace the you know Bitcoin and-and-and the regular crypto currencies but you have to think about if there is a central bank digital currency it also means you're gonna sort of have to build an infrastructure right where people are are using this this centralized crypto and I wonder if that would actually make demand for the regular cryptocurrency is the permissionless ones to to actually increase right if you sort of enable people to get used to this method of transacting of having you know wallets on their phone you're not going to be able to unless you're in a purely authoritarian country keep people from from using the regular crypto currencies so you may actually increase the competition you know depending on how you do it yeah and something else that I wonder is for you know I sort of feel like this competition would play out it would be like maybe bad state actors with cryptocurrencies people may not trust those cryptocurrencies and so in those markets you might see an increase in trust in these decentralized ones and then I just wonder how the competition would play out if you had cryptocurrencies that were state-sponsored that were maybe non bad state actors you know would would the decentralized one still went out anyway that is kind of an interesting question to me and then the other thing that actually I'd been thinking about recently was about how people in Venezuela and Zimbabwe and in Argentina and places like that have been driven the hyperinflation to turn to crypto currencies like Bitcoin and others and it just got me thinking that it sort of pushes adoption in these developing countries primarily and maybe in Argentina but but I think you know Venezuela and Zimbabwe whereas like in a place like the US or you know like Sweden or Norway or something where the money is good and you trust it and you don't feel any need that you would see sort of this reverse adoption where the technology takes off in a place where technology traditionally hasn't taken off first and then the citizens in those countries are sort of like one step behind which is kind of interesting people often point out to the adoption of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and in these environments where you know the the monetary system is sort of you know collapsed but I again I would sort of people's enthusiasm needs to be tempered because or curves because you know this is sort of a coping mechanism it's you know crypto people just need to keep in mind that crypto is not necessarily solving the problem you know the these countries are facing like economic crises and political crises that you know the even if you know the population you know needs some sort of help and crypto can help it you know it's not fixing you know that the crisis it's not solving the crisis so they're there you know none of this can be seen in isolation a couple last questions earlier in the spring effect said it was going to begin putting individual digital currency addresses on it's blocked persons list why is this significant and what could such a dice Ignatian mean for any coins that are associated with those addresses I mean I'll say you know something here in terms of it's really unclear what how this is gonna play out I mean I think this was a signal from from Treasury from you know Oh fact the office that deals with sanctions and designates people and entities that that they had to say that you know they're aware that there is a new method of transacting that may not it may not fall within the framework or people might have thought might not fall within the the sanctions framework and the signal was well no it does and we're not gonna be held back in terms of listing but yeah so if if Treasury does start designating I think I don't think it'll have it'll make a huge difference for let's say just the everyday person trading crypto but then I do think it does have implications for for institutions for exchanges because now you've the bar will be raised in terms of allowing what you allow and your sort of levels of compliance to ensure that no one on your platform is transacting one with a blocked address or an address which is transacting with an address there's going to be more scrutiny there so I think it could have implications to that maybe is also the fungibility of tokens that's something that people have talked about but it really depends on on how this is gonna play out because I'm not sure that Treasury you know designating an address is going to stop that actor from from operating in crypto yes so we will be adding these sanctions cryptocurrency addresses to our database and the implication of that is that different exchanges using our AML software and one of their users receives funds from the sanctioned address or try to send funds to one then that will be flagged up to them and so that you will be able to use that software to avoid transacting with mid-section medicines so in addition to lost coins we will see coins that are just sort of locked in these blocked addresses that stopped being circulated so y-you advocated for a self policing AML platform to prevent the tainting of coins associated with the Ofek list how would such a platform work you know this is where you know I put this suggestion out as a way to sort of provoke discussion as to how it should work because you know at the end of the day my sense is that folks in crypto are sort of waiting for you know for someone else for the government for some other sort of regulatory entity to you know to sort of be the the policeman right or the the police officer what I'm trying to point out is that in other realms like let's say in the cyber realm you actually have a vibrant community of folks that try to that use their cyber skills to you know to try to find fine hackers and find vulnerabilities right you have the white hat white hat black hat thing and I think there should be something similar encrypted I think that in order because because this technology allows for such transparency it just seems that there should be cooperation amongst folks that love the technology that are building the technology to try to ensure that there that there are you know that there are flags on on on illicit activity yeah go ahead go ahead so your lipstick is kind of starting to become that intermediary so our customers be the exchanges law enforcement agencies regulators are starting to feed to us addresses that they know through their own research or associated with criminal activity and then we will put all those addresses together in our system so everybody has access to that that's information we also work with a number of threat intelligence companies to get the that same kind of data so the the private sector is I think stepping into that role at the moment great well this has been such a fascinating discussion thank you both so much where can people
