railway app at railway.xyz today's guest is Congressman and House Majority Whip Tom emmer welcome representative emmer good to see you Laura great to be with you you said on the bank list podcast recently that you believe the government is trying to enact an operation chokepoint 2.0 to cut crypto off from the banking system what do you as a congress person plan to do about it well we we've got to continue to raise awareness Laura if you look literally we had people telling us that they've been running into problems uh trying to bank crypto this has been an ongoing problem especially under this Administration but let's not kid ourselves it's been there for a while but it really was ramped up and then you had the uh the three largest crypto banks in the country uh Silver Gate Silicon Valley and signature all for lack of a better term go down within a short period of time a silvergate first and then Silicon Valley in signature right after that look nobody lost anything in silvergate but uh the Silver Gate owners decided to Simply unwind and give everything a a return all deposits to their customers why is that Laura well because they decided it was better to do that than to be fighting with Regulators over the next several years and incurring all the legal costs uh that the uh that the government is going to uh require if you're going to take on the government again that's Tom Emmer's interpretation you'd have to ask them but it seemed interesting that uh that certain senator from Massachusetts seemed to be dancing on the grave of uh silvergate even though there were no losses you're talking about Elizabeth Warren I might be they uh I usually say the senator who shall not be named from Massachusetts but yes I think uh the owner of Twitter refers to or something else too but the uh when you go to Silicon Valley clearly there was a mismanagement issue but there also was an oversight issue again it is a large Tech startup uh banking firm signature I I believe 30 percent of the uh assets its signature were crypto assets I think back to the initial press Laura that came out and this is your business so you can correct me if I miss it but with signature the first thing we heard over the weekend when they were declaring it insolvent our government was was former chair of the financial services Committee in the house Barney Frank uh co-author of Dodd-Frank by the way uh he is was is I don't know what his status is today but on the board it's signature and I believe uh Barney Frank said something to the effect when this was first happening I don't know how my government declares a solvent Bank insolvent uh shortly after that uh it's uh some type of rumor or press statement that crypto was one of the problems with this bank because it was uh 30 of the deposits Laura within 24 to 48 hours I believe the head of the New York financial department came out and acknowledged that that those Holdings were not they didn't have anything to do with the uh the alleged failing of Signature Bank because they weren't leveraged they weren't using them as part of their loan portfolio Etc and then we hear we hear that uh some reporters are told that anyone who buys signature any uh bank that wants to buy signature has to agree not to bank crypto long story uh there are other uh uh warning signs along the way but uh when we got to that one it was really interesting that the FDIC was apparently telling prospective buyers at signature that if you're going to buy the bank you have to agree that you will not deal in crypto uh really interesting too they have Signet I believe it's called the the technology it's a 24 7 real-time closing of payments kind of funny that I asked the head of the FDIC last week uh Gruenberg uh what you've done with Signet and he said that oh I believe we sold it uh guess what Laura they hadn't sold it he either was ignorant or he was not telling me the truth on purpose and I just wonder you got fed now that our federal government has uh announced they're going to be rolling out sometime this summer as a 24 7 uh you know real-time payment system I don't know I we gotta wait and see what these people are doing but I do believe there's been a uh a real attempt you can call it choke point 2.0 whatever you want by our federal government to close out uh crypto uh at least uh recently in our country I was curious because you you know have a very deep knowledge especially from the crypto perspective about the industry and about these kinds of issues and I was curious when you look at other members of Congress your colleagues what are the general perceptions that they tend to have about crypto well it's uh it's changed obviously uh as you know I've been doing this now for a little bit more than seven years when I started with for instance the blockchain caucus which was a new thing it was a two of its original Founders were Jared pullis the current governor of Colorado Democrat from Colorado and Mick Mulvaney a republican from South Carolina who worked in the Trump Administration back then Laura there were probably four or five people that I would see the same ones when I'd go to those meetings in addition to those two you'd see someone like David Schweikert uh today completely changed and maybe there's one more intervening uh example I can give you Republicans were in the majority so this has got to be about five years ago there was a hearing in the financial services committee which then was chaired by Republican Jeb hanseling out of Texas and I was amazed back then to listen to Republicans and Democrats sound almost exactly the same back then they were talking about crypto uh in the context of Silk Road and this is where all the drug dealers hang out this is where all the nefarious individuals are clearly they hadn't gotten up to speed with what was going on and I would say since August of 2022 when the infrastructure bill was moving through the Senate of the U.S Senate and they put a tax provision in which would apply to digital assets I was 2021. ah thank you you know when you get to my energy tender you know but it was you're right August of 2021 and uh because I'm going back to the election year which isn't right in 2021 that infrastructure Bill really um what put the Jets on people's uh interest in getting up to speed and I I would say that now I especially in the house I've got a whole bunch of Republicans on uh on the committee that you know they've got their skepticism but they're very open to understanding what the digital asset space is all about what crypto is all about how it works why it's important what are the pros what are the cons and it's not just Republicans you look over on the other side of our committee uh you get past the former chair the ranking member who seems to want to have nothing to do with this uh and you've got some very thoughtful Democrats uh who are exploring the same things with uh digital assets in the crypto community so I think there's been a a huge growth in the knowledge base within especially the house I've seen it over on the Senate side too you know with uh lummus and Jill and brand and you know Booker and uh you know give Ted Cruz some credit because boy that guy's worked hard to get up to speed and crypto is a big deal mining is a big deal in Texas so I do think we're moving in the right direction but unfortunately we've got a uh we've got a federal government right now Laura that I I literally believe they have weaponized Market chaos to kill crypto it's exactly why I sent the investigative letter to FDIC chairman grunberg requesting more information and I asked him again last week if he could please respond to my letter you've said that crypto is non-partisan and yet at the moment it feels like it's becoming more partisan you just did name a number of Democrats that are pro-crypto and I would add rokana and Richie Torres to that list however it seems like the louder Democratic voices on crypto for instance those of um for instance Senator Elizabeth Warren or even Sherrod Brown Warren has tweeted that she's building an anti-crypto army Sharon Brown did at least at one point float the idea of a crypto ban and I wondered what you thought you could do to prevent crypto from coming apart as an issue you know I don't think it is yet I mean I think you're you're talking about a couple of uh Central Banking loving you know and uh Elizabeth Warren she may not love central banks uh but she does love the design I believe she ultimately wants Banks to be a utility a government utility and not privately owned but that part aside she desperately wants to hold on to the centralization the control that comes with Central Banking and while I'm not opposed to Central Banking I think it does serve an important function and we're always going to have the traditional in my mind two-tier banking system that we've become accustomed to it's going to have to evolve into the 21st century and uh when you talk about digital assets and crypto they can't stop it if China can't stop it you know when they outlawed all mining which they haven't been able to completely accomplish uh what do you think a uh the the country that's still practices freedom is going to do this is not a republican Democrat thing this is literally uh control freak Senators who do not want to lose their power over this it's her people that occupy the White House primarily and her people that sit in these uh these different cabinet positions I mean let's just talk about Gary Gensler at the SEC he's a Warren disciple this guy in my mind is a bad faith regulator he's been blindly spraying the crypto Community with enforcement actions uh while completely missing the true Bad actors and uh you know people ask what what are we doing we're gonna we're gonna continue to raise the uh the siren of hypocrisy to show how hypocritical uh their behavior is we're going to rely on some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle uh you mentioned rokana you uh you left out Soto who I do work with Richie Torres there are a whole bunch of uh non-partisan I mean they definitely have their political perspective Laura but it's not a partisan issue for them and that is alive and well those of us that are interested in seeing this uh digital asset crypto Community uh if I can talk that broadly continue to grow in this country will continue to push against what these guys are doing I believe they're just trying to protect their control over this entire system and the idea that they want to push forward a uh a central bank digital currency uh that exposes them further Laura because a cbdc is nothing more than a potential surveillance tool for a uh large oversized central government run by a few in a moment we're going to talk about other regulatory actions in the crypto space and the geopolitical implications of what's happening but first a quick word from the sponsors who make the show possible ever wanted to use D5 without being tracked railgun is the leading D5 privacy Solution on ethereum it's available on BSC arbitrum

app at railway.xyz to find out more back to my conversation with representative emmer so you just brought up Gary Gensler and he has said that ether and other cryptos besides Bitcoin or Securities and as I'm sure you know the cftc set in its lawsuit against finance that ether and a few of the other cryptos are Commodities what can you do in Congress to create clarity about this well I mean we can start moving some legislation through the house Financial Services committee which I think Patrick McHenry is committed to do but it's interesting we don't argue that enforcement is a bad thing as you probably are aware Laura enforcement when it's appropriate is actually a good thing and the cftc's recent enforcement action that you refer to against binance seems to uh on its face look like an appropriate use of the enforcement authority of that agency as you know within the last week cftc sued binance for knowingly offering registered crypto derivatives products in the U.S to U.S customers despite not being registered to do so and saying publicly that registered Americans from using the platform so the enforcement action alleges that binance did some shady things to conceal their customers locations uh with vpns uh in the like uh this is different from what Gary Gensler has been doing over at the SEC where he's uh he says he's got an Open Door Laura but a company like coinbase right which I accessed that open door and started working with Gary gensler's SEC by the way coinbase I would argue is one of the most regulatory compliant crypto companies out there well guess what uh Gary Gensler might have an open door but it is an enter at your own risk door because what he does is despite several meetings over several months Gary gensler's SEC refused to provide feedback on a product it was called the earned product that coinbase was uh looking to list and instead after all these meetings and nothing happening the SEC slapped coinbase with a Wells notice regarding the very issues on which coinbase was asking for their feedback clearly not the way uh the government should be uh serving Americans and it it sends a clear message I believe to the broader crypto community and that directly is Gary Gensler is not regulating in good faith so you got the cftc example but then you've got this ongoing uh stuff with the SEC which is not good for uh for uh Innovation and uh entrepreneurial activity right here in the U.S as the U.S appears to becoming less friendly to crypto and even driving the industry offshore we are on the other hand seeing that China is going full steam ahead on a number of blockchain projects as well as its digital Yuan and China and Russia recently agreed to use the Chinese Yuan for settlements between Russia and the countries of Asia Africa and Latin America so when you take those facts into account with what seems to be happening now in the US around crypto where do you think this could end up in terms of the effects on the US's economic power globally all right look we're under attack right now I mean you uh you probably have seen the rupee uh you know there are offers by other nations to replace the dollar with their currency because of uh the potential problems that they're alleging with our banking system uh and obviously some challenges that we are creating uh with our inability to govern ourselves at the federal level going back because it's uh it's interesting I'm not so worried about the digital Yuan uh Russia can do that at their risk the Chinese you do not want to deal with a uh kind of like when they held when they were hosting the Olympics they were going to give every Olympian some digital UI and that's like telling them that uh here's this great new technology called Tick Tock don't mind us we're just gonna uh Harvest all of your data and we're going to track you on our uh our stuff doesn't end well uh typically for us it's disturbing because I you know you didn't ask directly about it but uh the Biden administration's recent economic report I if you took a look at that they talk about well we know crypto technology is in its infancy and uh the White House in this report concluded that uh crypto has no real value uh to uh our society well they they conclude that crypto doesn't offer any value to our society but then they turn around and say that fed now their real-time payments settlement uh system and Central Bank digital currencies will I look Laura uh crypto will Thrive with or without the United States it's unfortunate to see this Administration and unelected bureaucrats try so hard to polarize a technology and pursue regulatory actions that are only going to limit the U.S Economic Development and opportunities for Americans which goes directly to your question that does not put us in the lead it puts us in the back of the line and do you feel like your colleagues agree with that or or like I I just from what's Happening and it seems like they're trying to push crypto offshore it feels like they don't recognize that uh some I mean I think you got three different kinds uh and uh you've got members that I've described Republicans Democrats uh take away the partisan Jersey they understand how important this is right uh it's funny I had someone high up in our government tell us tell me last week uh which you might have heard me talking about in a different interview that crypto is wampum and I said really well describe describe that to me and he went through describing how it's uh not real and uh and then got to the end and said well you know gold well you can make the argument and then he stopped he said look we've had gold for a long time and everybody accepts that you got to break out of the way you've looked at Finance in the past we are moving into a completely different era of Finance uh the old as I've talked about in some fashion we will always have intermediaries in my belief you will always have some form of the two-tier traditional banking system that we've become accustomed to because there will be value that you want to derive from that somebody to watch over the transaction to verify the transaction but the future is you and myself Laura doing business directly with one another we don't need the central Authority because we have a blockchain that is open permissionless and transparent everyone can see what's happening on it uh self-policing uh this is where we're headed and it should happen in the United States there is a group that believes this there's another group that uh I just think they're still skeptical I had somebody tell me that the problem with crypto is it's the wild wild west of finance and as I'm talking to him trying to explain them you know the regulations all apply yes there are some updating things that some of us have proposed but you uh you have the regulations in place uh and it's not the Wild Wild West and then there's a third group to answer your question the third group uh unfortunately is very partisan uh and I mean we've had the problem on the Republican side but we don't have the white house right now when we did have the White House we had people in the White House that were adamantly opposed there were people in the White House that were actually trying to help us move this forward now we've got a new Administration uh and they have their soldiers uh in the uh in the house in the Senate uh that they're willing to uh take whatever marching orders the White House gives them without regard for what is in the best interest in my humble opinion and just march with those orders I prefer to work with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and Republicans who have an open mind and understand that this is uh not only going to happen with or without us but we want this to happen right here on the shores of the United States uh where uh Americans can derive the benefits that would be associated with it last quick question fed now the upcoming Federal Reserve payment system is going to launch this summer you've been quite critical of it why what would you prefer to see let this let the private sector do this stuff uh this is our government once again trying to compete with the private sector this is our government once again I believe controlling the all Finance you know you control the money and you control the water and you control the people right this is literally what defines our freedom is our ability our financial system in this country our ability to be able to uh create an idea and then go out and solicit startup capital I by the way I don't need my government's permission or I should not need my government's permission or oversight to go out and seek that uh that's the definition of freedom in this country that's how we create uh tomorrow's uh small business that turns into I'm sorry today's small business that turns into tomorrow's uh big business in this country that's why we have been so successful and literally uh whether it's fed now which I you know I've never seen the federal government uh do anything uh as advanced in technology is the private sector but uh fednow and cbdc's are nothing more to me than the government trying to consolidate its authority over the financial system and quite frankly that means over the individuals that access that system and I would like to see it be decentralized I think that's the whole purpose is to put people back in charge of their own decisions uh with out regard to what their government May uh may want them to do or not do give us back our freedom all right well it has been such a pleasure having you on the show thank you so much for coming on Unchained it's always good to be with you Laura thank you don't forget next up is the

team tried but failed to pass a controversial proposal arbitrum Improvement proposal or aip1 aimed to allocate 750 million ARB tokens valued at around 1 billion dollars to the arbitrim foundation for funding special grants without undergoing a full on-chain governance process however over 78 of token holders voted against the proposal then arbitrum employee Patrick McCory revealed that the proposal served as a formality to inform the community of decisions that had already been implemented unchain data shows that the arbitrim foundation had already used 50.5 million of the proposed 750 million ARB tokens the foundation clarified that 10 million ARB tokens was converted to Fiat while 40 million was loaned to a sophisticated actor in the space which appears to be wintermute according to look on chain after facing significant Community backlash the team decided to break down this contentious first proposal into separate ones in a new announcement on Wednesday the Arboretum Foundation said it would keep the remaining 700 million ARP tokens in its wallet until the decentralized autonomous organization or Dell approves a budget and lock-up schedule the arbitrum debacle was discussed at length in this week's episode of The Chopping Block haseeb Qureshi host of The Chopping Block and managing partner at dragonfly suggested that this event will forever change the governance in arbitrim he said it's a precedent that tends not to go away crypto influencer Kobe's Tweed kickstarts 50 million dollars in liquidations an encrypted message containing the text Interpol read notice for CZ sparked a frenzy on social media on Monday leading to more than 50 million dollars in Bitcoin liquidations the message it was first shared by crypto Twitter influencer Jordan fish AKA Kobe and was encrypted using the shaw 256 cryptographic hash function though it is theoretically impossible to decrypt the hash function in a few hours the meaning behind the message was revealed igniting rumors of an International arrest warrant for binance CEO Chiang Pang Xiao or CZ bitcoin's values subsequently dropped to an intraday low of 27 414 and over 50 million dollars in Bitcoin liquidations occurred binance dismissed the rumor as false and Kobe later addressed the situation stating that someone with whom he had discussed the rumor likely leaked the hidden message causing the chaos Kobe apologized for the incident and plans to reduce his tweeting in the future despite facing a lawsuit from the U.S commodity Futures Trading commission on-chain data reveals no sign of

standing moreover coindesk reported that Finance declined an offer from Tron founder Justin sun to purchase his stake in competitor wobi due to its alleged links to China which binance wants to distance itself from According to an anonymous source three AC Founders LED exchange openx goes live the founders of bankrupt crypto hedge fund three arrows capital or 3ac Kyle Davies and suju

launch Mev blocker a tool designed to prevent maximal extractable value or Mev Bots from front running transactions developed by cow swap agnostic relay and beaver build the initiative is supported by several popular ethereum-based protocols such as nosy style balancer shapeshift and paraswap Mev blocker routes transactions through a network of Searchers structured to block front running and sandwich attacks users will receive 90 of the profits that Searchers bid to background transactions while validators will receive 10 of the profits MEP Bots have reportedly extracted more than 1.38 billion dollars from users impacting Traders liquidity providers and nft mentors alike by adding the customer remote call procedure or RPC endpoint to crypto wallets users can Shield their transactions from Mev Bots however according to nosa's CEO Martin koppelman transactions may take 10 longer than usual with this RPC this initiative comes after a recent incident in which an ethereum validator successfully front ran Mev sandwich Bots making off with 25 million dollars in a single block the validator exploited a relayer bug to force a series of transactions outpacing the Mev Bots

largest defy hack of 2023 returned all the 200 million dollars in crypto stolen from Euler Finance Euler's team confirmed the recovery of the funds taken during the March 13th exploit initially the hacker seemed unrepentant but eventually had a change of heart and began returning small batches of the stolen funds through encrypted blockchain messages the Hacker's tone turned apologetic last week when they returned 7000 East to Euler with an attached message expressing Marquette identifying themselves as Jacob the hacker wrote I didn't want to but I messed with others money others jobs others

Department issues a report on defy the US Treasury Department has turned his attention to the decentralized finance or defy sector releasing its first ever report on illicit Finance risks associated with the industry the 42-page document highlights that D5 services are being exploited by various Bad actors including cyber criminals ransomware attackers and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to launder and transfer illicit funds although defy services are subject to the bank's secrecy act many are not complying with anti-money laundering and combating terrorist financing the report says however the report also acknowledges that when compared to government-issued or fiat currency transactions illicit activities in defy and crypto remain relatively small in volume and value by

Bitcoin Maxi working at Apple what would you pay for crypto bankruptcy claims Jenny Hogan of Unchained has her take on the launch of open exchange and as they always say if at first you don't succeed be a rich dude in crypto suzu and Kyle Davies the founders of the bankrupt crypto hedge fund 3ac are back they're launching an exchange for insolvent crypto claims which feels a little bit like giving people paper cuts and then charging for overpriced Band-Aids one of the premises of their company open exchange is to offer claimants for bankrupt funds like FTX and Celsius the chance to be made whole given that FTS claims right now are trading at 20 cents on the dollar it's possible that their definition of whole is the same as SBS Adventure successfully raised 25 million dollars from investors which does make me wonder if the vibe in VC right now is like what's there to lose CEO Leslie lamb has said that the goal of the new fund is to help the crypto industry and let me just say we love a pivot 3ac case is not settled and U.S authorities have actually issued a subpoena to Kyle Davies via Twitter you know that Twitter could be used to issue subpoenas you didn't but to me it's no crazier than the idea that FTS claimants could be made whole thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about representative emmer and the current state of crypto regulation in the US check
