hi everyone welcome to unconfirmed the show that reveals how the marquee names and crypto are reacting to the week's top headlines and gets the inside skip on what they see on the horizon i'm your host laura shin a journalist with over two decades of experience i started covering cryptos six years ago and as a senior editor at forbes was the first mainstream media reporter to cover cryptocurrency full-time this is the june 18th episode of unconfirmed the crypto.com app pays you up to 8.5 interest on your bitcoin get 25 when you download the krypto.com app with code laura the

climate-neutral blockchain protocol learn more at n-e-a-r dot o-r-g tasos smart money that's redefining what it means to hold and exchange value in a digitally connected world discover how people are re-imagining the world around you on tezos today's guest is jane t kanani co-founder and ceo of polygon welcome jane t uh thank you laura for having me polygon has had quite a few months especially considering that the overall market has kind of been in a bit of the doldrums so can you tell me from your perspective the story of how polygon has taken off these last few months uh definitely um so we have been working on polygons since 2017 and launched our maintenance in last year may and since then we are we are working with apps to onboard them on polygon uh and we had like no 100 200 applications at the time uh before three months ago and then uh the nft uh boom came right and d5 d5 was there d5 boom was there and everyone was trying to send a transaction ethereum right and at the time like ethereum gas fees went like 100k or something like and people were spending a lot of usd uh a lot of heat on on ethereum as a case fees and at the same time you know our way uh deployed on polygon right and we created a pool uh incentives pool for the for the our liquidity right and it bring it it brought a huge liquidity to the polygon uh at the same time a sushi swap car when multiple other t5 came and started doing the same and it kind of blew the the whole d5 uh boom on polygon from from ethereum and it it just got crazy and crazy currently we we ah we have like 500 plus uh applications uh d5 nfts every every every kind of you know different applications and in the latest a few few days ago like it crashed happened right and the medic was only the token who was like sustaining its value uh we we were seeing like no huge uh investor uh interest in polygon right uh institution investors retailers and and what we did is kind of uh creating the path for layer two right uh if you see layer 2 ecosystem like there was no other layer 2 solutions ready for the production as we are and that's what happened in the last few days and i would say weeks that polygon paved the path for the layer 2 and so that you know uh on ethereum you can scale right away right you don't have to wait for any other applications you can just go and deploy your application on polygon and you could scale right now and that's i think uh was a major part of the success of polygon yeah so as i'm sure most of our listeners are aware there are multiple ways to scale and a lot of layer two scaling solutions on ethereum are taking one specific approach how has polygon decided to scale yeah so we started with plasma um so in 2007 end of like late 2017 i was doing research on scalability and plasma specifically and then we started with the plasma but in plasma we we didn't want to do utxo based plasma so what we did is uh account based plasma which is similar to ethereum right and for that we took the evm approach right what what we thought like let's take the evm and change it to make the plasma compatible and by doing that what happens is that any developer can just move their applications from ethereum chain to plasma polygon chain in few minutes right uh but you know what uh in plasma currently we are supporting only transfers uh not any arbitrary uh state transfer state changes and if you want to support any arbitrary state transfers state changes you need to create the predicates contract on the ethereum chain um so we thought you know it's very hard for developers to create each kind of specific predicates for each for for the use cases so what we did is created a proof of stake bridge from ethereum chain to polygon chain right and polygon chain is before before the proof of stake bridge uh it has 100 validators right a polygon chain has 100 validators it runs in kind of you know simple parallel evm chain but faster to ethereum and with polygon uh with prophostic bridge uh you can have any kind of state uh state changes on the on the polygon it's just the same as the evmj right so let's say if you have a bunch of quantitative um away contracts on the ethereum and you just want to if you want to migrate to polygon you can just take those bunch of contracts away contracts and deploy on there on the polygon and that's it you are done like you don't have to change anything at all right you can you can move your tokens you can move your state changes any kind of arbitrary state data right you can move that from ethereum chain to polygon chain using the bridge generalized bridge and you can also move back uh using the checkpoint mechanism so checkpoint is nothing but a hash of blocks of the polygon and we do that we push this checkpoints on the ethereum chain uh so you can prove we prove that you know your transaction is there on the polygon in this block at this index you can do that and with that you can prove any kind of receipt any kind of logs and exceed those you can prove that state data and it retrieves the straight down the ethereum chain and that's how the withdrawal works right so the whole thing is kind of now we started with plasma we added the proof of stake bridge a simple bridge now what we are trying to do is having a expanding our ecosystem and with that we are also going to support our roll-ups zika roll-ups and multiple app specific chains the the the approach is that we don't not going to just take the simple roll up approach we have that we we want to focus on the usability and for the for the app developers right and with that we think that pushing all the data on the ethereum chain for the roll-ups is not sustainable at all and that's why we are also creating our data already chained in-house and the data ability chain basically helps tap developers to reduce the cost for the roll-up so when let's say we if we if you if you want to use the roll-up arbitral up with a with with a with a polygon dl layer you can do that so it's kind of a mix and match approach we are taking in a more kind of you know generalized approach where tap developers can use the uh we use the whole layer to very securely plus they don't have to worry about the cost of the pushing the data on the ethereum chain so that's what we are going to do in the next few months yeah wow yeah just listening to that it's very easy to understand how so much activity has shifted very quickly and why uh and i was curious how are you seeing users on polygon differing from those who have stayed on ethereum if there is any difference um user face is is similar 100 similar it's just kind of now you have to add the url on the meta master if you want to use my tamas but if you are using the wallet link or other kind of mobile wallet wallet connect right you don't have to worry about it it's just works seamlessly uh as you are working on the ethereum but faster right and your cost is pretty cheaper okay i do think i did see that there was some data showing that some of the users on polygon or that a greater number of them were transacting in smaller amounts and that whales were um sticking around on ethereum but then i did also see more news saying that whales also um seem to be moving over and what types of projects do you see typically taking off on polygon and i just noticed you know there's it seems like there's quite a lot of gaming and nft apps on polygon and obviously you know d5 is also popular but i was surprised about the number of gaming at nft apps yeah i mean as i say you know we have 500 plus applications right now and uh most of them are like you know d5 and uh nfts in nfts i i think my popularity is one is a z drum right so saturn is quite popular at the time and uh people were using the buying the horses and horse and they're putting the horses into races and with uh with the arrests right oh yeah yeah yeah just for people who don't know that's i mean you said it but it's where people can bet on these um digital horses yeah yeah these two houses and in the d5 side we have away right away is biggest uh d5 right now on the the polygon and it it has seven billion plus uh usd worth of tokens locked in our way for our market on polygon uh with that we have quick swap association both both have a one million plus uh liquidity right we have curve uh and multiple others uh no other d files also coming uh deploying as we speak on the polygon so i think i think we we pretty much covered the all what popular ethereum applications as you speak so yeah all right so in a moment we'll discuss what's next for polygon but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible did you know nearly 338 million dollars worth of nfts were sent last year and in 2021 that number is growing faster than ever if you're looking to make your first nft check out near's fast scalable low-cost open source platform nir is investing 80 million near

thing that a lot of d5 protocols were discussing kind of i don't know maybe a year or several months ago was about the composability issue in d5 and how going to layer two could break that and some some different projects have just gone with one layer two solution or another and i wondered do you feel that polygon addresses that issue and if so how i think uh compositivity was an issue uh when people people were talking about the app specific uh roll-ups or app specific side chain or you know um chain like simple chain uh like cosmos like cosmo has a like ipc they just launched ipc but still uh like no it's not that popular as as we um as we see or we predict right in compulsivity like of course like device d5 needs compositivity right if you think about the curved protocol simple as curve right uh it needs like two you know multiple t5 protocols to to work uh our way needs research and changing oracle right uh the other other other defy application needs other d5 applications to work on right so in general like of course d5 needs composition if you break down the applications into the multiple chains it also brings a problem of liquidity fragmentation right so those two problems are go hand in hand like compositing liquidity but what we are trying to see on the on the specific two polygon proposition we have one chain right we don't have a application specific chain so you just deploy um as you're deploying on ethereum it's like you can say okay this is the sister chain of ethereum right uh polygon is association of ethereum you can deploy uh you can use the liquidity the same way you you do on ethereum in the roll-up and secondhand you know apparently arbitrarium and optimism are there but they are coming and there will be a same as as a pro of stake chains like we have uh there will be multiple applications in the same chain so there will there won't be any composibility issue but i'm i will see some liquidity fragmentation between the polygon chain and the rp term chain and the optimism generate if you deploy different kind of applications uh same applications on the different platforms and that's that's exactly what we are experiencing right now right uh what happens is let's say if you have a liquidity on the binance chain and uh if you want to if people want to move the liquidity from ethereum chain or from binary chain to polygon chain it's very tricky right and i'm i'm i'll i feel that it will be a same problem when we have a multiple role of multiple chains in the in the future even the composition compositivity is kind of not the liquidity is part of the composition assume because it's uh just a same thing part of this part of the composition so what we are trying to solve on the in the polygon is to how to do the the state call between the chain using the uh at the protocol level uh when i say protocol level it means that uh similar to ipc right ipc is kind of works underneath of cosmos sdk or tendermint level light you don't need a application level uh changes to do the transfer or composibility for to to achieve the composition you need to make it at a protocol level that way you don't break the composition you don't break the liquidity as well you can always move your liquidity from here to there very easily without uh creating the synthetics on the different chains but i think it's it's very tricky in general because you have to change or maybe fork your chain or it's very hard to change because if you are let's say application level transfer state transfer or uh token transport is very easy but if you go on the protocol level on the on the on the lower level it's hard to change and uh i think it can be tricky to implement but i think we need to do we have to do that otherwise it will be a problem when we have our roll ups and multiple roll ups and multiple chains yeah yeah i'm hoping that makes sense well yeah i think we're going to have to see how this all plays out i mean i think it is a tricky issue um and kind of a a big vision that you have there so speaking of polygon has gotten a lot of investment recently you know in and around it um au 21 announced a 21 million ecosystem fund billionaire mark cuban announced that he had invested although he didn't close disclose the amount and un0x announced you you two together will send 10.5 million to bring more users to polygon so what do you plan to do with this money and and what are your strategies for bringing more users to polygon yeah i mean we have a different agenda for different kind of funds so uh for for zero x and for the for zero x tau fund we are specifically looking to uh bring more applications for the on on the exchanges side right and the defy side and with 35 we we are hoping to spend with money on the supporting multiple startups multiple crypto projects uh which are just starting out and bring bring them on on polygon with au 21 capital it's it's generic general uh fund for the specific focus on the polygon right and uh with that uh i think they are they are planning to deploy those funds in multiple projects to uh on polygon it can be defined bnfts it can be any any other other projects we also just announced polygon http so we are also focusing uh crypto projects who are using the polygon sdk right and building their own uh crypto projects so we are also going to fund uh the projects uh using using this fund and on the mark cuban side uh of course like you know it's a strategy strategy strategic investment from him because he was a very much a user of polygon he was using multiple applications so it was great to be on on board and he is a good at technology right uh so we were talking to mark cuban um and he was he was very keen like understanding the roll ups and secret loves and everything so we were surprised to see his uh uh ideas around around the tech so i think having him on board is a good addition to uh polygon ecosystem in general right um yeah and and with that like we have multiple other fund also coming up uh focused on polygon and with that what happened we want to do we want to expand our polygon ecosystem with role of secure all of uh uh polygon sdk current improper shape chain uh and we want to you know bring more um applications who are everyone reach to non-crypto users right currently we have a we have a people users who are using polygon but what we are going to do is like we we we're going to launch um nfts focused fund as well in the media future uh with that we we are going to target the specific two games like you know we have two games all right so those kind of different different agenda we have with the specific ones and you just uh see like how it paints out in the future yeah and yeah and just for listeners who may not know sdk stands for software developer kit right so yeah that's yeah to take out more people building a polygon and so what is the future for polygon once ethereum 2.0 shifts because obviously that will you know scale ethereum at the base layer so um at that point what would that mean for polygon yeah i mean what i'm i'm thinking is that kind of now let's say even if ethereum scales it won't reach like millions of transactions for but minutes or per second you know or per day i would say it will have obviously increase some capacity of the current chain uh but i think it will also allow our users layer 2 users to withdraw more space for the vitro and deposits right also what i think is that you know for example let's say for example two years back uh ethereum was making let's say thousands of transactions per day uh right currently it's making 1.5 million touches per day and a polygon is making 7 million transition per day right if you see financing it was making like 12 million per transaction per day before it would it it got proper right what i am saying is that if in the future let's say if if crypto market expands it will have a it it will need more uh transactions per day it will you know you need bigger and bigger uh more and more scalability so even if ethereum will come i'm 100 sure it will it will get jam in few days or a few weeks for sure so you know it's it's like it's like you uber right like when uber came you you were taking the uber and uh you you got the uber in a few seconds right now i know like in bangalore in india like if you ask for uber or ola it won't come because it's so much demand there because you know people traveled a lot more right because of the pandemic it got down but the supply came also demand also increased uh you know better higher than the supply so it's like it's the same uh situation will be in the future as i'm ahead of pressure will be like no uh helping ethereum 2.0 scale as well in the future yeah yeah that makes a lot of sense and is also um kind of funny frankly um anyway well it has been such a pleasure talking with you thank you so much for illuminating us on this um hot new layer two of ethereum and yeah thanks so much for coming on unconfirmed thank you don't forget next up is the weekly news recap stick around for this week in crypto after this short break with over 10

biggest upgrade to bitcoin in four years is locked in as lightning doubles last friday bitcoin's tap root upgrade the most significant protocol improvement in years officially locked in after passing the speedy trial parameters which required 90 of the blocks mined in a two-week window to signal support for the upgrade the full implementation of taproot however is still a ways off as the next step in the activation process is a five month waiting period this dead period is designed to give miners and nodes the opportunity to upgrade their software to contain the logic for the taproot soft fork when bitcoin reaches block number 7000 when bitcoin reaches block number 709632 which is estimated to happen in november taproot will activate allowing nodes to begin recognizing transactions made using taproot the integration of taproot will be the first major upgrade to bitcoin's code since 2017's segregated witness taproot hopes to improve bitcoin's privacy multi-sig wallets security and scaling on related note bitcoin's lightning network has continued to grow since april when it hit 10 000 operating nodes for the first time nearly doubling within a year though may and june were slow for the markets according to bitcoin visuals and 1ml over the past 30 days bitcoin's layer 2 solution has seen growth in three major statistics number one number of nodes grew by two 5.25 percent to number of channels increased by nine point two percent and three network capacity jumped by fifteen percent zoom out even further and the growth becomes even more substantial as of june 11 2020 there were only 5916 nodes with channels and the cumulative network capacity which is the amount of btc locked into lightning channels set at 936 bitcoin according to coin square's kevin rook part of the excitement about a around lightning network could stem from el salvador on twitter he pointed out that two of the most popular finance apps in el salvador are lightning-enabled bitcoin wallets he tweeted its lightning season lightning network capacity just broke 1500 btc networks knows channels and capacity are at all time highs next headline the crypto market may be down but private

dollars to just a sliver above zero dollars in less than 24 hours on wednesday titan is linked to the iron finance project which mints so-called stable coins by locking in a combination of 25 percent titan and 75 usdc coindesk reported that quote when new iron stable coins are minted the demand for titan increases driving up its price conversely when the price of titan falls dramatically as was the case on wednesday evening the peg becomes unstable in a post-mortem blog post iron finance described the event as quote the world's first large-scale crypto bank run as titan began free falling from 60 so did the pegged value of iron falling to under 70 cents as a bank run was initiated on titan creating as fred shebesta founder of finder.com.eu and an iron finance investor told coindesk quote a crypto vortex of money iron finance explains this explained to this vortex as a quote negative feedback loop and the worst thing that could happen to the protocol where panic selling led to more titan creation which drove titan prices down which caused more panic for context at one point iron finance had two billion dollars in value locked into the network that number has dropped to 238 million dollars as of press time titan and iron finance were available on polygon in binance smart chain mark cuban billionaire investor and avid d5 user recently admitted to being a liquidity

what a stablecoin is and what collateralization is acceptable preston burn partner at anderson kill tweeted back at him mark cuban this stuff is already regulated that coin is more likely than not in unregistered security you should have known it and you bought it anyway don't call for regulation just because your crypto investment team doesn't know what they're doing this one is on you speaking of regulation next we have a u.s regulatory roundup on tuesday congresswoman maxine waters announced a new working group for house democrats focused on crypto regulation the group's goal is to quote

curve and d5 project for stablecoin trading calls for enforcing its intellectual property rights in court hydroxam the author of the proposal believes that curves dow should protect sip on behalf of its stakeholders just as centralized exchanges would protect ip on behalf of a shareholder he writes quote centralized exchanges protect their ipn behalf of their shareholders and there is no reason why curve just by virtue of its dow organization should not protect itself for the benefit of vote escrow crv token holders written on wednesday the proposal takes aim at saddle finance a competing automated market maker which as of the as the proposal notes has been accused of wholesale copying of curve code for example back in january curve told crypto briefing that a quant stamp audit found saddle finance's implementation of its stable swap function to be quote exactly the same algorithm seen in curves codebase the proposal argues that curves governance forms should quote review any proposals from law firms make them public and put them up to a dow vote any proposed settlement should also be subject to a dow vote at the moment seventy percent of members of the governance forum agree with the proposal time for fun bits the thirteen-year-old dev created a protocol managing one million dollars meet gadget schneich a teenager and founder of polygage a d5 protocol housed on polygon managing around 1 million dollars in funds according to decrypt nike started coding at just eight years old and has learned five coding languages already including solidity ethereum's smart contract language arjun khalsi the vice president of polygon describes the project as quote a clone of goose finance with a few minor modifications borrowed from sushi swap khalsi praised nike as quote the kind of guy who can build the next facebook or the next whatsapp that being said this is still a d5 project built by a 13 year old that defy watches chris black warns allows a single
