oftentimes I feel like the crypto Community they get really um kind of up in arms because they all view something as being one way but then you you all get surprised when you find out oh The Regulators don't view it that way and you're like mad and blah blah and it's like this thing with Gary genser where you know when he first uh was selected to be SEC chair people are like oh he knows blockchain great for us and you guys he is a completely different opinion on how all this stuff should be regulated from you and it's not that he does not understand the technology he has taught courses at MIT about blockchain technology he gets it he just doesn't agree with you about what it is or how it should be regulated blah blah blah and so like you know here we are like you're talking about this report and you're sort of like saying like how can they do this how can they do that and I'm just I'm just gonna suggest again they might understand it and have just a completely different opinion
