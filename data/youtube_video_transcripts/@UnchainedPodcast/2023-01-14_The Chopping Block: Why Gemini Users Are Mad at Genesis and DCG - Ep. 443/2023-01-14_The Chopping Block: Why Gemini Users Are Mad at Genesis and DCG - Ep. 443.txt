not a dividend It's A Tale of Two fun now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet generally speaking airdrops are kind of pointless anyways um my name's trading firms who are very involved I like to have the ultimate D5 Protocols are the antidote to this problem hello everybody Welcome to The Chopping Block every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry insiders perspective on the crypto topics of the day so quick intros first we've got Tom the D5 Maven and master of memes next up we've got Robert crypto connoisseur and captain of compound and you've got tarun the Giga brain and Grand Puba at gauntlet and finally got myself I perceive the head hype man at dragonfly the four of us are early stage investors in crypto but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice legal advice or even life advice so we are back it's the New Year things are still happening a lot of the real big dramas of the last you know call it uh December November period are in the process of unwinding the biggest among them is the situation going on with our friends at dcg so uh for those of you who've been following along there's a there's a big spat between dcg Gemini and Genesis okay so Genesis if you recall giant lender they're going under or at least are very close to going under if they don't manage to renegotiate things with some of their with some of their creditors so now one of their biggest creditors or I think actually the biggest creditor is a product called Gemini earned Gemini earn is basically like a you know coinbase earn or Celsius type product where you you know retail users deposit capital and that Capital was being lent through Genesis to you know to generate a yield so the Gemini earned was frozen uh because of the fact that Genesis was frozen uh Genesis is no longer processing withdrawals and Gemini understandably is very upset about this as as are you know there are hundreds of thousands of customers so we've seen this big very public back and forth now between the Gemini leadership and dcg and their leadership is namely Barry silbert and so we saw this um uh you know sort of dueling public statements going back and forth Genesis and dcg basically claiming that hey we've been responsive we're trying to negotiate you know the best solution for all the creditors we're trying our best here a few days ago we saw the Gemini CEO uh Cameron come out and say uh hey we don't think that dcg we don't think they're acting Faithfully in good faith we think that they are screwing with us they're kind of dodging our calls they're not willing to actually negotiate and most notably in the most recent letters there was I think three rounds of back and forth in the most recent letter Cameron comes out and accuses dcg a fraud now specifically what he says is that when dcg when Genesis rather when Genesis tried to demonstrate to their counterparties that after the collapses of the summer and after the defaults of three arrows that they were still solvent and in a good financial position they claimed that their current assets were they basically claimed the promissory note that we discussed last time the 1.1 billion that that gcg assumed of genesis's liabilities from three arrows Capital uh that that was a current asset now a current asset in accounting terms means that this is something that I believe it's like it can be liquidated within a year is that is that correct I think that's that's usually what a clearance implies yeah so um so claiming that this promissory node which is supposed to be I think it's like 20 years at 1.1 percent interest in 10 years do I have the details right 10 years sorry it's a 10-year note that it pays 1.1 interest over those 10 years which is obviously very very low that this is a current asset so if you claiming that this is a current asset that means that you can sell it or you can get all the capital within a year um now on a previous show I had heard and I and I claimed on the show that uh this was that this note was callable which I think would have made sense if this was being treated as a current asset that okay well the reason why it's pronounced is that's callable supposedly so Cameron states in the letter that the note is not callable meaning that there's no way to accelerate this node and say hey give me all the money now because you know I'm in liquidation or I need the I needed to pay back my own creditors so if that's true it seems to imply that whatever Genesis did here is basically a misrepresentation to their counterparties about their financial situation and perhaps as a result of this we've seen uh the doj and the SEC open investigations into dcg and presumably what they're investigating is this relationship between dcg and Genesis and whether there were misrepresentations made to counterparties so you know running out of money or you know having to shut off withdrawals or having a bank run that's not illegal it's unfortunate but it's not illegal but if you misrepresent your financial situation to your counterparties that is super illegal that is fraud so we now have a very public accusation by Gemini against dcg slash Genesis about making your financial misrepresentation and we'll see now how this plays out Robert what's what's your view you're close to this you're you're one of the creditors of of Genesis what's your view on this whole situation well as a refresher as I've stated on multiple uh episodes of The Chopping Block I am a creditor to Genesis because they have a portion of my assets that are currently Frozen they will not return them to me and I am stuck with many other creditors hoping that this situation resolves itself so I may be biased in any of these takes uh as a result of that my personal perspective is that this one billion dollar 1.1 billion dollar note from dcg was them acting potentially in a good manner to absorb the liabilities of three hours Capital so you know Gemini makes a pretty bold claim like oh this node is the heart of a fraud and that could be the case right it could be the case that they were relying on this being a current asset when they were keeping their exchange users money in Genesis however this absorption of liabilities was in its own right a good act from dcg dcg literally said Genesis lost 1.1 billion dollars we're going to take that loss and they move that loss up the corporate hierarchy so I don't perceive in and of itself this note as a bad thing in reality was actually a good thing that dcg was willing and did assume the losses from three hours Capital so in in a sense to boil it all down dcg did Genesis and Genesis customers a favor by absorbing this loss so on his own it was a good thing it was a favor to the creditors of Genesis which includes me which includes Gemini which includes every other customer they dcg did Genesis a solid right now separate of that you know could this have been fraudulent could they have portrayed it incorrectly could they have done some pretty shady things in their messaging and their marketing yes absolutely they were presenting themselves to the market as a sound business a solvent business and a healthy business they communicated on Twitter and then email and like many times saying we are a s you know solvent Sound business we're operating business as usual you know nothing is the matter and it was nothing is the matter until you know FTX went under at which point they said withdrawals are Frozen no one's getting anything back we're sorry you know that's the reality of it you're gonna have to fight Us in bankruptcy court if it ever gets there or fight us out of court you know prior to bankruptcy court and that's where we're currently at and when you look at it from a very simple lens there's some degree of misrepresentation there now what was the degree of misrepresentation is it you know a civil liability probably is it a criminal liability I have no idea right but that's the state that they're in and there was clearly some level of misrepresentation because they were purporting to be a sound business right before they went under just like FTX can I ask them maybe uh a more procedural question for someone who's never been involved as a creditor of a suit almost bankrupt or not bankrupt entity how does the like information flow work like do you get contacted by like the Genesis creditors class action suit or do you get contacted by Genesis directly or like do you have to just be like oh I heard this in the press or like I asked people who like tried to sue them or whatever like what's kind of the information flow I just out of curiosity so there are multiple creditor committees that have formed where everyone bundles their claims together and says we're working together as a squad we want to negotiate directly with Genesis dcg and I don't really think the entities are that unbundled between Genesis and dcg so the Creditor committees hire lawyers and those lawyers talk to the company and they share information they trade plans and Recovery scenarios and all these things that they're alluding to on Twitter and then they share them to their creditors in the Creditor committees and as I understand that there's like two committees that are negotiating with Genesis and dcg trying to restructure all of this in real time one is Gemini and one is many of the larger creditors I'm not a member of either credit or committee so like I get no information like I literally just you know getting things from Twitter when Barry and Cameron are tweeting mean things to each other no matter how much I ask they just refuse to provide any transparency or Clarity like I can ask them questions and they'll just say we're working to resolve the situation so that's mechanically how it works the Creditor committees negotiate with them but that's out of a you know mutual interest which is hoping for a positive resolution I don't think there's any legal requirement for Genesis to negotiate with anybody um it's just of their own volition to try to Stave off a um forced bankruptcy they could at any time do a voluntary bankruptcy petition and put themselves into bankruptcy they haven't done so even though density is most likely insolvent on the other side in order to push an entity into bankruptcy in an involuntary way um it requires a number of creditors to file their debts with a court and say I haven't been paid back and once I don't know the number I think it's like three once three creditors have said this company refuses to pay me they can be pushed into involuntary bankruptcy and so you know that could happen at any point as I understand it so we'll see you know it's an incredible situation to be in limbo it's one of the largest businesses in the history of crypto and you know it's it's teetering on the edge of the Genesis terminating their loan agreement as uh stated and either Cameron's letter or whatever they sent kind of earned customers does that count as telling the court that like they're no I think you actually have to file it with yeah exactly you can't like not just stating it publicly is not enough I just felt like it could just be like one person who does file is like hey these other two people happen to also say the same thing like or do they have to file separately because like I'm I feel like the mechanics of this type of stuff seem to dominate like the payoff much more like understanding the mechanics more than the like Showmanship nonsense yeah it's a complicated Game Theory to it and I don't think anyone is gonna walk away with more money if Genesis files for bankruptcy I think in general people are going to walk away with the same or less money drawn out over a much longer period of time so I think what's happening behind the scenes is everyone's saying like hey hey let's not push Genesis into bankruptcy unless we absolutely have to and like all conversations and negotiations so just break them down yeah you're saying it's like a mutually yeah you could you could almost perform like a bribery attack where you're like hey if you got like if the rest of the creditors don't give us some money like me and two of my friends who are like small fry creditors are gonna go push Genesis into bankruptcy and screw everyone else over it's it it does seem like an unstable it does seem like an unstable equilibrium well I think the reason why it's more stable than that and this is I'm not you know an expert in restructuring law or any of that but what I think makes it a more stable situation that prevents that is that any resolution has to be done equally amongst the various crackers so you can't have like three creditors who like threaten them with some ultimatum and say give us all our money back or read oh no no I'm not saying I'm not saying threaten the company I'm saying threaten the other shareholders oh oh well that might be possible yes yes yes I I mean I'm pretty sure that's extortion but you know I there's maybe some way you can structure it yeah but anything has to hold up right right the interesting thing is that um so when when Cameron is you know Cameron was accusing dcg slash Genesis of fraud his specific request like so clearly I mean look whether or not they're performing fraud you still want to get your users paid back right so one way or another you want to find a peaceful resolution that's still outside of bankruptcy um and so the the remedy that Cameron proposes to make him feel okay about the resolution here is for uh Barry to step down which is which is a very interesting thing to ask for because one of course Barry is not the CEO of Genesis right so Barry's not involved in Genesis except as a sort of you know distant owner or like an owner of the parent company um but then second uh you know Barry kind of is dcg you know it's like asking Elon to step down from Tesla uh or from SpaceX right it's it kind of he's so deeply into intertwined with that company and he owns obviously the vast majority of it so it does I I'm like I'm not really certain what Cameron is thinking and asking for Bear to step down it could be that Barry has just been so um like you know ostensibly what he's claiming is that Barry's been so difficult to work with he's been dodging requests he's been unresponsive and that really it's just looked this guy's stonewalling me and literally if you don't put someone there who's not going to Stonewall me I am going to push you into bankruptcy because otherwise I don't have a choice that could be the essence of what he's asking for it could also just be a way of kind of grandstanding for earn users and sure like look I'm doing something I'm asking for this like big kind of loud request I don't know yeah I think I was that I think is actually kind of like the the genius stroke here which is basically Cameron getting in front of the story and deflecting blame on Gemini towards dcg and that's kind of what I've been seeing on Twitter earn users are not pissed at Gemini they're actually pissed at Genesis you know if you think about that doesn't really make sense right like if you deposit money into a bank and then your bank makes a bunch of bad loans and has a bunch of defaults or liquidity crunch you know you don't get mad at like your bank's counterparty you get mad at the bank and yet you know Gemini has been able to basically get all of their users to be mad at Genesis instead of themselves well one small clarification there the Gemini earned users are in lending agreements directly with Genesis they're not lending money to Gemini who lends money to Genesis when they sign the PDF that's like the terms of service or whatever it's like an agreement between Genesis and the customer directly and so they're directly providing the money to Genesis not to Gemini in the middle so that that's the weird Nuance there and this has been front and center that you know Gemini earn it's not like Gemini is going out and managing like a portfolio to like generate a return it's Gemini earn is a funnel into Genesis yeah that makes sense yeah so I mean we'll see what happens with this drama it's all you know it's it's really difficult to see how this ends well besides people just kind of throwing up their arms and accepting a haircut I don't really see any other way that this can this can resolve but I think in the meantime we're going to continue to see some theatrics and some chess beating and I guess we'll see at the end of the day you know is does this rise to the level of fraud you know obviously it's not difficult to understand why dcg slash Genesis might make a misrepresentation or even if it's a subtle one that hey you know we we made everybody whole we moved all this money around like everything's okay now when in reality they chose kind of the easy way out which is not actually ponying up any cash to bolster the balance sheet of Genesis One Way Or Another We're going to learn the answer fairly soon but this does seem to be the big Domino that the uh the industry is waiting on is to see what's going to happen to Genesis and exactly how messy is the outcome going to be now of course the other big drama that has been playing out for a while now is the FTX debacle so we've got a few new developments on the FTX side we're going to be shorter today just because you know the last like 10 shows have all been about FTX so we're gonna we're gonna go a little bit gentler today so one of the really interesting developments with FTX has not been on the side actually of FTX itself but on the investors into FTX and this one really took me by surprise I think it was uh I think it was Reuters that broke the story that there's now an SCC probe into the investors of FTX and what they're probing specifically is whether the investors of FTX followed their own stated due diligence procedures when they invested into FTX and this is something that tarun has railed on a lot of the VCS for is not doing sufficient diligence when they were investing into the company itself and I was really looking into this because I was surprised that the SEC I mean one presumes that the um you know at this point we have pretty good reason to believe that FTX is making misrepresentations to their investors meaning that there was some degree of fraud uh from from FTX to the investors that's exactly what the SEC and the cftc have uh you know charged FTX was doing so you would think that okay well then that means the investors are are victims because they were made misrepresentations to but the SEC is saying like Okay well whether or not you were a victim you did not do everything you're supposed to do you did not do everything you told your LPS your own investors that you were going to be doing when you're investing into these kinds of companies um and if you didn't follow your own due diligence procedures we may potentially fine you for basically having not followed your own rules and therefore having fallen short to your own investors so this is kind of potentially going to be a double whammy so if you think about the big investors into FTX like Sequoia BlackRock you know these kind of guys who have their own LPS and our and are regulated by the SEC you could end up seeing not only the write down in FTX but also a fine from the SEC and these fines if you look historically at fines that the SEC has done for people who had these kinds of deficiencies where they didn't follow their own procedures in making an investment uh these these fines can be in the millions of dollars so um it's unclear whether they will actually bring in the actions against these funds but if so it's it's kind of like I found it personally quite surprising that after you know one of the biggest frauds in recent history that you would also go back and say okay great well the people who invested in they also get get a doubly punished you know I I guess I've already said I was hoping that to not be so uh crass in 2023 so maybe I'll I'll I'll avoid my uh hold on hold on why why are you why why change your uh your character all of a sudden you know it's like a New Year's resolution took a little break I'm like you know what uh you know other than EA being a scam and that I'm willing to rail against okay um I uh I I feel like I kind of feel a little bad for some of the people involved uh because it will be a Perpetual embarrassment that will be stained on their record in a way that's impossible to remove kind of like being like an Enron investor I I actually do really think like for some people like especially if maybe they were like it was their first fund and they they this is like their most prominent investment it will probably be something that will be very hard for you maybe if you're like raise money again you know then again John Merryweather exists so you know who knows but but I guess the main main point I think here is just like I think the fact that investors wrote so much that showed they did no diligence makes it a kind of Slam Dunk case in some ways I mean everything from the the Sequoia blog post that was taken down to some of the things some of the other investors said in the media and the fact that they all went very very quiet right after so like for instance I think there was an interview in the information with Toma Bravo and they talked a lot about everything but when it came to FTX you know sort of they were sort of the first check into the b or B2 I think B because uh I guess Sam's dad was a professor who was a taught uh Orlando Bravo if I remember correctly and that's like how the introduction happened and uh they were extremely quiet about it in a way that was like you know kind of telling to some extent and I suspect that there's just so much evidence that people didn't do diligence and people were almost bragging about it in a way that I I kind of yeah like I said I I kind of feel bad that you know if you got caught up in it because it might be like a very very hard blemish to remove from a professional record and so but people made it easy for the SEC because they have so much public documentation of the things they did and can do I've you've never seen such a case that was such a slam dunk for such a thing so I feel like the SEC is already going after everything this is just like the cherry on top because people kind of admitted to doing such things I mean if I had to guess it's probably the larger outfits that are more likely to end up getting hit with this just because you know if you are a early stage VC fund or you're just you know most VCS I think at least as far as I understand your stated diligence processes are pretty vague right it's kind of like oh it depends on the deal you know we sometimes we'll do this sometimes we'll do that it really kind of depends on the stage and the appropriateness of that diligence you know whereas if you were BlackRock or you're Tomo Bravo you might have much more kind of predefined things that you always do at a certain stage you know you always uh check this you check that you look at the balance sheet you whatever all this kind of stuff so my my intuition would be that this is more likely to hit the very large and kind of more uh stalwart institutional investors that were in FTX then sort of like you mentioned to ruin the kind of the first time funds that end up putting some money in and uh seemingly hit it big I'd be very surprised if any of them were in violation of their own lpas or their own stated procedures in you know like I mean Venture investors obviously all the time will fomo into deals and say oh crap you know I didn't have time to do anything uh you know it was we had a weekend to figure it out and so we just wrote the check whereas if you're BlackRock like you're not doing that yeah for sure I just meant like the evidence the public record evidence of people like sort of bragging about how they didn't do any checks and they still got in was is a little bit like bad you know I I don't know if I've ever personally seen such a thing where people kind of like you know if you do it that's one thing but if you go and like write many things like sort of in the public record bragging about not doing diligence it's like not a good look in the long run I was talking to another friend who's a VC and he had a similar reaction and yeah I was gonna say something very similar where it's like you know there's sort of this it's not as if they're being attacked for not meeting some sort of standard of of diligence effect SEC has in mind or for investing into a fraud it's like sort of doing what you say you're going to do and obviously for an early stage VC it might just be you know a Vibe check or something obviously more than that but like it's sort of a different standard I was wondering like what are other examples when when investors have been pursued busy on behalf of their LPS just like fiduciary yeah fiduciary duty I don't know specific examples I was chatting with our compliance officer or chief compliance officer was telling me about some cases that involve PE funds that got sued first up I I don't recall any of the details to be honest but they tend to be um like I I don't know of any examples that are quite a site profile as FTX I mean again we don't know if the SC is actually going to bring any cases it does feel a little bit like you know sort of don't just stand there do something from the part of the SEC where like they kind of dog piled onto FTX along with everybody else you know very unlikely that you know after Sam is given a kajillion years that he's gonna have much cash to pay the SEC if the SEC ends up you know successfully finding him in a civil suit so it's kind of like okay well we we've done what we can to go after Sam let's like try to show we're also doing other stuff going after the investors um and I'm sure that part of this is connected to their LPS complaining and you know uh you know look all around the investment industry if you were if you invest in FTX or you're invested in somebody who invest into FTX like there's generally people are people are unhappy so the SC feels like it has to do yeah I mean there's also this um this sort of fact that like I think even in 2021 and maybe late 2020 the SEC was starting to get into like trying to find ways to regulate or Force private funds to have more just public disclosures or at least they were like touting the Horn of this because they're like all they were like spax were like sort of very unfair as like public companies that had these like huge discounts whatever before and then I think like 2021 happened and like they kind of forgot about that but I feel like this is just like coming back around the circle to like trying to go after that and it's just a much stronger argument that the SPAC argument I suspect so yeah definitely it definitely feels like that's what they're going for but also again like I said I I if you have so much public documentation it's like very hard to not attract this type of attention when it's such a large scandal yeah no it's true so I mean the FTX drama is continuing uh Sam recently pleaded not guilty um as his initial plea now that doesn't necessarily mean that he is going to not eventually you know arrive at some guilty plea and you know got some kind of deal but right now um you know the initial plea is not guilty one of the big fights going on right now is over his Robin Hood shares so this Robin Hood shared my understanding is that these Robinson Shares are in some kind of SPV that's owned by both Sam and nashad I think and these Robin Hood shares uh they've been fought over now by the FTX bankruptcy uh the block five bankruptcy and they were just recently seized by the doj and Sam put in a claim basically saying that he needs these Robin Hood chairs in order to pay for his legal defense and apparently that that claim was was kind of smacked down um so they're like no screw off well didn't the US government just seize the assets like more like yeah yeah the doj just sees them that's right that's right but it's unclear what they are being seized for like to what they're going to be like are they going to be pledged over to the block I um bankruptcy are they going to go to the FTX bankruptcy like it's very unclear where it's going but we we just got a statement I think yesterday from the FTX bankruptcy proceedings that they've recovered now five billion dollars between cash and crypto assets for for FTX now we don't actually know what the liabilities are yet so we it's unclear what that translates into is that okay is that going to be a 20 recovery 25 30 40 we actually still don't know uh I don't know does anyone know like is there a ballpark number floating out there about what the total liabilities are anyone know maybe we could find this relatively easily the weird the weird thing though is that like uh the it was I think it was someone from Sullivan and Cromwell who like made this statement about the 4.6 billion dollars but they also said they don't know the total outstanding liabilities in the same statement yeah yeah that was what that was what I read is that nobody has their number file where everyone was saying it was like eight or nine points eight to nine point six billion like they had some range something like that and then all of a sudden now people are saying they don't know how much because 5 billion out of 8 is a ridiculously good recovery rate like if that's true that's very good I thought the whole was 8 billion right right yeah that that even if it's 13 billion total like let's say it's five five out of 13 is not as horrible as I I was assuming it was much more wiped out than uh based on the way people yeah definitely I mean claims if you if you go in secondary markets claims are going for like 10 to 15 cents or at least they were before they jumped a lot today I I actually I made a prediction on Twitter that there'll be an on-chain asset for trading the claims soon because this is just too juicy I mean there should at least be a prediction market right there are predicted markets but but I I kind of feel like the claims where are the prediction records I think poly Market has one a market but it's a very weird settlement thing they're basically just like if the the you know if it resolves like by a certain date which is like a lot weaker than trading the claims like an instant based on event driven stuff uh which is why I think it's sort of gonna maybe be more like someone will make a synthetic asset than like a prediction mark because the prediction Market seem to specify this like terminal event whereas I think these synthetic assets don't need to tell you like what the resolution event is they just are like yeah you're trading this it's an IOU who knows if you'll ever get the other side you're right gen which is the I the irony is that it's like people who would have lost money on those claims would trade that so I see that right the nice thing about bankruptcy claims is that technically they're not Securities so you don't really run afoul of Securities laws even if you do tokenize them and start shipping them around yeah I mean I just like people will just cash settle them or something like I I kind of feel like they're going to do some hacky thing and like someone is going to do it and it will it will be on chain on a big product yeah it's like No One's Gonna though the reason why It's Tricky well there are there are some off-chain uh there's this one startup that was playing uh exclaim X claim so there's this article X claim that people actually do trade bankruptcy assets like bankruptcy claims and I think Celsius is one of the big things that people are trading on there as well as um what's the other one we'll live at 82 mil in FTX claims oh they already have XCX okay interesting yeah well that's what people were talking about is like until the court I guess recognizes like the transferability of these claims it's a little janky where it's like people can sort of double promise or like the contract that you might be signing might not hold up so it's like it feels a little bit like like funny money right at the same time the prediction markets have this problem of they have to choose like a resolution time scale or events and like that's still very hard to do right now so I feel like people are you know in some ways this is just like trading an nft collection that maybe will deliver on its roadmap and you know people trade those it's more that it is certain that it will deliver as roadmap it's unclear when right so it's like uh still technically I don't know I don't know about you but you know some of them could deliver in 10 years yeah yeah that's why actually tarun I'm just remembering now um when we were doing our end of year kind of review show you were talking a lot of [ __ ] about nfts and I kind of want to get like one thing I'd I'd like to get from you is like what is your thesis about nfts in 2023 where do you think nft is a category do you think it's dead do you think like this was all a giant scam it's all a wash or do you think that nfts will continue to be a thing and that they will find new relevance I think nfts that have like use cases and revenue like a uniswap leisure it's a great okay so you're all about utility you're like nfts plus utility is where the future yeah the art representation stuff I just feel like I I it's it's very unclear to me if that's like a sticky thing it does feel like beanie babies not really like you're not going to get the Fine Arts stuff like no matter how much how close you were in 2021 I feel like it's still a little bit distant but I think the utility of the representation is really interesting and um yeah on this this other podcast I co-host called the zero knowledge podcast we were talking about like you know at some point there will be some type of on-chain trading mechanism that won't look like the current amms and it won't look like the current nft options but such that you can trade nfts and fungible tokens in sort of like as if they were in the same environment in the same sort of manner like same mechanism I think the day that happens I'm much more bullish on nfts because I feel like that's that like you know there are obviously many ways people have tried to do that you know Correctional fractionalization like securitizing in different ways but I think the moment you actually are able to to have transfers feel like using uniswap is is sort of like one of those days where like nfts midnight might make me might make me have to reconsider my past do you think amm's like pseudo swap or Haiti swap fit that bill they're not homogeneous across tokens on nfts I I actually think there will be one day a one-size-fits-all homogeneous across nft isn't the idea of entities and they're not homogeneous no no homogeneous in the sense of like you know the the uh maybe this is two down the Rival for this podcast but there's you know there have been a bunch of people who've done these kind of sequences of auctions I think this maybe now seemingly ill-fated collection called Art gobblers used uh sort of sequence of Dutch auctions um and this I this kind of it sort of acts as like an intermediate intermediate State between like you know an RFQ like OTC type of trade for a nft and something that's like trading a liquid token because there's like many of these auctions continuously and it's there there is sort of some notion of continuous trading unlike normal nft Trading so these types of mechanisms could theoretically sort of bridge the gap like sequences of like auctions that are guaranteed repeatedly and that you you know you have you you could you could do both large liquid token transfers on nfts in the same way and I think like there's going to be it whatever is the standardization of that like uniswap will make make the interface and ux like 20 times better because people only have to build things to one standard so okay and bottom line though you believe that for nfts to really work not only do okay not only does there need to be some sort of better Market infrastructure built that makes it much easier to trade these things kind of uniswap style but more importantly you think that without utility nfts are kind of doomed to be this sort of Niche beanie baby-like thing I mean I guess the Chinese government did make that weird like centralized nft Market they did last last week Robert okay you Robert you declared nft bankruptcy last year what's your view do you think like it's over or do you think do you agree with to ruin we need utility you know I don't think there needs to be utility per se like look at the Art Market in general okay no one's like saying oh this piece of art on the wall needs utility the utility is its beauty the utility is its scarcity the utility is you know it's provenance and the story and the history and everything that goes into it right like art is not valuable because of any utility besides like enjoying it and looking at it and like you know vibing with it so I don't think that nfts you know in an artistic sense need any utility I don't think you know an nft has to get you into a members club or some you know different event or whatever it is I think if you look at the entire market for art in aggregate 99 of its absolute hot garbage that's worth zero right and almost there's like you know 500 000 struggling artists in America who are all making Crap Art and like one or two that are really successful and famous like at any given time and I think nfts are just going to play out like that in that people are going to realize that most of this is absolute garbage and that most people are not good artists and almost all of this you know is not enjoyable and there will be things that stand the test of time and are amazing and people really like genuinely love and you know have a lot going for it but I think you know we're at the phase of nfts where we're still increasing the saturation and quantity of it where every single day there's more and more projects most of which are just hot garbage and worthless and I think this increasing saturation is going to keep on occurring until as a society people just get burned out on it and I'm personally burned out on nfts but you know I don't think Society is yet and I think they will be burned out on nfts and then I think you know they're probably just like people got burned out on regular art you know like good artists are going to keep on producing and making new things and experimenting and I think that's when we'll see like you know a Renaissance for nfts again where it's just like you know once people stop trying to do the same thing for the 2000th time and they start like actually experimenting and like taking risks and trying new things and being creative then there's going to be some great nfts but like right now almost every single nft out there follows the same stupid formula so you think we need to move past like the 10K monkey collection in order for nfts to have a Resurgence absolutely I like I can't even imagine how people keep falling for the same like oh it's 10K it's scarce it's like yeah great artificial scarcity of the thing you made up last week like it's just like if anyone remembers the old crypto cycles of your where it was like Bitcoin and the 37 000 rebrands and like Forks of Bitcoin how many rare Pepes do you own they were a cycle on their own yeah but even before that like do you know how many like things took the Bitcoin you know code repo and gold Bitcoin private Bitcoin God Bitcoin Unlimited and yeah and like back in the day you just changed like one little thing you're like oh it's a new coin right like please mind my coin there was thousands of coins that were all stupid right every single one of them is zero and gone today because they all did the same cookie cutter formula and like hoped that by changing this one tiny parameter it like made it special or whatever and like none of those exist today in any sense Quinn market cap even from like 2013 you know if you went to coinmarketcap.com and look at it now the top 100 like four are still around right so that's the way I see nfts it's it's all Cookie Cutter formulaic nonsense that will not stand the test of time but like there will be artists who do really cool really experimental creative things that don't just try to say like oh crypto punks worked and like board Apes kind of worked like therefore my 99 000th generative art project is going to work as well yeah and for the record I'm more speaking of nfts as a data structure not really like the art is horrible but like can I can I get that like on a cup like I'm just speaking about it data structure yeah tarun's the only person I know he talks about nfts being a structure uh I need that I need that on a mug or a t-shirt by the this podcast uh a gift clearly you've just learned what you can buy us yeah we need we need some merch like a t-shirt talk to me about nfts as a data structure talk to me or Tyrone can make his own NFP project where every nft is a new data structure very good Tom Tom what's your take nfts yeah I mean I'm inclined to agree with Robert here like there's clearly something very compelling about like um sort of a few Trends one being everything increasingly digital and online and I don't see that going away and people needing a way to express themselves and I agree the 10kp being is kind of bizarre to me it's like even board Apes frankly are in this bucket to me where they kind of just took crypto punks and like tweaked it and I don't really find it very impressive but um there are people doing really novel things on chain and so I don't think though I think the whole utility thing is kind of a meme like sure you can represent a uniswap LP shares and nft but that's not like really what we're talking about when we're talking about you know nfts yeah I'm actually um I'm quite bearish on utility I think utility in many ways it kind of balance how valuable something can be because if something doesn't have utility then really the only utility can have a status and status is the probably the most valuable thing that people pay for in basically the world right like people don't buy a you know 100 000 foot yacht versus a 50 000 foot yacht because they need more room to walk around right they buy it because they want to impress somebody and so the the way that the reason why nfts have become so incredibly incredibly valuable is not because a fifty thousand dollar nft versus a hundred thousand dollar nft brings somebody twice the joy or is twice as well drawn or is twice as much utility like if you're actually measuring these things in terms of utility how much utility like it's pretty hard to give you somebody fifty thousand dollars worth of utility to give somebody fifty thousand dollars worth of status actually surprisingly doable and so that that I think ultimately is where nfts if allergies are gonna continue to be valuable I mean I can believe that there's going to be Starbucks nfts and you know loyalty programs and this and that but these things are all going to be super super low value because how valuable is the Starbucks you know loyalty program the where we're going to be focusing as investors and where the numbers are going to remain eye-popping in the future are in the status game of nfts and that'll continue to evolve in my defense of myself I guess I would say that I'm I was just more focusing on the idea of like the actual nft needs to have something more than the current representation right like the uniswap version has like some other functionality that might it might not even have to be utility but some other functionality that like gives you whatever this the thing you're talking about is rather than just the current iteration right like I I kind of expect there to be another standard that takes over and I spent a lot of the a holiday in Switzerland and I uh you know one thing that was repeated to me more than three times which to tell you more about Swiss people than anything else was people mentioning the fact that the Rolex CEO has said the following statement which is like wanted to know the time I would just look at my iPhone like I feel like it's hilarious that the Rolex CEO said that so it to you it that is true when I'm wearing a watch I use my phone more as a actual timepiece than I use my did I use my Watch but can you imagine the Rolex CEO saying that that to me is like it means he understands his business good for him you know like imagine imagine the board ape guy being like look the problem with board Apes is that the art isn't good enough we gotta we gotta hire better artists like it's like no dude what you don't understand your business if that's what you think you're selling and so it I I I I you know I I understand the articulation you're making to remember but I I would honestly still be bearish on like finding new I don't know exactly the way you put it or something like finding new ways to new standards new ways to engage with these things I think clearly there does need to be you know something you can do other than just post about it on Twitter like I do think that you know having more forms of Engagement more ways to show off your nft whatever I think that that that is going to be important for nfts to continue to grow but fundamentally like if you think about like games right probably the single digital products that monetize in Monster games where you have these whales who will spend hundreds of thousands even millions of dollars in a single game there's no game that has millions of dollars worth of content or hundreds of thousand dollars worth of utility for anyone to even get in the game right you sort of you get so supercharged you max out all your stats you get the coolest robe or the coolest wand or the coolest whatever the hell it is the only thing you can be buying at that point is status that's where all the excess money gets spent in these games I think that is a preview of what nfts are ultimately going to be about in the end is about finding more and more ways to create richer status games in digital spaces like that I am very long I think that will continue that's going to look more like a social network and that means you're gonna actually have to be able to like have something or not but like some animal whatever this future version of a social network looks like and it's gonna have to have some notion of utility in that thing for you to express this status and I don't think that is the word you're looking for metaverse no but I I mean like if you look at the forecast versions of the world right in my mind they're actually the farthest Along on this experiment of like trying to really deeply integrate nfts into social media style experience and look whether they work or not they are still novel experiments that actually do try to like use this status thing as a fundamental data structure remember that throughout the entire throughout the entire experience of using the social network and it changes the Candor of how people are communicating what they're talking about how they're like giving each other sort of trinkets like the notion of a like changes in some ways when there's sort of some some other type of game around it and so I I think like that's what I guess what that would be more positive on than anything else and that to me requires some other form of utility as in the data structure better be richer Wait So when you say the data structure is richer what do you mean in the context of like lens or forecaster because like okay the nfts are first-class citizens there but I mean on Twitter like you can set a special pfp you can have a pfp be your Twitter thing and it demonstrates that hey you you verified that you own this thing on openc like what's the difference in kind that you're pointing to like you can basically make ft's out of content you generate or nfts are automatically minted okay when you reach certain thresholds like oh like you got like 10 000 likes on something you know they're they're experimenting with a lot of these types of like nft reward in social network type of thing which makes way more sense to me than like Starbucks whatever uh because it's like hey it actually does involve you engaging and like you are sort of on this this game but it's not like a video game it's like this like used to earn your stripe in the social network type of game and I I think those are the the interesting experiments right because those look totally different art they look totally different but but they do involve the data structure holding more metadata and like being able to kind of like mutate itself and like do all other stuff that like the current versions don't you heard it here nfts are about data structures I am I am actually going to get this bug made yeah and just to State the obvious since we're coming up on the end of the show if you're looking to communicate status in a way that's free without spending a lot of money on an nft tell people that you listen to The Chopping Block that is the fastest and cheapest way to increase your status in the crypto Community but we're so exclusive we don't mean nfts only data structures we don't do nfts we only do data structures that's our that's our thing here at The Chopping Block um okay well last thing that I wanted to cover today on the show was layoffs so we've had a slew of layoffs lately I mean it's no surprise I think for most people watching the industry we've gotten battered over the last you know three months we just had a huge announcement of a 20 layoff at coinbase which is another 950 people they already performed layoffs late last year uh continuing that Trend now actually uh Wall Street seemed to like the fact that uh coinbase let go of some people Genesis unsurprisingly laid off 30 of their staff silvergate the embattled bank uh has laid off 40 of their staff so it's been a very very rough you know couple months for crypto companies and um I think startups are starting to see the same story coming to hit them what what are you guys seeing out there right now does it seem healthy does it seem worrying is this not enough uh in terms of in terms of layouts do you expect there to be more how are you guys seeing the situation going on right now I'll jump in first I mean I think I haven't started seeing too many layoffs on the earlier stage of the market in the startups and the seed stage and series a I mean really you know I think layoffs have really come so far from the largest organizations you know the ones that need to preserve cash and the only sane way of doing that is to reduce head count reducing head count is one of like the last options in the latter of preserving cash generally It's like because it hurts your future prospects and so most self-interested corporations don't want to sacrifice future prospects to survive in the short term and so the reason I think it's less of an issue for startups in general is it's 100 about future prospects it's like you use that cash until it's all gone you know for the most part but if you're publicly traded like you just mentioned coinbase and silvergate you know you have to your financials are being scrutinized in real time and you know those organizations have from an equity perspective benefited from layoffs coinbase is up a whole bunch since announcing they were reducing their Force so I don't see it impacting the earlier stage of the market um personally I think you know it's probably extremely necessary for the larger market participants that are losing cash if you have negative cash flow and you're a mature business and you're not able to rely on Venture funding you have to get things in order otherwise you're gone it's existential so I think in some cases they probably have to go further there's the old saying like don't cut twice cut once it's better to have one big round of layoffs and two medium ones you get the pain over faster and everyone who's left can get back to work and grind it out so hopefully this is you know gonna around the corner at some point and you know but I don't think it's going to stop for the late stage companies that can't access Venture funding that are cash flow negative I don't know that I agree with that Robert because a lot of these later stage companies even the ones that are so private a lot of them are really going to have trouble accessing Capital at this point like I mean Venture funding in crypto has massively slowed down and I think a lot of people got you know they raised they raised quite a lot of capital in 2021 and 2022 and they're blowing through that Capital at a very aggressive Pace because they assumed that hey I'm always going to be able to get this awesome valuation I'm always going to be able to raise cash really easily and so I think people lost a lot of discipline over the last couple years and it's very hard to find that discipline when the market environment shifts so rapidly so I now I think there are some companies you know a lot of these protocols that raise like 400 500 million even if they're burning you know 60 70 million a year which is a lot of money um that still gives them you know five six years of Runway before they have to really start making tough decisions but for a lot especially for you know more uh you know more cash flow oriented businesses that you know maybe had three years of Runway uh for a lot of them because their revenues have collapsed right their their runways have significantly shrunk nothing too I mean I was commenting about this a lot over the last couple years like there's so many companies that over hired and you know they grew their Workforce by like 50 70 in a year and so many of those people like you know you have entire teams being managed by somebody who has hired seven months ago and doesn't really know that much of the product very much yet and all the VCS especially the growth stage guys were shoveling money into companies and just telling them to look higher but you know grow more burn cash like whatever just do something with this and um naturally the the efficiency in malinvestment just went way way down so I think it's somewhat healthy um you know I I even coinbase like I suspect that what their threat now like 3 000 employees or something 4 000 it's still huge yeah it's four thousand yeah you said you know 50 or 70 but a lot of the time it's like 3x right um I think uh for a lot of these that you know kind of this size of company so even if you do 220 Cuts you know you're still up you know over 100 of where you were you know at the beginning of 2020 so yeah these companies have have expanded pretty rapidly but the good news is that it's more talent for startups right that's how these kind of firms should operate and uh yeah I'm excited to see you know some of those folks land at early stage companies and and build those yeah I mean I also think a lot of the clut over hiring was probably mainly on the exchange and C5 side in general right like I mean if you look at the number of employees of like coinbase or Babel or Amber or any of those things right like they're like an order or two hours of magnitude more than the you know the later ones or things like that right so like there is a sense in which it was they kind of just grew too fast because in some sense if you're an exchange or a lender or something where there's like kind of no moat uh not like a super strong moat in some sense like people undercut you at any time like in you know kind of cap your market share you end up having to be basically being like leveraged long beta to the market because like any time things are going up a lot you have to spend you have to increase your spend like some fraction because like everyone else is increasing their spend right it's like it's very like market share competitive game and then when everything crashes it's the same thing it's like so like I think there's a sense in which if you try to like map which companies in the field are like really long beta to whatever index you should measure them against then like those are all always going to have these like hard unwinds at every cycle um whereas I think like the the ones that are like less immediately tied to Market data don't have to they don't grow as aggressively for sure and I think VCS and growth investors like kind of lost sight of that but they also don't have to Hemorrhage in the same way yeah it's certainly true that most people who are being laid off at this point are people who probably just came into the industry so it I suspect that there's um you know the folks who are kind of more committed more Die Hard um you know we're kind of in it from the very beginning those people are likely still staying around um especially because they just have more responsibility right so they're more Central to the company so usually when these laughs happen it's like okay we hired 3 000 people in the last year or two thousand people in the last year and we let go of you know like 40 of them because we okay we kind of made a big mistake there you know it's it's tough um although you know seeing the the um uh labor market numbers on the whole for for the us at least uh the labor market is still very strong but we're seeing the entire tax sector correct and you know a lot of these are kind of very high-end firms like it was just announced today BlackRock is doing some significant layoffs as well Goldman was doing layoffs and so we've we've seen just across the finance sector and across the tech sector layoffs hit almost every single company which is a sign of the times right it's just Bell tightening and saying hey we have to get costs under control when the market isn't rewarding growth at all costs anymore yeah I mean actually a very good um blog post that I think recovers this is um Neil Kashkari who's one of the FED Governors you may remember him from lot being in involved in the financial crisis in weird ways he wrote a very interesting medium post first of all I didn't even realize the FED wrote medium posts this was not like on their like blog that looks like it's from the 1990s um but it's actually like in medium and it was an interesting question about like how monetary policy like messed messed up in the first place because they were like overly reliant on kind of like models that were very linear in in labor participation and labor force and the thing is the quality of the labor force was actually going down like the the real wages per unit label around and so they like under they kind of like we're like basic hoping that the zero percent interest rate would like have a wealth effect to like the bottom 50 and it didn't it actually had the exact opposite and so then the response once they realized that like their model labor participation was so skewed in that way they went really hard the other way and he had a kind of interesting perspective on it which is like they're basically really focused on like wage growth and there is some irony in that the wage growth might actually be stunted by this level of cutting in general because like the top end of the distribution is probably just getting completely cut and the bottom end is not like growing faster than inflation so anyway there's a very good blog post called why we miss on inflation and implications for monetary Health that kind of does I thought did a very good job of illustrating kind of where they messed up and why they're like going hard the other way and why they did this really hard U-turn to like Miss your misunderstanding of like why the lab why unemployment's so low um yet wages are shrinking nominally or like insulation adjusted yeah interesting well we've we've now got um some homework for next week um I'll dig into that that sounds interesting we are up on time so we got a wrap but uh thanks everybody and we're gonna try to be back next week talk to everyone yeah [Music]
