so welcome everybody uh welcome to the chopping block every couple weeks the uh usually the four of us now the three of us and a special guest get together and give the industry insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day so quick intros i'm gonna go around uh first off we have taroun the gigabrain and grand pub gauntlet we have robert the crypto connoisseur and captain of compound there's myself a steve i'm the head hype man at dragonfly and we have today special guest kyle managing partner in multicoin i did not think of a clever uh i like the alliteration the sultan of solana is another another we could give you you're really going through all that's all in overlapping exactly all right so very quickly the the four of us are early stage investors in crypto but i want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice legal advice or even life advice kyle how are you doing sir you're the only one of us in shorts uh clearly you are the the austin native it isn't it's 100 degrees outside it is pretty warm it's pretty toasty so i'm in shorts and flip-flops welcome to austin guys great to have an event here i like i'm used to traveling prevents welcome to austin it's it's been it's been insanely hot austin's great yeah in the winter yeah it is interesting so consensus is usually in new york which like in the summer is like it's fine because it's mostly indoors doing a doing a conference where you have to walk long distances to different venues outside in 100 degree weather is a very great very interesting choice texas ninja warrior yeah exactly they should have done it a month ago but yeah june was not a good call yeah fair enough fair enough well i know this is your i know this is your home turf you were just telling me about how you uh you take a lot of your calls inside your pool i mean it's hot outside so like so that's why your video is never on during zoom i see that's not correct yeah that's right that's right well if you were wearing swim trunks as well he might turn it on but you know it's uh yeah i mean i i can tell that um austin austin's been very good to you you look great thank you having fun you all look great chels seattle's weather is looking good yeah it's uh it's all right it's up and down it's up and down um i've been i've been traveling so much like i was yeah i was like do you even live anywhere i know i know it's been it's been a lot but it feels good to finally be in summer where like at least in a bear market it can be warm you know you can you get a little bit of life in you if it's just like cold and the whole market's collapsing it's uh it's a little it's a little rough to take but you were just telling me that you you feel like people are way too somber about what's going on in in macro why do you feel that way yeah so uh i guess look at the last two recessions 2000 and 2008 um 2000 is more tech localized um in 2000 like the internet didn't really work super well and like most people like normal people genuinely believe like computers and tech and the internet is kind of like meh um in 2022 there's actually zero people in the world who do not believe that software's eating the world like actually every human in the world understands this now um and so like that's a pretty important thing of just like things will come back at least in the context of tech i'm not not necessarily broader macro um and then second major difference is like in 2008 like people were like is my bank going to have money in it tomorrow and that was like a real question that people asked like there's no existential questions here um so like i don't know is the growth there's real growth rates gonna slow down by two or three percent for eighteen months like okay like sure but like that's like not that bad in the grand scheme of things like clearly march 2020 was much scarier time because we were just like i don't know we're all gonna die and that was a question that people were contemplating but like today it's just like growth rates are marginally slower for some period i i don't know it's just like doesn't seem that big of a deal how do you feel about the long-term impact of higher interest rates or do you think interest rates are not going to be maintained at a higher level i mean look we're at what four or five percent now which like i guess relative to the last two years is high but like on historical like on any 30-year chart it's like still quite low um interest rates have been generally declining for like the last 100 years thousand years excuse me thousand years right um i don't think that like maybe we just had the inflection point the pandemic was the inflection point in that or something i i don't know but like i i generally think the reason that's the case is um as more as you democratize access to finance and access to capital the universe of capital to do to invest in things is growing which means rates of return are declining and like society needs to find more productive ways to put stuff to money to work um and like the rate at which financial capital is being unlocked to invest in things is clearly still accelerating and crypto actually is accelerating that um so like i generally think interest rates are still trending down in the medium to long term so you see pretty much all of this is like hey it's short term it's transient there's like this stuff going on ukraine there's supply chain issues there's china going offline when all this is resolved it's back on and the party's going to continue party never stopped party never stopped if you just come back to austin you realize the party's been going on the whole time i was amazed at the sheer number of people at this thing compared to the last one i went to the last consensus yeah how many people were at the last one definitely not 16 000 or whatever the number that was claimed here yeah it's true i mean permissionless was like 8 000 i think right yeah that does not feel like that big of an event it was pretty big i think so i mean and then uh denver was like 15 000 if i recall right right well i mean they did take three city blocks of lines i know like that was crazy the hotel lobby could hold like 300 people it's amazing that there's more people at this conference than there are defy users that might be the reason why our portfolios are all down unfortunately so robert fix it please wait wait wait wait i'm working on it only thing crypto has been has the most product market fit for throwing events that may have it might be the number one product you gotta respect the people who like look bear market bull market they're always making money because they're throwing crypto parties yeah and it's a it's a good business um but speaking of which i actually remember um there were some folks during permission list so permissionless there was it was a crypto conference that took place the week after uh the terror collapse and i remember you know obviously you know the whole world was like oh my god what is going on like crypto's ending you know people were there there were talks about people killing themselves and people losing tons of money and whatever and so it was a really somber time and i remember um permissionless was just around the corner and i was slated to go and um one of our portfolio companies was throwing a yacht party at permission and of course like this stuff gets booked way in advance and you know you have to do a lot of setup and so they were telling us like hey guys we'd love you to come to our yacht party and i was like dudes uh you know it's it's like it's a bad time to throw a yacht party like you know a lot of people lost a lot of money it's like kind of a slumber time for the industry also like you know if the press sees this they're gonna have a field day with it so like you know i can already see the headlines and they were like oh yeah see that's a really good point we'll we'll make sure not to invite any press no one will post photos on instagram yeah exactly that that and that's crypto in a nutshell which is why i respect the crypto party people because they they understand that that's what the the true ethos of crypto is just to have a good time wherever prices are going of a kind i'm just surprised we didn't see uh in the last cycle we saw like you know a lot of these kind of like mainly useless tokens like brain trust not to not to sing about anyone that's really standing out but that where like they have some offline like event or labor thing yeah somehow and like crypto somehow even though the events keep going there's no event token no one has tried this like crypto event people tried there's a desk token here proof of attendance tokens are vaguely event tokens that's true that's true but they're not like they're not like these like frenzy you know brain trust was a frenzy for a little while before it crashed to earth right yeah it hasn't has been monetized so much the poe apps are a thing but i i don't feel like uh there's i don't think patricia would be happy if co-ops were monetized i assume they're so bound or is that erc not approved or uip not approved yet no not they're sold out the the the i i think soul bound nft is was a pretty poor choice with marketing personally i i yes also i don't think the idea helps that much but though so very quickly defined sole bound so soulbound is an nft that is basically not transferable so you give it to someone and only that person can have it they can't move it to another address so why do you think a solo banner nfts are bad marketing oh i mean you're just basically saying like hey why don't we invent reinvent identity but call it soul bound which to probably like a ton of religious people feels like like there's probably some religious person in the world who's like that's a [ __ ] attack on my religion because like your soul should be free or like i don't know like i there is enough people on this planet who believe in enough crazy [ __ ] that like there's gotta be i actually think it's great marketing because the fact that we're all talking about it like there's a lot of blog post vitalik has written about that i've never talked about with anyone but it feels like everybody wants to talk about soulbound nfts all of a sudden because they wrote this paper right right but but also just like the the idea itself is clearly interesting to people it like it i mean it's just such a simple idea yeah like simplicity's good but like this is beyonce it's just like of course there will be nfts that are not revocable and not transferable and like i don't know why that concept needed more explanation or thinking well i think they also have some like voting uh component to it where it like has some notion of quadratic voting built in which i don't totally understand because there's not a fungible token attached to it but it was like a way of like if you use them in a chord with in conjunction with the fungible token you could somehow get right right right there was like the main thing was like to prevent civil attacks in this these like bitcoin like systems right yeah because there's tons of that i mean bitcoin is generalized and so i think their application was for that but then of course it mainly was portrayed as like non-transferable nft well yeah no [ __ ] everyone who said the word did which is like big bitcoin max season and uh uh microsoft i don't know if you remember the like did spec through the digital identity spec which would like write like some amount of data to bitcoin like every 100 blocks never happened but that thing is a sold-out well i think people forget that addresses and private keys are transferable we brought this up on the show like three or four weeks three or four episodes ago when we were talking about the ape coin land sale and people were buying other people's addresses in order to participate private keys are easily transferred like you know i think soul bound is a crazy term because it's not actually bound to an individual it's bound to an address and addresses are more transferable than people think true that's true at the same time like i mean i don't know i i find it hard to get worked up over these things because i'm just like look if if if soulband.net is a good idea someone will find an application for it and we'll all benefit from it but probably we're not going to be calling it sold by nfts we'll just be like oh that thing that we all use i mean i think the average user will see it from something like bitcoin where it's like how do you distribute funding in a way that's like not whales taking advantage of it right but i think it's pretty clear they're like look if you're going to create an actual kyc solution it should not be soulbound because people people rotate addresses right or people have multiple addresses or they have multi-stakes or they have whatever or they lose an address and then they say okay well i still exist even though i lost my advice i think the argument is like you have to build up reputation to that particular right but i think any clearly like the right notion of identity that is the the the notion of identity we'll be using in 15 years on chain whatever the hell that looks like clearly we'll be able to survive losing a private key yeah right so if your idea of a soul-bound nft or identity is that it is tied to one private key forever and you build it up over 15 years that's just not going to work yeah that's true i i i i assume it's just going to be some weird oracle service like sea lance you know something like ceiling so c lance is this like matthew green this like cryptographer from johns hopkins yeah yeah it's like uh it's like a kyc kyc solution where like people can verify like some subset of facts they can selectively certain types of queries right right about like off-chain from off-chain at testers like right the dmv right something right yeah this type of stuff just seems way more close to actual like identity than any of these nft yeah yeah certainly so okay i want to i want to jump into the meat of things um so so first off is that i've been informed that there is a long-standing beef between kyle and i don't know the nature of this beef but i'd i'd love to uncover some of the um you know some of the some of the some of the pain that's been that's been uh you know scabbed over when he mentioned to me before the show i was like what is he talking about it took me like three seconds for it to even come up robert knew robert i mean you want to take it away robert i i feel like hasive is trying to create drama on the show to get like clicks we need we need ratings we need right now we need ratings i can um no the only possible beef is that you know very early on in d5 when compound was one of the very first apps you know no one knew how the industry would unfold no one knew what would work and what would not work and what the final form factor would be in fact we still don't know what the final form factor for d5 is going to be and like how it's going to work but multi-coin had you know one or two ideas that compound was not going to be how it works i we invested in deforest they uh this is actually i think it was like march 2020 it was like very right right around the time of pandemic starting uh and the force team did four compound v1 there was a bug that was exploited shortly thereafter based on some i forget token contracts because tokens are complex yeah so we did fund them our thesis we put it on our blog it's still on our blog so go check it out two years later but basically it was a chinese super app was basically the thesis and we had a view back then and i still think we hold today that generally like americans will not build stuff that chinese people interact with and chinese people will generally not build stuff that americans will interact with i think that's generally consensus-ish um not strictly true but generally true and so our view is like these guys are going to go build stuff for chinese retail um obviously didn't work out uh super well and compound has thrived and also there's like 50 compound forks now yeah so you guys have great 50 a month yeah okay well i guess i guess you guys we started that was very sweet i i saw just a little spark of love there's always been some sparkling love here there's always been and like i want to say it was probably nine months later or something you and i started to re-engage on telegram or twitter or something and yeah so like it's fine now crypto's a small space when you really boil it down yeah that's true it's true and i feel but i feel like kyle you you tend to have run-ins at some point with almost everybody in crypto everyone yeah there's like almost no way i mean you've been doing this so long that uh just a boomer now i mean so i think all of us at this point like once you once said yeah like once you once you stop shaving for these things that's how you know that you're like last gen yeah so that's something what is true yeah now that i know they're actually looking at i'm like [ __ ] i actually shaved this morning are you zoomer jen which gems i get i'm trying i'm trying that's why alpha gen alpha can you make it there would you do you uh agree or disagree with the following statement fashion nfts will be the future of fashion i don't even know what that means i'm trying to like parse that statement and it's not i'm just telling you that like false there's so many people who are like arguing that uh or like so many people it's not so many people it's like it's some weird niche zoomer thing i see about like their metaverse character having like i think it will be true too to some extent i think to some extent but not i i view the answer this question is the the categorical division [Laughter] i like this litmus test it's very very clear that's true so we were also so we were supposed to get anatoli on the show and anatoly wasn't able to make it because he's in korea doing stuff so um kyle obviously you are the seed investor in solana you are known by many people as being the first uh investor to you know throw your weight and throw your no tattoo intellectual force no tattoo yeah that we can yeah yeah if you go to his pool parties you get to see this but otherwise we don't get to grace our viewers with that quite yet um so we we we naturally had um at various times on the show we've been critical of solana at times very rarely i i for the record i'm the one who is always like making sure that these kind of very like x is always way better than why claims are are hedged to be clear to be clear i think solana i think salon is awesome we've made a lot of investments on top of solana but i also think it's it's made a lot of mistakes that it's now paying for and um one of the one of the obvious components of that so i think we had andre on um like what was it a month ago i think we had andre on and um andre basically made some he made some claim about solana that solana's not even a blockchain it's just like a database and blah blah blah um and so we were like okay we should bring on somebody who's pro solana to go and give the counterpoint i don't necessarily need to respond to that because it's obviously kind of an outlandish claim but in the last you know part of the storyline about solana so solana obviously is down alongside everything else it's down quite a lot from the peak it's down uh it's like 30 something dollars now and at the peak it was like 240 so it's down what 80 plus percent in line with the market in line with in the market um and most all-tell ones are also you know suffered roughly the same fate um the the thing about solana though is it's had very very spotty up time so this year alone my understanding is that we've had 12 periods of downtime in this year and it's you know it's june so basically about twice a month and uh the most recent down times just give the tldr there was a there was basically a bug with what's called durable transactions on solano and so durable transaction is when normally on solana when you want to use a send a transaction you don't use a nonce the way you used on ethereum which is like this is my first transaction this is my second transaction this is my third transaction so that the blockchain knows even if it gets it out of order what order in which you intended to play these transactions um in in solana what you do is you specify a particular block and you can only sort of do that once that's how you do transactions make sure you don't get repeats um but if you're offline if you're like in cold storage and you're like in a clean room you don't know what the last block hash was so you can't include a block cache so selena has a mechanism for you to do what are called durable nonces which is a way for you to like sign a transaction a clean room take it out even if you don't know what the blockchain is now there's a bug in durable nonsense which caused consensus failure in solana and it went down for like six hours or something sliders back up they disabled this feature um but by disabling this feature they plan to reinstate it once they do the next upgrade but by disabling this feature that caused most of the custodians that actually hold solana in cold storage and do this kind of clean room [ __ ] to be unable to move solana anymore so like coinbase custody we got a notification that ended up posting on twitter that coinbase custody can't move solana they can take solana they can you know the flooded stakes is still being staked but um they can't move it so your solana is now stuck if it's in a custodian or in a similar environment where you need durable transactions is that bullish it's yeah so you know you can at least if you feel like you know it's not it's not blocked in for you you can remove your exposure to it but um yeah i'm curious to uh to get your take on the situation about the stability of salon that we've seen this year yeah so i'm i'm going to zoom out and provide a different framework on how i think about this problem um so bitcoin you know the ideology that has driven bitcoin for most of the last 10 years has been fairly libertarian digital gold almost pseudo-anarchy kind of a thing right um and obviously there was a block size debate in 2016-17 and the obviously small blockers won and like really strongly reaffirmed the like very conservative road map change nothing no hard forks et cetera um ethereum is not as extreme in like that hard instead of beliefs as bitcoin but it's like directionally aligned with like you know slow changes very slow like don't break it like i i think actually the litmus test of like the ethereum ideology is assume all the core developers die today every single one of them everywhere in the world the system has to run in perpetuity right and i think that's kind of the bar that they hold themselves to it every time they release an upgrade you they kind of operate with the same assumption um and and uh i think i think that's one of the core kind of ideological differences is like solano's world view and anatoly's world view is look it's gonna take us five whatever some number of years to get to where we want to go just get there as fast as humanly possible and like make a bunch of mistakes along the way it's fine but like don't assume that the entire engineering team will die in 24 hours um and so i think that's kind of product management ideology difference a um i think then b is kind of like diving down a little more narrowly is you know when we were i was obviously pretty close to the salon team as they launched two years ago and when we launched blockchain the concern was no one will ever use this thing that was by far the most important concern and like when they launched it like there was a bunch of known stability problems and like they worked through most of them there's obviously still some other stuff they have to do but like once the the blockchain was generally functioning their priority of the kind of all of the res the people there was uh was to get drive usage and started working with the serum team and did a lot of d5 stuff the first few hackathons were all very definite oriented and building out whatever spl stuff and whatever else they had to do then they turned their energy towards metaplex and nfts and did that spent on metaplex then they did salona pay um they have a couple other cool new projects they're working on but like they've generally been expending their resources explicitly on trying to drive growth to get people to use the blockchain um inevitably as you drive people to use the blockchain they will use the blockchain and like inevitably things break um right like in the generally in the history of software every time you scale a system 10x as a rule of thumb something breaks somewhere uh reads rights stability whatever right this is kind of like a known thing um so you know i think what you're seeing now is you're seeing uh the cost of the decisions that were made over the last several years um which was prioritized growth over like known but like they knew they needed to do free markets they didn't do them the durable nonstick was known several weeks before it happened to fail like a few days ago so like they made these were known decisions that were made ahead of time uh consciously hold on but i i'm i'm pretty sure that anatoly has argued with me on twitter that solana does not should not have few markets i mean few markets are shipping like now issues no i know i know like this you know because a lot of they faced a lot of criticism about the lack of markets but like for a long time this was an intentional design choice it's not like a it's not like oh whoops we forgot to sure markets right but like they change their mind like okay like we need that few markets right like go right right no no so i mean clearly salon is adapting to the fact that like hey there are these we're seeing the way in which this thing is breaking up the margin yes and we need to adapt around it but correct the story that you're telling is one that like look we basically we move fast and break things yeah we're intentionally prioritizing adoption over stability yes um but it it it does seem to me like this also is not just a story about usage it's definitely a story about usage in that there are a lot of blockchains that exist today that have you know hidden like sort of you know weaknesses that will only be exposed when they face really serious usage and you know a lot of things are going to break when they receive the kind of load that solana receives yes um so i think that's definitely true and i take your point on that um but it also does seem true that solana is probably um is probably breaking more than it should yes that also seems true yes and um i'm curious if if you have a i'm curious it seems like you agree with that yes um why do you think that is yeah so so one element of problems emerging in downtime is usage grew and that caused you to have problems but the related part of the point i was kind of getting at was like for the last two and a half years the primary engineering resources have been there's a bunch of known things they want to do to improve stability and fees and whatever and they just said kick that can down the road spend energy on trying to drive growth and so it's just been like a very conscious decision of focus on getting more people to use it um instead of identify like going after known bugs and like quite frankly i agree with that decision i think that was absolutely the right decision you can argue that today it may be no longer his right decision and like that's a pretty reasonable debate to have um obviously you have to play a lot of counter factuals of how the world works out and those are difficult to reason about um but certainly at least for the first 18 if not 24 months after the network launched which the network is 26 months old like i i think absolutely was the right decision to focus on growth i mean it's clearly succeeded right right yeah is obviously extremely valuable tons of people use it it's one of the few things that people even know yeah as layer 1 block chains besides ethereum yeah so i i i again like this let's come back to the core question actually you kind of literally do with andre too of like what's a blockchain and like again if you assume the entire engineering team will die today and the system must run in perpetuity if that's your definition of blockchain then it's not a blockchain but like that's fine like that's just not a useful definition what do you what do you mean by that like i mean again like if ethereum today if the entire ef and core teams and all the teams around the ef assume all of them disappeared right now yeah yeah ethereum in its current form will run probably in perpetuity yeah so i understand i understand that point i'm saying why would you say that salon is not a blockchain if the devs die like like there's a bunch of these things the fee markets are not alive yet right like there's a bunch of things that they know that they need to get working to scale this thing the blockchain will stop in like two weeks whatever something will go wrong and like it will stop working and that but i think that's okay like fix the ship the the corollary to ethereum is like okay you have a thing that doesn't go down but also like there's still no it's been seven years and like is the scaling stuff gonna work like i don't know like so you'd have to take the other side of the same coin right right um this this is a trade-off for almost every project in some form between the ability to evolve versus stability and you see with solana you see it with compound you see with bitcoin every different project ever makes some choice of where it wants to be on the pendulum and sometimes it's the right call sometimes it's the wrong call i think compound doesn't move fast enough because it's more stable and more resilient than possibly the market should be solana is more flexible and i you know we'll see what you know the right decisions are yeah i mean look i i i agree with the the the core point which is that all this stuff is it's trade-offs all the way down and there's no there's no free launch that you can get you can you can make the best calculation that you can and but eventually you have to pay everything down right so you can you can cut some corners in order to get faster performance better go to market better growth but you have to pay everything back at some point the question is what's the price when you have to pay it back yeah and when you become really big of course the price becomes significant because you know when you're a small little blockchain people don't really care they don't really care if you're down below um when you're you know one of the largest blockchains in existence which lana is today um of course is disruptive to a lot of d5 there's a lot of tvl there's a lot of oracles that go down there's a lot of blah blah so the disruption becomes becomes bigger and that that you're right it is tricky and we're not gonna know for another you know three to four years what the um what the record is going to show in retrospect but um one of the questions that we got on twitter was actually asking about your investment into aptos okay so aptos um for just very quick tldr aptos is one of the um blockchain teams that spun out of the x uh libra dm whatever teams uh they're basically building the blockchain that facebook was going to build that was going to be called libra took the tech are improving it and they're going to launch their own layer 1 blockchain it's intended to be very high performance similar in principle at least for solana um so what the the the kernel of the question was one what motivated your investment into apptos but the kind of the direction that i'd want to take it is do you think the exact same things will happen to haptos um cool so i'll answer the latter first um yes generally um aptos has the luxury of like they just had an enormous engineering team with effectively unlimited money for for quite some time that probably will be good for just like fewer problems down the road salon and before the network launched like those guys were running out of money you know like we'd let us around to like keep them alive um obviously they didn't have that problem at dm um so they have some luxuries there that you know are likely to pay dividends in the future counter factual cases of things not going down um but directionally i'll make an extreme statement every single layer one or layer two without question will go down substantially both on the rights and the reads over the next several years as they try and scale um something will go wrong in the prover something will go wrong in the sequencers like it won't just be even rpc layer every single one of these things is going to have very embarrassing face flops in some form or fashion um totally agree because like scaling reads is one thing that's kind of rpc side but scaling all the rights is like the whole separate set of problems um comment actually that was question two question one why do we invest in at this um the answer is like we like that it looks like solana um there's all this talk about modular blockchains and l1 and l2s i don't think l2s have a place in the world and i think they will be used for some stuff i am quite confident l2s are not the savior to everything um and so uh generally i want to maximize throughput at layer one um and then we'll see what little two stuff happens um but like so the common a and then comment b on why we did adapt this uh i think one of the things that helps a lot be successful is that it is a unique programming model um and has rust although knowing rust alone is not enough to program in salon you need to learn the salon account systems and data models and whatever but like um one theory i have is that being an evm chain is actually value destructive because people just copy paste code from eclair one and paste it in new places and you don't get truly organic developer communities with real intellectual capital forming and building um solana you have to have that happen and they took some set of opinions and trade-offs and whatever like how the system does stuff and compute whatever um and move is a taking a new set of differentiated opinions on like how the core programming model should work i actually don't know if those opinions are good about i don't actually care but what i care is that they're different and they seem to prioritize safety and like making it harder to write bad bugs um it's pretty clear that like as crypto enters mainstream more and more developers will be writing smart contract code a lot of those developers will be scared that they will write the bug the line of code that causes a 500 million dollar thing to blow up and like no one wants to be that guy and if there are people who credibly believe that this development environment is more is more likely to have safer code a lot of people will be attracted to that even if the claim itself is actually somewhat dubious and i'm not making particular claims about move versus evm versus solana yeah but like they lean into it they talk about it there's a bunch of academics talk about it i think the claims are generally accurate um i remember you were one of the co-authors on uh one of the libra papers what's what's your favorite reviewers um yeah i mean i think as a language it's like really well designed i i generally think however they're like i'm from my perspective it's more like i think the language is great i don't i don't see that as that much of a moat perhaps i think in solana's case actually there was more of the as antoine would say chewing glass effect of like the account system is [ __ ] hard to deal with like oh when i run a validator i have to figure out how to do kernel bypass like all there's like all sorts of like very annoying [ __ ] like that whereas i kind of feel like move doesn't have as much of that i feel like the place where you see that happening is starkware starkware has one of the most hilarious programming languages because it doesn't have strings yet so you can't even print a [ __ ] error message just like think about that right like you have to be really like assembly guru who like can't tell what the [ __ ] happening ever and in order to really write stuff there and like i think the zk stuff will be a little closer in my mind to to the solana kind of eat those i actually think move move is going to is relatively easy to write code for i do think people though in these kind of like overly typed systems it's very hard to get it it it will have a little bit of the cardano slash you know kadena etc problem of like you're getting people to learn this like sort of functional language it has like sort of weird semantics that like don't match like whatever your apparatus is around it which is like typescript or python or whatever right so i in my mind i guess that's that would be more my claim i think like people like the challenge of solana whereas like i feel like move is like a very different subset of people who would be like find that challenging and i don't think those people are very good at devops and like solana really attracted these people who are like i love 99 uptime i'm like who the [ __ ] are you people like i don't want to be on call 24 hours a day i don't know why you do but i i feel like i feel like move is more like it's like the oh camel like funny yeah they're very functional yeah like the house people i do think there is like the cultural differences i see um at least that's just from like the technical side i like ethereum because i don't think there should have to be devops for writing applications that live on a blockchain like i think when things are good enough like you don't have to worry about devops or uptime like the layer one people do though development developers do right but like the application layer separation of concerns right right in solana though in the beginning until anchor really like started to mature you basically didn't have that separation of concerns while you're testing and i feel like that attracted a certain type like it no matter what you you can say it's like it attracted the type of person who'd want to be a guest developer um there's a there's a kind of masochism that sounds like forms in early community like people who go through some [ __ ] together you need something there for what whatever it is in the case of solana though i i don't think on a go-forward basis the core of it is the chewing glass thing although anatoly leads into it and i like it i i think what's matter what matters is it's a different development environment with some unique set of ideas and trade-offs in the programming language and whatever um like there's javascript people there's python people there's people plus people there's rust people everyone gets trained on whatever they are trained on they have some set of biases and beliefs and how they think computers should work there's interpreter code native code right like all this and so um i i think the idea of like evm homogeneity is that's the crazy idea like you just need to have some different new ideas and models um and i think move will be a pretty meaningful benefactor from like the world wants some degree of heterogeneity of just different stuff i think i think that's definitely true and there and there are real trade-offs to the obviously evm is you know kind of it wasn't even designed by committee it was designed by like one crazy person on a bender yeah so it's like it's very one crazy person who disavowed his creation [Laughter] well so yeah it's it's it's you know it's a complicated origin story for like you know the biggest smart contract platform but it works and it's a steady format but like vhs versus betamax like you know the best format doesn't always win yeah and like in a lot of ways i think evm is winning in its own way because like it's becoming a format that any blockchain can adopt to have an ecosystem basically out of the gate i i 100 believe that and i and i i would take the opposite of the claim that you made which is that look the problem with launching a chain with evm is that people can just copy and paste stuff and they're all lazy and nobody reinvents anything and um you know that that is actually like that's why github exists it's that you can just copy and grab some other guy's thing and then put it on your thing and say great i'm gonna remix it and add something on top that's like what created internet culture is the ability to do that which was extremely difficult before they happened to the internet now of course that means that there's gonna be a lot of lazy copies and a lot of lazy forks that don't do anything just as there are you know thousands of forks of every major project that no one cares about no one needs to care about like the waste bin can be infinitely big which is the beauty of software is that you know we're not taking up resources by trying to create another chain with another evm instance that doesn't end up going anywhere it's totally fine no way no one no one uh no resources are wasted by doing that but the one person who creates an amazing vm chain that has some great you know novel idea in it or some great application can get a bunch of adoption have a bunch of tooling have the collective intelligence of everyone who's been working on the evm to civilize this otherwise really awful virtual machine into something that feels usable and feels safe and feels predictable that that is really powerful and it happened already to javascript right javascript is a horrendous language out of the box but we've turned it into something like fairly civilized and fairly usable and really really freaking performant there's there's so many there's so many uh functional programmers who are who who are the type of people who love move who are tisking at you let them let them disc i mean it's the most popular language i think that i i do agree though with kyle's point that like people like the the the heterogeneity because like you know somehow you want to like developers love that but i don't think like users love that that's the of course i mean it's opaque to use the users want their wallet experiences to be homogenous i actually think they don't like too many weird ux and like that i don't know i don't know how to reconcile like the user side with the dev site the devs are the hipsters the users are like i don't know like mainstream they're mainstream and they don't want they don't want to like keep mixing ux and i feel like eth did set the standard for what the ux should look like and now so there is some some some weird thing that i can't kind of reconcile there personally well so okay let's let's um shift subjects so there's a been interesting development lately kyle you were talking about that you don't believe l2s are going to be the savior um well so there was an l2 savior moment uh last week so optimism which is right now uh in the spotlight because they're a layer two an optimistic roll up on ethereum that recently launched their token optimism uh op token um there was a this token was supposed to get distributed to a bunch of early investors as well as partners one of those partners was wintermute which was a market maker and so the story goes that uh winter mute was supposed to receive 20 million op tokens so like mark and make and do stuff and um optimus was like yo here are your tokens winch mute was like cool we got them uh and it was supposed to be a gnosis safe a multi-sig that was deployed onto optimism however winter mute never deployed the multisig they had the multi-signal ethereum and they assumed that they could later deploy it to the same address on optimism but it would be good that's the address and like obviously nobody else can like become our multi-seg well it turned out they were wrong uh someone else could become their multi-sig and in fact that's what happened an attacker deployed a contract to the address that was otherwise going to be the gnosis safe for optimus or sorry for mute and took their optimism tokens as well as a bunch of other random uh nosy safes that uh were were also eligible to receive optimum air drops the reason why this happened was because of some some subtle things around opcodes and basically they didn't deploy their nose safe in the way that they ought to have using a mod using whatever create two which is a more deterministic way to deploy addresses that have the parameters in there so you know who the owners are before you deploy it um the attacker was then pressured by a bunch of people like hey so they stole like 20 million i think in opie tokens and um the attacker apparently they sent a message to vitalik is the ultimate ponzi scheme he gets like like tied from every single attack that's right so he said he sent a message of italic in like the little you know the the what's it called memo of the transaction saying like hey vitaly what do you think i should do or something something like this he was like asking vitaly for advice on how to deal with this situation and um so what he did as presumably penance for his sins is he um he sent 18 million op back to optimism uh to return the funds uh he sent one million to vitalik for who knows why maybe vital will return it maybe he won't i'm not sure um and he kept one million for his troubles i mean i think part of this was a little bit of like an edge alerting move with the vitalik piece because you know vitalik's you know i wouldn't say he would would he probably would disagree with this characterization but i would say his player two of choice the one that's blessed by him based on amount of interaction and talk about it is certainly optimism versus say arbitram um and i think the idea that like the you know this this type of thing happened on the the the blessed so-called l2 was this was like a way of like giving a middle finger that's that's definitely possible it feels it feels like that like even the note the way it was written was just like so trolling yeah it i mean we're seeing though i mean we've talked about this before like it's trend of people giving back hacks happens a lot something tells me it's not because of a guilty conscience that we keep seeing these hacks returned i assume it's that like there was no way for this guy to liquidate 20 minutes i mean chain analysis is actually pretty so there's another attack uh last week which is osmosis had uh had this huge bug they halted they got the valder to actually halt the chain and it still helped it until they fixed this thing they had an event here as well they were like partying well the chain was down i mean you already like like you said you're one chain down party up yeah yeah that's crypto yeah finally finally we can relax yeah it's great but it's like it's like you know i i in general i think they already rescheduled everything i spoke at this conference so like where you were there yeah what was the vibe at the opt at the osmosis not somber not happening okay there was no one busy in the back room being like yo we're turning it back on don't worry don't don't invite the press you're good yeah there you go there you go yeah um no i think that the the main thing is the person who who who did that um wrote this tweet apologizing publicly and i was like wow did the the team like can the two do this where it was like because it was a validator who was publicly known and they didn't have anywhere to go so it was like pretty easy to see um it turned 200 into two million i think they ended up doing five i think someone wrote the description of the attack as 200 to two but the transactions i think they actually got five five million yeah and so they um but then they wrote this thing which was like the most hilarious thing you can read on twitter it was like we're so sorry we we did this because we really wanted to take care of our families um but you know sometimes we have sometimes you have temporary lapses and good judgment and i was like that's amazing i'm never gonna say a bad judgment anymore i'm just gonna say only have temporary lapses of good judgment like it was like i was just drunk one night and like my yeah i broke the whole chain yeah i broke the chain thinking of my family but but i thought the most conference i did learn a lot which is uh chain analysis response time like is like under an hour to like find on some some of these things when you say their response time like to do what oh like you tell them there's like an attacker you show the actresses and they like fan this out to all the exchanges or what oh as in like there they they they can they've they they just track the floor back to flow functions and like have some ideas i mean it couldn't have moved that far right right well you have ibc so you could technically have gone somewhere else okay like you could have gone to edmondson to eat that would have been now that luna is gone there's no no way back to eath other than through atmos um but yeah so uh i thought that was like kind of an interesting thing and so it i think it is actually just like the chain analyses are way better than people realize right right that's like the majority of it and then then then it's like oh it's a known person so then like they get a threatening email that's like so with the with the osmosis it doesn't surprise me that like look you're doing this in plain sight everyone knows who you are you run a business you're part of the community like where are you gonna go on osmosis to hide it's pretty stupid you should have said hey sonny we found the bug please pay me a hundred thousand dollar buck down again like what are you doing this was clearly the right way to handle this look i i it's uh yeah look i'm sure he has a big family but uh and many many lapses but like at least in optimism like it seems like optimism is like fairly liquid on chain like you could just sell it you know turn to ether and then go you know take a tornado or whatever i mean there's there's ways to get rid of it i'd assume so i was surprised that they gave back what was i guess worth like uh because two bucks optimism token i think it's like 80 cents now that was there okay never mind all right i guess i'll give that back to you disclosure optimism investors okay there you go all right so yeah it's 80 cents so that would be what like uh 15 million 14 million whatever something something like they gave back um so yeah it seems surprising to me which tells me that you know maybe uh i don't know if it's honor or if it's just like they're not financially motivated to that degree yeah i mean my sense is like someone had the stats on this but something like i think 20 maybe 40 of all the ethan tornado is like known to be stolen funds it's like a huge percentage and so i think a lot of people are thinking like tornadoes not going to help me because just assume everything's going to blacklist it out like yeah that's a high enough percentage that like how much possible than i believe you have it's like one third chance i don't know it's like well you could always be a beta tester for aztec whenever they launched they just launched something like a day ago yeah no they they unlaunched because uh yeah i think it's next week yeah yeah yeah they unlaunched issues is that a phrase now unlocked well jason says his launch conference you can also have an unlaunched conference i think unlaunched protocol would be hilarious i guess always like deprecate [Laughter] well all right but but also one one other thing about this is like i think this does took to our earlier conversation about like non-native like non-standardized languages even in evm land where things are standardized you can't even get cross chain i'm counting it layer two layer one consistency correct because the execution environments differ and so they like you you get this kind of like weird thing where like yeah technically they're supposed to be running the same execution environment but like the data availability is different and like the transfer notions are somewhat different and i only think that's harder in a like a world of like many languages so that would be my bold case for for like one language winning them all is like if if in the one language within a mall case you still can't get consistency perfectly like how do you hope in like language translation because like that is a really hard problem in sort of computer science in general no it's definitely true it's definitely true but i mean look even if there are multiple languages there aren't going to be that many so i can believe that like look there will be three or four maybe five but i don't i doubt they're gonna be 12 major languages that define you know the major blockchains of the day so one way or another even if you're if you have to deal with pairwise translation it's not really that many that you have to fundamentally solve so i think it's doable in the long run but it there's a lot of wood to chop to get there um okay so the last thing i wanted to discuss today um so you know our favorite topic on the chopping block is regulation as we all know uh and so there was a big bill that was dropped just a couple days ago by cynthia loomis and kirsten gillibrand and it's kind of a it's kind of a landmark bill we haven't really seen a lot of legible proposals for legislation in the us that are like are actually actually actually fully define a framework under which digital assets can be regulated and that's what this is and it's also um bipartisan which is pretty unique because usually you know crypto is like oh the right things to this left thinks this blah blah blah and you can never really get anywhere so um i'll give you i'll give you as a highlight i assume you know we were at consensus when a lot of this dropped so i have to imagine most of us haven't gotten super deep but um here are the highlights first uh sales of crypto that are less than 200 are tax free so if you you know finally you can use your bitcoin to buy coffee so bullish for all these tornadoes cash people who are pulling out like very tiny amounts of money who's doing that i can't even do that with gasoline yes yeah yeah well the tornado deployed elsewhere i guess but okay but if you look at the buckets you have that you can deposit people oftentimes do like multi-withdraw at really small size and so i assume that people using tornado are not the people worried about the taxi something tells me they're probably not yeah they're sharing ironically okay okay they're probably tax loss harvesting is what they're doing um okay so let's go so the the there's a deminimus exemption for taxes um cftc will be the primary regulator of crypto spot markets which is pretty good which is which is great i mean denzel obviously doesn't like us so cftc is a lot better um crypto securities and commodities would be more clearly defined which would put most crypto assets as commodities so crypto securities are things that like pay a dividend or are like more like equity like or they you know whatever um most l1 tokens would be very clearly crypto commodities and crypto commodities would be regulated by the cftc so uh arguably though the l1 token is putting off the old is paying dividends well it's all complicated it's definitely a complicated message they're reading the bill yeah no but they don't know they don't pay dividends they don't pay dividends what what l1 pays dividends well staking guild looks freaking looks like no no you're also locked up you're also paid later like i mean like look you can you can get paid yield for doing work for anything right you can get paid deal for dollars that doesn't make it that that's not that's not getting paid dividends david like in and of itself does not get generate dividends you can do you can enter into a relationship with the protocol for which the protocol will pay you that is that is definitely different than i think i think it's different when the underlying asset in the case of proof of work stuff is energy compute power versus like oh i'm just providing more of the assets i'm just saying like objectively i think you're wrong all right yeah i agree here's why it's not a dividend it would be a dividend if all ether holders got more correct because even in proof of stake you might only have 90 participation or 50 participation the returns are not going to everybody the returns are going to the active network validators not a dividend exactly exactly we're team not a dividend yeah you guys can go hang out with gensler ether commodity i'm on your team even all right great fine um all right uh also um you guys remember this uh that we had that episode with coinbase where coinbase was like hey guys in one of our disclosures we're gonna say that in bankruptcy blah blah blah people freaked out they were like oh my god if coinbase goes bankrupt all of your money is gone so there's a clarification that that's not true and uh you know customer deposits are not uh you know they're they're not reachable in a bankruptcy by uh by creditors and um for companies that raise money in digital asset sales those companies would be required to do bi-annual disclosures about the teams the track record what's going on what the progress is um and uh these would have to be filed regularly by anybody who raises money in the u.s and that actually seemed pretty reasonable to me that seemed like yeah that actually seems like what we should be doing as an industry like now like massari is kind of like one of the places where that sort of thing happens but having it be some kind of public database seems seems honestly pretty great i don't know how many times have you used edgar i've never used one of the world's worst databases i've ever used i believe look it doesn't have to be edgar you can be on chain or something i'm fine with that um but uh that that so those are the those are the high level wait there's also the dow thing right where dao's no there was it was it was more that if you want to get favorable tracks treatment you have to uh incorporate in something but if you're a down you're not if you don't want that you don't have to do that there's also the staking yield uh tax policy so for proof-of-stake systems like ether there was that like unsettled um legal question where somebody sued the irs yes yes because those people right yeah actually basically the bill as i understand it says your tax when you sell it not when you receive it yeah there's a huge bill there's a bunch of other pieces in there there was something else also about the crypto broker stuff that was uh introduced in the previous legislations can be clarified in spill there's a lot to it but that's the high level stuff and so it would create a ton of clarity where currently there's obviously a ton of ambiguity and you've got a lot of regulators fighting for territory um what do you guys think about the broad shape of the bill and uh yeah i guess the other questions well my personal view is that it's fantastic because it addresses some of the longest standing open questions in crypto um i don't expect the bill to just pass in its current form but as the starting point for a conversation at like the legislative level i think it's the best possible starting point i'm sure like all legislation that's gonna get compromised to death crazy things are gonna be added removed tweaked if it goes through it's not gonna look anything like it is proposed today being proposed by some of the more friendliest members of congress yeah um you know but seeing that it's a bipartisan bill is like extremely promising you know right now i mean crypto has generally had republican support but seeing you know a democratic you know co-sponsor who's going to bring other democrats in i think is extremely positive for this space and the fact that you know you see both sides like trying to create proactive legislation to answer all these open questions and all these open questions are the root of why the sec is focused on enforcement and not you know um anything else i i think it's incredibly positive so you know i think it'll take a year to two years for something like this to pass potentially i don't think it's like the immediate agenda of the administration there's really hot burning fires that are taking people's time and attention but if this is where the legislation that will occur starts from i think we should all be excited so what's your over under on how long it takes for this thing to work through the machine so i'm not you know a political expert you know we have consultants who tell us we we uh we also forgot to add uh nothing we say is political advice yeah nothing we say is political advice i was hoping to dish out some political advice today okay what kyle what is your political advice well apparently i'm not allowed to share nothing he says is political advice you're the guest you're allowed to say anything you want we're limited what is political advice how do you act on political advice can i just tell people where they should vote you should tell them to run for office i think that's that's political advice that's political advice exercise your first amendment rights go run for office beautiful beautiful um okay so we have no idea how long it's going to be if i have to put an over under out there i'd say it's like 15 months 15 months so you think next fall is when we see something come on this is [ __ ] crypto you're telling me we're not gonna make a prediction market for this like this is this is what it was this is what the game was made for there will be there will be at some point but um i i think the midterms this year are going to shed a lot of light on how it unfolds you know i think frankly like november is only five months away now and the composition of both the house and senate is going to change potentially significantly and i think the prospects for any crypto legislation are going to change dramatically based on the outcome in november i think you know whether this is right or wrong i think if the republicans pick up a lot of seats you might see the timeline for crypto legislation pulled forward something that does have generally bipartisan support that won't get vetoed it's funny last summer i thought the most important thing that was going to be affecting crypto prices was regulation and now i'm like i don't i don't know i like it almost feels like it doesn't matter cpi relative to background yeah exactly it feels like the only thing that matters is macro and like regulation is like i'll be fine oh i i just we so we've spent a fair bit of time trying to think through this actually i don't think regulation will move prices meaningfully um there's probably speaking three things that can happen um the worst thing that could happen is like try and ban crypto in whatever form possible do you list everything other than bitcoin and doge and litecoin like is kind of like the most extreme version of that right um i think got de-listed by the way this week and in korea why so because they had us apparently the members oh that's oh my god um anywho so um that's like one extreme and this is just u.s centric i'm not commenting elsewhere um that's one thing that could happen i think everyone kind of agrees that's like a sub 1 probability like super super unlikely um the other extreme is nothing happens so basically the status quo just perpetuates indefinitely of like are they securities are they not there's this whole song and dance with the foundations and like the teams are mostly in the u.s and like there's no disclosures and just kind of like everyone just kind of keeps operating and like i think the market generally works there's like abuses and problems but like the market is a whole functions um and the third option is like something in the middle and like this this bill from senator allen from senator gilbrand is like pretty squarely like right there and like they're trying to say look we need some disclosures let's not make this um go going ipo public process with uh dodd-frank and whatever all that other all those other rules are um the public companies have to go through let's reduce disclosure requirements let these teams actually function and operate where you can have a 12-person team that can like have a public token and like be okay and like make some sensible rules around staking gains and diminish transactions like there's really not a fourth option and if you think about the probability extremes of like the the two on the on either end those also seem like one of them seems extremely unlikely uh the other one possibly could happen just as a function of inertia and like statistical bias um but i just generally don't think that like getting disclosure requirements that are reasonable and not too onerous like why is that bad now there's a case that the disclosure requirements are atrocious and screw everything up but i actually don't really think that's the case i i think the higher probability outcome is they're just stupid um like i don't know should compound labs report the same thing as solana labs is the same thing as audience is the same thing as nova labs like yeah probably not um but like they'll be forced to conform to some common standard loosely it'll be like annoying and kind of silly but like that's like not that big of a deal i mean the biggest question is you know will the projects that are six hours old you know conform to the same standards and like all the things that get created over a weekend that you know come out of left field you know versus everything you just named right are generally venture-backed larger yeah established systems well the thing that's also scary about crypto is that a lot of times things that happened over a weekend end up getting hundreds of millions of dollars and become larger than things that were made you know two years ago yeah so that's that's the thing about crypto is that because it's all software you've got these crazy power laws that kick into place and exponential growth in short amounts of time and it's very hard to build a you know a very clear regulatory regime around something that behaves that way so i i look i respect uh i respect the attempt at trying to come up with a framework i'm sure it's going to get bastardized and corrupted over the next couple of years as people play political games with trying to figure out what happens in their auditors or crypto people like like ernst i i've heard that actually the crypto lobbies are really bad um i don't have any particular insight into this but i've heard this a couple times now i i have some insight here and the relations test here will be november 2022 elections midterms um there is a growing belief in dc that crypto money is big like much bigger than previously thought um there's a few packs out there now disclosure multi-coin does donate to some of those um we have donated personal i've done personally senator alumnus center gila brand um and uh there's a chance that you see some really big crypto dollars hit midterms um and if that happens then uh i think dc will actually become a lot more pro-crypto friendly so here's the claim that i've heard the claim that i've heard and again i can't confirm because i don't know a damn thing about how all the stuff works from inside washington but what i've heard is that um crypto people basically think that washington has paid a play and uh it's like the efficacy of your dollars depends a lot on how well you actually understand how the system works and crypto people have a lot of money and very little understanding of how the system works that's like that you remember when everyone used to make fun of tech companies yeah for just like being bad at lobbying absolutely i'm sure there's a learning curve i'm sure there's a learning curve but i feel like tech was not committed to throwing money at it as much like crypto people the velocity of the capital flow is like way faster i think you're also implying too much homogeneity among crypto people i think there's a new class of extremely sophisticated actor um i'll just ping highlight ftx cause like sam is in front of congress like i don't know every two months now and like they're talking about the cftc about derivatives and all these things like they fairly obviously have an extremely sophisticated a nuanced multi-year plan with contingencies left right and right center for everything you can imagine and like they're obviously playing the game at many levels i'm not as close with coinbase but i would assume coinbase is playing a similar game um i can't really speak for any other firms but like that that's happening and it's happening at i think i think what will become apparent although it's not yet apparent at very large dollar scale no look i i believe it and i've been i've been advocating for like a year ago that people are way underspending on on lobbying and like making getting some political representation in dc um it's taking a while obviously crypto's scary so first approximation before this stuff is popular and seems kind of normal and like your kids are using it it's really scary to have you know a bunch of you know silicon valley people with a bunch of money show up and say hey we want to get the laws changed like generally that doesn't that doesn't tend to reflect well and so i i look i i i don't know a damn thing about any of this so i assume that this stuff will get better as people learn and they spend money and they figure out what is actually efficacious and what's not i mean the real question to me though is like how much of a negative impact was luna and tara on like the overall like like well we do we do have to we do have a rule that every episode we have to talk about taren well the way i think about it is like how much money did you have to spend to make like x units of impact in in whatever political metric positive positive political impact pre-terror and post-trauma what's the ratio like how much has changed i actually think it has changed at least like 5x 5x i think 5x so you think that a dollar spent before tara was five x more impactful than a dollar spent for terrorism i would hope that the rush is not that broad the like stable coin things are conflated with securities things have you ever talked to things yeah he's a he's a proud sponsor of a cop i i have donated to senator lomas and gilbrand um i am optimistic that they will not be all the baby will not be thrown out with bath water the whole elizabeth warren suing pulled together or like her right suing pool together i think one of her cronies one yeah well someone who's sure in her who's defending the lawsuits yes um protect e5 yes yes yes but i i just you know i i just generally think like the baby goes out with the bathwater because the thing governments care about is like mainly money laundering and like because because they've done the reductio at absurdum to that nfts don't they don't give a [ __ ] about nfts they only care about anything that looks like money laundering which is stable coins and like base protocol coins they somehow or maybe they'll maybe they'll separate them luna just destroyed value see they didn't help people once when the value goes to zero you can't like can't launder it anymore it's worth nothing that is true that's true that's true i think i mean look i i we were talking about this earlier is that like i don't think that um anybody on capitol hill has any idea what the hell one is much less that luna has anything to do with it i think kyle said the same thing to me but i i i just generally think i i'm trying to just estimate this ratio this like damage ratio well i i think i think the the primary um the the primary victims of the the program that is now facing crypto is going to be on defined stable coins i think that's pretty clear right that's the word cloud at the center of what terra was about and so i think it's going to be a rough year for those parties and i think they're likely you know to whatever degree this regulation or this legislation gets altered before it ends up getting passed almost certainly it's going to find some way to flagellate anybody who's doing something that looks more like tara also do do you think um fractionalized nfts survive the do you think they'll i mean they're so small that nobody's gonna i don't know though the cftc loves talking about them given how else do they yes a lot with the total market cap or fractionalized nfc is like like under under investment okay yeah well including doge yeah it's small but yeah yeah but it is it's one of these things that regulators are like glommed on to because they understand it right it's one of the few things in fts they can understand it's like oh you have this big thing that you put into little pieces and it's like i remember that yeah exactly yeah security we gotta know that word yeah exactly i heard i heard bad things happen once when we did that so anyway all right gents well we're up on time thank you so much kyle for coming and hanging out with us thanks you all for visiting yeah this has been this has been amazing signing off everybody peace out bye
