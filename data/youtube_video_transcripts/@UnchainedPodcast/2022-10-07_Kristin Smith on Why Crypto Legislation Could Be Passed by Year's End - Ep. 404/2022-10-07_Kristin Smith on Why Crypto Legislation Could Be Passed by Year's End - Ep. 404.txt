director of the blockchain association welcome Kristen it's great to be here Laura the last several months in crypto have been pretty dramatic there's been an epic number of collapses there's also been some unprecedented enforcement actions and we'll start time at one of them uh tornado cash from your conversations in Washington do you think as many people in the crypto industry believe that Regulators didn't understand the repercussions of what they were doing when they sanctioned a series of smart contracts or as some people might say do you think that they just plain messed up I you know that's an interesting question I I think that there are a handful of people with an O fact that understood what was going on but I think that this was a decision that was really driven by other actors in Washington namely like the state department and Main treasury that wanted to do something about North Korea and this seemed like a logical thing so I don't think it was a question of hey we have this um you know sort of complex policy that we want to create how can we go about doing that within and you know with some sort of sanctions I I really think it was a broader sort of national security issue however it has obviously tapped into something that um you know is is we think you know pretty problematic um what they've done and um is going to require quite a bit of work to undo it oh and when you say undo like what exactly does that mean the action I think that that is a really important step and it's great to see again they're not actually bringing the challenge but they're funding it um the fact that they're backing that I think is is really important um you know the blockchain association we have a general license request in with ofax so that lawful users of tornado cash can you know if granted uh go in and and get their tokens back but you know it's just it's just a lot of work to work through the administrative options that are available um and then obviously the the court option as well essentially like parts of this can be undone but maybe this idea of the notion that you could sanction a series of smart contracts will not be reversed yeah well we'll have to see I mean we'll have to see how the litigation goes right I mean I think that's that's the challenge that we're at um I do think that we need to be having a broader conversation around Financial privacy in Washington and that is something that I think Congress will want to get involved with at some point but the challenge is when you have you know sort of these National Security arguments coming in where they're worried about North Korea and North Korea is a big enemy it becomes a lot a lot harder to have um sort of a a dispassionate discussion about it and so um so yeah this is this is something I think we're going to be dealing with the consequences of for for a while um and yeah we'll certainly you know do everything we we can um uh to to support the litigation effort you know we will be filing an amicus brief um on that front but um but yeah it's it's a it's a real unfortunate turn of events I just obviously this week with the news about North Korea launching some missile over Japan or something like clearly um clearly there is cause for concern so um yeah I guess we'll have to see how all this plays out because obviously in this scenario it does seem that in a way the crypto industry has been sort of like collateral damage um one question I had for you is you've probably seen that there's some consternation now in the ethereum community over how one of the relays under proof of stake flashbots is complying with sanctions at the base layer and about 40 of the blocks now are being validated using the flashbots relays so that's kind of a huge percentage of blocks that are being censored do you get the sense that the government wants compliance to um go that deep meaning that it needs to be enforced at the base layer yeah no I think there are some in government that do want to see it go that deep right um and um I think it's a conversation that is is emerging it's not one that's been you know sort of fully vetted yet but but yeah I think that um you know when you're dealing with with sanctions when you're dealing with anti-money laundering efforts like like the the people who are working on those take that responsibility incredibly seriously and and you know to the extent that those can be you know built in I think I think they would like to see that now whether or not that should be the case I think is is more of a policy question but but yeah I certainly think there are those within government that that want to see it go as deep as possible and so treasury has now issued some guidance on how to get your coins out of tornado cash but why have they not issued kind of details around how far the compliance needs to go like you know whether these base layer participants need to enforce them yeah no I mean I think I I think a lot of that has paused with the the lawsuit that has been filed I think that on on one hand I think it's great to see that that is moving and you know uh that it's being challenged but it does make it more difficult to have a dialogue with them when there is active litigation going on and so you know I do think some additional guidance um and some additional frequently asked questions would be very helpful I'm just not optimistic that we're going to get that now that the litigation is out there all right so now let's turn to ukidao which was another case where the industry had that sort of similar reaction where they sort of felt like that what the government had done suing this Dao didn't make sense since it wasn't a centralized entity and I wondered do you think that the cftc did that because they wanted to make this point that decentralization is not a defense yeah I mean I I think you know the facts of this case aren't aren't great right because if you take b0x the sort of centralized entity um you know if you are trading leveraged products they're allowing retail customers to trade Leverage leverage derivatives products in the US like you have to register right like that is um uh and also just leverage retail Commodities I should say um so you have to register with the cftc like that is that is very clear under the law and so what I think ukidao you know was sort of touted as a way to get around that requirement and so I think that that made this a particularly like strong Target for the cftc um obviously it poses massive questions all right because you have individual governance token holders who are um uh you know who are now liable for the actions of the Dao where there was you know I don't think that anybody who um you know engaged in voting and in governance like thought that that was going to be the case and so um you know it's going to be interesting to see how this one plays out um you know and and I guess defense of the cftc they don't really have a lot of tools to go about doing this right like this this regulation by enforcement is really the biggest tool that they have and so I I think this is going to be a very important case but but what we do need though is to come up with some sort of solution to provide limited liability to Dao's and some sort of legal status and so um it's unfortunate that that this is all being done again through sort of this enforcement action um but I do think there will be litigation around it I think there's a couple different organizations that are that have um you know stepped up and said that they're willing to help fund this and fight this um and so I think it's going to be a very a very interesting interesting question but yeah that this was certainly the most aggressive move we've we've seen in terms of Regulation by enforcement from the cfdc we're very used to seeing this come out of the SEC but I think everybody was was really caught off guard with the cftc but but I think it goes to like sort of this broader point that I want to make is that you know if there was really clear guidance that agencies could give already whether it be the cftc or ofac or Vincent or others like they've done that already right like that guidance is out the door what we're seeing now is agencies are sort of testing and playing around the limits of the authority that they have and so whether it be with tornado cash or with Uki Dao or even with some of the cases over at the SEC the grayscale lawsuit or or Ripple we're starting to fight these battles out in in the courtroom it's really not the ideal place to be doing this like in theory you'd rather have a more sort of organized open process but I think it's really great that the community is pushing back um and is willing to fund the litigation to to challenge when we when we think agencies step too far because it's our right to do that and and I think it's it's great to see companies in particular that are stepping up to to fund these efforts but what we really need is legislation that would be that would be the real way to get things done um and we may see some progress on that this year as well yeah so in a moment we are going to talk a little bit more about potential for legislation but also about the SEC um the first a quick word from the sponsors to make this show possible to swap crypto to choose among

week especially in the mainstream media with a settlement against Kim Kardashian for promoting what the SEC said was a crypto security without giving proper disclosures and you've probably seen people in the crypto industry have been criticizing the settlement saying that it was really more of a publicity stunt whereas the SEC sort of missed major uh things that have brought harm to Everyday consumers like Celsius and you know some of these other like recent collapses that we've seen and so I was curious for your opinion why do you think the SEC pursued the settlement with Kim Kardashian but you know didn't really do much about Celsius I yeah I mean I I agree that the Kim Kardashian situation was was obviously a press play right I mean that was something that was picked up across news outlets across um uh you know mainstream news um big on social media I mean I mean that was uh obviously like I think a publicity stat I mean Gary gunzer was on Squawk Box within minutes of of uh of the announcement of of the action but yeah this leads to this troubling Trend right it's it's so basically what they're saying you know that is ethereum access the security it's like okay well at least they're alleging that right and now that we have the settlement we don't know if a court would agree with the fact that ethereum Max is a security or not right and so um I think that this this continues to kind of put more uncertainty out there um and this isn't you know the right way to make policy I think if if we had Clarity on what was a security or not then I think the advertising team that works with Kim Kardashian probably would have complied with the laws right and said you know not only like hashtag ad but all the disclosures that are required for her for her to do something like that or maybe she just wouldn't have touted it at all um so yeah I think you know if it is indeed a security then yes she was clearly like in in violation of the anti-touting provisions because she'd have the proper disclosure but the bigger problem is this settlement doesn't give us any sense as to whether or not it is a security and and what the legal reasoning behind that is so you know it just puts more uncertainty out into the marketplace so um but yeah I mean Gary gunsler had a video he was on squawk he was this was clearly a publicity stuff as we were just discussing there has been this huge question over the last several years over which tokens or Securities in which our Commodities and there are a number of bills that have been introduced in Congress that attempt to answer this question I think most of them propose the cftc will be the default regulator but I was curious like which of these bills do you see as having the greatest chance of making it into law and why yeah no so this is this is what we're spending most of our time on right now at the blockchain association um there have been several bills uh all of which uh point to the cftc to be the regulator for uh digital commodity spot markets the one that's getting the most traction right now is the digital Commodities consumer protection act the dccpa and this is legislation that was introduced by the chair and ranking member of the Senate agriculture committee there was a hearing in September on this legislation and I think there is a very good chance that this is enacted in into law before the end of the year um there's some issues with the bill that we're working through uh right now that um you know I would we would definitely want to see fixed prior to anything becoming uh being signed into law but I think that um we expect this bill to go to markup and committee right after the election in in the middle of November and the leadership offices have um thought about potentially attaching this bill to either the National Defense authorization act or the Omnibus or whatever sort of year-end packages are going and so the timeline has um has greatly sped up for for this legislation getting done and and what this legislation would do is it defines you know digital commodity platforms and um and digital commodity trading facilities Brokers dealers custodians and requires these entities to register with the CFT see and and with registering they you would have you know sort of all of the sort of anti-abusive trading practices disclosures of conflicts um you'd have the you know cyber security programs like all of the things that you would want to have for regulation um I think that the big issue that's outstanding there right now is that um defy kind of gets wrapped up in this regulation and so we've been working to try to figure out some sort of process around how to apply some of the core principles in the regulation to different actors in The defy ecosystem in a way that makes sense and so that's kind of where the discussions land right now but but yeah this there is a very real possibility that this gets signed into law by the end of the year and and so this is this is what we're spending most of our time on right now wow I'm just uh a little floored actually that you're saying this I I guess I hadn't heard it before I don't know if that had been known before but I feel like what I'd been hearing for a long time was that stable coin legislation was the kind of crypto legislation that would be likely to be passed first so what's the status on that yeah um so so yeah so yes fall in Washington and I think if we had had this conversation two months ago I would have had the exact opposite um the staplecoin legislation um this is an effort that uh chairwoman Waters and Patrick McHenry uh who's a ranking member of the House Financial Services committee uh as well as the treasury Department have been engaged in discussions for months now um there have been a lot of hearings on stable coins and what we're hearing right now is that those talks have essentially sort of stalled um and that we don't anticipate that becoming law um you can talk to different people they might give you different opinions but but yeah our latest information is that that's probably something that's going to be picked up again in 2023 uh that being said I do think there is a window if the digital commodity consumer protection act gets attached it may it may make sense to do something on stable coins at the same time I think from our perspective at the blockchain association the language of the staplecoin bill that at least our understanding of how it's written is actually pretty good I think it provides a really good framework for you know dollar back stable coins and and their regulation um there had been an issue around decentralized stable coins but we largely um have that in a place that's that's workable going forward so yeah much less optimistic on staplecoin this year but again that could change if if the dccpa does continue to to gain momentum and get attached I could see the conversations you know reopening I I would say in general you know the end of a congress like this lame duck session is an incredibly special time for congress like this is when this is when the the deals happen right because you have this time pressure of the congress's ending you've got you know the election is over you've got people that are going to be cycling out um and you know everything kicks off Anew in 2023 and so with that sort of deadline that time pressure people are able to make deals and I think this is one of those issues you know crypto policy in general that would be a pretty big bipartisan win um especially with all the market events that we've had this year you know Congress would be able to say hey there were these issues and now we did something to address it even if like the the even if it's a little little bit like apples and oranges like you know the high level messaging is that you know we brought regulation to crypto and and I think it's something that they really want to get done um but yeah there's certainly some issues that are outstanding with the bill um I'm a little bit uh on the fence because this is a good plan or a bad plan but the reality is this is this is the this is where we're at and so we're working right now to try to make as many improvements as uh you know with the committee staff as possible um uh so that when the next draft is released it'll hopefully be better than the one that was introduced and when you say that there are still some questions about D5 what are those questions well the question is um right now it's not clear that the regulation for D5 would be any different than for C5 right and and if you have just sort of one regulatory regime for those two worlds right for the central if decentralized exchanges need to comply with the same regulations the centralized exchanges then there's going to be elements of those it will be impossible to comply right because it is decentralized and so we have to figure out like what are what are the appropriate core principles that should apply to D5 that you know might be different than you would have in a centralized context the I think in an Ideal World we would be doing what Europe is doing right where they they did Mika and then they're coming back and doing D5 later uh this this committee this the Senate agriculture committee uh does not want to save D5 for later but they but they have been open to making sure we find the right process so that any regulation of different actors in this community Community is is tailored and appropriate right um I mean like what we saw with with ukidao is if you're a governance token holder you know you're supposed to be registered with the cftc as an individual and you're supposed to have like a BSA plan like that doesn't make sense right and so we need to make sure that the cftc if the law of passed is given the flexibility to say all right this applies this doesn't apply and and to study it first right like there hasn't been a single federal study on defy there hasn't been a single Congressional hearing on defy the cftc hasn't held any meetings or around tables on D5 and so we don't want to rush super quickly to regulate this space when nobody has actually thought about what the problems are what the risks are and what the best solutions could be so so yeah we want to make sure we get we get that fixed um and and we're actively um working to try to do that there's some other problems I think with the bill too it's sort of a missed opportunity to answer this secure Securities Clarity question that we were talking about earlier you know that might be a battle we have to save for another day Oh Oh I thought though if it were going to make the cftc the develop default regulator then that sort of settles or largely settles it but you're saying it doesn't no well the way are ether I should say as being included in the definition of digital commodity and so that would pretty clearly put those two at the cftc but for everything else there would still be sort of this open question and their their Securities are sort of carved out of the definition of digital Commodities so Gary Gensler could still assert that something is a security uh and then therefore it would need to you know be regulated by the SEC so yeah this this does not solve really what is like the core question of this industry but I do think it does help in that right now the question of whether something is a security or a commodity has very high stakes because if it is a security has to be registered at the SEC and there's all these disclosures Etc right lots of regulations it's a commodity there's no Market regulation no disclosures of any kind and so I think by having a strong role for the cftc then you know the question of is it a security or not is a little bit less high stakes it's more what is the type of you know regulation that we need what is the type of information that investors need um in order to uh make informed decisions and and you know I think I think that conversation gets a little bit easier to have um if if the cftc has a strong role to play all right well we managed to cover a lot of meaty topics in a very short period of time so I really really appreciate that you uh took the time to hang out with us yeah no great great to be here Laura yeah we'll have to come back and we can go we could do a whole show on any one of these questions so oh my god seriously yeah all right well thanks again for coming on Unchained all right thanks don't forget next up is the Weekly News recap

some hot topics he said he knows the legal risks of his tweets and he also stated that the reason he hasn't returned to Korea yet doesn't necessarily have to do with the fact that the charges are
