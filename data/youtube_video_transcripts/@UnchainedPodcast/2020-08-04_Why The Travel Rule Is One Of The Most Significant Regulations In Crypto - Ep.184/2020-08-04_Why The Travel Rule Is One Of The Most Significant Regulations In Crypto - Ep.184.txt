consulting welcome dave and sean hi hi laura hello dave hey laura great to be with you before we start disclosure that ciphertrace has been a sponsor of my shows to begin let's have each of you explain what you do and how you came to work in crypto dave do you want to start sure be happy to um laura as you know i'm ceo of ciphertrace we are a company that helps make cryptocurrency safe and compliant our customers are banks their cryptocurrency exchanges and their government agencies including regulators and law enforcement and uh you know i got into crypto well quite some time ago in the early days of bitcoin well actually if i recall i believe you kind of got into digital currency well before bitcoin even existed can you talk a little bit about that i did yeah i got interested in cryptocurrency in 1999 i would say as sort of you know as the cypher punk movement was kind of starting to trail off a little bit and i got to go to the early uh financial uh cryptography conferences so i was at the one in 2000 on anguilla i got to meet the early folks at digicash uh david chalm i got to meet the e-gold guys who were building a gold-backed digital currency mondex which at the time was was uh was being promoted by mastercard and also the zero knowledge guys from montreal who eventually that technology is now some of the foundational technology for zero knowledge proofs that are used in c cash great and so then can you just bring us up to how it is that you started cypher choice sure so i got interested in bitcoin in 2011. so a little late to the game but i did start tracking and reporting how the price of bitcoin related to cryptocurrency crimes primarily break-ins into exchanges um but there were some other ones as well and you could see a linear correlation between the price of bitcoin it would drop 30 40 the day after a major crypto theft and i would report that every year at the electronic crime conference so i started back then um we were doing some early mining as well building custom mining rigs liquid cooling that kind of stuff as a hobby you know you make a few tens of bitcoins you know 100 bitcoin that kind of thing back then in 2015 i uh i had finished i sold a couple of security companies and fintech companies and um i was presenting on bitcoin and bitcoin security and effectively i had a customer come up and say hey we would like you to build this we said well okay yep great so we got into it in 2015 with an initial customer was a government customer who wanted to help find um criminals effectively but from there we've really grown the company and the technology to help cryptocurrency exchanges with compliance um working with regulators on compliance and more recently working with financial institutions so that they can help validate cryptocurrency companies and help expand the banking relationships between crypto companies and the banks because it's clear these are merging and they're both i think very symbiotic worlds that are going to help drive crypto forward in a big way and sean what about you can you explain what you do and also your backgrounds and how you came to work in crypto well i i've always thought of myself as the methuselah of uh bitcoin but i just realized dave you you beat me by two years so i i my career is 48 49 years in i.t in fact going back to the era of steam computing probably and i have been largely involved in security and information security through my career until i finished my corporate career i guess around 2012-13 i started to get interested in this new use case for crypto pretty much a bit like dave i guess started getting involved in in meetups this was uh where i was living at the time in the united kingdom uh and suddenly before i knew it because of my more recent then recent experience in the regulated space folks were asking me for advice sort of one foot in the old regulated world understanding that and a lot of startups who wanted to understand how they might be impacted um going forward but from there i got involved in public policy work in the uk in whitehall and westminster and then in the european uh parliament in brussels and from there i was uh tempted away from being in the uh from being a poacher to becoming a game keeper i was asked by the government of gibraltar to architect the um what has then become the regulatory framework that i architected uh came into force in the beginning of 2018 so the idea was to do it just for virtual currencies but during the the period of architecting we opened that up to to to cover a broader range blockchain so it became a dlt provider license and i guess today you would find analogies between the way we defined it then a dlt provider and what is now known as a vasp in this current vat of regulated world and so um that came into force other countries then started to follow suit and in 2018 in august 18 i sorry august 19 i my tenure as a public servant came to an end i started to approach retirement with that i picked up the mantle of being a poacher once more and came back into the private sector and uh x-ray is now working uh with governments with public authorities such as regulators and financial intelligence units in the public sector but also working with vast in the in the private sector and really working around regulatory policy and the whole area of operationalizing regulation uh and we're a team of uh of six all former regulators now uh uh all former poachers who are now a merry band of poachers so at the beginning of this episode i did talk about how the subject for today's episode will be the travel rule and i think this is one of those topics that is bringing into focus one of the main fears that the cryptocurrency industry or really community maybe more have about how the space will develop which is regulation and this is kind of an on-the-ground implementation of a new regulation that i think will vastly change how people transact in cryptocurrency or at least what happens on the back end when they do um and probably also frankly will drive changes in behavior or at least um drive some of the evolution and and also the technology that is used to uh to perform cryptocurrency transactions so um just to give people the lay of the land here because we're going to be using a lot of terms that some people will never have heard yet um including such as the travel rule as i mentioned um but let's maybe just give the high level overview and define some terms so you mentioned uh the fitfatf financial action task force we talked about the travel rule um you also sean did bring up the term already virtual asset service provider or vasp so can why don't we just define these terms so people know what they are going forward and then we'll dive into more detail let's first of all look at the financial action test for spatter fatigue is a an intergovernmental um body that has its origins uh oh more than 30 years ago it was set up by what was then the the g7 or g8 now the g20 and it was set up specifically um at the behest of the few major nations that saw a problem uh with uh drug trafficking and felt that if they could address the source of funds the flow of funds i should say the movement of funds they could um somehow beneficially uh impact this seemingly intractable problem of drug trafficking and that's the origins of this thing so it was set up as a body as an international standards body to set the rules for anti-money laundering that was it those were its origins and those rules have been updated a few times and the remit of the organization has been expanded so now that after 9 11 that was expanded to include countering terrorist financing uh and more recently uh countering the prolife the financing for the of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction a very catchy sort of title but a very clear objective there and of course now it has an impact on money laundering that's associated with not just drug trafficking and uh terrorist financing and so forth but it also has an impact on those who um are involved in human trafficking on those who are involved in uh trafficking of of uh animals and and and so on so the remit has has has widened over time it should perhaps be seen as an organization that although it's um it's got a title of its own it has its own secretariat it's really made up of its members and those members are countries and they're the 39 major countries of uh of the world were 37 countries and two groupings of countries such as the european uh commission and it's involved in um setting the rules not just for those 39 members but the anti-money laundering rules for some 205 countries around the world this is through a kind of extended network of organizations so in effect pretty much every country in the world is required to follow those standards those standards they may be called the fat of recommendations but as i have called it before they're really recommendations with consequences so countries have to follow them and you could think of it as a kind of quasi-treaty organization setting those rules and it sets those rules for for banks for financial institutions for other kinds of industries such as casinos or lawyers or accounting firms real estate firms and so forth but it also um now has clarified it did so in october 2018 clarified that its rules its standards also applied to virtual assets and virtual asset service providers and earlier when you said there are consequences for countries that don't enforce it is it primarily financial or economic consequences that they face i mean it used to run a system of country blacklists in other words those countries that didn't comply with the standards and that would make it difficult for example for banks in those countries to do business with banks in those countries that did comply with the standards um it it enforces if you like its standards by a process of peer review the countries um periodically go and assess each other to really two two things firstly whether they've got the technical means in other words whether they follow the letter of the recommendations that they've got the laws in place and the powers and so forth to um to enforce uh and also how effective they are in other words you may have the laws but do actually you know make that stuff happen and it carries out those assessments uh currently in a sort of 10-year cycle and you can pretty much assume that every country is assessed once every 10 years on its uh how it complies and how effective it is at complying with those rules okay and so now let's talk to let's talk about the travel rule because this is what's going to i think set in motion quite a bit of change across the industry so what is the travel rule well let's uh let let's understand one thing first of all the travel rule is just one part of one of 40 recommendations so it's by no means the the only thing that is affecting vasps and just to be clear about it but it is a vast that's a pretty broad definition that's been added but in the main think about exchanges think about custodians custodial wallet providers for example but it does cover a range of other activities essentially anyone who is intermediating in in the virtual asset ecosystem and virtual assets really go beyond just cryptocurrencies again it's another wide one of those wide definitions and would it apply to staking providers because i believe staking is going to become a much bigger part of the industry in the coming years the the short answer to that is maybe they're not defined specifically but depending on their role and their function it may well have that they may well be considered a a service provider yeah and then what either types of companies or transactions would not be covered by the travel rule like i know for with tax purposes there was a question at a certain time about whether or not crypto to crypto transactions would be taxed in the same way that crypto fiat is there any distinction for things like that or like you know what what falls within the purview and what falls outside so so there's no distinction between fiat crypto crypto fiat on the one hand and cryptocrypto on the other um all kinds of those intermediate functions uh are activities that come into scope of fatima's broad set of recommendations so pretty much all the 40 recommendations now apply to bass and that includes things like having to be licensed or registered not only in one's home jurisdiction but also in potentially in jurisdictions and which one operates that's i think something that's not yet fully fully uh appreciated across the industry because different countries will apply this differently think of the fact of rules the fact of recommendations as a baseline so countries will and already are starting to put their own gold plating to those baseline rules but looking just at your question around the travel rule the travel is is is not unique to crypto it's not unique to virtual assets and bus this is the same rule that is applied to banking and financial institutions where if you imagine transferring money across borders your bank in one country is required to gather some information hold that information but also to transfer for that information if you like or certain information certain mandated information to travel with the transaction to the institution at the receiving end the beneficiary yet and essentially that is that base rule has simply been widened out to include transactions between vasts and what is the information that has to be provided well there's certain required information such as identifying the originator of the transaction and that has to be verified information so that's essentially kyc'd information from the originating vasp the sending bas if you like about its client its customer uh and also details and and that's including things like name potentially their national identifier maybe a passport number for example maybe their address and not necessarily all of those things but enough to identify who that person might be and and that has to be verified in relation to the sender the originator and also information about who the intended beneficiary is although that doesn't have to be verified by the originating vesp and that information has to travel now in the traditional world of bank transfers um messages are sent between banking institutions and so it's very easy for that additional information that's required to travel with the instruction to make a payment but in crypto of course it doesn't work like that the transfer of value happens differently on the blockchain uh and well hey there's nowhere that you can just append that information nor i suggest would it be wise to do so so that's presented immediately some very significant challenges for the industry those are challenges which maybe we'll talk about later on but the industry has certainly come together to to start to resolve and in short order of time it hasn't been given a lot of time to to do this yeah and what is the deadline dave do you know well there's no specific deadline so every country sets its own regulations so it's going to be country by country based on their timelines and how they interpret the regulatory guidance from the fatif so for example in the united states says that since 2015 or thereabouts every cryptocurrency company should have been in compliance already so they would say that they have you've been given a grace period of four to five years where we haven't come after you it was mentioned in the rippled um issue back in several years ago but it wasn't the main focus of that investigation and uh and order but it was mentioned at the end but if you talk to finson in the united states they would say that every cryptocurrency in the united states has been under this regulation for at least five years in switzerland it's already in place although it goes far further than um the requirements in the united states to include personal transfers in and out of exchanges and vasps singapore is starting enforcement actions as well so they say we'll look at it it takes it back now and you have to do it but so there's no specific global time frame it's really when countries start to um adopt it integrated into their regulations another example is the united kingdom they intend to do it but it is not it is not regulated at this time with the fca and just to understand a little bit more about which transactions will be covered by this rule let's say i'm a customer at one exchange like gemini i send money to my friend and they want it sent to their kraken account and also fyi uh disclosure kraken was a sponsor of my show then the exchanges will send the info but if i let's say that i'm a customer gemini but i send it to my friend's self-custodial wallet then no information gets sent and if so how does gemiini know who the recipient how does gemini know that one of them is going to you know this other custodial wallet and that or in the case of the other transaction that that's not a custodial wallet yes so the this is one of the large technical problems that need to be solved so how do i know for across all virtual currencies hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of virtual currencies and chains how do i know um whether it's a personal wallet or uh or um a custodial wallet so that's first one um do i know i have to send it or not and um same on the inbound so when i get the transaction do i know that it came from a personal wallet or do i have to wait for this information to arrive to me from some other vasp or exchange what have you to come in so that is one of the challenges another challenge is and then you know there's a lot of technical detail around it so how do you do it without creating a global list of every address that belongs to every exchange so preserving privacy is a big issue that we've been working on we believe privacy is is of a dramatic importance you know this simple idea is well we'll just create a database or a blockchain of everybody this is not in or for various reasons a good idea and then you have other problems around how do i know who's of aspen how do i know who isn't and what country are they in and how do i stop ones from spoofing each other so that i can reap all of the data pretend to be a vast who hasn't signed up yet get all the customer data from other people so there's a quite a number of security and privacy issues that have to be dealt with and of course it has to be cross-chained it has to be global and so these are the technical challenges that combined with the regulatory that you know we've been working on as an industry okay so i just want to make sure the audience has caught on essentially anytime there's a transaction between two custodians meaning two exchanges or two wallets that are both custodial wallets then this information will be sent and if at you know either for the sender or the recipient that it's someone transacting using their own private keys managing their own keys then the information will not be sent but then i also want to make sure so it sounds like depending on the jurisdiction that the types of information being sent will differ and it sounds like you know your identity is a key piece of it and who you're transacting with is also a key piece but then in terms of other things like when you said in switzerland that they also include your transaction history a little bit or something uh that's no they don't include transaction history but they're extending it to um self-custodial wallets where you have to make declarations about who you are so they've taken it beyond fast to vasp they're stretching the boundary to look at you know extending it to more self-custodial wallets which is you know challenging and obviously not a great not a great thing in my opinion and and actually seemingly out of character for the famous book of switzerland from uh 11 or 12 years ago yes all right so okay but in but in terms of the basics it's who you are who you're transacting with and i'm presuming the amount of the transaction the date stuff like that correct and a transaction id so that you can correlate it to the blockchain transaction right one sort of addition to that i i think it goes beyond just custodial wallets although that is the easiest way to think about it if you've got some sort of intermediary function at the other end or one or other end then you're you're effectively caught if there is an intermediary at both ends so there's got to be a vast raw definition of a vast think about every kind of financial intermediary in the traditional world and you kind of got the analogy there so it it probably is more than just exchange well it is more than just exchanges and custodial wallet providers um and uh and there has to be a vast but at either end that's that's the baseline requirement so if it's vast to user individual uh or user to er to vasp or or it's a peer-to-peer user-to-user then that's outside the scope but if there's an inventory there it's called is there any minimum transaction threshold or is this for any transaction even it's for a dollar or something well potentially it could be for even if it's a dollar the rules are that information has to be captured uh about a customer so essentially a customer has to be kyc to some degree there are degrees of of of how much kyc is done depending on on value and risk and a whole set of factors but um that has to be done at the start of a what's known as a business relationship essentially if you open the account you sign up with someone that could be could constitute a the start of a business relationship and if if you've started that business relationship you've got to be kyc you may never perform a transaction subsequently clearly of course if you don't perform a transaction no information has to to be transferred there are provisions which say well if it's a one-off and what's known as an occasional transaction if it's a one-off you haven't signed up you're just performing a single transaction um then there is a threshold which interestingly for crypto is set by fat of lower than it is for most other sectors but essentially anything that's below a thousand dollars or a thousand euros has a one-off transaction where there's no sort of pre-sign up no commencement of a business relationship then then it would fall outside but it's up to countries they can stipulate lower values or even a zero value so it's quite feasible that a particular country and there clearly are some who are going beyond the baseline and saying you know we want it for everything well and then there's also countries like the united states who go above and say it's 000 us dollars it's not a thousand euros we where they're setting their limit higher saying you know if it's under 3 000 then you don't have to do this okay well that's a little bit more um generous or comforting probably to a lot of people in the crypto community um so in a moment we're going to talk about how all this information will be sent because as dave did allude to it brings up a lot of questions around security and privacy but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible looking for a place to connect with thought leaders innovators and blockchain enthusiasts of every level welcome to tquorum a weekly

king papa john's and domino's download the crypto.com app today and enjoy these offers till the end of september back to my conversation with dave jevins and sean jones so as we discussed earlier there's a lot of sensitive information being sent and it's a lot of valuable information so i'm curious to know if and as we talked about this is basically replicating what the banking system already does so what do banks use and is that a system that crypto companies could use or you know what options are they looking at so banks today typically for international funds transfer use the swift system so that means effectively any kind of instruction whether it's payment instructions but also stock clearing on an international basis uh go through swift there are over 4 000 banks directly connected to it but there are also corporations as well so you can join swift as a private corporation they have a whole set of messaging standards in fact you can even move check images and things if people are still using checks so they have all these messaging standards and i would i feel like this um approach is really trying to mimic that although i think nobody in the crypto industry wants a centralized solution could you use swift i suppose so but it will incur a lot of cost um because every message is not free it's expensive um you still have to have directories how to look people up does this address belong to this exchange or to a um a privately uh custodian wallet so all of that stuff would still be an issue um i'm not sure everyone wants all of you know every crypto transaction to be routed through either um manassas which is near dulles airport in the united states or through lahore in belgium because that's where every message goes through if you're on the swift system we think that a much more of a peer-to-peer type of model which will help contain privacy contain breaches make it more attack resilient as a better model and so what are some of the different standards right now when i was doing research for this i came across so many uh safer trace has your open source solution teresa coinbase is about to come out with a white paper for a peer-to-peer joint bulletin board maintained by exchanges which has participation from some of the other big exchanges like gemini bittrex and kraken and the i also saw bitco has an api travel rule solution no to bene i just launched to to provide such a thing coolbitx also did so ing is proposing something then there's these other kind of like open standards that i found intervasp and openvasp um why don't we actually why don't we just do this dave do you want to just tell us about teresa and then we can talk a little bit about some of these other exchanges or these other solutions yeah so i think that in my view there's about four different what i would call open efforts that are um that are going on so there's inter bass which sean can speak to uh quite a bit because she was on the leadership team of that which is um developing messaging formats so what do the messages actually look like that contain the information and i think pretty much i would say most people in the industry have standardized around that as a standard for the message contents then you have the overall message flow which is how do you discover is is it a private wallet is a is it a custodial wallet where are they how do i communicate with them and there's in my view there's there's pretty much two and maybe two and a half open efforts there one is the trisa which is the travel information sharing architecture it's i mean we've contributed to it but there's you know every time we have a call there's 36 companies every week working on it so there's it's it's not a cyber trace product or anything it's an open initiative that you know we're helping with the other one is openvasp which has been led primarily by bitcoin swiss um so that is again looking at an open methodology for exchanging this information for doing peer discovery and having a directory and um we work very closely so the truth working group the open best working group work together and we're working on interoperability of the messaging standards and the directory and how those would integrate i would say a third one is bip 75 so that is being promoted by a private company called netkey but it is an open standard definition that's been around for some period of time and when you say 75 you mean a bitcoin improvement proposal correct oh yes yes so that's been around for several years now um was not designed to solve this problem but has been the people have been working on it justin and others at netkey have been working on it to um to to move it into this direction and to build that those to me or the what i would consider what i know of the open efforts where you have multiple companies and then there's the coinbase one which is i'm really u.s centric u.s centric exchanges does not deal with the global problem of discovery was initially a peer-to-peer mechanism but to try to get some prototype out they've gone to a private bulletin board system to publish addresses so i don't think it's a scalable global solution and they would never say it is they're saying we want a proof of concept to show us regulators that we're doing something that we can solve this problem in the united states you know it's not designed at this point as a global solution that may change but that's not where it is right now everything else you mentioned as far as i understand are private companies who have built proprietary solutions that are closed um many countries specific like cool bit x's really larged it largely aimed at the asian market and they'll if they'll tell you they want to be the swift of the space they make no bones about it they want to run every message through them um shift has another model which uh is is pretty cool and they're working on interoperability with some of these open standards but again you know run by a private company and many of these other ones that you mentioned are private company specific things so what i think the takeaway is several really open efforts around standards interoperability and then private companies offering the things in their own country and therefore there will not be one solution there will have to be interoperability it's you know it's going to be a free market which is great because anyone who wants to build solutions can but it does mean that for the foreseeable future there are going to be 5 10 15 who knows solutions out there which means interoperability is going to be critical this thing is not going to start next year and suddenly be solved we have other issues which we call the sunrise problem we'll talk about that later if you wish well yeah why don't we just start with the first one about how there isn't going to be one single solution and how actually some of these um basically are more decentralized some of them are seem more kind of crypto and then some of them see more you know traditional kind of vc startupy just from a logistical standpoint it seems like it would be pretty burdensome on countries if there were you know five or several different solutions that they had to use right because well you tell me so let's see so let's say that um you know i'm coinbase and i'm sending to or that one of my customers wants to send to their friend who uses kraken then uh kraken maybe uses let's say a different travel role solution provider than coinbase so then how how does that information get shared do they just have to both adopt the other's solution to or or what the reality is that a vast i mean it's not i think so much troublesome for countries it's probably not troublesome at all for countries they they they're agnostic on the question uh it's troublesome for vasps because um you know i think dave is right at the moment i've certainly counted uh in excess of 15 projects out there the different broad categories that dave has outlined and you know some of them will will make it to market some of them will not make it tonight um but others may emerge and in fact we we've seen even over the last year folks who weren't in the running at the beginning if you like as this uh issue emerged have have joined the fray and you've mentioned a couple of mainstream uh financial institutions that are involved in in in their solutions um pretty much though across the board there isn't a si there is no obvious single solution out there and i would echo dave's comment i don't think it would be a good thing necessarily but having 15 is also not good because the costs of trying to connect up to 15 different solutions and the complexity involved in that and indeed the discovery exercise and you've got the challenge of figuring out whether uh you're you're going to be involved in a transfer of value with a wallet at the other end that has a vast associated with it then you've got the problem of discovering who that vast is and and now you've got the problem of also discovering um which networks or which solutions they're employing these this is a whole cascade of issues certainly when we started the uh the intervas project this was uh its proper title was the uh intervas messaging standards and this was partly to short-circuit some of the challenge uh associated with having many different systems so we said well you know the the way the data will get from one vast to another will be solved by different solutions one or a few may emerge as the leading solutions and then maybe in the open space they may be in the very closed networks that some uh vasps are building between one another and or they may be in the proprietary space or combination any which way you cut it at the end of the day it's the same amount of data the same pieces of information that have to move from one vasp to another and it would save an awful lot of time if that data payload were defined in a standard way that a vast at the sending end would know that regardless of where in the world that value is being transferred to the information that goes with it can be understood understood as was intended and the the receiving vast can can get this information and understand how this bits the name this is the city where they live oh this is a passport number this is a date of birth just to be able to understand that forgetting for a moment that not the whole world speaks the same language yet alone uses the same character set so there are a lot of things that a technical standard which is what the interval messaging standard 101 ibm s101 was about was really to short-circuit that and make it possible for the payload data whatever however that is transferred to be understood as intended you're saying inter-vasp will make it so that it doesn't matter if gemini and kraken are using different um kind of front-end solutions because the information in them will be standardized absolutely you're right it's not an it's not a solution at all it is simply a technical standard you know it's a it's a document that's published that says this is how the name is set out this is how to deal with a scenario where uh than the original name is in korean but you have to communicate this to someone who's in switzerland for example this is what a date of birth looks like in other words you know is it the year first the month second and the date third or how how is that constructed so that everyone involved in that information sharing exercise uh can at least understand the data they can send it knowing that it can be understood and it can be received knowing that it's coming to you in a way that was intended okay so actually maybe it won't be as burdensome if different custodians are using different software but another major concern i imagine a lot of people in the crypto community will have is how this will be secured especially if there does end up being redundancy where for whatever reason you know we find that even for one transaction you have two different solution providers having to send the information for various reasons i mean it just creates more places where people's information can be compromised and you know the other scenario is also not super um comforting where perhaps maybe there will be one solution that tends to be the dominant one and sees almost all the transaction flow in it anybody who gains access to that will have access to extremely valuable information so how is security being handled for these uh different systems so we've put a lot of thought into security around systems architecture on the trisa project so ciphertrace has contributed to it but mit a whole bunch of exchanges and others have really thought about it quite a bit and definitely a centralized exchange our centralized data exchange model uh we believe believe is very dangerous it's counter to crypto i not only as you point out laura is it something that you know if somebody were able to get into it and the information were not end to end encrypted and the middleman could look at it absolutely it could be a privacy disaster um but also it's it's also availability so if let's say the world went to a centralized system even if it wasn't and encrypted and they couldn't intercept the messages it's a potential ddos attack for a nation state or anyone else who wants to take crypto offline so if you have one centralized service that if you want to transfer between vasps well if you want to take crypto out just kill that thing for a long period of time and no one can send money between vasps anymore so there's either that or they'll just do it without without complying with the fed of rules but anyway well sure absolutely um so that's a thing so we believe that it needs to be peer-to-peer exchange of the information so that create what that does is it creates resilience because there's no central place to take it out it means that you're only exchanging the information with the person that you have the vast the counterparty that you have to send it to now then the other benefits of this is if you have a directory service that you can look up these vasps around the world and then understand what their information protection at least requirements are or profiles or what have you then you can start to make decisions about do i feel comfortable sending my customers information to this vast and some you know companies won't and so one of the things that we've been working on on the trisa project as well as with open basp is a direct and the gdf the global digital foundation digital conference foundation is we've been working on a one a questionnaire and a verification uh process for who is a vasp where are they what is their jurisdiction what protocols do they support so as we've talked about you're going to have to support multiple for some period of time if not forever and and how what are the end points of it what is the security of it what are the certificates digital certificates around it but also what is your basic information security policy so not how you do it but um information about how do you protect the customer's data and then i think that helps that helps vasps as we move into this world to determine i feel comfortable sending my data to this company that's going to hopefully protect it or not i don't feel comfortable therefore we're not going to allow direct basketball transfers to xyz company in some country that has no data protection and one other thing i wanted to ask about was here we've been talking about cryptocurrencies this whole time but the fat off did release a long report all about what they kept calling so-called stable coins throughout the report they never just they never just called it stable coins um even in the title they called it so-called stable coins um anyway i call it a so-called report i don't know why they didn't just go with the term but anyway um so you know i didn't fully really understand in the report how this would affect because i mean they did make the distinction between centralized and decentralized stable coins um but even with the centralized table coins they were saying well there generally is a team that you can identify that launched the coin um but even for like a centralized stable coin it wasn't totally clear to me what exactly those creators of those stable coins would need to track is it that every time somebody creates a tether that uh the um the parent company which i think is iphone x or it's somehow related i'm just blanking on the company that they would need to track who that is and then do they need to track where they send their tethers initially or you know how does that all work and then as far as i can tell i believe also these rules could even imply to central bank digital currencies or do those get a pass because they represent fiat or you know how does all this apply outside of cryptocurrencies so taking the last point first as central bank digital currencies are outside of scope they're expressly excluded from the definition of a virtual asset pretty much everything else that you've mentioned whether whether they're considered to be stable coins of limited scope or whether they're so-called global stable kinds of global scope is really beside the point uh they they do fall within scope and i think if you look at the direction of travel you can assume that if you're someone who makes a buck on the back of some transaction you're going to be the one somehow along the line that is going to be brought in to into scope so true digi something that's truly decentralized where nobody's making any money nobody's gaining from the process uh other than the users uh the sender and the recipient uh i think you're going to assume that that that definition over time is going to suck in more and more people we're also going to get more and more imaginative about how they decentralize stuff and if you're looking to make some money out of decentralized stuff you're going to be sucked back in and there's an inevitability to that i think and but what about centralized stable coins you know what do those creators have to do uh in terms of tracking information or sending information on well of course if it's within their ecosystem they may be the vast at both end so of course they've got the information on both both customers if when we're both holders both stable coin holders uh if however it's moving between vasps or between the um between the issuer and a vast the the issuer is almost certainly going to be considered a vast of some sort so you've got a vast vast transfer and you you're caught by the same requirements to capture certain information to verify that information that was to do the kyc the due diligence stuff uh and um uh where there's another vasp at the other end you're to have to send the required information that is the information about your verified customer as the sender and the intended recipient and it's then up for the bus but the other end to do due diligence on his customer but only at the creation redemption points right it wouldn't be like every tether is being tracked you know as it changes hands until it gets redeemed or nothing like that if it changes hands between uh between uh one vasp and another then that information moves that travels if we're looking at the travel rule implication and if uh that chain is broken in other words there's not a vast but one end or the other then subject to certain national variations which i think dave's already mentioned switzerland which is a very clear variation on the baseline but in broad terms if it breaks the chain because there's not a vast at both ends then you may only need to keep information about your customer and you don't have to send any of that information right but what i'm saying is tether itself the company does not have to do it for every step they only do it at the creation or redemption points yeah that's my understanding now what the the effectively the you know the recommendation doesn't go into great detail it basically says all that stuff we wrote about applies here that's really pretty simply what it says okay so it turns out to some extent around the nuances of it i think you know right now it's not dealing with creation of cryptocurrency it's not dealing with mining of crypto it's not dealing with issuance it's really about when there's an end user customer moving at information back and forth now so for example if you think about like stable coins as a settlement mechanism between vasps maybe maybe not so you probably don't you know it's not really a per customer thing it's a settlement end-of-day type of settlement mechanism um you probably don't have to probably just say i'm vast i'm the customer i'm the best but you're the recipient you're the best but you probably don't have to bundle 500 people's stuff into it as far as we know but i think it's open for interpretation at this point in time i i take a slightly different view on that i think that um the the settlement if you think about the traditional financial services world there's the the communication of the of the of the payment instruction you know bank a telling bank b make these funds available to someone that's quite separate from the settlement between the banks but if you're talking about the the so the information that has to flow in the traditional world goes with that payment instruction and i think every movement of value between two parties where there's a vast body involved at either end that information about sender and receiver has to has to move regardless of whether there's some kind of net settlement mechanism but the placing of um of liquidity say between vasps um that isn't about uh an underlying transaction that that probably won't attract there's no information to transfer with it so i think you can always look to the banking sector to look for the analogies because actually that's all they've done is take the existing rules and say they also apply to virtual assets to crypto and hey industry you work it out and countries you work out how you regulate your vasps to make sure they comply with your rules um one other thing i wanted to ask about was how you thought that this rule would affect privacy coins particularly on exchanges i mean obviously if a privacy coin is on an exchange well yeah i don't know how this applies to something like monero but you know with zcash there's a public and there's a shielded transaction but i did see that the korean arm of ok x d listed its privacy coins most likely due to fat f rules next last fall so in general i wondered if you had any prognostication on what this would mean for privacy coins yeah i mean it applies you know i work with zcash i would say every week um with the electric coin company you know is one of the you know major players in the z cash space um you know they would argue that zcash natively supports the travel rule because you can you know attach information with a view key that could actually literally move with the transaction but i mean this would apply to every every privacy coin as well remember we're talking about an out-of-bound transactional information exchange before you do the actual blockchain transaction so to be compliant whether it's monero zcash dash or anything else that's yet to be invented if it's you have to be able to identify is it to a vast or a private wallet and if it's to a vast you have to send that information and correlate it with a transaction so that it can be correlated at the receiving end and and the extension of that is that if you can't do that then you can't affect that transfer of value if you're a vasp and you you're unable to meet that criteria whatever the circumstances but obviously there are very specific challenges in being able to do that with shielded transactions or with those uh enhanced privacy coins that simply don't that that shield effectively all movement then you you simply can't support that uh that transfer because you can't comply with the law in your country it can certainly provide trading facility so for example you buy as an exchange you buy monero from you know a known vendor or a miner you can certainly support trading on your platform the ability for people to buy and sell and make money etc it's the transfer in and out by private individuals that would be uh would fall under this regulation so you know one thing that i'm sure you guys have been watching in recent months that i feel is really developing between the crypto community or or at least a certain segment within the crypto community and analytics companies is a certain kind of antagonism because of the general cypherpunk philosophy and of this new world that we're entering where cryptocurrency is going from the fringes to becoming adopted by the mainstream and here we're just talking about basically applying some pretty basic tenants of the banking system to cryptocurrencies and so i was wondering especially dave i think for you you were talking about you how you have these roots in the cypherpunk world and i wondered how you square this work that your company is doing with the cypherpunk philosophy and if you have any opinion on that um relationship that i talked about between the community and and the this new world that we're entering i don't think anyone wanted in our opinion at least in my opinion in the crypto side nobody wanted this move i think there's way better ways to deal with this in my view which are much more cryptocentric which aren't you know folks who spent 35 years regulating banks but that's the world that we're in i think there's far better ways to to solve this problem to be honest um and maintain way better privacy and not spew people's information all around the world to vasps that you don't know about i but this is the world we live in so i have two choices i can either say i'm gonna do nothing and let the regulators do whatever and not be technically informed or i can step in as a technical person who understands the privacy constraints and and be involved and create the bridge between the community and hopefully and you know influence them to think about privacy influence them to think about um the implications and also the um unintended consequences of what they're proposing because let's face it there's a lot of unintended consequences that are come out going to come out of this that are not what they intended so it's either stand back and let a train wreck happen or at least try to like help some way to represent the community to bring it in to help influence it to bring the privacy community to bring the you know the privacy coin community into it to work with them that was my choice so what are some of those unintended consequences that you believe could happen well i mean the first one is you're spraying people's information all around the world you've now made it highly valuable to break into smaller companies because you're going to be able to identify people around the world so i think it's a big privacy problem you've just basically taken protecting people's data and made it let's say a thousand times more difficult because you're going to have a thousand vasps out there that are going to have other people's data that aren't their customers that's a big one i think the second one is going to be um well then everyone will just move everything to private wallets why would you do vast past transactions your transaction fee will be doubled but um or more but you know move everything to a private wallet and then send it on and then none of this makes any sense anyway so there's a lot of different implications out there i mean we also are going to have um the sunrise problem which is that this regulation is going to be implemented country by country it's going to take years to get implemented different countries will implement it differently so what does that mean if there's enforcement in one country let's say singapore or the united states decides to enforce strictly and like actually start binding people does that mean that if france hasn't implemented it you can't send money there so does that create a restriction in them in the market you know no longer have global liquidity so none of these in my view are positive so these are all unintended consequences there's others too but yeah there's a lot that needs to be thought through and this is why i chose to get involved and ciphertrace chose to get involved because it's either stand away and let it let people who don't know anything about it like define it or at least help be an industry representative in the room literally and figuratively in the room with these people to try to show them here's the problems here's alternate solutions and here's the problems that you're going to see and face and you know we were asked to list it we worked with 50 different vasps and others you know we work closely with coinbase and others just to and other vasps as well around the world to try to get their issues with it and represent that out so that hopefully we can influence policy in a positive way that doesn't you know destroy the fundamental value of crypto and speaking more about the unintended consequences it did occur to me that this maybe would spur more developments in privacy technology or more usage of privacy technology such as mixers or um it might drive it might drive certain groups of people who transact in cryptocurrency to simply cash out in less compliant jurisdictions or and and broadly probably there's just going to be a lot more people absolutely without a doubt there will be regulatory arbitrage both among users and companies who want to move to less regulated jurisdictions absolutely and they should but that's just going to happen it's just it you know it's a balloon you squeeze it in one place and it'll grow in another you can't stop you can't stop crypto what and you shouldn't yeah it should be available it should be available to everyone i you know we just unfortunately have this you know this world of financial controls that are out there that are only going to get more stringent they're applying to crypto i would rather them take a view which is more more enlightened which is there's ways to solve this problem that aren't throwing people's customer data all around the world that aren't assigning account numbers that aren't changing the way that we do crypto that you know i'd rather see that emerge but that's not going to happen unless people like us are involved in that that discussion because otherwise they're just going to slap all the banking regs on and that's what we're going to have is this thing's going to look like a glorified you know wire transfer system yeah and one other thing i imagine is that this will probably prompt a lot more people to manage their own keys so um there's there's kinds of uh i don't know there's probably uh both good and bad uh to that um but i did want to ask a little bit more about the sunset thing because or or just in general like you know what do you think the next few years as this gets implemented what will that look like and and are there any other major milestones that are on the horizon that people should be on the lookout for i think uh you've got to look at this deadline question that you asked a wee while ago that dave is quite right there was no sort of deadline the deadline was back in october 2018 when the when the recommendations were changed and it became countries became obliged to do something about it okay took till summer of 19 before there was the guidance for countries that might explain what that could look like but as has already been said those guidelines are pretty high level and so countries well you've got advanced countries who have folks who understand this stuff the us has a regime that already supports this and and the u.s fincen says these rules have applied forever and certainly since they clarified the position five years ago now something like that but other countries that have absolutely nothing in place and so the sunrise problem emerges because in reality you've got 200 deadlines as each country brings in its own laws and sets its own deadlines that vasps now have to comply well there are countries probably around 30 35 countries that have now done something to bring the recommendations the global recommendations into their national legislation but quite a few of those have either not brought in anything yet for the travel rule because they know there are no solutions out there so they can't or they have brought them in but have simply said look we're not going to enforce them or we're giving some regulatory forbearance until a solution is available and keep the pressure on the industry to actually solve all these many different challenges so that you end up with an end-to-end a perfect solution but you're still going to have countries bringing them in one this month one next month three the month after and so on and so on and if you look at how the travel was brought into the banking sector that was exactly the same problem it applied in in some countries very quickly the majority of countries took another two or three years to bring in the legislation and then start to uh bring in the regulations to support it and then you had the stragglers who took up to what i think seven eight nine years before they had all complied and this is not going to be any different than that meanwhile you've got vast all over the world who have this asymmetry in regulation not only the requirement to be licensed or registered in their own jurisdictions the possibility that they may have to be licensed or registered in some other jurisdictions because those countries then say oh well if you're if you've got a customer in our country even though you're not based here you still also have to be regulated in our country and then you've got the mismatch over the travel rules some countries will have the legislation in place the rules in place other countries may not so you know it takes two basks to tango and yet one one verse be subject to rules and the other one hasn't got any rules yet to apply and this is going to be an ongoing story and itself a a challenge a challenge of uncertainty a challenge of uh asymmetry and enforcement and um to be honest many of the solutions that are out there today are only part of them i think dave has very eloquently made the point that some of the solutions are geographic you know those for the us and north america on the one hand those in asia on the other hand different solutions that certainly not yet um global in nature and not comprehensive in nature not end to end and meanwhile amidst all that confusion you've got data that's being thrown around in an unregulated way and that it also is a huge challenge i couldn't agree with dave moore the um the privacy issues are massive they are the same privacy issues that happen with banks you know your bank will send your information to a i don't know a bank in brunei or in uh or in north korea or well probably not north korea but um certainly in some other part of the world and your information about the fact you sent this money to someone is is is held by that bank you don't know who that bank is you don't necessarily know what's going to be done with that information but it's certainly a much bigger problem when you think that this is going to apply to an unlimited range of virtual assets so in the payments world there are 200 and some currencies thereabouts you've got thousands of virtual assets today we could be talking in 10 years time there's a part of me that kind of hopes it'll happen but you could be talking about a hundred thousand uh different kinds of virtual assets especially when you start to think about this applying not just to to cryptocurrencies but to a whole raft of digitized assets of one form or another they would still qualify as virtual assets and you've got vasps who are not yet regulated in the way the banking sector is regulated globally to global standards and then you've got a raft of different privacy requirements uh eu obviously with gdpr but you're seeing other jurisdictions now with their own flavors of of privacy rules and they have to be mapped on to all of the same stuff it's it's going to it's going to keep me occupied right the way up to and probably beyond my retirement all right and dave did you want to add anything uh i mean i think it's important for industry to get involved so more exchanges more companies that are either doing analytics or anybody who's doing currency swap services this is going to affect all of those companies and we'd like to see more engagement more education you wouldn't believe the number of exchanges that i talked to on a weekly basis who've never heard of it and it's oh yeah no it's coming and this can be the end goal can be served without breaking krypton without you know spreading people's information all over the world and i think this sunrise problem is a big one um i think we're gonna see five years of turmoil around this thing um the good news is i think many come countries recognize there aren't good solutions we've educated them that the sunrise problem exists it's now in their vernacular they talk about it every time there's a meeting so that's good they understand that you know this isn't easy it's not trivial and i think there will be forbearance on hopefully on enforcement and let the industry come up with better ideas better solutions yeah i think to its credit this industry has mobilized super fast and super well um yes i agree that there are a lot of folks who still don't really understand what the what the requirements are going to be even if they've heard of it they don't understand all of the implications and that itself is is a challenge but if you look across industry you've seen it get together very fast on various projects that we've talked about in this program and also on technical standards such as the interval standards you know to get an international standard on messaging in the traditional world might take three years it was done in 18 19 weeks and this industry has stepped up to the challenge but let's be absolutely clear dave is 101 right on this one um this is going to go on for years and it's going to be in a state of flux and how it settles in five to ten years time will not necessarily be how it looks like today yeah if there's anything i've learned covering crypto it's that this industry moves very fast um so we will have to see how this all plays out it does sound like it will be a little bit messy but hopefully um it will actually maybe not be as scary and a transforming of the industry as people expect or hope okay so where uh can people learn more about each of you and your companies and also about the travel rule well um the the information about the uh the flat of recommendations in their entirety which include uh which of course include the travel rule can be found on the fat of website you can google that that of uh virtual assets guidance you'll it'll come up in the top top couple of search results um in terms of the technical standard the interval messaging standard ibm s101 that we talked about it's free to download uh any vasp anywhere in the world anyone with an interest can download it from intervasp.org and anyone who wants to find out more from those of us who are in the industry helping folks well you can see the uh the name there x-ray x-ray dot consulting um and and and you can reach us uh reach us that way dave yeah so i mean i think everybody who's listening probably knows i'm at cypher trace so you can catch me over there um but on the open standard side of things the working group the governance model look at trisa.iaos so that's t-r-i-s-a so travel information sharing alliance dot io and you can find github over there to get open source you can find various articles and white papers about security models threat models how these things work and then also i would recommend intervasp sorry open vast investment as uh as sean said but also openvasp so look up openvas and look up their standards as well and um also the bip75 uh are all open uh standards as well great well thank you both so much for coming on unchanged thank you so much for joining us today to learn more about dave and sean and cypher
