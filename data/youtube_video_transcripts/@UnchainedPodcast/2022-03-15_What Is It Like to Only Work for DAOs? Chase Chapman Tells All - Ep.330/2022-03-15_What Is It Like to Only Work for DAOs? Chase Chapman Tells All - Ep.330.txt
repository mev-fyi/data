welcome chase i'm so excited to chat me too so you have so many jobs in crypto and at various dows you're a co-founder and advisor at decentology host of the on the other side podcast and you're a contributor at orca index co-op and rabbit hole so why don't you unpack for the listeners what all that means and to sort of describe what your work life in crypto is like yes so i kind of like to think about what i do as the web 3 version of freelancing so you know in in the world of web 2 you have people who do a few different things at a few different organizations and what i really love about web3 is that you can do those things but you can actually earn ownership and have governance rights in those organizations and so that's kind of what i what i spend my time doing so i do research at orca protocol thinking about how we can implement dows in the real world not just theoretical and then i do some community stuff at rabbit hole i'm helping index think about inclusion within the organization and then i also have my podcast so i spend a lot of time thinking about really similar common threads around how humans engage in decentralized systems but i get to do that across a lot of different contexts which is really fun yeah i have to say your podcast is definitely like very nerdy it's like very much this kind of like abstract discussion and i just feel like for true crypto geeks like it's very fun and interesting so i'm so curious how did you even get into crypto in the first place well i appreciate that i think my my podcast is definitely the nerdy governance niche which is super fun i first got into crypto because i was working in marketing doing data analytics and we had all these challenges with the provenance and who owned data like among different companies and so of course blockchain at the time was like this amazing solution to the problem and this was a few years ago and i was still in college and and sort of doing this while i was in college and really fell down the crypto rabbit hole from there so i got involved with c256 had a mentor who i ultimately started a developer tooling company with that company is decentology so still doing really well but when i graduated i really got obsessed with dowse and decided to take a little bit of a step back as a founder into more of an advisor role and then dive really deep into dowse and the sort of human side of web 3. and it's definitely a different world from developer tooling which has been really fun and being able to focus on this human element has been really like fulfilling and rewarding and so why don't you walk us through how it is that you can have each of these different jobs ooh that's a fun one so um of course decentology the company that i started sort of stepped back and into an advisory role but still helping on uh some of the dow pieces in terms of index co-op i actually met someone who was working full-time at index in miami at bitcoin miami and he was like chase we really need more women in in index and we know it's a problem and so i started just kind of collaborating with him and a few people who are already indexed to think about not only how we could bring more women in but also how we could really promote not necessarily promote support them i guess within the organization and then we expanded that out to include people who identify as female and non-binary and really try to use that as like this testing ground for how we can make these spaces more diverse and inclusive because you can't amplify collective intelligence with homogeneous groups that's sort of the the thesis so got involved there and then kept up uh that that initiative and and really like started growing that and then with rabbit hole i actually worked with brian who's the ceo um when he was at dapper labs when i was at decentology because there there's a partnership there and so sort of uh stayed friends with him when he left and started rabbit hole and had always been really excited about their vision and mission and started working on a few community things and have continued doing that and then with orca protocol which i absolutely became like a fan girl of before i i ever got involved with working with them but as i dove deeper into dowse it really felt like there was this piece that every dao had in common which was this notion of working groups or circles or pods and even when i looked back at sociocracy and co-ops and all these different more decentralized organizing mechanisms that came before daos they all have really similar primitives around what does it look like for a group of people with a specific focus within a decentralized organization to align on goals and work together and so i became obsessed with orca and uh ultimately was able to take a lot of the research that i was doing around co-ops and sociocracy and things and pull that into orca and start uh really testing some of these things that i've been researching so that was really fun and then the podcast was something that i always give brian flynn again from rabbit hole credit because he was like chase you have to start a podcast you love chatting and so i started that and and have continued that forward i was going to ask you something about this later in the show but since he brought it up right away i'm so curious you talked about how there aren't that many women in crypto or web3 how have you been trying to get more women involved at index co-op and in general like how do you think the crypto space can go about doing that i think there are two interesting things happening the first is that i think we have women we have people of color we have like people who i think for the last couple of years in crypto definitely have not been represented coming into the space in a lot larger numbers i think the challenge becomes how do you support and empower and if they want make them visible because i think a lot of times particularly endows like when you think about what it means to become a contributor it means you kind of have to put yourself out there and you don't know if people actually want any of the things that you're working on half of the time which is kind of a challenge without onboarding more broadly but a lot of times it kind of feels like a job interview and we know from data that a lot of these types of groups whether it be women or people of color tend to like not apply to as many jobs because the way that they're socialized you know or at least jobs where they don't meet every single requirement and so when you look at just the systemic reasons that people don't get involved in things it's a lot deeper than just like oh hey you know get your girlfriend into crypto it's really about thinking about what are all the factors at play how can we make it a safer space and so i think a big part of that is just visibility something that we've noticed with index is that talking about inclusion isn't necessarily the only or best way even to bring more people into the space a lot of it is actually just how can we put women and non-binary people and people of color and other groups that maybe you don't see as much in crypto from like a visibility perspective in the spotlight and talking about you know how dao is organized and and that doesn't mean making sure that every single time you talk about inclusion it's an important conversation but it's one that we've learned is you know you can you can beat the drum so many times but it's it's a lot more about actually putting people into the spotlight so that's been a really big thing and then also creating spaces where people can feel supported i think she 256 is a perfect example of this i'm not sure that i would have been able to go as deep down the crypto rabbit hole as i had without them so for anyone who isn't familiar they're an organization that basically matches women who want to get more involved in the space with mentors and so i think creating spaces where you have this like support structure is also really important huh yeah one other thing that i wanted to ask you about is that when i did a show about how syndicate dao is launching these web 3 investment clubs they said that half of their launch cohort were either all women or women led dows when i asked them how that happened the um co-founder ian lee said that actually you know they hadn't intended it which is sort of natural out of like mission and values alignment and i wondered in general if you have if you agree that sort of like dows in general are kind of like a good avenue for bringing more women into crypto or if you feel that the kind of values of dao sort of align better with the values that women tend to have hmm that's a really interesting question from my anecdotally anecdotal experience i think i don't know about dows more broadly or nfts more broadly i have a gut feeling that they're probably a little bit less intimidating because they acknowledge existing skills that already they're not web 3 specific and i do think that if you look at crypto i mean you know over the past many years like it is definitely predominantly men and so i think and and new and like when i say men there's like a very specific demographic of men and um and i think that when we think about like all of these other skills that taos and nfts actually are starting to bring in i i do think that there's something to be said for just like the demographics of those groups the other thing that i think that's interesting is a lot of the people that i know who are doing like community management are not like cis white men and i think there's probably something to that i i don't want to speak like generally about everyone but i do think that there's there's in my experience more like women or um people who are coming into those roles who definitely don't look like the the very sort of standard crypto bro that i think people imagine okay yeah maybe we can talk more about that later but i also then actually just wanted to circle back on your uh history of work because i was also so curious when i was looking at you know your resume or cv or whatever you want to call it before you ended up in this line of work uh working for dao's what did you think you were going to do for a living well before daoz i definitely was like full on going to be a crypto founder i don't think i ever would have left crypto before crypto though i thought i was going to go into gallic consulting or investment banking probably i was in business school that's what all my friends ended up doing i probably would have tried to go into private equity longer term i like to if i'm not doing something that's like being a founder or a dow contributor i think i would have not done well in a corporate system because i totally would have been like obsessed with climbing a ladder that got me nowhere basically okay well so since you sort of like veered off in a very different direction i'm curious how you think dows are either changing the nature of work or will change the nature of work i think there are two broad trends that are going on in my mind when we think about what the future of work looks like and where dows fit within it the first is this general trend over the past couple of decades where you've seen a lot of organizations zappos very famously spearheaded this move towards a more flat structure so you know you have um like the 50s and 60s and 70s where you have a lot more hierarchical corporate structures everybody has a boss and and there are all of these systems that look very like rigid and i think what we've seen is this movement towards teal and flat organizations where employees are empowered to make decisions because ultimately people have realized that having a boss tell everyone what to do across a large domain of of different things really doesn't make that much sense and it's not actually the best way to run a business you can only create so much flexibility and resiliency with a model like that and so i think that's sort of the the first trend and then the second trend is uh what kovid brought about which was this massive movement towards rethinking work whether that be where you work like being remote or what it means to be an employee of an organization in the first place so the great resignation and all these things i think really force people to rethink this concept that we have as a society of what work could look like and i think dowse became this really interesting example of moving towards self-management and autonomy and having real ownership that is completely remote work that's totally flexible and so i think of course like what those things actually mean in practice can be a little bit different like there isn't complete flexibility i don't think at least not endowed scale there's still going to be some things that stay from what we've already seen in corporations and more traditional companies but i do think that when we look at where things are going it's a lot more towards quote-unquote employee now dow contributor basically autonomy and towards thinking about um a lot more flexible way of engaging with labor and and actually being able to earn ownership while you do it and then how do you think that intersects with what people are calling the passion economy or the creator economy i just talked with yancey strickler who i'm a really big fan of who's working on a project called metal label about this and he has this notion that you know everyone talks about at least in the western hemisphere how we've moved towards um individualism and this idea that you know you used to go to church and and all these things and now we're much more focused on on ourselves i actually think and now he has this notion of a post-individualist society where we can choose to engage in different types of work that we personally align with and so i think we're moving a lot more towards okay you have this like individual um individual decision to now become part of a collective and to me that's really like the next iteration and this is kind of yandy's point of the passion and creator economy where to be honest like it's lonely to be a creator but it's much more interesting when you can align with other people and co-create in a way that feels flexible but also like you actually own it so i actually think the dows are are the next evolution of making the creator economy a little bit more about the collective while also acknowledging individual autonomy and values i love that that's super interesting okay so i have some sort of nosy questions for you how do you get paid and how is it determined how much you get paid i get paid in a lot of different ways which is the fun part of this so um there are a few different ways one of them is in tokens that are effectively like governance tokens from a dow so for index for example i'm paid in index tokens i personally hold those tokens some people who are paid in those tokens sell them right away it depends on if you have you know rent that you need to pay with those tokens for other organizations like orca i'm on their like core team as a researcher and so i'm paid just like any other job um in fiat i'm sure that if i wanted to get paid in like staple coins i probably could um but that's a lot more traditional and wait wait and is that like a w-2 type situation or a 1099 so currently it's a w-2 but i'm probably going to change it to a 1099 because i i'm figuring out exactly what the best legal structure is based on how i actually like work and we're still figuring out where i sit with an orca because again it's like one of those things where i'm a researcher but i'm engaging a lot with their dao and i think that's that speaks to probably the the organizational design best practices still being figured out but um when we think about how those things are set that's where things get interesting every single job that i have has a different compensation structure or way that it was decided upon for the most part for something like orca it was a lot more of a traditional process where you know they approach me or i approach them with like a number and then we sort of settle on it but for index for example i've gone through quite a few iterations of how i'm paid so one of them was index would have everyone submit a spreadsheet of what you did if you're not a core contributor on a salary which was the case for me i was not a core contributor on a salary and then they had like a group of people who sort of decided what they felt the value was based on looking at everyone's contributions if you didn't agree with it you could like appeal it and come to a decision they've moved away a little bit from that system and gotten more specific to the groups of people you're working in so now we use coordinate which is a tool that allows people to uh within a group allocate salaries to each other based on who you work with and how much value they you think they provided so now most of my compensation at index is based on a coordinate circle people who are core contributors and salaried don't participate in that um it's mostly for people who either are like contributors who are sort of part-time or a little bit less consistent i'll also note that like i don't do this but other ways that i've seen dows use this type of tool is you have a base salary and then you use something like coordinate on top of it as more of a bonus type system so there are a lot of different ways that other dows have done this but that's that's my general way that i'm i'm paid across different orgs and now that your peers are basically deciding how much you're being paid do you feel and so hopefully you don't mind revealing do you feel that it's fair and like did the compensation change in a way you know from how it was you know did it change a lot after you know they switched that model it didn't change a lot it was pretty consistent i know that for me it felt fair but i also don't rely exclusively on that for income so i think you know i i'm kind of much more accepting i think of whatever people think makes sense that's also not a large part of my income in general like just based on the amount of work that i do with index for example and so i think i would probably feel much more strongly if it was like a large percentage of my income i will say i think the people who i know who have used this type of system in the past it requires a really high degree of trust and honesty with one another because one of the most important elements of this and zach from chord tape always says this is feedback alongside uh the allocation so when before he was at coordinate when he used this in his consulting company what they would do is they would say okay here's our pot of money let's you know all four or five of us get together in a room and decide how to split this up and have an open and honest conversation about it and so i think what's really valuable is the conversations that it brings about and again i think i would i would probably feel much more strongly about the actual number if it was a really large part of my income so oftentimes compensation at like a traditional company would factor in cost of living in terms of where the company is located so let's say that in one of these daos you have two different people in the same role but one of them lives in new york city and the other lives in cleveland which is where i'm from so you know hopefully nobody from cleveland will be offended by this but um then would that factor in or would they be paid the same or how does that part work something that's really interesting about every conversation i've ever had about compensation is it comes down to values and agreeing on those values and then having compensation pull those through and be a manifestation of those those things so i think every dao is going to have a different approach to this but i think what it should reflect is a decision whether or not to change comp based on where you live so if one of the values that you have which by the way i think should be articulated by every dow i think a lot of dabs don't do this today but i think having a core set of values and agreements is one of the most important things that you can do from an organizational design perspective but if index said one of our core values is that everyone is paid equally and if you are a contributor to this organization you consent to that value then everyone should be paid equally regardless of where they live if one of the core values is that we acknowledge that different areas cost different amounts then that's what should happen but i think a lot of it is about making those decisions and then making sure that those are explicitly stated so that when people do come into a system they know what what the underlying values are going to be and they can decide whether or not they want to be there or you know go somewhere else and so for your taxes is it that you have that one w-2 and then everything else is at 10.99 yes currently i'm working through exactly what the best strategy is i'm also very lucky because i'm under 26 and my parents have health insurance so i get to be on their health insurance i'm going to ask you about health insurance but okay you're under 26 all right but i know a lot of people who use like opolis if you're in the us which is a collective that's allowing dao workers to come together and essentially purchase group health insurance and then you run it through um and yeah i think i use opolis but um i'm like a sole proprietor or no no i'm not i'm i'm an llc sorry i'm i'm an llc but i still use opolis but anyway yeah but but so i think there are lots of different solutions what i know a lot of people do is have like an s-corp status and then run things through that but i definitely am still figuring out what the best approach is i think most people are because the other thing that comes up when you think about taxes is actually if you're like me and you are paid in index tokens and you haven't sold those tokens you have to consider what is the income that you're that you actually have because it could be and i think just like the the basic sort of standard approach to this is your income is the price of the token when you get it but there are also private rounds happening for these tokens typically with like vc funds and so the question becomes is that actually the price or is it the price of the time you get it and there are all these different questions around what that actually looks like and how you treat those things and i think we're very much still in the early stages of figuring out what the tax implications are for dow contributors who are being paid in governance tokens i bet your accountant just loves you i have two accountants and i think they they both dread calls with me okay so i want to get into some of the the nerdier things that you like covering your podcast so you tweeted stop using the terms decentralized protocols permissionless networks and start using self-managing organizations sociocracy which by the way you have to define that and co-ops and then you wrote the human layer requires different mental models than the computational layer so unpack all that and and please define sociocracy so my definition of sociocracy is definitely not going to be correct but i the way the sociocracy uh from my understanding of it is effectively organizations that use consent based governance and circles to organize in a decentralized fashion and there's like this whole evolution of organizational design thinking that got to this point which is why i'm such a big fan of like looking at it and i am definitely not an org design historian by any means but um it's effectively a means of decentralized organization that leverages these smaller groups that being said the reason that i think about things like sociocracy and self-managing orgs is when we look at the way that people currently talk about dows a lot of it borrows from the terminology and phrasing and design mechanisms that protocols use so bitcoin as a you know protocol for example is maximizing for the most part for decentralization it's generally permissionless like if you have the hardware you can run a node and so you have these different nodes that are all doing work to secure the network and they are rewarded for it hopefully but i think the challenge with doing that in the dow ecosystem and pulling all of that terminology and thinking over is that humans are not like nodes in the bitcoin network humans have a lot more complexity when you think about the types of work that they provide to the quote unquote network which is like the organization so you don't have bitcoin nodes that specialize in social media marketing and i think that's where you have a lot more complexity when we start to think about the mental models that we need to be using for dows and i'm not saying like protocols are not useful mental models but they have their limits just like any other mental model and i think we over index on them as opposed to thinking more about this this trend that i was talking about earlier towards self-management where you have pulling from you know flat organizations and sociocracy and all these different things to actually think about how humans organize which is a lot more in these smaller circles of people where you have decision making that is decentralized but the reason that it's decentralized is because you only have like six people as opposed to trying to get an entire network to agree which works when you have mathematical proofs but not when you have human beings because there's no right answer with human beings so that's why i say we should move away from computational models only and towards more of these human-centric models and something that was interesting was you retweeted a tweet by jake chervinsky of the blockchain association where he said that he feels like daos are sort of like relearning why it is that corporations exist and you seem to kind of plus one that um so what is it that you think dao should be taking from corporate structures i think corporations have gotten a lot of things wrong and a lot of things right i think hierarchical systems and pulling from having someone like a ceo that has a lot of generalized power over lots of different domains is not a pattern that we should be recreating but i think very specific hierarchies of for example within a small circle of people someone who knows twitter really really well and kind of has the consent of the people in that circle to say hey yeah you own twitter that's a win and so i think having these types of hierarchies and specialized expertise um like recognizing people with specialized opportunity not opportunities um expertise is really really important so i think from that perspective corporations get a lot of things right i think we're definitely still experimenting with what hr looks like in organizations i will say i was very much of the opinion that things like hr need to exist in daos and i still think we need to consider them but i have had my mind changed over the past couple of months to move towards this notion that hr needs to be a lot more localized and so we instead of having a single department that we outsource all of our people problems to instead we need to be thinking more about how do we equip people within our organization with the tools that they need to navigate conversations around compensation and conversations around conflict resolution so i think that there are a lot of functions and some structures that we can borrow from corporations but i think that there are a lot of like modifiers on almost every one of those and that's i think exactly why what jake was saying makes a lot of sense to me in some ways where we need to experiment and figure out what does need to be brought over from corporations and i think that's very healthy to do and what we can leave behind and if we don't try things we're never going to to know all right so in a moment we're going to talk

web3 in general but i think also in dows you know i think some people question like why should a16z be investing in friends with benefits which is a social club um so in general how do you see uh vcs in terms of their participation in doubts especially since you know obviously they tend to have huge allocations of tokens which can affect voting i don't quite know yet this gets into something that i'm personally thinking a lot about which is this question of how do we think about the role and authority that token holders have in in relation to the role and authority that contributors have and i think that's really what this gets down to whether it's a vc or a whale they hold tokens that now give them power to govern an organization that they might not be contributing to or actively helping run and so i think it gets into this question of how do you make decisions as an organization what we have definitely learned is that having token holders vote on everything is definitely not a mechanism that works well even sushi trying to get token holders to approve compensation packages which became a very big debate feels like a very good example of why this doesn't work so the question becomes okay how do you delegate power and decision-making authority to different people within an organization so that they have the ability to make these decisions and you don't have to ask token holders every time and so my current thinking which is not fully evolved on this so it's kind of half baked is potentially having token holders and contributors choose who to delegate different responsibilities and and roles to and very specifically defining and consenting to their scope of authority so that again it's not that you have a ceo or even a cmo for example who can make these calls across so many different things but instead you say this is the right person to make decisions for maybe social if you're a small dow if you're a really big down maybe it's like twitter and something else and so i think a lot of it comes down to kind of this like representative democracy type thing but with very tight scope as opposed to having this either every token holder votes on everything which i think is why we have voter apathy and all these things or saying okay we're gonna put a ceo into place which i think also doesn't work well yeah i actually want to kind of apply this discussion to the recent vote on whether brantley milligan of ethereum name service should have remained a director of the foundation and you may know so the results ended up being that 43 percent were against his removal meaning they wanted to keep him 37 or 30 percent were for his removal and then 19 abstained but brantley himself actually participated in the vote so what did what did what were your kind of takes on everything that went down and like how it could have gone better so yeah brantley participated in the vote with an amount of shares that changed the vote itself i think it's worth like pointing out the reason that he stayed if he had not voted if he had abstained he wouldn't be the vote would not have gone the way that it did i have really mixed feelings about this so my own personal perspective on the entire thing that went down aside i think what it highlighted to me was that organizations again have to articulate very clear values so that it doesn't become a question of should this person stay in power it becomes a question of did this person go against one of our core principles that we expect every single community steward to abide by and if the answer to that is no then it becomes simple because you're not voting on should this person stay you're voting on did this person break the agreed agreed-upon consented principles so i think like from that perspective i think that's how we could have avoided a lot of what is currently going on and one of the important things there is saying if inclusivity is a very core principle and you expect your community stewards to uphold that principle which very explicitly can mean not making the type of comments that brantley made then it just becomes a question of like did you do it and when people come into that community who are much more on the other side where they say this type of speech shouldn't affect whether or not someone holds this position if the community has that value that means that you probably shouldn't be in that community or if you want to be there that's okay but you consent to this rule that you basically don't agree with but you acknowledge that's how we're going to govern and so i think like the ability to have people consent to or choose to exit because we know that this is how we govern is really really important more broadly i think there's a question around delegation here i think again if there was a rule that said hey if we're voting on the removal of someone who is you know part of our community who has delegated votes they're not allowed to participate in that vote that would have been a helpful principle to have so i think a lot of this comes down to values at the end of the day like if you don't have those defined and if we can't at least in response to things like this to find them then we're going to have more and more of these types of conversations and so ultimately i think it comes down to to deciding on on those things and if you don't care about you know inclusivity or you don't think that that's part of what building an inclusive culture means then people who do not agree with that won't enter your community and i think that that hopefully longer term things like forking become easier i think ens is in a really different situation because they've they've built an identity system which brantley has famously talked about is not easily forkable so i think there's probably a broader discussion there to talk about what is the responsibility of people who are building a system that isn't really as easily forked and how does that change those types of principles but um yeah i think a lot of it comes down to articulating values and um earlier when you were talking about how you felt like in a dao kind of system it would make more sense to have many different little pockets of hr or however you know those were my words but um so in the case of something like brantley where you know he he was a leader obviously but he had these views that you know probably uh would have made it uncomfortable at least for different people to work for him like how how do you imagine that in an ideal world that that would work in terms of the hr around that i think that there are two different types of like what hr really looks like the first is you know conflict resolution laura you and i have some disagreement and you think that i'm being a really bad person to you and making work really uncomfortable but no one else really feels that way and and i might have been given that position or people might have consented to me making decisions but i'm in a role that is very specific i think that's one type of conflict resolution and working through that i think having people who are more broadly community stewards and speak on behalf of an organization i do think that they they have a little bit of a different level of trust that's required and so i think sometimes those types of things go beyond like hr in the sense of almost peer-to-peer and a little bit more of a conversation that pulls in things like brand but also things like community because you are shaping culture by having people who speak that way and saying yes we're okay with those people continuing to be community stewards again like my views aside i think there are larger implications of how many different things you're impacting as someone is sort of more exposed to larger groups of people and has more trust of those people to speak on behalf of the organization which i think you could definitely say pretty objectively brantley spoke on behalf of ens in a lot of cases and so i think that becomes a little bit of a different type of decision and so obviously you know we talked about how for brantley it kind of was a conflict for him to have voted but in general there are a lot of systems where whales have a lot of influence and so in that sense like taos can become kind of like oligarchies so what do you see as the best way to mitigate that i think this comes back again to the question of what is the role of token holders and contributors and how do we think about governance i think index has done some really interesting experimenting around how to make it so that contributors are either making decisions or have varying amounts of weight based on how involved they are so i think there's a point to be made about having core contributors and people who are consistently committing time and energy and have responsibilities in an organization have potentially a little bit more weight in governance decisions as opposed to exclusively token holders so i think that there are ways that we can start to experiment with how contributors have a say in voting and how token holders have a say in voting and potentially even narrowing the scope of what token holders can actually do which ultimately i think brings you to the question of okay then why are tokens worth anything if ultimately we're stripping away all of this value then why would you hold a token and honestly i think that's going to be one of the biggest questions that dao's have to deal with in the next couple of years we're already seeing a few das experiment with becoming like cultural currencies kind of that's that's the current approach and i think there's something interesting there i think that's the innovation that we're gonna need to see a lot more of and as you mentioned earlier sushi swap has been through a lot of drama what what would you do to try to turn sushi swap around now i think once you have a token released it becomes a whole different question and i think that's why it's so challenging because again token holders are left with this major sort of if you strip away a lot of the governance rights of token holders you ultimately end up with an organization that probably operates a lot better as an organization and i think contributors probably thrive but you have this question of why did someone buy a token in the first place and so i think one of the biggest things that an organization like sushi can do which is a way easier said than done is reconsider what the utility of the token is and think more deeply about how you can create other types of mechanisms to build in more utility which would not be impossible meaning that you wouldn't have sushi be a governance token or what do you mean by that i would have it be a governance token but i would consider how it could be a token that is useful for other things in d5 as well and i don't know what that means for sushi specifically because i think it's challenging when you're a d5 protocol in particular like i know there's a i forget what dow it is but there's a dow that's playing around with uh you have to hold their nft you have to buy their nft in order to leverage their defy strategies what would it look like for sushi to experiment with that so really adding more utility so it is a governance token and but a lot of the value also comes from other sources and other things that they're doing outside of that but again i think it's a lot easier said than done and i'm not sure if that's going to be the best approach and but in general what about kind of the uh the fact that the leadership is in such disarray do you feel like if you were to change the token setup that that would sort of resolve itself or i think a lot of this comes down to a question of my brain right away goes towards you need a really strong leader to push this stuff forward and i don't know that that's an old way of thinking because i just wrote this piece about how falling back to hierarchy is kind of like texting your ex it's like familiar and when we're in these states of discomfort we're like oh you send the drunk text because you know it and it's familiar to you and comfortable and i think my constant question is is my brain falling back to you need a strong leader because it's a drunk text to my ex when i don't know the answer or is it that that's actually the best mechanism so i think sometimes to take really chaotic moments and try to figure out how are we moving forward it is really useful to have a very strong leader i don't know exactly what the answer will be for sushi i think these types of situations though ultimately if if sushi is able to make it through will be a hell of a lot stronger because of it so another one obviously is wonderland dao which suddenly the community discovered that the treasurer was michael patron who is a convicted felon and was the co-founder of quadriga cx which obviously is one of the biggest scandals in crypto history so how do you think that whole situation could have been prevented and then what do you think wonderland should do going forward i think there are so many different layers to this one of them is what is the role of anonymity and not knowing someone's background in giving them trust and i think that's something that every community is going to have to decide on themselves i don't think that that's going to have a unanimous answer some communities are going to be so fine with having someone who's in on in control of their treasury some people are totally fine with that when they know you know someone's identity like that was totally fine for some people and very much not fine for a lot of other people and so i think a lot of this comes down to again articulating those those values and making them explicit so that if i go into wonderland out and i see that one of the values is we trust sort of um without needing justification like we trust by default even if this means anonymous contributors have a lot of responsibility that might be a red flag for me and i might want to say okay not the space for me but cool you do you and we'll see how that turns out so i really think a lot of this comes down to making those things explicit which i think you have to find systems to do that i think documenting decisions and making these types of agreements is really important and then surfacing them so that people can actually understand what's going on but to me that's that's what a lot of this comes down to because some communities are are going to in a similar vein think that you know having like token holders vote on everything is terrible or having a single person in charge of the treasury is fine but not if they're anonymous you know there are i think a lot of different versions of this even people who use molok daos have a very different version in their mind of what a treasury should look like in how it should be managed than people who are okay with having a couple signers on a multi-sig so i think there's a huge scale and making sure that you're articulating where the dow sits in every part is really important so i just came up with this book and it goes into the history of ethereum and one of the major events obviously was the dao it's funny because the the book is 12 chapters and four of the chapters are about the dao and it covers like two months and then all the other chapters are like you know years one thing that really strikes me is that at that time they just had barely any tooling for when they created this dao um you know they kind of immediately realized oh we need to make some changes but they had no way to kind of galvanize everybody and actually implement them so obviously we've come a long way and i'm curious for you like what are the dow tools that you really depend on and like really feel are sort of like instrumental right now and essential in managing dows and what do you feel still needs to be built so i will say as just a precursor to this one of the things that i think is really interesting about their lack of ability to change everything that was happening in the dao because people who were not necessarily like active voters were holding the tokens is a perfect example of the fact that implementing everything on chain right away especially if it's binding like that is going to cause problems and it's why the dow hack was able to be like as you know problematic as it was and so something that i always say with regards to dow tooling is i am very bearish on any dow tool that is implementing a pattern that we haven't already tested and is not like a reflection of what's currently happening so an example of this is the wikipedia one of the wikipedia co-founders had a company that he started before wikipedia called newpedia and it was basically like wikipedia but had all these rules about what you needed to do in order to contribute and who you needed to be and like all these different things and it totally failed the reason that wikipedia succeeded was because they created this community of passionate people and then all of the rules and and mods and all that stuff emerged because they were codifying it's a little bit less codified than it is in a smart contract but they were saying here's what we do and they were writing these like rules in way that they govern based on what they had explored and what worked and so i think every dow tool that i'm super excited about when we think about like orca even something like snapshot which came out of the balancer community because they needed something to do exactly what snapshot currently does as a tool all of those things in my mind are really really great tools because they reflect what dows are already doing they just make it easier or they put it on chain and make it more composable in the case of orca for example so i'm really excited about dow tools that reflect what is already working and one of the other ones that that is not really traditionally considered a dow tool but that i'm i'm really excited about is murmur which was created by people from the ready which is this like consulting company that helps um organizations become more self-managing they help the fed and airbnb and others now they're getting more into the dao ecosystems they following git coin and all that and they created this product that is basically like agreements for working and it's useful in self-managing orgs which is why i'm excited about it endows because it's effectively these like emergent principles that again let's say you and i have some sort of conflict if we're able to talk it out we'll probably find out that it comes down to something that we didn't realize one of us had x perspective and the other one had why so maybe like you thought that i was going to send something over to another person and i didn't do it and then you felt like i was incompetent at the end of the day it was probably just that we had some misunderstanding about our roles and responsibilities and so this allows you to in those moments be like oh wait this is what is not explicitly stated let's let's sort of codify that so i'm very excited about dow tools that do things like that as opposed to trying to create entirely new systems that feel like they're they're forcing i always forget the phrasing but like a square a square peg into a round hole there we go exactly yes so speaking of dow tools a lot of daos congregate on discord what are your thoughts about discord as a platform for dao discussion and as a dao forum i think discord is really challenging alone i mean of course like everyone says discord sucks that's not i feel like eventually we might get somewhere else but i also think a lot of it is actually a lot of the friction that people currently attribute to discord is actually friction that comes from not having really great again models and practices and patterns because at the end of the day a lot of this stuff is very human i think you can even use discord as a a tool to build an organization where humans thrive i don't think that there's anything about discord that makes it so terrible it can't be used but i think there are definitely things that make it challenging like it would be really nice to have certain features and and some things would be made a lot easier from discord i don't think it holds people back as much as they think it does maybe that's the hot take well you speak as a young person but i can tell you as an old i i find discord extremely challenging do you find it more challenging than slack yes for sure really oh for sure i mean granted i'm also not a big slack user so maybe it's just that i don't know but i feel like i when i've used slack in the past i could at least figure it out with discord i literally i finally was just like to my assistant okay i'm gonna give you the password can you get me into these discords where like i'm joining and then like nothing happens um that is very valid i think i like messed something up along the way so now like nothing works do you know what i mean and it like got all backed up and and i being so focused on the book and like super busy with all that i like never got to fix it and so there's like some problem like from months back that i never resolved so it's just been like slightly um not working for me for kind of a long time but anyway nobody cares uh but it will be fixed to you guys because it's happening right now as i'm recording this um but you bring up a good point i do think that my experience of discord as someone who grew up with this type even of messaging platform like i i didn't really even do the aim stuff which is sad i don't understand a lot of crypto references because i'm not a millennial even but in any case i think that it's a very good point and something that makes discord problematic yeah and i'm so old that i like didn't even have email until i went to college and like growing up just used a corded phone to talk to my friends discord's a little bit of a different energy from a corded phone for sure a little bit um so one other thing i want to ask you about was obviously so daos and nfts have kind of like a big intersection point so when you look at the future like where do you see that that going like how do you think they'll intersect i think that dows are going to be the chosen mechanism for coordinating people and humans and all of like the things that come when you need to actually create something and and coordinate all that stuff i think nfts are going to be the way that we engage with a lot of like media and things like that so i see most nft communities as dows and i think a lot of daos will leverage nfts something that i'm really excited about that i'm seeing a lot more of and it totally makes sense when you think about this entire conversation is we have tokens that's fine we'll figure out how to use those for governance let's give contributors nfts so with orca for example which for anyone who isn't familiar orca is a protocol that essentially codifies like working groups within a dao so they're called pods and you have members of a given pod that have control over a multi-sig typically like the the sort of primitive is a multi-sig with nfts that give you membership to a pod which can allow you to control the multi-sig so i think what we're going to see a lot more of and orca is a perfect example of this is nft is being used as a way to not only represent membership which can give you access to something like a multi-sig but also to give you governance rights more broadly as a contributor and so i think you know even the ability to have really rich metadata in nfts which is not the case with erc20 tokens gives us an ability to do a lot more with governance and i'm already talking i'm seeing this a little bit as bubbling up and so i think it's going to be something that ends up being really really important over the next year and then of course longer term i think we're going to see way crazier mixes of these two things but in in the beginning i think this is going to be one of the big ways that dows and nfts intersect and what other trends and downs are you looking out for in the upcoming months or even kind of like the next year or two one of them if you couldn't tell is definitely articulating values and expectations like it's so boring but it's so important and i think so many organizations companies don't do this well i think dows have an opportunity to do it really well information information asymmetry i think is really toxic for dao so having that type of thing i think is incredibly important this notion of how we think about the value of governance tokens i expect to be a big one in that vein i think inflationary governance tokens are going to be really important so when you think about the way that governance tokens are currently distributed it tends to be to a lot to the founding team and then also potentially to venture capital and i think the challenge with that is over time as an organization changes the founders or the vcs that originally backed adao might not actually be the right people to be holding those tokens and actually even more so early contributors might not be at all even interested in the organization anymore but they actually have a lot of governance power and i think that's a flawed model i think we're going to realize that and it's probably going to be a painful process but one of the really interesting ways i think to approach that is inflationary governance tokens where you have the ability to create new tokens give those to existing to contributors that are actually actively contributing and effectively dilute earlier founders and vcs and all that i think it's going to take a while to see that in term sheets i think that's not something that vcs are going to be excited about which is very fair but i do think that over time we're going to realize that that's actually one of the best ways to make sure that we have contributors that are aligned not just on values but also in being able to govern the organization itself huh that's super interesting i i like that idea so is there anything that i haven't asked you that you would like my listeners to know i don't think so this is a fun chat on dows the the concept of dows have gone have come such a long way and your reporting on the dao was such a perfect example of this because i think a lot of people in the space had no idea that there was even and when i say in the space i mean people who have come in in the last year and gotten excited about dao's really had no idea not only that there was an original dao but that it caused the ethereum fork so oh wow wait and did you read my book i didn't but i bought the audiobook or i i have it in like my amazon card or whatever um or on my watch list and i was super stoked about um listening to that podcast because every single aspect of it i was like this is the problem like this is why we need to have better mechanisms for governance because all of the stuff that was on chain and and having all of that was like oh my god we're going to recreate the same problem if we're not careful you're talking about the episode with griff and left harrison kristoff uh yes i think so it was it was a little it was like a whole story of everything that happened and how you figured out what was going on oh oh the one about how i figured out who the dow attacker was yes yes oh okay okay okay but it was really really interesting in the context of all this because it's the same it's all the same challenges you know and it was like okay we're going to be redoing this over again yeah i i actually want to hear from you after you actually listen to my book because i think you'll have a greater understanding of all the craziness that went on in the dao i'm very excited we're still very early i think it's always uh always remembering that but that was like proto-dow and it was like so early and the whole thing just ended up being so crazy okay so where can people learn more about you and all of your work yes um mostly on twitter that's where i exist and i have my podcast on the other side which is on pretty much every platform but that's linked in my twitter bio and your twitter is oh chaser chapman so it's chase chapman but with an r in the middle okay perfect all right
