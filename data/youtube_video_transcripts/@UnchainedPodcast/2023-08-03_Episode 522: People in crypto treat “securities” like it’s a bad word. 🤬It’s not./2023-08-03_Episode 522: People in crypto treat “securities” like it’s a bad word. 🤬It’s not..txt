there's I think 40 50 60 million Americans that own Securities and trade Securities that's not a problem something being a security is not a problem where it is a problem is well with a lot of these networks the asset has a utility component and that a user ought to be able to uh you to spend the asset in order to consume a service and that's where an asset being deemed to security can be problematic because it means that I if I send it to you as a form of payment or I just use it in a game or something if that's a Securities transaction that's a lot of hair around it and so that's not sustainable so this ruling is really important to protect that aspect of the space the fact that the average user not the investor transactions with investors should be regulated it should be subject to disclosures and so it should be subject to investor protections and and other such things
