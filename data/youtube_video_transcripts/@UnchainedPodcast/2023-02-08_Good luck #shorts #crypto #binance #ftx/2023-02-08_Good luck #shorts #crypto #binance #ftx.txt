so binance is organizing a Consortium to try to rebuild trust in crypto good luck I do wonder what inspired binance to do this besides you know everything when I hear about a Consortium to rebuild trust in crypto I think what I imagine is that scene in Mean Girls in the gym where they all apologize to each other and then do trust falls into one another I'm picturing SPF on stage sobbing about how he's innocent and then he turns around falls back and everyone steps away and SBF just I don't know maybe vitalik would try to catch him he does seem really nice a Consortium seems like exactly what people who lost their money because of the collapse of FTX want well a Consortium or their money back Finance isn't going to run the organization actually nobody will it's a decentralized organization which might be an oxymoron I'd Advocate calling it desensin kryptos decentralized Center
