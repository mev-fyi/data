today's guest is matt luego project lead for TV TC welcome Matt hey Laura thanks for having me just a heads up for listeners the main topic of today's show is TBT see but we're recording before at the launch and so by the time this comes out TV TC will just have gone live so Matt I guess I'll give you a pre-emptive congratulations thanks yeah hopefully hopefully that doesn't become the headline that so you're involved in a number of companies foals keep thisis and obviously know T PTC which is in a company but a project can you explain all the various things you do and also talk about where t BTC fits in yeah sure so clearly I've got a bit of brand ADHD I I like to like to work on a lot of things so I started I started fold in 2014 and it originally it was a Bitcoin kind of 1.0 payments company and since then you know when Bitcoin kind of stopped the the narrative for payments died and we started realizing this store value is really what made more sense for Bitcoin we started pivoting fold but but I got bored so we found a new team to run fold the CEO will Rives us frankly a better a better consumer app CEO than I could ever be and and they have raised their own money and they're doing their own thing but then we started working on something different called keep and I started to realize that I I really like starting things and then growing them but eventually I'll probably want to step out so when we started keep which is a confidential data layer for aetherium we also started working on this kind of parent company model called thesis and the idea behind thesis is the tying thread between all of our projects which is you know empowering individuals and protecting individual rights and liberties so yeah so thesis is the parent company of fold and of keep and this latest project t BTC is an app built on top of keep to bridge bay point in the theorem and how did you come up and well so why don't you describe what t BTC is and how you came up with the idea for it yeah sure so it's it's a bridge between Bitcoin and etherium and I mean that in a couple ways on the technical side what what we will learn to accomplish is take all the things that we love about Bitcoin and make them accessible on aetherium so so what is that so bitcoins hard money it's censorship resistant obviously it's digital but you know that sort of table stakes and so we said okay if we were to have a one-to-one Bitcoin back token on aetherium how could we preserve those properties so we made sure that there wasn't really a way to there's not a way to print more there's not a way to mess with the supply but the next part and this is the tough part is also making sure that this bridge is censorship resistant and resilient to you know government or corporate intervention so that was our goal on the tech side but the other piece is its hummus geological like I'm totally outside my field here but I think it's really interesting which is over the years crypto has split into these like this Bitcoin purist group this like group around aetherium and then a whole bunch of other little splinter cells and the Bitcoin folks are sort of their more fiscally conservative the entire hard money narrative is it draws a very particular kind of person me included frankly and then on the etherium side we have these sort of like techno optimists who who lean a little like almost left anarchist and so you know what I really want to do with this project is I don't think that coin versa theorem is a useful dynamic in the space I think it's really Bitcoin in all of crypto vs. the world versus the money printers and and banks taking advantage of the situation that we all find ourselves in so that's what t BTC is both on the tech side but also kind of my aspirations for it and I just have to ask you to tell your personal story of oh yeah because I just love that story and people might but in case my listeners didn't for sure for sure yes so we so I've been in the space for a little while and we have a little bit of crypto not you know not like some crazy people but a little bit and so you know when our second child came along we we were living in the bay for a while and it's just like it's very hard to raise a couple kids in the base so we moved back to Georgia and you know my wife was like well now in this market like we can definitely buy a house right and I was like yeah that sounds great let's get a house for our kids and so she said cool well this is why you've got all that crypto and I did not like that and was I was trying to like you know explain no this is like a long-term holding we really can't I would look at date anything else in our lives before I would sell this so I said okay what if I can find a loan and this was kind of before before loan desks really became more popular like lately we have tools like block fly but um so I went to a local lender that my family recommended that said they were crypto friendly and I I met them and I said hey um you know here's how much crypto I can use as collateral for this I'd love to love to do this and they said yeah we're totally crypto friendly and we're so glad that you have this crypto why don't you sell it come back in 30 days and we'll pretend like we never had this conversation and so I never want to name and shame these guys because it's like a small local joint but like I guess they thought that I wanted to avoid taxes or anti money laundering or something I don't know I don't know how it was something sketchy so ever since then like on the Bitcoin side obviously like I think it's good collateral and and I think the hard money narrative is strong but the thing that you get on on the etherium side is a little bit more like I have this kind of millennial finance idea where it's like why would I ever have to talk to a human to get a loan against collateral that I already have that's provable and so I kind of started thinking it would be really cool if I could get a died alone against that Bitcoin it would be really cool if I could you know I mean ultimately I think that I should have should have just been able to talk to somebody and get a mortgage at a super incredible rate because they could see this additional collateral but but I really shouldn't have to talk to anyone and so that's what led me to getting really interested in this problem of bringing hard money and bringing Bitcoin to defy and etherium but so one thing I just want to kind of break down and understand is like why is it that important to have Bitcoin in particular like what do you feel that you can't do in defy using aetherium that you could do with BTC yeah so I mean I think there's like there's like a really pragmatic answer that the etherium folks like and then there's also maybe a little bit more philosophical and answer so the pragmatic answer is Bitcoin has 10x the liquidity of ether and finding a way to access that via defy is critical I don't want to say that ether right now is tapped like there's still there's still more money sloshing around to use as collateral for sure but there's this whole huge user base in Bitcoin of people who have never touched aetherium because they've never really been given a reason and so and so you know it's not it's not necessarily the defy needs Bitcoin I would argue that but a lot of dphi people disagree but they do need users and it's a lot easier to tell someone like hey you love Bitcoin why don't you try this new technology bring your Bitcoin with you than it is to convince someone off the street like you know what is the value proposition for a mainstream person today for defy hey you can take this incredibly over collateralized loan to get 3x leverage - it's just like so far outside of their day-to-day and obviously I'm interested in that but like it's not you know it's not like it's just it's not something that most people are gonna care about day to day yeah yeah so so that's pragmatic philosophically you know I like aetherium the technology quite a bit as a developer it's given me tons of tools I'm not yet convinced of the asset I think the story of replacing central banks with an algorithmic alternative which is Bitcoin is much stronger than ethers current value proposition that could totally change I'm not an economist but that's kind of the direction I come from yeah it's really interesting you're bringing this up because in my most recent unchained I interviewed Cathy wood and her blockchain analyst yes Seattle mantra and I noticed on Twitter later that people were saying like oh you know these are investors and they're like saying Bitcoin is like the main thing to invest in and but but we think ether is is money and it's in Festival and and they were kind of taking issue with how in the episode Kathy and yes scene where sing like a theorem is more like technology and you know it's not like I have a stance but but I would agree that you know Bitcoin has a certain its monetary policy probably is more in line with yeah something that's kind of purely financial but one thing I wanted to ask you was so T BTC is somewhat similar to some existing products liquid or W BTC so how do you differentiate T BTC from those oh yeah so so I think there are two I think there's kind of two interesting camps for alternatives so liquid is great it kind of started to show people what we could do we've all been talking about this idea of side chains and bitcoins so how can we expand bitcoins utility in a way that is safe and doesn't kind of sacrifice the stability on on the main chain and so so side chains was this idea that we've been talking about since like 2013 and in their heart because to do a really great perfectly like the sort of the strongest version would require some changes to Bitcoin that people aren't willing to what to make so block stream launched liquid and it's it's kind of this it's like what is the what is the almost simplest way you could do this and still call it a sidechain so the basic structure is you've got 15 members of a federation and so on the bitcoin side what you're doing is you're saying you know here's my bitcoin and you put it into a multi SiC and this multi-sig is composed of these 15 members and that's it so it's sort of like I mean you don't even need to worry about the tech for a second it's sort of like if you were to just give your money to a consortium and then hope they gave it back to you and what's interesting about this consortium is it's across many jurisdictions so it's very hard to actually like sue them if you want legal recourse and then when the consortium does is they're running this faster chain that has some additional power and then if you want you can ask them for your money back so here's my problem with that structure you have to ask them for your money back so permissionless you know is not a thing here and and it's maybe the closest we could get when liquid was first launched so for me that's sort of like it's just a Bitcoin bank it's kind of like if I were to to give give Walmart money for a gift card like I hope they'll let me redeem it for the same amount that I got it for but that's not why I got into space is to hope that people would would give me my money back so but but you know is a great step forward is it's a good effort um and then W BTC is quite quite similar the difference between liquid and WBT see though is liquid once you have money and liquid it's like what do I do with it so you can move it between exchanges but there's really not a lot more with WBT see it's quite a it's quite a similar idea to liquid but with even fewer Federation members right now the only custodians bit go and but you can plug in to defy so like now you have Bitcoin and you can you can use you know compound or whatever else on defy so at least there's like stuff to do but you have to going in and going out you have to kyc at any point a transaction can be censored and this is not like BIC oh they're good players they did this to help the space it's just because they're a single company that was what was legally required of them launching this right so I think those are two different approaches like they're both in my opinion Bitcoin banks but one one is kind of off off without an ecosystem and the other is tapping into the etherium ecosystem so the difference with us is we don't want you to have to ask anyone permission so you know you don't need to talk to our our company in fact we go out of our way we're trying to get our company out of this as quickly as we can and just launch this thing into the world you don't need to you know send your passport and hope it doesn't get hacked and and leaked on the dark web later you don't need to ask permission for for redeeming your Bitcoin and so what we've done is we've taken this like Federation idea originally in liquid and we've expanded it to mate to way way way way more people so that each deposit of Bitcoin gets us on Federation and then that Federation also puts down money so if they're dishonest you can just take their collateral and you'll actually have made more money than they did being dishonest with you so it's not quite the same as like perfect trust lessness that we that we expect on Bitcoin l1 but it's I think it's as close as you can get and so walk us through everything that happens when someone comes to the system and wants to create one T BTC yeah sure so yeah so I think how deep you want me to go well it just I have a whole bunch of detailed questions here but I know that if I ask this one you'll probably explain most of it and for whatever you don't I can dive in and ask the the more specific questions fair enough okay well I'll still try to keep it a little short I know I don't want to bore you so so here's the rough idea you can go to this step initially it's it's going to be TV PCI Network but shortly after launch you'll be able to run it on your own machine or ipfs or just sort of whatever other way you'd like to get to it and if you have Bitcoin you and you have meta masks so you do need to know a little bit about aetherium in this first version you can say I'd like to make a deposit and you can choose an amount that you'd like to deposit unfortunately you can't in this version just deposit any arbitrary amount and you'll hear why in a minute so you can choose an amount up to one Bitcoin at a time to deposit and then what happens is on the etherium side you put out a request to and this is all of the infrastructure that our teams built to this random beacon on the keep network and what the random beacon does is it chooses signers from a large candidate set who will ultimately be or decentralized custodian for your Bitcoin so chooses the signers randomly and then it also says this is how much this person would like to deposit we need you to put down one hundred and fifty percent of that deposits value in ether and so now these guys are bonded they've agreed they come back and they say here's here's a Bitcoin address the way the Bitcoin address works it's quite similar to multi-sig it's it's actually a little fancier it's called threshold ECDSA but the basic idea is that all of these signers have to agree to move money and then you as the user back up here in your browser are like okay this looks great I see a place I can pay Bitcoin I'm going to pay so you send your Bitcoin and then and this is one of the coolest parts this is the name of my favorite part so once you send Bitcoin you then send a proof to aetherium that shows that you paid Bitcoin and so at this point you've only talked to the etherium chain and now you've talked to the Bitcoin gene you don't need to talk to anyone else you prove that you've made this deposit and once that happens T BTC can be minted on the etherium side there's a small fee taken I think it's incredibly low at launch but it'll it'll end up fluctuating with the market and then on the other side you now have this this see token so as cool as that part is if you can't get back to your Bitcoin that's not a great trick so Redemption the way that that works is you take your you take your token tokens back to a particular deposit group and you say I'd like to redeem this and then all of them come together to make a signature to move funds and then they take your your tokens and they burn them so it maintains this one-to-one supply peg and at any time if those guys either if they send the Bitcoin to the wrong place or they don't send you the Bitcoin their collateral is ceased and an auctioned off and then it's given back to you plus profit so there's a pretty huge incentive for these guys to be honest and timely and then you know you sort of pay them for their time with that fee so they're happy with with the profit in the system and that's that's it I mean that's that's in the end and how do people sign up to to be signers like hey great question so so earlier I was talking about liquid and a fixed Federation and I was complaining but I didn't really say anything about an alternative right so the way that we work and the way that you join the candidates set is initially we have a permission set and that's a whole whole slew of people will be sharing over the next few days it's a mix of like you know like the sea types and like professional operators sticking providers like bison trails and staked and Figment so at launch all of these guys will be there and I think we should be able to get to around 80 signers and then see coinbase custody and Anchorage you did yeah yeah so yeah so both coinbase custody and Anchorage are also going to be working here I think they're figuring out how much they're gonna stake versus outsourcing but yeah it is so if you're either of their customers you can just sort of get in there and you can you can do it and then June 8th we are going to start opening up the signer set to everyone so you know on the one hand like this system requires a lot of ether so we actually in the first version we need enough ether and make sure the we're confident that this Bitcoin won't be stolen so we needed ether in the system but also like as much as like ultimately I want a wide signer set and I want this to be a system that's resilient across jurisdictions and the whole team wants that so we need these these signers to be everywhere and we need them to be in in different regulatory environments we need them to be geographically distributed so so what we're doing is we're launching something that we are calling a stake drop June 8th and the idea is that you can take your ether and and you can start staking and you don't you don't actually need to have any pre-existing arrangement with us you can put your ether down and you can act as a signer and there'll be a brief period where anyone can do that it's looking like it's going to be three to six months or pinning down the exact length of time and once you do that if you prove that you're good at being a signer you'll then be granted these tokens that allow you to sign whenever you'd like one thing that I was also wondering though for when you open it up is so obviously they need to be able to keep enough collateral that's you know 150 percent ease against whatever BTC they're signing for but like because that exchange rate is changing constantly totally how can you be sure that they'll have enough if the exchange rate changes like there's some way of proving how much ether they have and that they'll keep it in reserve or like how does that work yes there's there were a couple like options here so one is treating this like a margin account right so like if if the exchange rate goes too low you know signers can like top-up and put in more ether but the problem with that is even if you make it incredibly easy to talk top-up you need a lot of people to coordinate very quickly to do that otherwise you have this situation where like you know maybe one it's like a common situation where one person ends up paying for the other signers and so we realized that we really can't treat this like a margin account so instead what happens is if any of these if any of these deposits goes under collateralized the deposit opens up and any any signer or anyone can and redeem the deposit so the idea is that if the signers want to get out of this situation because they think that ether is you know in the middle of taking a big drop or a lot of to Bitcoin or something like that they can actually just close their deposit and redeem the Bitcoin and get their ether back and sort of rebalance their books are what they'd like and so one thing that I wasn't clear on is are you moving to a system where people will only be staking keep or are you moving to a system that's more similar to multi collateral to I where you're just going to keep adding collateral types yeah so oh I know that sounds impossible so okay so we could have launched a system where you just where you just use keep but here's the thing you know again I come from Bitcoin land and it is totally unclear to me that this token that we're launching is going to magically be good collateral overnight it takes a lot of time for things to to be trusted and have liquidity and so and to actually be good collateral so the way that I look at this is this version we've really overdone it with collateral so that we can make sure that you know no one no one can lose a cent here if you're a Bitcoin er and you're playing with a theorem for the first time using this system and you lose money you're never going to come back and so we really overdid it with both the ether and the keep and this first in this first design because we just can't have anyone have a mistake like that what we're moving toward eventually is once we see the fees that a system like this can take in there's this trick where you say okay how much am I making how much is that worth to me over time and you can basically treat you know your position as a signer is this like income generating property so now we know that that's valuable to you and it can act as partial collateral and then the second piece is okay well will it just be ether so so I guess what I'm saying is first I would like to lower the ether requirement I think we can get it like my very rough models have said maybe like 40 or 50 percent can be ether and some future design that's impossible in this version of the system though because I want people to be confident we don't have like the power to upgrade the system or anything so maybe maybe we'll have this multi collateral future but I think what we're seeing maker run into right now is that there aren't that many interesting assets on aetherium and I know that's like a theory and people don't want me to say that but um you know there's there's some security tokens which are not really my jam but I see why people want real estate on chain there's some interesting systems like auger where the token does have properties that maybe matter and then there's ether and almost everything else it doesn't I mean a lot of it doesn't have a reason to exist you know a lot of it was a speculative like land grab and that's like the nicest way I could possibly say that and so and so maybe we'll end up moving to multi collateral but I think we'll find ourselves in a similar position to maker which is you know there's not that much good collateral to have on this chain there's ether hopefully I hope that will prove that t BTC can be in that category and then there's a bunch of security tokens so I guess I was like I just have so many questions about this but one of them is like keep you know if either can we use like what is the purpose of keep oh yeah yeah why is it totally yeah it's sort of I mean you were talking about a land grab and now it feels like there could be an argument made that this also isn't necessary 100% so I think if we yeah oh gosh you ready for some radical candor so I think if we so I think that there's like sort of like two very different takes on this so one is if we ship T BTC like just the way it is and we increase the collateralization to like two hundred percent you would never need another token and people can just keep dumping ether in and so like that's super inefficient from a capital standpoint but that's like one way to do it and then we could just walk away and the thing would exist eventually though someone would build something that required way less and the system that requires way less is the system that we're building with keep so what's really great about using and it doesn't have to be a fungible token that was an early decision we made but it could be an NF T 4 signers as well is if one of these guys cheats you kick them out of the system so if you only use ether as collateral and somebody loses their ether they can come right back and they'll just have more ether like it's such a large cap that there's really not a way to exclude them without burning all of the ether in circulation but a workto can like keep the idea is that if someone does something malicious so I don't mean like I messed up or like I became under collateralised eye but I mean I stole Bitcoin if you steal Bitcoin and a system like this we take all of your keep and you're ejected from the network you can't join as a signer unless you buy back in and very quickly because this is a work token there's no liquidity that's not you know it's not really a property of a token that's primarily used like a taxi medallion so I think like in v1 if we increase the collateralization quite a bit I could probably build some sort of system that didn't require any sort of work token but as we move more and more toward lessening the need for earth you either need a token like key which is an E or C 20 or you would need to give people a whole bunch of NF T's that represent their like signing rights and then take those away from them so it is a pretty necessary part of the eventual capital efficient system we're building but yeah I could totally imagine building this in a way that was just much more expensive but that didn't have another token at the beginning so essentially tell me if I've got this right you're gonna do this stake drop it's gonna be six months and then after that there it there won't be a way for people to like earn more keep to enter the system that's right either they get kicked out in which case they'll have to buy keep again to get back in oh and after that six months like anybody who wants to join after will have to buy keep to get back in is that what you're saying I have no idea if they'll be able to buy it but yeah they'll have to hold it somehow and yeah so it just gives us a way to basically say this person is a bad actor they've proven it cryptographically they're clearly a bad actor or they were hacked in which case they're incompetent they shouldn't be on the network and you can just eject them and when you say you don't know if they'll be able to buy it you're just saying you haven't requested any exchanges to list it but no no I can't and that it people won't be able to but like in what scenario what that happened oh yeah well you look at systems like so for a long time it was very difficult to get mkr and it was just a it was just a bunch of kind of I mean you know I don't want to totally mischaracterize cuz I wasn't there but my friends were early mkr holders were true believers who were constantly meeting up in video calls and it was very difficult to get a hold of the token and even now it's a pretty low liquidity token and I think what we're looking for is something somewhere here with keep where if you hold this the reason you hold this is because you want to participate in the network and if you if you don't like but that's sort of it that's sort of the only option so maybe maybe you buy it we've got a grant program where we're making sure that folks who we think would be excellent stewards of the network can get keep regardless of whether or not they want to put money down and yeah we'll just see how it goes okay I'm gonna ask you more about that in a second but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible

right before the break you kind of were saying that people could like be chosen if the if the system thought they would be good stewards like how would that work is there like a yeah yeah so so there's there's two components right so with the stick drop it's just prove that you don't lose money for a period of time and that you're honest and then you'll and then you'll be granted this position as a signer and you'll get these tokens and then for now what we're doing is is we're playing in a test net game we're calling and playing for keeps because we got tired of everyone calling it game of game of thones or tags or whatever and so the idea is that that anyone who can prove that they're a good sticker right now on test night and then who like add to the community so maybe they're like doing translations or they're helping other people learn to use the system they can just be granted a position as a signer and the tokens that will let them sign on may not so so the downside of that is its permissioned right so like my team not really my team we actually have a panel of outside judges but people that are affiliated in some way with me and that know me are going to be granting these to people that they think would be good so that's like the human component and then the part that's just objective is the stake drop where you just put your money where your mouth is and if you're honest you can keep using the system okay this yeah this it sounds interesting I I guess one other thing though is like we were talking before about adding other types of collateral is there like some system for determining you know obviously now we can say like maybe there aren't that many compelling collateral types but sure down the line if there are is there a way to to add yeah so I'm about to say total left turn on you here sorry if this is if this sounds like a lot so like there's this trend to be incredibly governor bull and upgradeable in aetherium and like the like geeky engineer Optimus to me thinks it's so cool but the craggly Bitcoin OPSEC security guy is like what are you doing you know the whole premise of this space is censorship resistance and immutability and people not being able to sort of like mess with things so so so when i talk about like a v1 or v2 i have no no idea if v2 will exist i could get hit by a bus and our whole team could you know cove it i don't know anything could happen that prevents that from being a thing and so you know no one should get involved with the system assuming that that there will be a v2 and and we have not built in anything to allow the team to upgrade the system as it runs and the reason that we did that outside of like sort of philosophical leanings is if you're a Bitcoin ER like it takes an incredible incredible amount of coordination to change Bitcoin even for a soft work and for a hard work we've seen that fail and I was there on the frontlines watching that fail and so 2x I'm talking about Segway to X I'm talking about I was I was a what was it I was a Bitcoin classic supporter all out myself I was a big blocker like yeah I was a big blocker until segue to X and when I saw how that was going I was like no this is wrong like we can't make these decisions with a bunch of companies in a room in New York that is wrong and not what the system is supposed to be about so originally I was like engineer engineer we need to this thing we need big blocks and then I became I just sort of realized like what is Bitcoin for if it can't be for payments at l1 that's okay the most important thing is that it's not captured and so anyway so this kind of really it really shaped how I look at these systems and so what I've done is you know the team does have a privileged key to this system but I can name all the things that privileged key can do so the first thing is let's avoid a kill switch let's avoid an upgrade process and a kill switch so here's the one closest thing we can do to a kill switch which is if there is a zero day exploit and we think a whole bunch of people's funds are at risk in t BTC the dev team has a multi sig wallet that can press a button one time that will pause t bt sees new deposits for ten days that's it you can't press the button again if I'm compelled by law enforcement to press the button it only lasts for ten days and then after that we have three other functions that that key can do one is to set the signing fee we do not yet know how how the market will discover signing fees and we're just going to have to mess with it but what we've done to keep that from being incredibly dangerous for users is we've said this only impacts new deposits so anyone would have to opt-in before this became effective and it's in a tight range we can't set it to like a hundred percent or something the second is we can set or sorry the third is that we can set collateralization ratios and that's also tightly bound it has to be over a hundred percent and less than three hundred percent and then the third and then the third is oh there's another there's another fee right structure that we can set as well so there's this enumeration of these are all of the things that this dev team can do to this system so if there's a v2 it'll be because a p-- whole bunch of people on twitter trolled us so hard that v ones not good enough and it'll be because we think that we have a better design and we'll propose it and if people like it they can move to it but I just want to be really clear so this discussion of you vitu like v2 is is we have some designs but like please don't get involved the system expecting any of that stuff and wait I'm sorry so just like I asked whether or not you're gonna add collateral to that you're not going to fiddle with the system is that what you're saying that is what I'm saying so so we are going to try to add new types of collateral in this next version but but in this version the only the only acceptable collateral is ether and all that keep does is it can additionally kick out malicious signers that's it you guys are working on potentially having a next version yeah but you're saying nobody should put their hopes on you guys are launching it something that is what I'm saying yeah I know that I it might sound like two sides of my mouth but I'm actually trying to do people a favor here right so like in the etherium space people love to say like oh well this is how it will work so you know I had actually I had a really terrible public eating crow incident the other day where as I'm trying to explain to bitcoiners what's interesting about aetherium you know they're like I don't see anything here that's new and they're mostly right like there are a couple things that are really cool but a lot of it isn't new and you could just do with like multisig on Bitcoin so one of the things that is new is robust privacy like robust privacy tools you can launch a new snark circuit or another sort of like privacy tool on aetherium and so I've been really excited about tornado cache right it's not like it's not as robust as something like Z cache but but it's interesting and it's on aetherium and you can use it today so I've been so excited about it that I've been telling people like you should really check this out and consider this as an alternative to coin join and and I got into this little Twitter spat with Odie who if you guys are familiar with cryptic Twitter he's a fun fun guy I got into the spat with him and he said you know this isn't the robust thing you think it is and I actually looked at the contract and I realized the team has the power to upgrade the contract in such a way that my funds could be totally moved and and so like look I'm so excited about tornado cash but not yet and there was just this misunderstanding where a bunch of us in the community thought this thing was ready to roll but it's not gonna be ready to roll for another three to six months and it looks the same to users and so for me it's really important to say hey guys this week by the time this podcast is hurt you know you'll be able to start interacting with this system and you'll be able to start playing with your Bitcoin on aetherium but you know all of these ideas of new collateral and and more efficiency and better privacy constructs their ideas that our team has for v2 and you know we'll probably still call it TBD see but it's incumbent on you like these tools are sharp and you have to do your diligence and I and I don't want to I don't want people think that this is magically just gonna like get better without them paying attention and okay so just so I understand also about the v2 sure like if you were to ever launch something like that would you have to wind down the current TB TC Network okay so no so it's totally a social it's like it's sort of like a hard work it's a coordination event so if people like me to better they can drain their Bitcoin from v1 and they can move it over if they just want to keep using v1 forever cool we didn't know again we don't have like a long-term stop button and I mean you know I guess what I'm trying to say is I think that even though that might be in my business interests I don't think that's in the users interests and so that's why we made sure you're not included okay so it's a little bit different from the transition from a sighted I where if I remember correctly I think there was was there a deadline unlike when yeah okay and they were trying to move everybody but you if you were to ever launch a v2 it would be like up to people whether or not they wanted to use it the news is that's right that's right and with my CEO hat on guys we're totally launching a b2 but with my bit corner hat on please don't trust me alright okay so one other thing that I wanted to ask about was for when people meant TBT see you know obviously the number of signers is going to be somewhat limited do you have a sense of how many there will be yeah so it should be around between eighty to a hundred that's start and then I expect that before the state drop will start to approach 200 we're trying to take this thing kind of slow so it could go slower but I think the most important thing is that users can see so as as you decide to mint TBT see you can actually see how large the signer set is and decide like am i comfortable with this security the other thing that we're doing is in in the depth that we run we can't do this in the contracts but in the tap that we run we're actually going to limit the initial deposit size to pretty small and then slowly ramp it up so people can you know play with this thing and get comfortable before we are off to the races so anyone who's integrating in the contracts they can just go for it and and Yolo it's your life savings if you want to put it on the line that's your choice but um but the rest of us who are using the step will get you know appropriate warnings and you know take it easy don't move too much money until you feel good and as for choosing the signers you have this random beacon that does that but I guess I was wondering is it always randomly choosing a different set of signers each time or is it like groups within yeah so so it's actually always choosing random signers um so so the way so I'm gonna try to not delve a bit random beacon is super interesting and if you guys are familiar with if to like it's kind of an alternative design to what the youth 2 team is shipped but it's on 8th one so it's it's super interesting but the basic idea is that we're just sampling so we use this idea called like sortition which if you look into it it's actually really fascinating just from like a governance perspective it's this way to randomly elect a pea and and the Greeks actually have a history of doing it so I would really suggest if you feel like going on a Wikipedia rabbit hole to check out that but we use sortition to to choose signers randomly and you know a guarantee of the system or a guarantee that we can't offer in the system that you can and something like liquid is we don't know if these people are different people are not ultimately you know these people aren't all aren't all like providing their kyc information every time they sign so you're not confident that these are different people and so it's important with this random beacon is just to make sure that each time it is actually random and that folks aren't colluding and then the other thing is that even if they are occluding that's why we have all this extra ether so that if they do try to her to use or the users got recourse and one other thing that I heard you talking about on a different podcast was you're gonna allow EBT C as a collateral type yeah I didn't I was trying to listen sort of quickly so can you explain it yes so this is this has totally been kicked to v2 but it's one of my favorite pet ideas and keep going yeah oh it's totally is it took me a long while to like convince myself that it was real so like if you use the system like maker and die and if you make die backed by die so synthetic backed by itself the system diverges right like it's gonna swing more and more wildly because every time the bass swings the collateral also swings so every time it would swing up it would swing up harder every time it swings down it'll swing down harder but in a system like this what you're actually saying if you use T BTC backed by T BTC and this is a huge difference it's like people are like is T BTC a synthetic no and this is exactly why is if you use T BTC to collateralize Morty BTC what you're actually doing is you're taking T BTC off the market and you're having signers put more of their own Bitcoin at risk and so you do that and and what it does is it provides more system security but less system utility on the and so like you ask yourself like well why would you do that well if everyone is moving their Bitcoin to the etherium chain to get leverage on it as collateral that's okay that's actually fine so anyway it's really interesting like I cannot wait to like provide a proper formal treatment of this thing because it's it's really kind of a counterintuitive economic effect and anyway so so I think let me make sure that I even understood what you said because it sounded like what you were saying is that essentially a signer the signers will be like minting t BTC and so they'll be oh okay oh so now that makes more sense to me yeah yeah so the signers are basically they also become depositors or I mean they could have bought it on the market or whatever but it's like you know so it actually has this like increased structural property to the system but like balancing those incentives is is going to be tricky okay so something that I was wondering about and this mostly applies like especially for eath backed T BTC sure could there ever be a situation where the price of that collateral crashes and then it would just make more sense for the signers to just steal the TPA and take whatever punishment they get because like their collateral is just so worthless like it doesn't even make you know what I mean Oh totally yeah so so here's how here's how I I will reframe it the way that I like to talk about it so here's how I like to think of it right so like if the eath became zero overnight this system falls back to security like liquid which is that these people are going to be honest by default and that most of them will run the default software and that probably if you go to withdraw your Bitcoin you'll get it out but yes the incentives totally skew so because we're starting with a hundred fifty percent over collateralization if you were to lose 33 percent if to be DC and like less than six hours this is where things start to get crazy so eath takes a total nosedive relative to Bitcoin or or alternatively Bitcoin goes on a run and it doesn't follow and these collateral these deposits start moving into under collateralized and if if no one does anything they move into the liquidation and the bond the the signing bonds get sold out so again fall back to liquid mode a lot of these people the majority of these people are going to be honest we don't like to make that a primary assumption but you know this is this is what you're left with when the eath goes away and then the people who do decide who you know and they have to have prepared for this they have to have like written a malicious client upfront and be ready to like steal everyone's Bitcoin the people who do decide to actually be dishonest and steal those people this is where keep comes in they're ejected from the network and so you know maybe they get to do that once but they're never going to make these fees again especially if the work token stays yeah I think what's fascinating to me is from what you said like I can see how just having that second collateral type of keep will help at least a little bit in a Black Swan type situation because otherwise what I could imagine happening is if eath like let's say there's some sort of you know dowel hack like event and the eat price just drops precipitously like you could end up with this crazy feedback loop where TBD C is also exiting the system that's right and yeah and that would well actually now that anything about it though right yeah wait does putting T BTC in the system will that make the price of East go up yes I don't love to yes the reason we're going and I keep going back to the reason we chose so many conservative we made so many conservative design choices in this first version is we don't know now each time you mint tea BTC there's more eath locked up and so this could have a great impact on the price of ether because it's going to be its lows velocity of ether right either gets stuck in the system and so I what I don't I truly don't know and we're we're we're running simulations but I cannot if anyone like I mean I can't be sure we're right now running simulations with like a black Thursday style event like happened recently with maker and you know what happens if this loses if he loses 50 percent relative to BTC and there's a ton of our of opportunities where people should like air quotes should be minting t BTC and that could actually have a positive price support impact on ether but I just don't know and and so that's why we've kind of done this multi tier approach because can you imagine like if we just relied on keep and we only had a little either or something you know the price of keep could just be swung around everywhere and and it would really be like you would have no idea what happens and so so yeah so I think I think what would happen in that scenario is that there's an ARB opportunity to actually mint Morty BTC and that has an eighth price support I just don't know like as T BTC gets bigger that has a bigger impact and I think well it's still small it's it's you know I mean it's small it's it's more likely to break probably in the first 60 days then it will in the next three years huh okay well yeah we'll find out well and and speaking of that so you know this fact that you're only gonna have this admin key that allows you to do the pause one time if god forbid there is some kind of second situation that is life-threatening to the system venture then what like our people just screwed or joining me like it yeah it's a shirt it's a sharp thing yes is the answer so like and this is a huge difference and and and this is why you're here I mean you're hearing that you're like well is there be one or isn't there like this is why you're hearing maybe so try to be so careful with my words is if we have to use this pause there's not another one and so you either have to be very happy with how that pause got used to continue to use the system or maybe don't ever use it again you know and I think this is the sort of stuff that we as a team are trying to be much more upfront about a lot of folks in defy especially in defy right now are Cowboys and they're losing you know ten million dollars here twenty five million dollars there and you know it's sort of gratifying to be like willow caveat emptor you shoulda done your research but you know it's really hard has a user to keep up with the firehose and crypto and it's really hard to know if a system is trustworthy or not so my expectation is that if we have to use the pause button ever that probably people will use those ten days to exit and not come back that's what I would expect that's probably what I would do with my money and I there might be a few cases where that's not true so maybe there's like a widespread like zero day exploit on a whole bunch of different types of computers but but the core T V DC systems not impacted and we just didn't want people losing a lot of money so we press the button okay but if we press the button because there's a black Thursday style event that means the system wasn't it's not resilient and so my I mean you know my goal as the person who will be part of making that decision if it ever comes up is is this the economics like working as designed and if I can I don't really want to ever press the button because of an economic reason what I'd rather do is only press the button if there's a you know an actual hack that has been disclosed in advance and we know that we can save people tens of millions of dollars but if there's a if there's a huge drop in the price of eath well yeah we the systems that was designed for exactly that happening and don't press the button this is this is how it's supposed to work oh this is really fascinating because when I first heard you say that you could only press the button one time I I kind of assumed that at some point you won't you guys will need to to engage that but what you're saying is we will always have like like you're saying as long as this system exists we will have that backstop and if we ever have to use it that would be kind of life ending for the system most people would leave and like game over that's how I look at it I mean I think that's probably how I would manage my money and again this is why we've taken kind of a different approach like I have spent a long time collecting the little bit coin that I have I do not want to see it disappear I you know when I join the space it was in the middle of like the 2013 rise and then the GOx crash and that was quite oh my gosh actually I've got another one so not only did I join the space mid GOx but the day my son was born I was so that was so I'm very well I won't share cuz spat OPSEC to share his date but the BitFenix happened the big the next hack happened right around when my son was born and I was in this position where I really had to focus on my family obviously and we were having our first child but I was also seeing that I was I was long long on BitFenix and I was watching a big chunk of my life savings just get eviscerated Hague right and that was really I mean I learned a little bit via proxy with Docs and watching what happened there but I learned a lot BitFenix taught me a lot it taught me a couple things as as a user it taught me not your keys not your coin so a system like TBD C will will be weaker than keeping your Bitcoin on l1 and my hope is that we can show that it's less risky than like centralized lending for example but the other thing that it taught me and this is and this is and this part makes me sad is that people will forgive you for making huge mistakes so so I do not use BitFenix anymore and I stopped using it after that and I was done but you know a lot of people they recovered and it was sort of miraculous and it took a lot of took a lot of guts from that team and it's very impressive but so so I would hope though that if there were something similarly disruptive to t BTC that people would be out but if I'm in the position where I I try to regain that trust I mean I'm gonna try and we'll just have to see our people forgiving but I know that as a user I'm not very forgiving and I know that as a user I would probably be done huh well one other the thing I guess I thought initially when I heard about the pause button was you know we're just coming out of this period after the divorce Linda Emmie attacks and that you know in large part was caused by this issue around the ERC seven seven seven tokens being you know I kind of like having more option ality built into them but then course making yeah older systems vulnerable so I assume that you were maybe gonna use the pause button to integrate stuff like that but so you're not saying that so it it almost sounds like for things like that like as the technology improves essentially you'll just have to do something like launch a v2 is that that's right yeah that's right and if people want to keep using the old one they can and and again this also goes back to Bitcoin right we aren't constantly upgrading Bitcoin and that can give people confidence which is really powerful that's another reason like ether fear again I mean I love aetherium it's like what it lets me do as an engineer but just the institutions can't get comfortable with it like institutional investors and funds can't get it's difficult to be comfortable with ether because things can change hard Forks happen frequently and and and really big like I mean you know the ice age change over New Year's where a whole bunch of our teams were kind of like oh we need to upgrade clients very very quickly on on a holiday that that doesn't inspire confidence and so with the system we've done everything we can to I mean not to inspire confidence now but to build a system that can can build confidence and so that's why I don't want this to be I don't want anyone using the system to be do I trust Matt and his team like that's how things used to work do you trust Satoshi no it's totally irrelevant to whether or not you think that coin is is a good place for your money and I hope I hope that one day that's where the system will be too and so a couple last questions for kind of getting where we're basically over time but but just couple last questions because this is so fascinating to me so as far as I understand one of the reasons that you're interested in creating T BTC is because of the ways you can use it on defy so what are you expecting people will do with it and how do you think it will change defy yeah so I really think I mean I think it's gonna depend on obviously on people's risk profiles and defies changing very very quickly I think for me just going back to my story to scratch my own itch you know IIM DUP having to do like a side deal with a friend to say look here's my crypto collateral here's how much cash I need for this long to get this house and and I think I would really like to see dye solve that problem I would like to just open my browser or open open an app on my machine and say here's how much Bitcoin I have and then and then get a dial on that's really so I want to see that and I think we will I think we'll see sort of the collateral aspect and then I think of course they're gonna be crazier things people are likely going to do leverage and all sorts of settlement but I also think you know this is almost hard to say I think I've come off as a bit of an odd duck to both communities a lot of my a lot of my Bitcoin friends are annoyed or or wondering like what I'm doing in aetherium a lot of people in aetherium they look at me kind of askance because there's this sort of paradox of of tolerance where they're a very tolerant community and but it's hard to be tolerant of intolerance and so they're really skeptical of people who come from Bitcoin because a lot of them have said bad things about aetherium in the past and but I guess what I'm thinking and the reason I bring this up is there are more people like me there are a lot of them and I think that they might even be the silent majority that believe in the economics of Bitcoin and then the technology of aetherium and and so while I think like defy is step one and it's going to be really interesting to see Bitcoin uses collateral and see people take leverage against it and it's gonna do a lot for the defy space right we're talking about you know a 10x liquidity injection in this space that the you know the thrives on over collateralization so I think that'll be big but the biggest part the the thing that's most exciting is when people will be able to get robust privacy so not coin join but zero knowledge robust privacy on aetherium with their Bitcoin and anyway so I guess I guess that's my end game sorry I've strayed a little bit from your question but well we so just I actually just want to walk through that first second so essentially I turned my I turned my B T C into T BTC yeah and then I use it in a private transaction so then the person receiving that receives T BTC privately yeah and then they can cash it okay and when I don't think I when I ask was um what are you gonna do with your new transition Stewie's 2.0 so well again you know I can't do anything with v1 so it'll just keep on it'll just keep going and we'll see if the incentives are compatible with eath 2 or not and by the way this is exactly what I was talking about with people struggling to have confidence and aetherium so you know the first release of T BTC will continue on and maybe it will be perfectly compatible with eath 2 staking and maybe it'll it'll make it it'll make the fees shoot through the roof because no one will want to put Etha it's totally unclear but you know for my for my next for our next release that we're working on now that this one's about done this is another reason that this work token becomes much more useful so where the base collateral and the chain is not not as easy and the rates are already kind of set by the protocol on on what you need to earn there you can either compete for that collateral or you can say here's collateral that's more closely tied to the operation in the system so eventually that's my goal for keep is to move to the system where maybe you still put a little bit of aether in to make sure that everything is kosher and that you have safety margins but that almost everything relies on key ok this is interesting so which is one last question would you kind of talked about a little bit but I want to have you elaborate a little bit more what is your take on the difference between the Bitcoin and aetherium communities and like why do you think that there is kind of a bigger group that you know believes in both but for different reasons is that there isn't that big of a group that's right that's right so crypto Twitter is a fun place because it really becomes you to say ridiculous things on one side of the spectrum or another and and and they're like a handful of people that maybe are in the middle and who are trying to if we're trying to just be real or or who are trying to provoke one or the other but um but you know if you I mean the numbers don't lie like if you look at the people who own Bitcoin and ether and some tokens like most people I guess I should say I'm fairly confident I actually don't have totally have dated back to someone fairly confident that the majority of individuals who have bought Bitcoin have dabbled with another token or blockchain so I believe that's true I could be wrong but the fact that a lot of people for example by the first Bitcoin and coinbase and then there are like five other assets there it's just you know you're probably gonna try these other assets and I think that that's this like silent majority that you know like that maybe that they're excited about this idea of Bitcoin and that they see that the world is is changing you know I don't want it not to not to get to ranty about the kovat stuff but we just saw so much money printed and I think that we're all about to see whether or not we know what bitcoin is having a moment right now and and we're not really gonna see the impact of it for years but it's going to be pivotal and so I think that there are people who see that and see this macro stuff going on or they're uncomfortable with our local government they're uncomfortable with how the world is changing they're thinking about opting out but I think those people have also experimented with other things but you know as far as as far as the actual difference in like they're really vocal communities Bitcoin has developed this social immune system and I and I and I love it a lot of people don't but I do it's this idea that like anytime someone says hey try this new thing everyone else is like no that's a scam and it might not be skin and you know what their been right 98% of the time that's the thing like people they've been right most of these things have been scams and so you know earlier you know you hearing me being really soft about our having a token and then I was really reluctant it took me a long time to convince myself that there was an economic reason to do this and and that's because the vast majority of people you know there's just been money printing and bitcoin copies and this has been going on since you know all tall coins have been I think since since slight coin first launched and and so I think there's this there's this thing in Bitcoin where if you believe bitcoin is the asset that will win and it should be the asset that will win anything that threatens that narrative is in the way and conveniently most of the things that the narrative have also been a scam or at least not interesting maybe in the most charitable way so that's Bitcoin it's this hard in the community people talk about having strong hands people talk about never selling it's it's borderline a religion and I think that's incredible but it means that when you want to propose something new and Bitcoin the chance of you getting shouted down or called a scammer is incredibly high so you know it was really hard in the big block days to have a conversation about tech because actually a lot of that debate wasn't it had nothing to do with technology it was about like money crypto and this idea of what's the most important asset versus tech crypto which is this idea of like building the future and everything being so cool and whiz-bang and and so so Bitcoin is money crypto and and it's it's this hardened it's got this hardened immune system that shouts things down and calls them scams and there's a very high bar for something being acceptable and trustworthy and then in aetherium you have all the people that got kicked out as well as a whole bunch of new people who have found you know that there's this much more open community where you know okay maybe maybe aetherium saw 2017 and they saw all these scamming Aiko's but there's still like oh this is a new token this is interesting and that's sort of incredible that's sort of like tolerance and open-mindedness is sort of incredible and it does them a service and a disservice right so the services every new developer who comes into this space it's very hard to stick with Bitcoin because you'll start exploring all these ideas and not only is bitcoins l1 fairly limiting it's cool and it's interesting but it's but it is limiting not only that but also the people don't necessarily want to talk to you about your ideas because you can very quickly become heterodox just by kicking ideas around and and sort of be shunned and so in the etherium space it's the opposite where they like where unicorn costumes and do Badger dances but they also like if you have an idea they'll talk to you about it because they're like any of these ideas could change the world and so you have these very opposing viewpoints and what I really want to see is like you know bring these people together and sort of make them be in the same room because it turns out that both and I really do think of Bitcoin kind of as the right and aetherium is left both of these people are against big government they're against the sort of like corporate surveillance state they're against you know all of these that they want power to be inverted and they want it to be grassroots rather than top-down and that's so fascinating and outside of the status quo that I think that they have so much more in common that they have then that they have to fight about so yeah so those are some of the differences that I see this is now veering into the political but there is something theory of the moment that you were describing if you look at some of the populist trends yeah in the country but yeah I mean just as a journalist who's been covering this space now for oh my god you guys it's gonna be five years in a month or no it's not even in like two weeks or some three weeks which is crazy but anyway um I would say that like I do agree with you that Bitcoin has gotten traction you know as money as an asset aetherium got in traction as technology you know just just as somebody who's just kind of looking at the facts like I feel like they're they sure carved out different areas and they're not occupying the same niche and so you know what you're doing is very interesting linking the money aspect which is Bitcoin with the technology aspect which is aetherium and so I'm very interested to see how this plays out you know obviously a little concerned about you know it's just the security of it all because as we've said fine that's yeah I which isn't anything to say about your projects specifically but just notify in general that it's all the scrutiny in the world namely risky yeah but you know this looks to be super super interesting how this plays out so anyway thanks for coming on the show of course yeah I've got I've got a parting thought uh-huh thank you so much for having me we're talking about veering into the political every time we talk about this stuff it's political and I think that this is maybe using this technology is probably one of the most political things most of us will do in our lives so I just want to give you that little parting thought that getting into crypto is opting out and yeah let's do that it's you're rallying for the end of the show thank you so much for having me yeah well thanks for coming on unchanged thanks everyone for tuning in to learn more about Matt and TV TC be sure - I got some
