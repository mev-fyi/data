earning solar-powered money today my guest today is Joey Kruk co-founder of auger and Co chief investment officer of Pantera capital welcome Joey thanks for having me I had known of you for a while before I realized how young you are and so for listeners who don't know tell us your background and how you got in a crypto sure so my background is I really first got into crypto in 2011 as in high school at the time and just came across Bitcoin on this form called overclock net and started mining a little bit back then it was money with graphics cards so I was doing the same thing and I quit after a few weeks because it was making my room really hot I was in the summer it looks like 90 degrees in my room and then you didn't really do a whole lot with it again until 2014 or so when basically I kind of saw how Bitcoin was becoming this sort of digital version of gold and you know that wasn't really the sort of use case size that interested in I was more interested in the kind of disrupting the financial system side of things and so in 2014 ended up starting augur and for that basically the idea was that it was a platform for prediction markets the idea is even essentially speculate on anything on augur and it was one of the first projects on top of etherium now that's kind of how I initially got into the space and at that point you dropped out of college correct yeah that's right I was studying computer science at Pomona and in Southern California and dropped out that summer and then I guess like a year or two later you got a teal fellowship as well right yep that's right and so how did you come up with the idea for augur well so prediction markets are really you know old idea they're basically kind of a generic sort of financial market and you can use them to create revenues markets so things like you know what will the price of either be on a certain date you can create things like cut options or call options and you can also create you know more traditional kind of study markets so things I'm like who will become president United States in 2020 or you know which horse will endorse race and so the idea is an old idea and it's kind of rooted in economic theory basically two different economists one is Frederick Hayek who kind of came up with the idea and said that prices and markets are just information so she had more markets and more things you would have kind of more useful information to go about your daily life and the other idea is this idea called complete markets from the economist called arrow and Dubrow and their idea was basically that she had markets on essentially anything the economy would be more efficient because people can hedge against more specific risks and they could take more specific speculative positions they actually want to know about prize for that work and that kind of vision was never really realized and you know the reason is in my opinion it's very difficult to create new financial markets today so if you look at you know how hard it was to create a new book before the printing press came out you had to have monster scribes copy it down and you know each copy had a little bit lost in translation that's kind of how I do new financial instruments some new financial contracts today the monks were scribes or basically investment banks like Goldman Sachs and you have them write up a contract so there's a big difference n of to experimentation because it's just so expensive it cost millions of dollars to get anything off the ground and so with augur I kind of view it as a sort of it's like a tool it's like a printing press but for finance so the idea is if you want to create a financial market on something in that market doesn't exist or it's just expensive somewhere else you can create it for you know 20 or $30 on augur and base it's it's way too to do that interesting so what is your background in finance or betting so I first got interested in in betting when I was in Middle School as essentially you know had this computer class I'd always get done with early and was looking for something to do cuz it was the end of the day and we'll move up basically betting on horse races so there you know overseas betting sites and I built you know some really simple models essentially in Excel and that's kind of how I first got started betting you know initially started with $20 built it up to a few thousand and then at that point ended up getting into finance because I wanted to invest in something safer unfortunately the year I decided to get get interested in finance was 2008 so lost lunch money in the 2008 you know recession but it was a good you know learning experience and so just from your personal interest in that that was how you came across across those ideas by those economists and then you know connected that with what you were doing in Bitcoin and decided a lunch auger yeah so the the you know interest in economics the stuff that was that was back you know a nice in middle school and then ended up you know starting working on auger like during your after my freshman year of college so there was a you know gap in time where I wasn't like doing anything actively in finance but yeah the those are kind of the original reasons why I started to get excited about it how does auger work describe it for listeners who might not be familiar with it sure so the way it works essentially is you have you know these programs on a theory on the store the money and so say you're basically betting on whether you know Trump will win the 2020 election in the US and so in this canary oh there's two possible outcomes yes or no just to keep it simple and if the current price of yes is 55 cents per share that basically means the market thinks there's a 55% chance to trump away and if you want to participate in that market what you can do is you can say okay I want to buy Trump and 55 cents per share if he wins you end up getting the dollar back so you basically made 45 cents profit if he loses you ended up losing your 55 cents and so it's really simple and straightforward basically the way it works is you know funds are deposited into these programs the training takes place on these smart contracts and then at the end of it a payout happens according to what actually happened in the real world and how do you determine what the truth is or what actually happened on the platform yeah so in augur the way in a way the outcomes are determined is basically there's this big system people we call reporters and it's a distributed group of people and they collectively kind of say what happened so from a practical standpoint the way it works is initially just one person submits a report so they may say you know Trump won the election however let's say they are dishonest they said that he didn't win even though he did then what happens is the system has a dispute period where anyone can dispute it and these disputes are essentially crowdfunded some people keep disputing back and forth until eventually either the market resolves and one side kind of gives up or the network can actually fork or split into two networks similar to other blockchain Forks except an augur you know you're forking over essentially reality you launched augur live on July 9th since then what kinds of activity have you been seeing and what markets have surprised you yes there's been you know on that Kennedy side of things what we've seen is lots of people creating markets but you know a lot of those markets don't necessarily have liquidity on them it's definitely follow the power law distribution where the local init ease actually landed so the most popular markets tend to be things right now like essentially derivatives on the etherion price and you know hey that makes sense because right now every market is denominated in ether so you need either to trade in things and ether is a pretty volatile asset so it doesn't really make sense right now if you use augur for something like say sports betting when you have you know 5% daily volatility and ethers price whereas using it for a derivative contract that involves ether itself makes perfect sense it's not kind of what we've seen but there's about a thousand markets that have been created on augur I did see also I think the most popular one is about the price of Bitcoin yeah yeah I can see that what markets have prized you I mean the most surprising ones really to spend kind of how how creative people have been with with creating markets so like some people have actually figured out ways to construct like putt call spreads on top of lager which is a pretty complicated financial instrument and so what's really interesting about that to me is it shows kind of the power of prediction markets in general where you can take these kind of very basic fundamentals simple tools and use them to build something that's kind of quite complicated and that exists in the regular world huh so if augur becomes widely used how will the world and the lives of everyday people look different a few years from now yeah so the main differences are right now if you want to get information about something some future event it may may or may not happen your best bet is essentially look at either poles in the case of elections or to read kind of commentary in the case of things that are you know harder to decipher than elections and I think you can think about augur from like an average you know consumer standpoint one really useful thing will be you know we kind of view it as like long term a sort of a search engine for the future so if you look at like predictions global which is a website somebody built on top of augur you can look at all the markets and see kind of what they're forecasting and that can be essentially anything it could be something kind of boring like you know flood or drought risk but it can also be something more interesting like what are the odds the US and North Korea sign a deal requiring North Korea to you know give up nuclear weapons or something so you can have markets on essentially anything and right now when we go about our daily lives we have pretty good predictions about things like the weather but we don't have that greater predictions about other things and if you look at financial markets today they're primarily on you know the prices of companies but I think they can be expanded to be a lot more than just that you've talked before about how augur will enable trading and markets that are too small for financial institutions to make markets in like for instance how many inches of rain will fall in a region of the world that's not important to most people but to the farmers that live there so if that market is is that small how could this market be popular enough at all even amongst the crowd on a platform like auger for it to make sense to create a market in on other yes so algorithmic Aust to create a market you have basically two different costs one is you have this column that you have to put up basically that if your markets in invalid market or it's a market kind of doesn't make any sense or result is indeterminate you lose that bond right now that's around you know 25 to 30 dollars but you get that money back if your market is like a properly worded market the other fee is you know the gas fees to create a market on a fee on which we're probably you know a few dollars right now it's probably around $5 and so if you look at that you know your total cost assuming you get the money back for that bond is around five to six dollars so it's very very cheap and so that's kind of one barrier to entry that it lowers if you look at regular financial markets it's really hard to even explore that with them because if the start-up costs - ekans create a mark on something there's millions of dollars it makes it's a pretty large barrier keeping experimenting and seeing if there's even interest in a given type of market bit and then in terms of the you know people actually trading on something like that Stenson startup cost is so small it's perfectly fine if there's some markets that only have you know a few thousand dollars and people trading on that back and forth because for them it might make sense oh that's interesting so even in markets that small with where there's only 100 people betting there could still be useful information that comes out of it yeah that's right and the reason is you know no one takes two opposite parties who want to place a bet at the same price for a market to be useful for somebody in practice of course so you know you generally need at least a few dozen people before market starts to make sense interesting something else that I was interested in is whether or not prediction markets could help curb fake news what do you think well I don't think they can help that much with fake news because you even fake news a lot of the time people know it's fake but they still share it anyway but prediction markets are definitely a good way of putting your finger on a piece of information kind of in a really precise way so like the way to think about it is if you disagree with what the market says you can always bet against it and so there's always financial instead to basically correct the price or correct the odds do you but I guess what I'm asking is you know from the way that the lager market is described and the incentives that reporters have don't you think that if someone was trying to say I guess for instance so like what if what if right after one of these big shootings like that the Parkland High School shooting in in Florida you know there were those people saying oh those quote-unquote students they're their paid actors and so what if like right after the shooting somebody created a market saying will actors be paid to act like you know distraught survivors of the shooting you you know then there are those people that keep insisting that they are paid actors what if they were to somehow try to engage in the market market and keep disputing the outcome would that then leave to a fork and and like allow those people to kind of persist in their fake news universe or how would that work or origins meaning like not even possible yes so it depends on how depends on how much they're willing to lose money by kind of having that done that dogmatic you know incorrect view people have brought up using their reporting system as a way to kind of have consensus on real world events for things besides auger so on like news events that's actually a good example people on reddit have actually brought up using auger reporting results as you know citation for Wikipedia articles so you can imagine you know that in regular news there's not always the financial incentive to tell the truth but in reporting on auger at least you know in theory the incentives should be to be honest and so then no I'm just curious so in that scenario where you had this one minority that kept insisting you know that that actually the outcome was not X but why then in the world of auger as long as they were sizable enough majority I guess if they represent a 2.5 percent of all rep then that would lead to a fork so then there would be sort of like these two auger universes one with the that is based on reality and one that's based on fake news and so then with it which is sort of like the internet now where there's a world of the internet that's me sorry honey the other version of the internet that is not so it just would that keep persisting where you would just have this other world where they would just keep reporting you know Fink news and those would be all the winning outcomes on that auger platform yes on that on that one universe you know you could think of it as like a fake news universe you know I don't think people would actually use that that side of the platform because if you're a trader or you're a better or you're anyone who's not you know profiting off of solely fake news your financial incentive is to use the one that actually reflects reality with those people you know that small minority minority could still maintain their kind of side groups where fake news rules the markets the problem with it though is fake news isn't necessarily consistent in its fakeness so even that universe interestingly enough would probably split over a bunch of disagreements which is kind of part of the core concept of auger is it's easier to align on the truth than it is to align on some sort of lie that's part of the reason why if you look at like how police examine criminals they do cross examination to try to find inconsistencies in stories huh interesting well we'll see what happens um something that I wanted to ask you about also is this is kind of I guess really the year and for the last year has been like this where we've seen the SEC making a lot of moves in the crypto space and for the last several months the SE C's message has been that all icos are securities offerings so do you ever worry that the augur crowd sale in 2015 would also be considered an unregistered securities offering and worried about what that could mean for you well so I think if you look at you know auger in particular in some of the more recent statements by the SEC you know they've talked about this kind of concept of sufficient decentralization and if you look at augered you know I myself don't really have any control over the network beyond the fact that you know I can you know sit here on a podcast and talk about it but I can't actually exert any sort of control on it I could for instance publish some code and you know maybe evil switch over to it or maybe they won't it's similar to a position they know that a core developer or someone like Bitcoin or aetherium is in then if you look at augurs token in particular in order to earn money from the markets in the system you have to be you know actively participating in the reporting system which is I think one thing that makes it different from most other projects in the crypto space where you know to actually get the cash flow I guess it's the way to put it you have to participate in the system we said we're going to talk more about decentralization and these issues

speaking with Joey Krug of auger and Pantera capital so you mentioned that you don't have control over auger but you were one of the co-founders or are one of the co-founders and you designed it and coded it and launched it some token projects have this kill switch that gives the developers power over the project in case of you know potentially catastrophic incidents and you guys burned yours two weeks after auger went live was that the intention there to kind of give yourselves cover and say like oh and outs to centralize we can't control it well so the concept of kill switch is you know they been called escape hatches and like the academic literature I think people are kind of misled about what they actually enable enable so if you look at an escape hatch what it enables is kind of pausing of all contract functions and it allows people to withdraw their money from the contracts but it doesn't prevent someone from you're just reuploading the same copy of those contracts without the kill switch or without the escape hatch and the main reason to have these sorts of things at least from a computer science standpoint is very early on you want to make sure that there's least not some huge obvious critical vulnerability that was missed by auditors and so you kind of have the benefit of being able to pause things let people withdraw and then migrate over to a new version of the system at some point though you want to basically get rid of that feature because as a system grows you can use that feature for malicious uses so if you look at Ogburn the way the escape hatch worked when you pause the system there's no way to - you know return the money to people in a hundred percent fair way the way the original logger protocol did it was it returned the money at the latest odds that each market traded that so there's definitely much use cases where that key could get stolen or you know somebody can maliciously press that button and screw over a lot of the traders in the system so once that we thought it was seeing you know decently secure and there are no major vulnerabilities found in the first two weeks we basically decided to get better at that functionality it that way you know you can't really pause this um and if you know there is some vulnerability found essentially what would happen is people would have to kind of hard fork over to a new system and who would manage that hard fork well so the way it way a hard fork you know for for smart contracts works we haven't really seen this that much but basically what would happen is somebody would upload a new smart contracts to be developers it could be essentially anyone it's trivial to verify that those are the like the smart contracts they claim about pre-loaded are the ones that they actually uploaded and then after that point it becomes a problem of convincing people to use it so in the case where there's like a vulnerability found from a security standpoint I think you know doing a hard for getting people to migrate over to a new version where it's fixed would be pretty straightforward because there's not a good reason to stay on the old vulnerable one however if you're doing things like you know feature upgrades it's a lot harder to get people to move over we've seen this actually with Bitcoin where there hasn't been a huge amount of upgrades to it that require hard Forks because people are not really willing to do that so but like in terms of making decisions like that it would be the forcast foundation so it's kind of unclear at this point how how hard Forks would happen because none have happened yet for really anything on the decentralized to have player on top of aetherium I imagine they would happen in a similar fashion to how hard Forks happen on the protocol layer so the closest analogy to look at would be look at how hard Forks happen on a 3m itself and basically they're what you have is kind of a community-driven process where he will debate what sort of things should be in the hard core for what shouldn't and then after the community kind of comes to a consensus on it eventually a new version is released and people decide whether to use it in the case of you know a theorem right now people have gone with most of hard Forks they can also decide to reject it in the case of you looking at the DAO fork some of you literate stayed on the theory on classic the same thing could certainly happen to augur or you have people on the old version some people on a new version and when you say a new version is released and people can decide whether to use it or not who is releasing it so in terms of who who releases it you know in practice it would probably be you know people working on the auger protocol would push a new version of it - yeah it didn't people would decide whether to use that or not in theory though anyone can do that so it sounds like it could be you yeah that's exactly right yeah so people have actually already proposed kind of hard fork updates to augur that are separate from the current dev team so for instance some people have proposed versions that kind of allow for more easy easier censorship of markets some will also propose versions where you modify the reporting system quite a bit and actually remove fees entirely that's all kind of early stage stuff the FAQ on augur says that it's not a prediction to market itself but just a protocol that enables people to make markets and so that you guys cannot control what markets people create or any other actions they take on the platform and this you know I'm not a lawyer but from that research I've done it seems like this comports with a section of the Communications Decency Act that says providers or platforms are not liable for content by others but it actually turns out that there's an exemption for criminal activity so I'm just making up this hypothetical scenario but let's say somebody created an assasination working on augur and then that the target of you know that assassination market was actually assassinated and somehow investigators linked the killing to the market if the prosecutors went after you for creating the platform how would you defend yourself well I think I think that question is a bit like asking you know somebody who invented the hammer or the printing press you know what happens if someone takes a hammer and uses it for something bad or what happens if somebody uses the printing press to write you know look like Mongkok and so I think like all sorts of tools you can use them in a very positive ways and you can use them in very negative ways when you're inventing a new form of tool kind of society to use what you have to weigh is basically whether you believe that the positive benefits outweigh the negative the negative use cases or even the negative externalities of those positive benefits and so you know looking at something like auger if you look at the volume that's taking place on it and what people are actually trading on today you know 99.999% of it is either derivatives contracts you know some of its sports if you look at like the World Cup markets you know there was somebody who created in the assassination market that expired at the end of July and it had about $50 traded on it and about $300 and open holders on the book that weren't well and so I think from that standpoint you know I believe the augurs when create more good in the world and bad from a you know legal standpoint of what does it mean to be the creator of the sort of protocol you know I think if you look at the Communications Act and the 90s that was passed it was primarily intended for people who were actually operating these sort of platforms on the internet so you know hosting a site running things where as I view as augur more more similar to something like aetherium or even BitTorrent where you know we can definitely push new versions of the UI the people who need to decide to run in their own machine or not but we don't actually host the software and run or ourselves and so from that sort of standpoint I think if you're thinking of creating a market on augur you should pay attention to the rules and regulations in your jurisdiction and those are any people who are creating for-profit entities on top of augur to do exactly that and they're basically getting licensed and you know their respective jurisdictions whether that's mall tour the UK versus like creating a market in the United States I don't think makes that much sense because it's just so many legal hurdles to doing that you know only lists past summers sports buddy been legalized on the federal level but you still have 50 states to deal with and in terms of my kind of positioning on on longer itself and creating the tool like that I view it as mostly as a free speech issue so I think you have basically if you look at code it's been protected as free speech under the Supreme Court and there's also this concept of what I call compelled speech that's the idea that you know if someone were to try to go after us and say hey like you should make these certain markets not exist one there's not really a functional way to do that you know maybe we could add a thing that hides them in the UI but you could always access them on a theory unless - were to actually censor a theory in myself but even the thing of preventing them in the UI I think would fall under compelled speech laws which has also been been protected under the Supreme Court you can't force someone to say something that said that all this stuff is new kind of novel ground it's very similar I think to the kind of early days of the the PAP file-sharing revolution like we saw with you know projects like BitTorrent so in your answer you talked about how you do you know recommend that users comply with the laws and there are jurisdictions so do you ever worry at all about maybe aiding and abetting liability on you know for yourself with respect to any of those laws in any jurisdiction can you clarify the question like do you do you worry that you might have liability for aiding and abetting whether it's for you know laws against murder for hire or something like that well so I think I think from a liability standpoint you know I'm definitely not definitely not encouraging that sort of behavior and you know just because something is possible doesn't mean that you're necessarily aiding and doing it any more than that the person who created a hammer aided and you know someone who broke into a window with it okay and I was also curious in your answer where you spoke about consulting services for people who are making markets I wasn't aware that was happening it sounds like already there's consultant link services popping up for people who want to create markets to make sure that they can comply with the laws in their jurisdiction I didn't mean consulting services I mean those sorts of things do exist Gaming consultants have been around for decades doing exactly that but what I meant was people are creating for-profit companies on top of lager that are going to create markets and those companies are getting licensed in their respective jurisdictions oh interesting but then how do they enforce that the participants are people who can participate in that jurisdiction you know how can they restrict it to that jurisdiction yeah a simple way to do it it's just you know geofence your site the most most people creating for-profit things on Cathy Walker are probably still gonna run centralize websites they're just using augur because they don't have to deal with settlement resolving markets processing trades things like that so it's mostly a cost savings and so they're still gonna run this stuff through centralized websites so you're just I pee fence or geofence those people out you know there's always the possibility that somebody could come you know basically through the backdoor essentially in this case you know using a theory on on like a API or or manual level you know doing something through like my ether wallet to trade with you but there's also ways to to get around that like for instance you could run all trading into a state channel where your users have to sign up through your website to take part trade against you the way that you've designed augur you do not identify users why did you decide to design it that way that wasn't really a consideration and designed to be honest it was more of just kind of how would you build this from a technical standpoint so that it actually works and using aetherium ended up being I think my opinion the best the best way to actually do that the theorem itself happens to be you know pseudonymous it definitely doesn't mean that you can't identify users though for instance if you look at it throw you my address for instance every market has a market creator it'd be very trivial to transform their theory and address back to the real identity by tracing in which exchange they sent money through and most the exchange and points in the space or KY seed even those you know assassination markets that the media is kind of went crazy about over the past few weeks have also been funded by KY seed accounts from exchanges so just going back to the question about the assassination market so I totally understand about how you view this as a tool like a hammer or I guess like any other Internet Protocol but I just wonder you know in this case where if someone does use augur for criminal activity and in general usage of the market drives up the value of rep that does benefit you financially which is different from a kind of other ways that you know creators of tools you know might might say oh well you know criminal activity on what using that tool isn't really related to me but in in you know with something like rep and auger there would maybe be a financial benefit to you so how do you feel about that well so if you look at you know those sorts of markets longer does have the ability built in to result in this invalid and in that scenario there's essentially zero financial incentive to kind of do what everyone's talking about and so basically in that scenario what what ends up happening is the people who created those markets essentially lose money and people who traded in them essentially lose out to arbitrage errs and so in that scenario you know I don't see any problem with it because you're basically removing the the financial incentive if you know people on the system start to resolve those markets you know accurately and so they're not trying to basically prohibit them then that would be you know more concerning but that also happened at this point and just to go back as you can see I have a lot of regulatory questions because I I do wonder this is such a new animal I wonder how the regulators will react but we do have some history to look at so our users able to speculate on what this stock of a private company will be worth if it goes public because there was in exchange and it was a blockchain based exchange called santol exchange that enabled those types of beds but it was shut down by the SEC so I wondered how augur differed in this regard well so for that you know I definitely would encourage you to read that thank you but in general augur itself doesn't operate those markets and we don't process the trades you don't store customer funds and we don't create those markets which is even more important thing so if you look at you know most most rules surrounding market operation they surround creating and kind of operating the markets themselves and so I don't know if there are any markets on that on Aughra being specific at the moment I haven't checked for that specific use case but you know in theory someone could use it to grade those and from a regulatory standpoint you know I think it falls kind of on the onus of the market creator if you look at something like BitTorrent it kind of fells on a bonus of the tracker sites and people actually hosting those files to make sure that they're not you know hosting some sort of illegal service for markets on you know private companies startups I think that's a really interesting use case I've been talking to some people who are interested in doing it in actually a regulatory compliant fashion you know obviously not not in the US because it's it's really hard to use that sort of stuff in the US but it's stuff that you could do much more easily in you know jurisdictions like the UK or Malta interesting so as you can see through this discussion we've been talking about how the technology can be used for both good and bad are there ways that you in particular are thinking about trying to influence the usage of the technology more for good than for bad well so yeah hey I think the main thing with with the with something like this is it's hard to know you know what people are going to use it for just because it's such a generic sort of set of financial primitives like it's literally a way to it's literally a protocol for escrowing funds processing trades back and forth and then processing you know resolution of those markets and so the sort of things you can use it for kind of really varying you know in terms of what I think is most interesting I think the sort of information gathering style markets are the most interesting ones as to things on like political events you know things that allow people to hedge against various risks things like that and so if anybody's interested in you know creating something like that I'd be happy to chat about it basically just because I think those are kind of the most sort of beneficial use cases for for society in general that said the cool thing about there is you don't have to look at all the markets it's kind of like Google you don't have to search for everything on Google once when you use Google you can just look at the stuff that you care about and find interesting yeah and how will you you know I I heard you talking before and I sort of referenced this example about how this market could be useful to farmers in some remote region of the world how would you reach them or how would you reach the people that would care about that kind of market well so you basically need a couple of different problems to be solved before it makes sense to use auger for anything especially you know use case like that and so those problems boil down to essentially two core things one is fees are very high right now in to is the user experience is very poor and so if you look at the fee angle if you're paying you know 15% in fees if you add everything up from getting fiat into crypto dealing with volatility at crypto dealing with all the fees for trading on the theory I'm dealing with the feeds on augur itself add all that up it becomes quite expensive so that's one problem the other problem is the UI UX and that includes things in my opinion like making it easy for people who aren't familiar with crypto to use it you know ideally the kind of long-term state you want this tech to be and is an area where people don't necessarily even need to understand crypto or know that it's crypto or know that it's using the blockchain for it to be useful for them I think on the fee side of things we'll see some pretty strong improvements over the next six to 12 months as things like you know maker dowse died and become more popular and as we see exchanges like batch launched which have much lower trading fees on the ui/ux side it's really just kind of another thing that improves at the mature ation of the tech part of the UI UX issues are due to the fact that it's it's so unscalable that time is really high to do anything that you want to run longer it takes you know an hour until in sync the thing and that really needs to be down to you know a few seconds those are all problems that are solvable but it's gonna take you know a few years yeah I was gonna ask you because I noticed in the last 24 hours there were just 30 39 transactions but it sounds like the way to foster the growth of this network is actually to resolve some of these other issues which actually maybe in some cases are more problems with aetherium than with auger itself yes if some of them definitely are but that doesn't mean there's not that doesn't mean there's nothing you can do I guess is the way to put it like you know we can write you know free open-source tools that allow you to run markets and state channels and thus solve the transaction fee problem and the speed problem and that's seen as something that I've been looking at actively I think it's really interesting and I've been talking to a few people in this open source community about it's just stuff that you know takes time because it just got out the door but I want to go and we've been working on improvements to it but it all takes time let's talk about your work at Pantera as co-chief investment officer what's your investment thesis or strategy there yeah so our investment thesis so we're focused solely on blockchain tech and crypto currencies and the sort of things were looking for are things that either disintermediate you know existing markets or basically create new financial markets for things that people may not have considered to be markets in the past so in the first scenario you have things like augur things like aetherium they basically serve to cut out middlemen and then on the second scenario you have things like file claim where today there's not really a sort of marketplace for file storage but there will be in the future and I was curious to know you've been there for I think a little over a year how has the market changed in that time and in particular what do you see happening to valuations in the space yeah so the market about a year ago was much more retail driven so there were a lot more people in the market and a given point in time and a lot more people buying you know new crypto currencies or ICO at any given point in time nowadays the markets more kind of VC driven in the sense that most these ICO deals are happening in the private markets and it's not really so much in the public markets anymore and yeah that's because projects are starting to sell things basically on you know staffs with the year lockup and then after that then you know you it can be traded because they're trying to do things basically reacting to the kind of news is coming out of the SEC in terms of valuations I think valuations from public markets have obviously come down quite a bit valuations in the private markets people are starting to become more valuation sensitive but they're still you know investing in things that pretty pretty crazy valuations in my opinion yeah I know that some teams are able to ratchet their evaluations 100x between rounds even before they've launched how do you think they're able to do that well that I think you know I've seen that a few times in past on the second the second rounds and the reason they're able to do that is they raise you know a relatively small amount by kind of a name-brand well-known you know Silicon Valley investor and then in raises the second round at you know 50x that valuation in the second round they raise from a bunch of overseas Chinese investors who you know don't really know what they're doing and that's kind of why you see those disparities I don't think that's a good thing or a healthy thing for the market though I think it takes advantage of people which I don't like interesting yeah well speaking of the way this market is working so I saw that you mentioned somewhere that one of your motivations for building auger was democratizing access to finance but I was noticing that in one of the most recent investor letters from Pantera that amongst the more recent funds which so I'm just leaving aside the Bitcoin fund which launched in 2013 and is up like 11,000 percent or something among the the more recent funds that are actually up because one of them was actually down 24% both of those are ones where you guys get tokens at a discount so in this case where your returns in some way is you know predicated on getting early access to the tokens how do you reconcile that with this ideal of democratized access to finance yes good question so I think if you look at I mean part of it honestly I think is is due to the regulatory environment in the US a year ago that there was that democratized access to lots of projects now a lot of them I would never invest pepero crazy valuations but there definitely was to know I consider to be democratize access to least funding projects but when I say democratize access to finance I don't really necessarily mean funding kind of early-stage startups what I actually mean by that I think that's a very small part of finance even from the numbers standpoint venture capital is very small part of finance despite how big it seems if you're in Silicon Valley what I actually mean by that is you know opening up access to new markets and really enabling people to be able to trade on markets that they don't have access to in their local jurisdictions so I'm one I'm really excited for is you know things like derivatives on top of you know aetherium people being able to trade on more more and more asset classes or at least synthetic versions of those asset classes now said I do think it would be great if you know access to startup investing was more democratized but it's hard because of you know accredited investor rules that even kind of ad in my opinion an unnecessary barrier to entry to investing in early-stage startups because I think you look at the financial markets today you can be a non accredited investor in by pink-cheeked stock on the OTC markets that has a 97% chance of failing but you can't Cohen vest in a start-up you know through a syndicate that's Co investing with Founders Fund which obviously has a lower chance at filling than the random king she'd stock I think there's some kind of you know issues with that that I hope you know are resolved in the future and so obviously the investment strategy up enterin pretty much any other of these venture capital and hedge fund investors in the crypto space is in as you get in early and everything but because everybody always is talking about democratizing finance I was just curious are there any particular projects that you've invested in that you are particularly excited about in terms of their potential to democratize finance yeah absolutely so you know projects so decentralized exchanges are a big category and that things like 0x khyber basically the idea of you know right now they're not scalable and they're expensive to trade on but when you're making an investment as a venture style investor you have to look out on the exponential curve a few years I think a few years from now this text can be super scalable most transaction fees will be much lower than regular centralized exchanges where you're paying 25 basis points per trade and so that's that's one area the centralized exchanges another one is you know the concept of kind of stable coins as you start to see more exchanges building fiat on-ramps for crypto eventually people in countries with you know really poor currencies will be able to actually just get into the stable coins and hold those instead and then stable coins are also really useful because if you're doing any sort of financial application on something like etherium you can't have you know the follicle OD of ether you know it's just something that you can't really like deal with from their risk room risk management standpoint besides that you know I think other projects of neat things like you know file coin basically creating the financial market where there previously wasn't one and making it you know much cheaper to access file storage also interested in some of the art projects like projects that are trying to disintermediate their auction houses which charge about 40 percents and fees the other problem with art is if you wanted to buy like you know $50 worth of a Picasso painting well obviously you can't do that today cuz you either have to buy the full painting and be super rich or just nothing at all and so doing things like securitizing assets like that some projects like harbor i think we're also really interesting to me in terms of democratizing access to things that and access to things and investment classes that you know the average consumer wouldn't have had access to in the past you touched on staple coins and I've heard you speak before about how they're previously at least and even probably now that there was a big need for stable coins in general in crypto space and of course now there's a ton of projects both live and also in development what other big needs right now do you see in the space and where do you see a lot of activity yeah so I mean but besides besides stable client I think the other big areas are you know really just making a text scale is a big area that there could be a lot more work on tons of people are working on it right now but it's it's still just a really large set of problems that need to be kind of surpassed besides that I still think the Fiat on-ramp is still a very large relevant one which is why we've invested in you know exchanges all over the world making it easier to get access to crypto is I think another kind of big piece because if you can't get your dollars or yen or whatever it may be in your crypto you can't really get access to this you know quote-unquote democratize pension system anyways and so that's that's a big barrier if you look at you know companies like coinbase you know the fee to to buy Bitcoin bases you're paying 4% for another transaction one and a half percent for an ACH and the interesting irony is you go through G tax which is kind of a more institutional side yeah you're a CHP is is zero but the average consumer doesn't know you know to go through G X and so I think I think just basically seeing more people kind of competing in that space and seeing more attempts to drive the cost down for for getting fiat on into crypto is another big area hmm okay well great for people who are interested in learning more about you and auger and Pantera where should they go yeah you
