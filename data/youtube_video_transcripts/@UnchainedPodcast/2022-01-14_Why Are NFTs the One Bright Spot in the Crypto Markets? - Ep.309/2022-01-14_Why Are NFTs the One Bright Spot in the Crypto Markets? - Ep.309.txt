the code laura link in the description today's guest is aftab hossein aka dc investor and he is a crypto investor project advisor and nft collector welcome offtab hey laura thanks for having me on i'm really excited to be here the crypto markets were down quite a bit earlier this week with the total markets dipping below 1.9 trillion dollars a few times and also in the last seven days bitcoin traded below forty thousand dollars briefly and eth even dropped below three thousand dollars and yet the nft market was booming so for listeners we are recording on thursday january 13th and already open c's monthly volume has exceeded the monthly volumes for november and all of october as well and i also noticed that monthly active traders have also surpassed the number from august the number from september the number from october the number from november so autub what is your sense of what's going on here well i think there's a few things laura and first of all you know for those who have been in crypto for a while i think a lot of people are aware of the more cyclical nature of how things work and certainly as it relates to the fungible tokens when i say that i'm talking about bitcoin ether and some of these other fungible project tokens when those get traded um truly as speculative assets insignificant volumes at times and so you see a lot of activity around those assets and when prices start to go down you do at times see reflexive panic and that works the other way as well when prices are going up you see that reflexive fomo right because people can easily get in and out of those token positions so if i wanted to sell even like a million dollars or 10 million dollars or more of ether or bitcoin i could do that instantly in an exchange transaction and it could be done within a second whether it's on chain or an off chain exchange with nfts the dynamic is different right so even if you want to sell your nfts you can't necessarily find an immediate buyer you actually have to in most cases find a buyer who wants to buy your specific nft and then they provide you the liquidity for that so i think that's that's just the fundamental market liquidity dynamic but i think also at play here is the fact that a lot of people have bought nfts now you know we've been through several waves of speculation in nfts and by the way that's ever continuing but we also have seen a lot of those flippers kind of burn out so every time the way that i think about it is every time a flipper buys an nft and sells it the probability of it going into a longer term collector's hands actually increases right and so those longer term collectors are fairly price insensitive they're not necessarily tracking the floor prices and even if they are they don't have much intention of selling anytime soon so i think for those reasons you kind of see nft prices potentially holding up better even though these fungible tokens you know when people really need liquidity they're going to sell those fungible tokens first just because they can i also had another theory which is and i i have no idea really if this you know is a kind of a big enough trend that it would be noticed in the markets but i have a feeling a lot of people gave nfts as holiday gifts and so i wondered also if some of the trading was simply people who received nfts just like selling them or kind of getting into it and like buying more or you know what i mean like there was maybe a new wave of people that were sort of like onboarded during that holiday time i don't know what you think of that theory well anecdotally i think there's definitely some of that in terms of there's been a lot of new participants coming into nfts and by the way this has been an arc that has been pretty much continual since this time last year the past year has just been explosive for the growth of nft since last january and obviously there was activity before them but the past year has been marked and i think i don't think we're really seeing that slow down a tremendous amount i mean of course there are issues around transaction fees and just using layer 1 block chains that make it difficult for some users but the interest in nfts it just continues to increase quite frankly and you see this a lot with like celebrities now putting you know you have paris hilton and shaq doing dot eth after their name and that that's just bringing a lot of eyeballs to the nft space and web 3 as a whole so i do think we're seeing new buyers enter the space and that is that i think is an interesting dynamic because could we see a crypto like bear market whether that's a short bear or a long bear while nfts continue to go up in value i think the answer is possibly as long as there's sufficient what i'll call like replacement demand from outside of the crypto space for people to buy nfts now a lot of the higher value nft activity has been crypto people who were who got wealthy off of their crypto assets buying nfts but i do think you know you have people like shaq paris and other celebrities coming in it's not entirely out of the question that prices might continue to go up even in a prevailing crypto bear at least for a time yeah literally right before we started recording i saw jimmy fallon tweeted gm and his profile pic is of a board board ape i don't know if that's a new profile pic or if he's had that for a while but and i know i've said this on the show before it still reminds me again of of a tweet that my mind is just so spot on which is fred ursum of coinbase tweeted if like when the nft thing started taking off he tweeted it turns out a lot more people are interested in culture than in finance and so i think you're right that even if the crypto markets just you know for fungible tokens go down simply because you're right there's probably a greater population of people that are kind of interested in nft type things than would be interested in money type things that market alone could yeah cause the nft market to continue to rise and sort of be uncorrelated with the functional token market so regardless of whatever kind of the anecdotal trends are there is one phenomenon that probably also was responsible for the high volumes on openc which was that open c saw a decentralized competitor named looks rare launch via a vampire attack on the marketplace what opportunity do you think it was that the luxury team saw there and how well do you think openc will be able to fend off this competitor that's essentially rewarding users sure well openc and i'll say i'll start off by saying openc has done tremendous amount for the nft space and really they are the predominant marketplace by a very large margin and have been for a while now from from my point of view as someone who's involved in the nft space i think we need to see decentralization there and decentralization isn't just in how the apps are run but it's having more than one app absorb some of that marketplace volume and so i think that the luxor team saw an opportunity with openc you know openc really only has market share to lose because they're practically at 100 now and so if they can get any piece of that that's a win for them but two open c at least so far with the articulate strategy hasn't necessarily wanted to go down the community ownership route and and as some of your listeners may have heard that recently openc has done another round of raise that i think valued them at like 13 or 15 billion 13.3 billion 13.3 billion which is which is significant i mean for for any for any company but certainly one in the web 3 nft space and and so that's a huge amount of money but they have not really wanted to go down the token ownership route and i'm not necessarily saying that they should i don't think that's always the end-all be-all however for a lot of participants in the nft space today a lot of people are used to dealing in tokens used to using these layer one blockchains directly and they feel like they should be able to participate in some of that upside and that's kind of been an ethos of some of the most successful web 3 apps that i've seen and certainly the ones on ethereum the idea of giving ownership to some of your users is a very powerful motivator and it's i mean we've seen this recently with the ethereum name service ens domains they recently released their governance token and that just kind of catalyzed the next wave of growth for them because all of their passionate users became that much more excited about the platform and three weeks later you've got shaq and paris hilton changing their name to dot e i mean like it's hard to understate the power of those kinds of effects so when i saw what looks rare did and you mentioned that they did a vampire attack in this case with that vampire that vampire attack took the form of them giving a retroactive airdrop of their tokens to openc users and because all the openc activity is on chain they're able to see exactly how much previous users had spent on openc and they gave users a proportional amount of tokens based on how much activity they did on openc so the premise is they gave more tokens to the people who who bought and sold more nfts and by receiving those tokens users could of course sell them immediately on uniswap or some decentralized exchange but they also have the option to stake them to earn a portion of the transaction fees that are that are ongoing in that marketplace and so i i actually claimed my airdrop and i chose to stake it just because i wanted to support them and see what happens and also part of that so i'm earning a portion of the transaction fees and i'm also earning staking rewards in the looks token and so i think the looks team just saw this opportunity of hey can we create something that gives value back to users and that's what they're doing and we're seeing it absorb some volume already all right so in a moment we're going to talk a little bit more about what the kind of ripple effects will be of this looks rare vampire attack but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible join over 10

o back to my conversation with off top oh so you know i was mistaken i thought that part of it was causing higher transaction volumes in open sea at the moment but this is a retroactive vampire attack it's retroactive and yeah it probably didn't drive the activity that we've seen on openc but yeah it's based on previous activity that have been done on openc okay so i mean these figures are pretty amazing on wednesday according to dune analytics looks rare had more than half a billion dollars in daily volume while openc had less than 200 million dollars and some people though are saying that the looks rare volume is likely wash trading just to yield farm and so i wondered first of all if you thought that was true and if so do you think looks rare could have staying power or will it just be that those traders simply go elsewhere when the rewards dry up it could be both and i think let's start with the wash trading question because there is some definitely some wash trading and for user for listeners who might not be familiar that's where someone is buying an nft that they're putting up for sale themselves however that is not like a free transaction here because i think it's i think it's every transaction on looks rare has a two percent fee and that is going directly to the looks token stakers okay so if you're doing wash trading you're paying that two percent penalty and at that point you're hoping that your looks reward is offsetting that i think you know and i hope i hope the luxurious team kind of pivots a little bit to adjust to that so we don't have a ton of it but i don't think we could say that all of this volume is being driven by wash trading there's certainly some legitimate activity going on the other question is around well what happens as these rewards start to decline or if people become less interested in those rewards i think that's a to be determined and i think we've seen other vampire attacks so to speak within the web 3 and ethereum space we saw it with sushi swap and uniswap previously and the way that vampire attack worked was different you actually had to move over your liquidity tokens in order to get the sushi staking awards but sushi also had that staking mechanism i think users are really i think that's it i think that was a great model that looks rare team chose first of all because it gives people a reason to hold the token it gives them potential benefit in that upside on a continual basis so will people stop caring about it i don't know i mean i think it's possible that people just keep keep all of their looks rare and just keep staking it because they're also getting paid in the ether rewards from the transaction fees not just in that looks token and i think that's an important differentiator they're actually earning a portion of the transaction fees that users are paying in ether and so we've seen this kind of flywheel effect where when you reward users they start to talk about your platform more they start to use it more and i think looks rare is kind of at that moment where it's we'll see if it's able to have that kind of staying power and so for you a user who now uses looks rare as well as openc what would you where would you prefer to list a future nft that you were to sell well looks rare has lower fees so if i'm going to choose one just on that basis i'm going to lean towards looks rare for that reason and that's irrespective of the looks rewards number one number two though laura i think that you know my view looking at the space let's say like over the next year is we're going to see more marketplace fragmentation because the idea that all nfts need to be listed on the same platform a single platform is kind of like web 2 thinking the idea of like centralizing creates this economy of scale that's not really necessary in web 3 and certainly not for non-fungible assets you actually do get some of that benefit for fungible assets because you get more order book depth but with nft is every asset is unique and you don't really have that so my point of view is that you're just going to see more and more of this activity kind of you know fragment out into multiple marketplaces and we're going to see more aggregator solutions come into the fold which actually look across all of these marketplaces look across looks rare look across openc look across these smaller marketplaces and we've already seen the genie xyz team is kind of a leader on this i think that's kind of the future so i don't view it as will looks rare to feed openc it's can looks rare take some of that liquidity and fragment it and can we see six other marketplaces come online and do the same thing and how do you think this vampire attack will affect the pressure on open scene to issue a token and or decentralize at least some part of its business it's an interesting question because if we use the una swap sushi swap situation as an example we i think most people would agree that the sushi swap vampire attack compelled uniswap to issue its own token will openc do the same thing i'm not really sure i think that like you know there are implications to issuing a token for a corporation like openc that you know there are legal considerations i don't think we talk about that enough because i do think that there are a lot of teams that operate in good faith who don't want to issue tokens because they don't want to face like sec action and things like that because the sec hasn't exactly been friendly to these kinds of models and open c to my knowledge is base it you know is subject to u.s laws and so they can't just they might they might feel like they can't issue a token i do think it's going to force them to think really critically about it though and can they issue a token what kind of functionality could it have number one but number two i'm hoping you know competition is a good thing laura and i think that to the extent that openc has another competitor that's pushing things that has lower fees it's gonna it's gonna be something that is makes all of the users of these marketplaces better off that's my hope yeah i think i agree with you about kind of regulatory issues for openc and you know even though i think this was an unpopular idea with the community i do feel like an ipo would make more sense at least with the way that the company is has been structured so let's also now talk about one of the more highly traded projects in nfts recently which is me bits well actually that and loot both are two of the highest volume traded nft projects and both of them do not charge creator royalties and i wondered what that said to you about a kind of like attitudes toward royalties on secondary sales for creators yeah and i think royalties are a complex question and quite frankly we're really only a couple of years into thinking about these models and what they mean long term but i do think that projects without royalties have some benefits and i'm not saying all projects should should not have royalties but some projects like crypto punks like me bits and and loot i and i yeah i think loot also doesn't have a royalty they what that allows for is more organic trading volume right so like it actually becomes it makes these assets easier to trade if you're a speculator especially right the idea of finding assets that don't have these loyalty fees which essentially are attacks for what you're what you're trading on they become a drag on your earnings effectively if you're a trader right and so i'm not surprised to see periods of volume increase on these assets that have no royalties especially when you talk about that speculation i think though royalties are really powerful motivator and incentive for creators in the space and especially for individual artists i'm a huge proponent of royalties i on these big projects like that we've seen i'm a little bit more i kind of wonder if they really need the royalties because they already raised a ton of money in ether you know half the time so why do they also need the royalty on top of that but for individual artists they're often selling the pieces at a quote loss or at a at a level where they're not not at the full market value if you will and they're making residual income off of those royalties and that allows them to keep creating so i think that's really powerful i think another point that you know listeners should understand is even though these royalties are you know technically coded into into these contracts they are avoidable if you really don't want to pay them but most good faith collectors that i've seen of like individual artist works actually want to pay the royalties to the artist because they they want us to even if they're selling the piece they want to support that artist so they can keep creating and i think it's just a really that's part of what makes this so different from previous models in my opinion yeah it's so funny because when you were talking and you called the royalty attacks i did a show or i didn't do the show but i released a show on my channel called the chopping block and in it for early stage crypto investors talk about all things crypto but one of them has qureshi of dragonfly capital was talking about some drama with pudgy penguins and he was calling the royalties attacks and i saw one of the people during the live stream said why are you calling an attacks instead of royalties and so i really like that distinction that you made between royalties paid to these big projects versus individual artists and that also maybe explains why i happen to notice for the royal drop that is uh going to be issued by nas assume i mean it was supposed to happen this week but they have technical issues so they're bumping it a week i noticed the royalties on that are 50 which to my mind seemed very high but you're right that i mean now this is like a you know super super famous musician and this is royalties on the streams and the prices are really low for what he's initially selling them at so i now it all makes a lot more sense and probably explains why he feels he could charge a high amount and probably why those collectors will you know feel that he's owed that money so anyway yeah and i i think the royalties the other thing that they also do is create an incentive for the artist to bring value back to those nfts somehow whatever that is because the artist then gets to participate in that upside outside and the traditional art markets when an artist sells a painting that's it you know like that whatever they got from that up front is all they're going to get and they don't really have much incentive to keep them culturally relevant so i i think we're still in really early days around these models but i think we just have to see what happens and i do want to clarify on these bigger projects where they do take royalties i'm not categorically like against that but what i like to see is how those funds are being driven back to enhance the community in like a meaningful way not just going into the pockets of the creators i like to see those funds go into like a dow or something like that so that they can add value back to the people who continue to participate in those communities yeah yeah so for listeners who are interested in some stories right now that are looking at doing that i would urge you to check out that chopping block episode where they discuss the pudgy penguins issue can't even say it okay um so after where can people learn more about you and your work so the best way to follow me is actually on twitter and i'm on there at i am dc investor and i tweet about a variety of different topics i'm engaged with a lot of project teams in the web3 space and yeah feel free to give me a follow or drop by and say hi great well thanks so much for coming on unchained thank you laura don't forget next up is the weekly news recap [Music] thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap thanks fomc crypto is tanking because of you probably on sunday afternoon the total crypto market dipped to lows not seen since september 2021. bitcoin led the way dropping below 40 000 for the first time in roughly three and a half months overall the crypto industry's market cap hit a weekly low of 1.86 trillion dollars on sunday before bouncing up to above two trillion dollars for the rest of the week according to data from coin class the market drop saw over 300 million dollars worth of positions liquidated on the ninth which is the third time this has occurred in 2022 the dip coincides with big time money flowing out of digital asset investment products coin shares notes that digital asset investment products experienced the largest outflow of money on record for the week ending january 7th bitcoin and ethereum based products were hit especially hard losing 107 million dollars and 39 million dollars respectively the coin shares data shows four consecutive weeks of outflows which has not happened since september the firm points to last week's federal open market committee meeting as the catalyst for the market drop which hinted at inflation risks and the possibility of interest rate increases a take that haseeb qureshi partner at dragonfly capital agreed with on the chopping block bitcoin developers are now protected by jack dorsey block ceo and avid bitcoiner jack dorsey announced plans via email to set up the bitcoin legal defense fund a non-profit organization aiming to protect bitcoin developers from legal pressures dorsey wrote the bitcoin legal defense fund is a non-profit entity that aims to minimize legal headaches that discourage software developers from actively developing bitcoin and related products such as the lightning network bitcoin privacy protocols and the like according to dorsey the fund's first goal is to coordinate and organize defense for bitcoin developers in a lawsuit coming from tulip trading limited a company associated with craig wright who claims to be satoshi nakamoto and was a leader in the bitcoin cash and bitcoin satoshi's vision forks dorsey makes it clear that the board which includes himself chain code lapses to alex morcos and martin white an academic at the university of sussex is not seeking additional money for operations but may in the future cache app is rolling out lightning network integrations cache app the block owned payments platform has begun integrating lightning network into its ios mobile app lightning network is a bitcoin scaling solution that allows users to transact cheaply and efficiently without settling each transaction on chain lightning has grown from holding just over a thousand btc to 3344 btc in the last year which means roughly 150 million dollars in bitcoin is locked in the lightning network while that growth is impressive cash app may bring an even further stampede of bitcoin to the layer 2 solution as data shows that cache app ranks as the 14th most popular app in apple's us app store furthermore in a recent report the company noted that over 40 million users transact on his platform each month lightning networks should also receive a boost in activity from strike a lightning-based company led by jack mallors strike announced that its lightning network enabled app is extending its reach to argentina expanding a bitcoin slash lightning payments operation into a country with a 50 percent annual inflation rate and 45 million people seems like a decent product market fit commented lynn alden an economist on twitter in related news the wall street journal published a piece on how citizens of turkey are turning to bitcoin and tether in lieu of the turkish lira notably ezra alpe the chief marketing officer at the turkish crypto exchange bitlow told the wall street journal the turkish lira's volatility and rising inflation seen in recent months has led our investors to see cryptocurrency as a profitable investment in the long term and as a hedge against inflation in the short term the wall street journal notes that the lira is down 40 against the us dollar since september which has led to crypto trading volumes in the lira jumping to 1.8 billion dollars per day despite the country banning cryptocurrencies last year paradigm and citadel securities make an odd couple citadel securities made headlines on monday by taking 1.15 billion dollars in capital from two venture firms paradigm and sequoia the deal values the market maker at approximately 22 billion dollars citadel securities is massive according to its website the firm handles 27 of equities trading volume on the u.s stock market each day and executes 37 of us listed retail volume because robinhood makes a lot of money from citadel in exchange for data on its users trades when robin hood halted purchases of gamestop stock in early 2021 rumors swirled that robin hood was acquiescing to a request from citadel however the actual reason was because robin hood did not have enough collateral for the compliance demands from the gamestop mania the move to take money from paradigm which backs quite a few crypto powerhouses like compound cosmos sky mavis and uniswap is an interesting move by citadel securities because back in september founder ken griffin said the company did not trade in crypto due to regulatory uncertainty however based on comments from paradigm co-founder matt huang in the press release it sounds like citadel will be moving into crypto we look forward to partnering with the citadel securities team as they extend their technology and expertise to even more markets and asset classes including crypto wrote huang coinbase enters the derivatives game on wednesday crypto exchange coinbase announced the acquisition of fair x a us-based cftc regulated derivatives exchange the purchase could soon allow coinbase to offer regulated derivatives products to

security on monday during a cnbc interview securities and exchange commission chair gary gensler was asked whether ethereum is a security or not gensler responded carefully saying we don't get involved in these types of public forums talking about any one project one possible circumstance or give legal advice over the airways that way however he then added in a somewhat ominous tone for eath holders that if you're raising money from the public and the public is in anticipation of profit based upon that promoter sponsor that group's efforts that's within the securities laws in 2018

finalized more quickly for now offchain has control over the lone arbitram sequencer the team says it is looking into decentralizing sequencer control in light of this event according to arbitrom's twitter account no funds were lost due to network downtime pulled together sued by a former elizabeth warren presidential campaign staffer joseph kent a software engineer and former tech lead for elizabeth warren's 2020 presidential campaign has filed a lawsuit in new york federal courts against pool together a defy lottery protocol kent says he deposited ten dollars into pool together in october and argues that pull together does not qualify to give out lottery tickets under u.s law notably anyone who purchases an illegal lottery ticket under new york law is allowed to bring a class action lawsuit on behalf of themselves and other ticket holders which could lead to 244 million dollars in damages according to the wall street journal in essence the suit questions whether pull together is autonomous and self-governed however in the journal pull together lawyer kevin brugel claimed that pull together simply owns the front end with information on how to use the protocol and that the operations are governed by the original code which pulled token holders now control as the article states quote according to legal experts mr kent's lawsuit could be among the first to squarely address the question of who is legally accountable when a defy application known as a protocol is at odds with the law or causes actionable harm to a user time for fun bits crypto land is a meme do you want to be part of the world's first physical crypto island asks a male narrator to begin an 18 minute 35 second video promoting crypto land after watching the full video which is a cross between a metaverse hellscape and a cheesy infomercial i personally would say the answer is no the idea is bold and familiar if you have kept up with nfts and dows recently cryptoland is attempting to purchase an island in fiji through the sale of nfts after that the details get sketchy for one it appears the island's acreage is smaller than the amount offered in the nft sale more humorously basic
