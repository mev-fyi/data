fee on the product today I think is certainly borne by you know just a lot of costs that go into running a product in the crypto space it's not analogous today due the kind of economies of scale that you'll see for Equity products or fixed income products and we've said publicly and I'll say to you again we are committed to lowering the fee on gbtc when it converts to an ETF but certainly in the meantime all the fees that are being generated on gbtc that is all the the capital that we as an organization are putting into our lawsuit against the SEC bringing the best legal Minds possible to the case and really just continuing to advocate for investors so we feel very strongly about the case the full resources of the firmer behind it and again yeah we'll we'll lower fees in an ETF state
