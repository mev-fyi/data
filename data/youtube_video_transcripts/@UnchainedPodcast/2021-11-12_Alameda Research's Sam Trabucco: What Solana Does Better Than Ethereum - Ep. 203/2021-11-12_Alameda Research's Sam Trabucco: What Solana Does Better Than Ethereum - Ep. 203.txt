which hit a three trillion dollar total market cap earlier this week what would you say is the significance of that milestone and what drivers led us here yeah the big the big news was that uh crypto hit like an all-time high for or like bitcoin hit an all-time high for like a few hours at least yeah like it's there's always a few things that like sort of point in various directions i think there's like been a steady stream of good news uh for uh for crypto and bitcoin in particular uh like the news that like tim cook owns crypto uh was was significant obviously a ton of regulatory news that's always coming in um and i i generally think that especially especially the u.s regulation uh like the the news coming out of the us has been mostly good for the most part uh in the past couple months and the fact that there hasn't been any big negative news is uh really the most important thing i think uh given that like their regulators are talking about crypto like congress uh it's like passing laws really into crypto and like nothing bad has happened there hasn't been like a a china banning crypto level thing happening in the u.s or really any other jurisdictions besides china and i think that's like in general um that's been the biggest driver of crypto's price increases uh which you know culminated recently and uh getting almost 70k um obviously there's been some pullback that's sort of been the more standard stuff where uh in general like leverage is very uh uh very popular uh in the crypto trading ecosystem like these big moves tend to be driven by by people trading with high leverage uh so if there's a small drawback like you know like if it goes from 69 to 68 uh there's some potential for there to be a lot of liquidations uh for people who go who got really leveraged long near the top uh which can drive it back you know more than it might if it were just people who were like deciding to sell and yeah so there's all these effects that are pointing in different directions uh obviously has led to crypto sort of steadily rising and this week getting getting quite high yeah i was surprised what you said about the regulators so you feel that the crypto provisions and the infrastructure bill they're not negative enough to affect the market and what we're talking about is for instance the one that defines brokers so broadly as to perhaps encompass miners and validators which would then require them to report on transactions in excess of ten thousand dollars to the irs which you know they wouldn't have access to that information but you feel that people kind of recognize that will be resolved and so it's a non-issue uh yeah so i'm not claiming that like the you know the the thing you're talking about uh like any other any other news that's come out i'm not claiming it's the best possible uh like pieces of news that could have pos that could have come out about crypto uh but like the us has like a pretty a pretty like consistent history uh about like the kinds of things that it that it does regulatory for you know different kinds of asset classes obviously crypto represents like this brand new thing that is like there is it has a lot of features that other asset classes just don't have uh but the us is like you know a reasonably aggressive jurisdiction uh regulatory for the most part and and i would say that yeah the kinds of things that we've seen come out about how it's about how the u.s plans to regulate crypto have been like probably a little better at least than that than uh than the expected set of things they might have done uh like it's very much in flux and it's unclear how things are going to keep going uh but yeah like i i've see i've certainly seen takes that uh you know the infrastructure bill uh has represented this like you know betrayal of of the system and how it's regulating crypto but like i don't really know what people expect out of the us like you can look at like what it's done to or not what it's done too but like how it regulates like various commodities uh it's obviously very aggressive in terms of defining things as securities uh and like restricting people from trading securities they're certainly gonna do something uh and this is this has it has hasn't represented anything too bad uh as of yet and how have you seen the bitcoin futures etfs affect the bitcoin markets uh yeah so that that's another thing uh the fact that like an etf like multiple etfs at this point have gotten uh approval to get off the ground it also represents like a decently big update in my opinion for years uh there's been there have been various parties trying to get a bitcoin etf passed uh and you know the fact that it actually happened like it is a pretty big update uh and i think the markets uh sort of agreed with that the like last week or a few weeks ago whenever uh uh whenever like the uh the first etf uh like started trading uh bitcoin like hit a different all-time high uh you know it hit a new all-time high this week that that we could also hit an all-time high yeah like the market obviously agreed that this was like you know like a decently positive update to the point where it like represented a big price increase and the fact that it and it didn't even exactly fizzle the the etf uh like was this either the first or second uh most traded etf in you know us history uh depending on like what what metrics you're using and yeah it was a quite exciting launch uh which you know led to sort of predictable price increases uh and like i said before there was like like these big price increases especially to local maximums uh tend to uh do like sort of have always tended to uh get undone a bit in the in the days following and that one did and the one this week did as well the the trend is what's really important to look at the longer term trend uh and obviously the market uh is seeing these things as good and ether has also been on a tear this week and has also hit an all-time high uh it was above 4 800 earlier what would you say is pushing up the price of eve uh yeah i mean so not even just specific to any any one coin throughout the history of crypto trading we've seen that uh every coin has some beta to bitcoin uh meaning that uh like when when bitcoin moves like all the other coins will at least move like you know to some extent uh in response uh that's part of what we're seeing certainly basically every altcoin has followed bitcoin uh to to some extent uh and i think that's yeah that's a lot of what we're seeing uh there's all but like you know like every coin also has uh very specific features uh to it uh ether has like as a layer one uh ether has like a lot of uh has quite a bit of adoption compared to like you know various other uh various other like hot chains right now uh and uh the fact that it's like it's continuing to like to increase uh with the rest of the crypto ecosystem uh indicates that people uh you know still have a decent amount of faith that ether will be like a part of the the future of finance and the future of decentralized finance or whatever people are uh like whichever specific application people are you know caring about um and i think yeah the fact that it's continuing to succeed uh just indicates that's what people think and obviously the network did also undergo a change in terms of its monetary policy back in august which more closely ties the usage of the network to the price but ether is definitely facing a big question mark in the form of the merge which is when the applications on ethereum 1.0 get moved to the proof of stake chain or ethereum 2.0 and that change is going to take place next year and meanwhile there are a lot of competitors that are nipping at the heels of ethereum so how do you see investors approaching both the opportunity with ethereum but also the risk in the form of this competition different people are doing different things uh like like you mentioned there are yeah there's there are many competitors at this point like solana has been making a lot of headlines for uh reaching like a pretty extraordinary market cap but considering where it was like a year ago and you know various other other chains as well something that like i've seen a decent amount of chatter about anyway is like the uh the fact that like just diversifying into like multiple sets of these things tends to be good uh like over the past like couple years or whatever like a ton of crypto projects have really succeeded quite a lot uh and uh it wasn't it's never been exactly clear which of these projects we're going to succeed like our priority like you can find various like a ton of people who had very different different and different investment thesis a priori uh who you know have all done quite well over the past few years and that's because crypto as a whole has done quite well uh and uh for the most part like like i i tend to think that like all of these all these projects and like uh specifically what we're talking about right now all these different chains or not all of them but like many of them have like you know have some decent chance of be like you know like doing quite well getting some piece of the adoption and like being relevant uh and you know like therefore succeeding price-wise as well yeah so i for the most part i think that anyone who claims that this chain is definitely going to be the one that you know gets all adoption and like everything else is like terrible that's just a bad opinion for the most part uh and i think that you know the the best investors and the best people who are thinking about these things like a lot uh tend to think that diversifying is smart all right so in a moment we're gonna discuss more about solana as well as luna but first a quick word from the sponsors who make the show possible there's a new cryptocurrency made for mobile that you can earn by downloading the nodal

solana's soul token has been on a tear this year up from less than fifty dollars just three months ago to close to 250 dollars now so what would you say has accounted for solana's rise uh yeah so i think there's a lot of factors uh sort of in solana's favor especially as compared to uh not not exactly as compared to like some of the other newer chains but like as compared to either specifically oh like obviously there's a ton of uh it's very fast uh it can achieve a ton of trend like many many more uh transactions a per like unit of time uh than ether can and and then most of his competitors can honestly uh and the fees are also this like quite small as compared to uh many many these other chains uh and so yeah there's been a lot of excitement about this and in particular there's been a lot of like exciting projects that are being built using solana uh as as a back-end yeah which i think that has gotten investors quite excited as well uh and yeah i think i think that's the big thing like the there's been a solana conference over the past week uh in lisbon uh and uh i wasn't there but uh several of our team members have uh have been there uh and the excitement and all the different projects that are like composable with each other and can actually represent like a future of finance to some extent are like legitimately happening on solana but yeah which i think is an important an important piece of why it's you know risen to be in the top five by market cap uh of you know all coins at this point uh and why uh yeah why people are so excited and what are some examples of those projects that are being built on solana that people are excited about like i don't want to like risk like not uh talking about any any uh exciting projects uh but like if you can name uh uh like a thing that is important for decentralized finance to be like a big piece of the ecosystem like there's someone doing it on solana like there are like there's uh perpetuals that are being built on solana there's uh all these lending platforms that are being built on solana there's uh dexes and whatnot and all these things are like really important to have exist uh in a uh in a stable ecosystem uh and yeah uh they're they're all being built on solana all right so um one of the interesting comments this week about solana actually came from sam bankman-free the former ceo of alameda research and he said at the yahoo finance and decrypt cryptoco's mainstream conference quote solana is one of the few currently existing public blockchains that has a really plausible roadmap to scale millions of transactions per second at you know fractions of a penny per transaction which is a scale that you need for this and then he said this is not where a lot of other blockchains have been focusing including ethereum so what's your take on what the future looks like for ethereum and solana do you think the two will coexist or do you think that one will come to dominate or do you think they'll just kind of take different niches or what will that look like uh yeah it's definitely an interesting question and i i don't i'm not especially confident about like certainly any timelines or any like exact uh exact answers here both have advantages right now i think solana uh yeah like we've already mentioned the technological advantages that solana has and i basically agree with the things that sam said yeah ethereum does have advantages though like it's uh something it can do a first mover advantage is like you know like really obviously something that ethereum has going for it uh it has a ton of adoption already uh it's been around forever uh there's there like you know as uh for all the uh for all the talking i'm doing about how much is being built on solana like much more already is built on ethereum it's impossible to deny that uh and uh yeah so i think that it's like uh it's unlikely that like certainly within like you know a year or like a couple years or whatever uh ethereum goes away because it already has so many users that already have so many people who are like using it for uh for applications that don't require uh anything uh that solana's offering that ethereum isn't uh and so yeah i do think that it's like quite likely that both will exist uh or like that uh specifically that ethereum will like continue being relevant just because like it's already like so so important to to the ecosystem in ways that are like you know kind of unlikely to be completely eroded away so no matter what chains are you know like the exciting chains going forward the ones that people are building on going forward uh ethereum likely still has a place yes yeah and um earlier when you were talking about some of the applications on solana i did also want to mention that alexis ohanian the co-founder of reddit is investing 100 million dollars to grow decentralized social media projects on solana so that uh could be another way in which solano differentiates them itself and would be you know kind of like another application that would be popular on solana so last topic uh this week tara began one of the biggest token burnings ever the community approved the burning of 89 million tokens which were worth 4.5 billion dollars what do you think of this massive burning of luna and in general what do you think is the outlook for luna i'll address the second question first uh like i think that luna is uh sort of just another like potentially exciting project uh which you know has uh like i i i don't want to quote any numbers here because i don't know the numbers offhand this that doesn't tend to be my forte exactly uh but i don't but like it's it's uh certainly represents another uh competitor to ethereum uh given like its increased capacity to to support various applications i mentioned before that diversifying tends to be the smart thing with these with these kinds of investments and i yeah i think that it's certainly a plausible competitor as well to the point where i wouldn't like specifically want to like that for or against it compared to the other possible competitors uh regarding the burn itself uh yeah i think it's uh the kind of thing that uh is like is very supportive of people who are trying to build projects uh using uh using luna uh and you know like i think it's a probably a good move on their part okay yeah in a way it it really is similar to what's happening with east now where the base fee gets burned um all right well this has been a great discussion thank you so much for coming on

bill will most likely become law on monday on november 5th the united states house of representatives passed the infrastructure investment and jobs act which contains two provisions that could heavily affect cryptocurrency tax reporting so-called crypto brokers must report customer gains via a 1099 and any transactions over 10 000 to the internal revenue service to many in the crypto community including advocacy groups such as coin center and the blockchain association the bill defines a broker too broadly and could potentially impose reporting requirements on entities such as crypto miners and wallet developers for whom it will be impossible to comply in addition to the broad definition of broker the bill includes an amendment to tax code 6050i which would require entities to report personal data on trading partners like social security numbers for digital asset transactions over ten thousand dollars coin center described the requirements of the bill as unworkable and possibly unconstitutional even more striking not reporting such an event would now be deemed a criminal felony according to abe sutherland in his appearance on unchained in october jake travinsky the newly hired executive vice president and head of policy at the blockchain association explained that getting the language changed is most likely a lost cause in the short term importantly nothing will happen right away he said the cryptic provisions don't go into effect until 2024. we can try to get them repealed or amended before then he also noted the 2022 midterm elections could reshape congress's attitude toward crypto however if nothing can be done to amend the legislation by 2024 a redefinition could fall to the treasury department it's up to the treasury department to decide who is subject to the provisions said ivory johnson founder of delancey wealth management to nba cnbc similar to the broker definition the treasury department will have to provide guidance twitter embraces web 3 via dedicated crypto team twitter announced a new business unit dedicated solely to crypto the news was first reported by the financial times tess reneerson formerly of interchain foundation will be leading a team named simply twitter crypto where nearson said the new unit will be focused on supporting the existing crypto community on twitter twitter truly gets crypto hello

posted a sneak peek of discord's future showing a direct integration with metamask into the popular gaming discussion platform however after a wave of negative responses to his tweet citron walked back the hint saying thanks for all the perspectives everyone we have no current plans to ship this internal concept for now we're focused on protecting users from spam scams and fraud web3 has lots of good but also lots of problems we need to work through at our scale more soon a new home for binance chiang pang zhao co-founder and ceo of binance hopes to secure status as a digital asset service provider in france in 2022 france will be a natural choice for a regional and even perhaps global head office said zhao in an interview with les echoes according to a translation from the block xiao went on to add we want to be regulated at this stage of our development this will allow us to grow faster five percent of the world's population 400 million people have already adopted crypto they are pioneers we now want to convince the remaining 95 xiao's words come as binance faces regulatory scrutiny from the united kingdom japan germany the united states and other jurisdictions q3 was tough for crypto communities especially coinbase third quarter earnings reports have slowly begun filtering out and the numbers for crypto companies have not been pretty coinbase for example saw a decline in monthly transacting users by 16 trading volume by 29 and net revenue by 39 between q2 of 2021 and q3 in response to the earnings report coinbase or coin shares fell roughly 10 on tuesday afternoon and after hours trading as of press time coin is down 4.1 percent on the week other centralized crypto communities saw similar dips between q2 and q3 square's cash app reported a 23 drop in its bitcoin profits in q3 robin hood's numbers were even more drastic as crypto revenue fell 78 between q2 and q3 accordingly total revenue shrank from 565 million dollars to 365 million dollars between earnings reports sec halted registration of tokens stemming from a wyoming-based dow the u.s securities and exchange commission or sec stopped a wyoming-based decentralized autonomous organization or dao from registering two tokens as securities the dow named the american crypto fed dao llc was legally recognized in wyoming as a limited liability company or llc back in july following wyoming's decision to allow such an action the sec alleges that the dao filed a materially deficient and misleading registration form known as a form 10 that failed to contain certain required information about the dow's business or tokens the sec alleges that the tokens ducot and lock are equity securities rather than utility tokens as the dow attempted to describe them according to gabriel shapiro general counsel at delphi digital it appears american crypto fed dao llc was a sham to be clear i don't fault the sec for this he said it clearly was a troll but does show that the come in and register not so easy of a thing he added this is getting farcical we need a better way ens rose 100 after airdrop ethereum name service or ens the company behind dot eth domain names began an airdrop of its governance token ens to existing name registrants this week shortly after the airdrop which gives users the power to vote on how ens will function going forward the ens token price skyrocketed shooting up to a high of 85.69 on wednesday morning at such high prices users are reporting their airdrops are now worth upwards of twenty thousand dollars interestingly to claim a job users had to vote on the e s governance constitution furthermore claimants were required to delegate tokens aka their voting power to addresses owned by the likes of coinbase that applied to be delegates as of press time thursday afternoon ens was at 63.57 a 100 increase from its initial trading price of around 30 good for a market cap of approximately 930 million dollars time for fun bits citycoin is
