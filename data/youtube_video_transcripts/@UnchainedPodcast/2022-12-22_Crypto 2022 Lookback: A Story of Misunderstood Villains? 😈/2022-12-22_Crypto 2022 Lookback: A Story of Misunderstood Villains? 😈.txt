you know I feel good about a lot of the impact that you know I think we're going to be able to have it wasn't a scam like it wasn't a fraud right it was a massive market failure sometimes the code does exactly what was intended it's just what was intended isn't what anyone wanted 2022 has been the craziest year in crypto as dominoes have fallen the community has turned its ire on one person then another then another and yet all of these people seem pretty good at rationalizing their actions which leaves us with a question who do you think is the biggest villain in crypto who doesn't believe they're a villain [Music] could it be Tara Luna's dokwon who on May 7th tweeted Anon you could listen to CT influence sores about UST to pegging for the 69th time or you could remember they're all now poor and go for a run instead a few days later Terra Luna collapsed do you feel any remorse for your cocky tone during that time [Music] so I I think I got carried you know too much carried away with interacting with other people on crypto Twitter or is it Celsius EO Alex machinski after being questioned about the health of Celsius machinski tweeted Mike do you even know one person who has a problem withdrawing from Celsius why spread fud and misinformation the next day Celsius paused customer withdrawals the following month it filed for bankruptcy the massive market failure of Terra Luna also hit hedge fund three arrows Capital as the firm went under Founders Sue Zhu and Kyle Davies ghosted their lenders then in July suju resurfaced with a very relatable Bloomberg interview he rejected the perception that he enjoyed an extravagant lifestyle noting that he biked to work and back every day and that his family only has two homes in Singapore and in an interview with CNBC his co-founder Kyle Davies denied that he was on the Run where are you now and what are you doing to get your investors money back uh well I mean first of all I'm in Bali I take it you're not in Bali because of the G20 are you there because Indonesia is one of seven countries that won't extradite you back to the United States it's a good place to be is the biggest villain broadcasting regularly right here on Unchained could it be haseeb who would abolish nft Creator royalties so let me give the the super villain argument for why I think actually I'm fine with the idea of destroying royalties or do the problems of 2022 actually extend back a year when Kim Kardashian promoted ethereum Max are you guys into crypto this is not Financial advice but sharing what my friends just told me about the ethereum max token or is the villain SEC chair Gary Gensler whose enforcement action against Kim Kardashian caused ethereum Max to pump again then there is mango markets exploiter avraham Eisenberg who as he put it was involved with a team that operated a highly profitable trading strategy it's hard to say oh the intent was that the top impression never changed I mean because the price has changed all the time so or is it as Robert says uh you can Rebrand a hacker or an exploit into a profitable trading strategy um I could try to Rebrand bank robbery it doesn't make them right and it doesn't make them legal but don't forget hasib who is still anti-creator royalties nfts were not built around creators they were built around speculators that's why all these people are here or is it CZ who some accused of being responsible for the collapse of FTX and to make matters worse CZ won't even make love after divorce or is it Elon Musk who bought Twitter only to immediately turn into Kim jong-ilon but amidst all this we can't forget about Caroline Ellison former CEO of Alameda research I think over time I've kind of only been become more convinced for the most part it'd be effective altruism movement is kind of like onto something good uh and we're definitely still like figuring a lot of stuff out and I feel quite uncertain about a lot of things uh but I think like it's you know goals and intentions are uh overall quite admirable two days before FTX revealed it was insolvent she tweeted that Alameda had an additional 10 billion dollars in assets where did that 10 billion dollars go was it effectively and altruistically donated let's ask Sam so I was vaguely aware that that was how some wires were being sent in the first place um didn't that set off alarm bells in your head but Sam seems just as surprised as everyone else hopefully this poll is complete and no other potential villain candidates emerge in the next few weeks thanks for playing ask the audience comment below with your vote we'll tally them all and announce the winner once we finish counting the mail-in ballots but I don't think this is it like right now I mean look I I've had a bad month [Music]
