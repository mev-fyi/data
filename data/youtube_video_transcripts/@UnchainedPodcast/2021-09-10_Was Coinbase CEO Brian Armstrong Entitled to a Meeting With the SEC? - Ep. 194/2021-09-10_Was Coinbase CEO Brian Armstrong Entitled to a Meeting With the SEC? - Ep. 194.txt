digitalassetresearch.com today's guest is ifrat lifney a deal business and policy reporter at the new york times welcome efrod hi thanks for having me this was a big week in crypto news both on a global stage and here in the us let's start talking about the conflict between coinbase and the sec which began with a tweet storm by coinbase ceo brian armstrong and a blog post by the chief legal officer paul gruel what did they say what did they say they were unhappy because so coinbase has a product that is sort of like a um somewhat resembles a bank account and that would allow people to get a high uh yield like high interest on their um deposits and they asked the sec for they and told sec they were planning to uh like release this and the sec said it could generate litigation and coinbase which likes to say that it really really wants to follow the rules got mad and started trolling a regulatory agency online and when you when you say trolling is that they instead they did go so coinbase went to the sec they asked they introduced their product they asked how would the agency respond to the product the agency said this could run afoul of securities laws and then coinbase's response was to go on twitter and to post on their own blog their estimation that it was their product is not a security and also to the um chief executive in his twitter thread had a lot to say about how the agency's behavior was sketchy and he had questions about the chairman and it seemed it was arguably it was arguably trolling a regulatory agency on social media yeah one thing i would say is um when brian introduced his threat as saying that he was going to describe sketchy behavior he did go on to talk about how when he went to dc he tried to talk to a number of regulators and the sec was the only one that refused to meet with him and that when the sec told them that they if the agency felt that their lens product was a security that it would not give clarity into the reasoning and so i think um that was you know what he was describing as sketchy but let's dive into this lent product how is that product structured and how does that compare to traditional securities or lending products well so i think there's a whole the one of the the questions i think right now is that it's not nothing is act nothing is actually uh finally settled and the products are new and they raise new questions and all of this though all of the law is about characterization and categorization so on the one hand coinbase's argument was like this is not at all like a security how is lending like a security it's like a bank account well okay you don't want to be an investment vehicle you want to be a bank but a bank would be highly highly regulated they would have a lot of different demands if if coinbase was running right from a regulatory perspective there would be a lot of demands if coinbase was running a bank in terms of like risks and guarantees and reserves and all kinds of things and so while it is true that the sec has not made necessarily made it very clear and a lot of this stuff is popping up relatively quickly so and government does not operate rulemaking does not happen quickly by necessity and people would not be happy if it did and so so that there is a space right now where i feel like there are a bunch of products that straddle lines and they haven't been characterized and businesses sometimes advance one characterization in one context because it's useful and so coinbase did talk about its lend product like a like a bank account like an account like an account i'm not totally sure if it would want to be talking to banking regulators instead of the sec you know because it's not clear yet it's not clear and it's not entirely clear where the how the ecosystem will evolve and develop and who should be in charge of all these things yeah i actually reached out to a few different crypto lawyers and hilariously i got really different answers there were some who uh felt it was definitely security there were others who felt that it was not and or or rather that the law was so unclear that it that it was it was not something that could be determined at this moment and um i think the cases that they were citing was the howie case which most listeners of mine will know because that was what was applied during the ico period and um that has the four prongs an investment contract um and a common enterprise with an expectation of profits dependent on a third party and then there was a new one that i hadn't heard of but or hadn't heard of before called reeves which had to do with notes um and i think there i did see another lawyer maybe bringing up one other one i didn't talk to that person um but the point is like i think you know as we've been saying it it's not totally clear and obviously maybe coinbase has one set of arguments and the sec has another um so what do you think that this whole i guess conflict says about how the sec is going to regulate crypto lending going forward so i think we honestly i just don't think we know or they know or anything else i mean i'm certain that they know more than i do yeah about what they're gonna do but my sense from some of the statements so there was an exchange between sec chair gary gensler and senator elizabeth warren over the summer an exchange of letters there was like a lot of discussion about all kinds of products including lending and borrowing there was a call for more authority like gensler said we need more authority from congress to regulate now what specifically like what more do they need i mean to me that indicates that there's a recognition that there are products or developments that are not currently covered under the law as it is written and that the to some degree for example the argument that coinbase made that like these old laws don't fit or whatever maybe they're right maybe the old laws don't fit maybe new laws have to be written i mean that's also one of the big debates like do we fit everything into how things are do new tools need new rules i mean so everything is unsettled from a legal perspective it's to me it strikes me as very early to make any determination and i think coinbase is trying to win the um the popular fight you know like that they're making uh the argument online because otherwise why are we gonna we're not gonna go around debating securities law unless they make it into a topic that we want to debate because you know yeah yeah and given that gensler did ask for this extra authority um to regulate this area um i do think that uh you know maybe there is merit to this idea that the law is not clear on what the lend product is um but i did wonder then for this alleged behavior of the sec that you know was like what brian called sketchy but you know whatever you know to whatever extent it was you know sketchy or or whatever you want to call it um their refusal to meet coinbase or whatever what do you think that says like do you think it says that perhaps the sec is kind of working things out and just not ready to say something or do you think that they're um yeah just waiting for more authority or what do you think is going on there well i think there are two different views of whether whether like how to interpret whether or not a [Music] government official will meet with a business person and there is a view that the business community would no doubt take that business and government must work together and it is you know and that the government should open its doors to business people who want to discuss and communicate well that's one view there's also a view that government must have a certain dignified distance from industry in order to create rules that are because government is not just there to promote industry it is also there to protect consumers and facilitate societies you know like they're not just there for the advancement of innovation and so i i don't actually think it's that problematic i think there's a view of the sec saying no we're not talking to crypto companies that's very honorable that doesn't mean it's not honorable to talk if you want if they were going to engage and they do engage on specific issues you know that's also fine but i don't think that the arrival of the the chief executive from california the first cryptocurrency company frankly he some of the language and his thread showed some of the language in armstrong's thread showed a sense of entitlement about what the government might owe that i don't know if it's shared by all americans i don't know that all americans feel that the cryptocurrency industry is owed or deserves anything in particular should they be treated fairly sure but it's i i found it unseemly right i'm sorry to say brian's tweet storm you mean yes but i'm in i'm in washington dc i you know so it's hard so obviously i i love like you know what i mean i'm by government but i do i think that there are two views and i don't think it's necessarily problematic for the sec to take a step and say like at this time we are not necessarily engaging in this way okay and just quick wrap wrap up on this before we move on to the next next topic what are coinbase's options going forward or do you have any insight into what it'll do next in terms of what in terms of lend yeah uh so they declined to speak to me about it so i don't know what their uh plans are and i don't i can't imagine i cannot imagine i can't i will not speculate on what their plans are okay well in a moment we are going to switch gears and talk about el salvador because that was also huge news but first a quick word from the sponsors who make the show possible with over 10 million users crypto.com

updates crypto data from digital asset research is available through refinitive or directly at digitalassetresearch.com back to my conversation with efrat lifney so let's turn to the other big news of the week el salvador and bitcoin tell us what happened there so uh a central american nation adopted bitcoin as legal tender and so that's the first country in the world to adopt bitcoin as a currency so they're adding bitcoin to the dollar which is they adopted in 2001 and it was arguably a historic day for i mean certainly a historic day for for cryptocurrency right i mean i would say so and i think it was something you know what there were there's a lot of debate about the the merits of the of the adoption and the process of adoption but there is i think little question that it was a big day for bitcoin it was like a big event for a country to adopt this project so talk a little bit about kind of the questions it raised or the controversy around it what were some of those issues so one um i think like we could start with the way that the um the adoption was announced so it was announced by the president naibu kelly in a uh bitcoin conference so a recorded announcement in a bitcoin conference in miami in english so the people of el salvador heard about it second it was passed very quickly uh thereafter with like minimal debate while the little bit of debate was happening in congress um buchelli was on a social media chat with american bitcoin enthusiasts and the reason i raised that is that i i there is something the project is being advanced as a project for financial inclusion and the vast majority of salvadorans do not have bank accounts and it is true that arguably like a mobile phone based financial system could improve the economic life of some salvadorans but there there is a question about the the way um moved on this and also like his motivations all right it's who is he wooing like it could be great for el salvador but there are reasons to be wary i know so when you say it could be great what are some of the i guess the pros of having adopted bitcoin as legal tender so arguably if you see bitcoin not as if you don't think about because bitcoin is not a practical payment mechanism right it's it's volatile it's like it's almost everything you don't want in uh in a currency for for daily use yeah it's and so but if you see bitcoin as a like a stand-in for blockchain like let's say we talk about bitcoin because that's what we know but what we mean is that a whole financial system exists on the blockchain where people are able to just arguably like the lend product and things like that where there are accounts uh where you can borrow crypto like you can borrow money based on your crypto and you don't need the credit checks and you don't need the same interaction with institutions theoretically this is i mean that's the promise of crypto theoretically is that it you know it brings billions into the financial into a alternate financial system so but how did the el salvadoran people react to the adoption of bitcoin as legal currency so it is my understanding that it was there's you know i mean there's a range there there's a range surely yeah um but there but it there were protests part of the protest i think so the in conjunction with the protest about bitcoin people were also protesting the passage of a bunch of um laws about whether you know how quickly that you can fire prosecutors and judges over age 60 and so that law which is more recent than the bitcoin law was also passed very quickly and with minimal debate and so i think in the eyes of people who are worried about buchelle these actions indicate that whatever he's saying about uh economic liberation or any other kind of liberation he's autocr arguably autocratic so there are protests they are not aimed solely at bitcoin in terms of the general population i think from based on the polls of in the national newspaper people are not that interested the vast majority of people said they would not want to transact in bitcoin like just something like three quarters yeah yeah i saw the same poll so um yeah one other issue was i did see some pro-bitcoin groups in the u.s protesting what is called article seven in the salvadoran law which says quote every economic agent must accept bitcoin as payment when offered to him by whoever acquires a good or service so was for the protest which i know you said had it also do with this other law but what was that part of the reason they were protesting or like what were their reasons for protesting bitcoin i think they're the their reasons are more general that they're it's a more generalized but there are a couple so let's there are a couple of problems with the um with the bitcoin law from the perspective of even bitcoin enthusiasts in the united states and it's so it is this mandate now number one you have a government you have a a payment mechanism that was designed to to operate outside the total government control of money being co-opted by a government and then mandated and that is why the article 7 thing is like it's like a double frustration for bitcoin fences like not only did the government take a money that was supposed to be outside of government which you know you can argue whatever there are arguments either way but they adopt this non-governmental decentralized money as money that the government recognizes and then mandates its use when it was designed for choice and it's very problematic philosophically for bitcoin like people are cheering this movement on but the mode in which it's happening is undermining the very reason for bitcoin's me it's complicated right i mean yeah i know um one of the people that i saw tweeting about that one and he wrote an article on this in coindesk is uh jerry brito who's the head of coin center which the whole reason you know for coin centers being is to advocate for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies it here in the us and so it was interesting that um you know he really took objection to that um so actually i spoke to him and one of the things that was really interesting was that he raised that and he says this is like sort of moral philosophical problem but then he's he also was concerned he's like on a practical level like we are what is this is not really work yet as a payment mechanism so that is you know there are there are a lot of conflicts in americans going abroad and advocating for things that in societies that they may or may not completely understand yeah i mean i did see um yeah some people who happen to be there now demonstrating how they're paying for things at coffee shops and stuff using the lightning network so perhaps they've found the places where it's working out well but yeah so going forward what developments or storylines are you going to be watching for in terms of uh you know what happens with bitcoin and el salvador so well there are there are a bunch of things i mean price volatility price volatility is interesting right i mean this now a country has taken on the risk of you know whatever the same risk that investors do at a just at a totally different scale so that's interesting i mean that's something to follow i think the extent to which this works or doesn't work we'll be watching you know what i mean we'll be watching i don't think that there will be a determination of whether it's a success or failure for quite some time and maybe both arguments will be made simultaneously all the time which on some level they are being made right now [Laughter] yes yes that's um par for the course in pretty much all corners of the world and the internet um okay well this has been a great discussion thank you so much for coming on
