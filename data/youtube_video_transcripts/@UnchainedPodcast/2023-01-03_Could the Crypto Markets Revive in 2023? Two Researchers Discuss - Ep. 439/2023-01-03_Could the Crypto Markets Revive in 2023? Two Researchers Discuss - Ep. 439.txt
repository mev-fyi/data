here to discuss are Lucas nutsy head of r d at coinmetrics and Larry Cermak VP of research at the Block welcome Lucas and Larry thank you Laura hi Laura happy to be here 2022 was it doozy for the crypto industry certainly one for the history books what developments do you think we'll see in 2023 that will be a direct result of the events of last year Lucas do you want to start yeah I think with the collapse of FDX we've seen a bit of a reckoning especially in D5 projects that were supported by FDX I think in 2023 we're going to see a lot more search for product Market fits uh I think FDX was really centered around the speculative use case of crypto assets where it predominantly served as a speculation platform right they did fund a lot of really interesting projects in the space but at the same time the majority of their focus was really the specular use case I think given the skill of the collapse of FDX we're going to see a really a reshift in in the priorities and potentially a focus on use cases that really add value and potentially abstract the way even the notion that there's a blockchain in the background uh I think the product Market fit of projects is going to get tested especially if markets continue to contract and we might finally see projects that uh have product Market fit to survive because they're providing you know services that are valuable Larry what do you think yeah so I I agree this uh Lucas a couple of things I would add on top of that so with uh with the collapse of FTX and three arrows and a bunch of other projects uh We've also seen a pretty large collapse in terms of credit in the market which generally just translates to less liquidity because market makers have less available cash to Market make ways on top of that we also see significantly less retail in the market which kind of removes the other side of a lot of the trades so that also translates into into slightly less liquidy so I think that will continue in 2023 and and just overall exactly like Luca said there's going to be flights to actual quality and and there's not going to be as much speculation uh I think the the macro markets will continue kind of dictating how crypto markets overall recover and how they turn out in 2023 just overall it's going to be slightly slower and quieter than we saw in 2022 that would be kind of my guess and there's going to be a lot of impact from 2022 mainly because people are going to be scared they're going to be constantly looking for you know as skeptical as you can be we already see that now everyone's second guessing everything um and I think that's that's going to continue being a trend yeah yeah and I would say that part of that also is simply because the public perception of crypto has really taken a beating so when you talk about how there's not that much retail I don't know how soon they're going to come back but one thing I wanted to ask just to draw on your comments a little bit more is I saw that coinmetrics published this chart of the crypto prices in 2022 I'm sure everybody saw this because this was a very sobering chart with you know fire engine red colors for uh how the prices have gone something that was fascinating to me was that some of the coins that fared better were ones that aren't even thought of as very good like Tron Ripple bsv and ethereum classic which just kind of funny um but anyway so I was just curious like do you feel that the prices are going to draw down even further in 2023 or are we going to see some upticks somewhere or what's your take yeah this was a year or 2022 was a year of pain right there was a lot of projects that just collapsed effectively became zombie projects with no one really backing them um and well you saw with projects that were able to retain some momentum uh were the communities Behind these projects that at times are not the healthiest but the fact that there are communities Behind these projects certainly helps on the market side if you have a market that's predominantly retail for some of these assets that are deemed you know not of particularly high quality but you have a strong retail community that can also be incredibly powerful there's only so much that that will get you though there's um you know at some point that project needs to deliver or it needs to continue to to pump in order for this cohort of retail investors to continue to support it and we saw this in the aftermath of the 2017 bull market as well right a lot of projects that had huge communities Iota xrp they weren't immune to the continuation of the bear Market uh and the same might be happening here where you have a little bit of a lag but uh retail users are quite price responsive so if we continue to see a decrease those projects will follow suit as well I think the ones that were able to survive I think they're so hanging on to that belief that the prices will will continue to pump which what we're seeing in the low macro uh situation you know it's probably not going to be the case one more thing I'll add to that and I totally agree with Lucas is is that there's also uh the effect of just projects that have unlocked or investors bought a lot of coins for cheap and with a lot of the projects that you named you know xrp bsv even Bitcoin and ethereum you know it just doesn't exist but then you look at something like Solana or some of these other coins and you know VCS bought ads still at this point it's gone down 95 but they still bought it prices they're still like 80 lower these Dynamics do a lot in a bear Market in a bull market it almost became a meme where there's an unlock you know the price will actually go up in this market long term it actually isn't that why because in some investors are very much in the riot and if they've bought tokens for cheap those tokens will be sold and and you know when you look at on-shade stuff sure Lucas is tracking as well you see a ton of selling even at these really low prices by investors and in some of it is force selling because they're just down a lot and they don't want to disappoint anymore so these unlocks actually are quite bearish in a market like this and I think that will continue being the case uh we've seen a ton of ton of VC investment in the LA in in 2022 and and some of these prices are still much higher than some of these investors bought them at so I think that will continue being a trend as well uh it will become much more popular for diligent investors to track unlocks much closer uh including 23 for sure yeah and not to pile on with the negative news but in addition to that we still have kind of continuing Fallout and contagion obviously you know we had you know the first set of collapses but then now because of FTX there's this like Cloud on the horizon with the Genesis dcg Gemini earned situation by extension even grayscale potentially could be a problem here so what do you guys think might happen there and how do you think that will also affect both the industry and the market yeah contagion is not something that happens immediately right it certainly did for a lot of projects in the aftermath of of the the collapse of FDX projects that didn't really have that much runway or that even from a public perception because they're a part of you know what's now considered a massive scam uh they were unable to to survive but a lot of these larger institutions they're able to move Capital around and obtain short-term liquidity at times at very unfavorable terms so there's always that that danger that in the short term there they can remain afloat and suppress any sort of concerns around their solvency but uh people are Skirmish and and afraid because if those conditions are not favorable to the point where they're just pushing the problem further down the line you have these cascading failures right and I think it's it's highly likely that we haven't seen the full extent of contagion it's been you know only a couple of months now not even a couple of months I I should say that the collapse of FDX feels like the years it feels like four years it's it's been uh you know only only a few a few uh days so it's it's something that uh will likely haunt us a little bit still uh in 2023 I think we're gonna have a couple of additional companies that were able to obtain short-term liquidity and survive push the issue from down the line but if those conditions are also Market dependent and the markets continue to contract the contagion will also lead to their their demise as well one quarter is really nothing uh when it comes to this level of the scale of fraud so it will likely be a recurring Topic in 2023 yeah what I'll add is that contingent really works in funny ways uh like like we saw with Terra tear it and translate it into three arrows having issues and then going down completely obviously combined with gbtc but regardless and then after it took another five months for FTX to go down whilst having issues with both of these and and when you look at Genesis I mean Genesis is quite similar I mean obviously I I don't think that there's fraught there but they have been exposed to effectively every single collapse that we we saw in 2022 I mean it was it was Terror exposure it was exposure to three arrows they had there was some block fight deals as well and then I think finally the FDX as well so there has been just so much beating that Genesis has taken and obviously there isn't much concrete information uh but I mean it's it's pretty much understood that there are at least you know one maybe even two billion in a hall right now and it kind of reminds to be seen how that will be solved and what effect I will have on its parent organization and other companies in that parent organization do you want to make a prediction about one or the other if dcg goes down this is going to be big news for the industry so yeah I mean it's it's just a really difficult time to be struggling because everyone else is struggling and it's really difficult to raise Capital like that that's the that's the entire story of the end of 2022 is that the projects are having issues regardless of how well they're structured and how well their business looks it's really really hard to actually get any capital and I think that's exactly what dcg and Genesis are running into right now so I don't it's it's difficult to make predictions they could fight Capital somewhere but I think if they don't it could definitely be a pretty significant issue because Genesis and grayscale are massively important and grayscale as we know you know two products gbt they're both trading at roughly 50 discounts uh right now and it's because everyone is scared of what could happen if this actually ends up materializing and it is somewhat of a possibility that those funds would have to be liquidated if someone else for example bought these assets and they wanted to go in that direction whereas if it's just grayscale and you know that Barry isn't really interested in liquidating any in your of the songs because they're just generating a lot of money there's less certainty there so I think I think what I'll end up seeing but it's definitely scary and it's definitely worth like keeping really really close I own I was just gonna say that I think valuations will have to come down too if it is in fact a very tough environment to raise capital and even perpetuate their their business model right a lot of their their business models rely on folks trading demand for for Lending and with markets Contracting so those you know the revenues so if they have to basically raise funds on the on the basis of equity it's very likely that valuations will have to come down quite considerably in 2023 as a result of you know their short-term liquidity crunch yeah and I I would just say I think that's already happening and one good example of that is when you look at coinvest stock I mean it's trading at less than 80 billion dollars market cap and it's in the bear Market 2018 which in my opinion was actually worse in a lot of ways because people thought crypto would die if they raced at 8 billion so it's currently less than the investors paid in 2018 bear market and that's on the second there you know after the direct listing when it's trading on the market so I think valuations have already contracted insanely it's just not as visible yet but I think this year it will become visible quite quite a lot more so it's interesting that you said that you felt that the 2018 bear Market was actually worse because people have been noticing that in previous various Cycles the prices is would draw down but they wouldn't ever really go below the high of the previous cycle the previous bubble and in this cycle they have gone well at least for Bitcoin it's gone below the high of the 2017-2018 cycle so I was curious why you thought that was and kind of what you thought that meant for this bear Market yeah I think just to clarify I think in some ways it's better in some ways it's worse I think where it's actually better is that there are now it's kind of common thinking that crypto will be back that it will it will continue coming back and the prices will eventually Rebound in 2018 I remember like you know I I basically I started working at the Block play 2018 I was thinking in two years I might not have a job because like this thing just might not turn out and and this year I'm just not seeing that as much but it's also worse in a lot of ways like we didn't see as many collapses as we did in 2022 like 2018 it was just kind of like slow bleeding into nothing and projects dying because they ran out of money whereas in 2022 we just saw absolute you know these projects could absolutely destroyed like dropped back to actual zero which which previously was kind of a meme it can't go to zero but a lot of these projects actually did go to zero so I think those are kind of the the two aspects that that I would compare to but in a lot of ways you know the industry is much larger and to answer your question why did prices actually go lower I think a reasonable response would be that the macro environment is actually significantly worse than it was 2018 20 2018 was kind of isolated in my opinion to the crypto bowl and bear Cycles whereas now you know you have Tesla going down 80 as well you have other stocks that are very speculatory going down as well that's because there's just significantly less capital and because of what central banks are doing with the interest rates you know that's really challenging when you combine the bear Market of the normal Cycles in crypto plus also the macro bear market and I think prices could actually go a lot lower despite what people think but they might also not it's it's just really difficult to read in a market like this yeah I would add that crypto very much trades like an industry if you think about it as an industry as a highly speculative Tech stock right so we haven't seen uh a recession coinciding with crypto existing uh we also haven't seen uh a period of uh monetary tightening uh when crypto existed so it is very difficult to make predictions and and look retrospectively right in terms of understanding what will be the market dynamics because a lot of the Investments that came into this space uh were really coming from traditional funds uh you know there's certainly a retail Mania as well in credit tightening capital is not as fluid and it becomes a lot harder for this scale of Investments really take place that's why I think there's going to be this Reckoning of what is this technology actually doing and what problems is is it solving because these investors are going to have to be very careful deploying into projects that are you know even pre-launch as in 2017 I was saw in 2017 were really just based on an idea a white paper not a whole lot of actually organic users and and actual software written in a lot of ways though this is a lot more of an optimistic time for the industry relative to 2018 I think in terms of use cases there are clearly a lot more use cases for this technology now that coincide with more of a thirst for better Services uh you know less surveillance perhaps in some of these these apps freedom of speech is is a huge Topic in today's discourse uh and you know ownership of data so I think there are a lot of interesting use cases that have been somewhat validated maybe to not to their full extent but um there are various areas now that really just didn't exist in 2018 maybe were created because of this influx of capital but uh if one of them goes well which there's High likelihood that you know one of these areas that this industry called crypto is is pursuing will actually provide value I think the industry itself will be you know uplifted we just haven't really seen that yet and because it's coinciding with a pretty damning collapse in terms of traditional finance and credit tightening it is something that is concerning but there are reasons to be optimistic as well yeah so we've touched on crypto Venture investing in a few different points in this discussion and I would say the industry is probably having its own sort of Reckoning right now and yet it's also just kind of this interesting place because VCS have raised 78 of all the funding they've ever raised in the last two years alone portfolio performance maybe hasn't been so great but given how much cash they have at the moment I was curious where you thought crypto VC would go in 2023 I can I can apply here quickly I think you're totally right there's still a lot of cash on the sidelines from these investors what I what we've seen and we track all these deals as well internally is that oh Capital hasn't been allocated over the last you know three to six months as much as as it was before despite there being a lot of capital on the sidelines but also a lot of these funds as you guys know like they have a mandate to invest some of them are long only funds uh and some of them you know okay not just justify having a few billion dollar a few billions of dollars on the sidelines not doing anything so I I do think that they will eventually have to be allocated but there is significantly higher standards kind of as Lucas mentioned the valuations have tanked massively I mean but from what I've seen privately as well as kind of just from the publicly announced deals really most companies are raising right now or raising because they're in distressed situations because they're running out of money and because they're in some way like have to race or they're just gonna have to close the project and the valuations of like seed Investments as well as series a have tanked in my kind of experience at least 60 uh like six months ago we saw valuations for City Investments going from anywhere like 6200 million dollars and now they're lucky if they're getting 15 to 20 just like before so so I think you know that's playing a large effect as well but on the other hand These funds eventually will have to allocate the capital and I think there's just going to be more Focus for quality and for projects that are more long-term oriented and maybe not as focused on speculation that would be kind of my quick opinion yeah I completely agree I think there is there for some VCS this is the perfect environment right because especially for the companies that need short-term liquidity those that raised in 2020 2021 and even some that have raised earlier this year before the market saw the second kind of wave of failures and contractions it is a perfect environment because they have the dry powder there are companies that need capital and that are taking these valuation hits so it's something that to them could be very positive I think the nature of what they're doing though has probably changed quite a bit especially when you come comes to due diligence I think what folks have realized post FDX collapses the level of due diligence that some of these VCS were doing in their companies that they're investing in the individuals that they were backing was really lackluster so there were you know our analysis like my metrics has shown some pretty crazy smoking guns around FTX and their activities that were just not really understood or or acknowledged by a lot of these VCS right I don't I don't think they were scrutinizing a lot of these projects to their full extent so in a lot of ways this is a positive for the industry as well because there's pressure for them not only to take these you know deals that for companies that are in the stress that need short-term liquidity but it also enables them to or pushes them to do more due diligence on their Investments uh and potentially prevent scams of this magnitude from growing because now we probably learned a pretty painful lesson in in the need for due diligence so in a lot of ways this is a very favorable environment for VC investing but it has changed in terms of the nature of the the work that's that entails uh making an investment in into a crypto company at the moment another part of the industry that is just kind of a source of mostly bad news um is Bitcoin mining uh Bitcoin miners as an industry are about four billion dollars in debt and a number of them including large ones like core scientific have filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy and also obviously with the price of Bitcoin and the doldrums mining is actually unprofitable for many or most of them so what do you guys expect to happen amongst Bitcoin miners in 2023 I think there's going to be a massive collapse in in hash rates that's uh you know just waiting to to take place um a lot of the Asics that are live right now mining Bitcoin uh they were financed through debt um and because of the contraction the price of Bitcoin a lot of these operations are just not profitable right but they're they're forced to continue to mine because they need to get something out of their existing Hardware they cannot afford not to mine so there's a lot of speculation as to why hash rate was continuing to to go up when the price of Bitcoin had collapsed quite drastically and that's essentially the reason right they do not own the machines that they they're using to mine Bitcoin uh a lot of them Finance these machines and those machines sometimes are even used as collateral so as uh the market conditions uh worsen their profitability goes down electricity prices have also been fluctuating quite a lot it's not as bad as as once was but they had to take a hit from increases in electricity prices coinciding with a very negative environment for Bitcoin so ultimately I think we're gonna see a continuation in in a decrease in hash rates and we'll see a lot of of markets for Asics like secondary markets for Asics but uh likely to you know extend this the pain really I don't think this decrease in hash rate will be a cause of concern from a security perspective all the evidence that we've seen is that Bitcoin drastically over pays for its Security in terms of potential attack vectors but it is not something that is positive news really there's no twist around you know why this is potentially good I think it is going to be a painful environment for miners heading into next year as a result of this this collapse not only in the Press of of Bitcoin hash rate going down and also the value of these Asics that were at times paid over uh MSRP also collapsing as a result of of this contraction in the market the only thing I'll add to that is is and I totally agree is that this will really be a cleansing of of the overall kind of quality of miners out there the companies overall those that have that are prepared to you know properly use Hedges properly actually sell and not overuse the credit that they can get those are the ones that kind of deserve to survive in my opinion and those that haven't done a good job that have just been kind of greedy and overextended because they thought that you know bitcoin price would keep going up or for whatever reason uh those maybe don't deserve it as much because then they end up causing issues like like we've seen and then there's a ton of companies with exposure to these firms like 100 including Genesis I think uh so so these while they're much smaller than some something like FTX blowing up or or any other company filing for bankruptcy these also have effects on on the space overall and I think overall exactly like Lucas said it actually it will go down but it will actually improve the quality of these operations for the next cycle and the people who actually know what they're doing are going to be very valuable uh it's when price goes up it's easy to make money when price goes down it's actually very difficult and and those that are run the most efficiently those are the ones that survive so hopefully that translates into the next cycle hopefully if it comes yeah it's almost like

in the description back to my conversation with Lucas and Larry had actually probably a pretty good 2022 except for one sort of big black eye which is the fact that kind of before the merge people didn't seem to pay too much attention to how centralizing the flashbots mov boost relay could be and then obviously when the sanctions happened right before the merge suddenly that became a concern and then obviously after the merge now we're seeing 70 of blocks being censored Mev boost itself accounts for about 60 of all blocks in ethereum so I was curious what you thought would happen to ethereum in terms of this question of centralization yeah it's probably one of the most concerning Trends uh in terms of of censorship I think the whole structure of Mev infrastructure is concerned not only from the censorship perspective but there are also single points of failure that were introduced as a result of this right so if you look at how to attack a crypto Network you know 101 the biggest power that an attacker could get is the composition of a block the transactions that are inside of that block it is like this notion of adding transactions to a block and aggregating transactions to the block is basically what muv is right you want to organize the transactions in a block in the most profit maximizing way at times by receiving transactions directly from traders that are extracting Arbitrage profits from various different markets this in the context of proof of work is done mostly by mining pools so mining pools would aggregate the work from all the their constituents that were using that mining pool and they themselves would select um the composition of the transactions in a block it's still the case that you know the majority of blocks in Bitcoin are selected by less than 20 entities and it is probably one of the biggest sources of concern at least in my view when it comes to security the hypothesis with a theorem was that that structure would be improved because now you have a much broader set of of validators that are acting like minors and appending the blockchain add a new blocks to the blockchain but in reality there's another centralizing force behind us right where you basically replace the structure with mining pools with their Mev counterparts uh and Mev infrastructure providers so it is in a sense uh you know pretty negative because it is something that the trend for Mev and the profitability of Mev is a lot more tempting than say what a mining pool operator would do to maximize their profits uh with Mev you have a lot more entities involved um and that are relying on these open source times uh endpoints but a lot of them are not open source and that also has its own set of challenges but decentralization forces are are very powerful especially in mov because centralization the more centralized that you get the more opportunities you have to make more money let alone all of the potential security concerns that emerge as a result of this there are some good news there I think there's a lot of work in what's called proposer block separation PBS that's being discussed right now I do think it's something that needs to take place at the base layer and we've had strong cohorts of users that support this idea that any of you needs to be more modular and there needs to be more safeguards so that you're basically not replacing a structure that was less than ideal uh with a structure that is you know more predatory and potentially dangerous to the entirety of the network so bear markets tend to be positive in the sense of it's when things get billed and I'm hopeful that PBS will be something pretty high on the priorities list within the the ethereum researchers that are working exclusively on on MLG those are really good explanation so I don't have much to add I will say Laura exactly like you said that it was kind of unexpected for a lot of people that censoring blocks in this case are complying with sanctions would happen this fast I think that was those definitely quite unexpected for a lot of people given the tornado situation exactly as Lucas said there are now initiatives and flashbots is developing one of them as well to kind of like decent centralized building of the blocks itself and kind of like create a mental kind of a plug-in mempool that would solve some decentralization issues but I think it was not expected that that this would come up as fast as it did and and therefore it is one of the largest concerns for me as well when it comes to ethereum and it's also slightly concerning that a lot of like really prominent ethereum community members are not talking about it and they're kind of like ignoring it and it's like oh this is going to be fun because you know a year from now or two years from now this will be fixed I would expect uh just like in Bitcoin when there is some threat even if it's just perceived a short term to decentralization people would speak up a lot and people would really you know talk about this as much as as much as they possibly can and that's one thing that I found quite concerning myself is that a lot of the prominent people have just not talked about it enough and uh are just kind of like closing their eye to those concerns whereas if it's a concern with Solana or concern with anything else that that is related to Central station they bring it up immediately that kind of approach by the community itself is a bit concerning for making the blockchain long-term as decentralized as possible there'll just be some some thoughts I I would add to it Luca said because that was great yeah but are you so it seems like you both are kind of optimistic that the community will resolve that is that how I could characterize that I am um I I think this is not going to be an issue but it's kind of unclear how long that will take uh long term it could it could be a year could be two years and in that time you know there is there are attack vectors uh in ethereum that are not good for the project itself so I was just going to say that you know I really resonate with this notion that a lot of voices in the ethereum community I think need to be louder about this being in fact a problem I think this is how these issues get resolved I'm optimistic that you know this is in essence a technical problem uh to be solved it's not something possible there are various solutions that have been proposed uh to improve the decentralization of muv uh it's interesting if you talk to Mev Engineers that are working on this directly uh it's almost like a nuclear scientist mentality you know they understand they're working with plutonium and they don't want it to lead to Contagion and you know a nuclear disaster I think there's awareness of their responsibility a lot of these folks might not talk as publicly as others but it is something that I've seen a lot of really interesting even papers that are published openly about Fair transaction sequencing Block composability in terms of of mov it is something that needs to be discussed because in a period where you see decreases in interest especially from retail in defy and and D5 protocols Mev opportunities also decrease and what that might ultimately lead to is Mev Searchers and firms that specialize in New movie engaging in riskier and potentially more dangerous Behavior there are various types of miv attacks that are detrimental to the health of the network where you're actually perpetuating these so-called reorgs where you're rolling the chain back so transactions that you thought were final are no longer final they not even exist in the blockchain and there are new novel attack vectors that exist because of this ability so I I don't I think shruggling this problem as you know something that you know is not a problem I think it's it's dangerous because as things get more uh bearish what we've seen is that the strategies get more creative and that creativity mine tail and impact to real users of these networks through things like Time Bandit attacks which is really the the worst case scenario for for an muv attack which actually entails sending transactions back to the mempool and disrupting you know several users so it does seem like there are some promising solutions to do this but I definitely Echo Lara's comments on you know we need to take this this issue seriously and elevates the folks that are actually working on this yeah so as I mentioned before despite this one major issue ethereum otherwise had uh what by all accounts is a really pretty good year um in addition to the successful merge which obviously was a an amazing technical feat ethereum used to face a lot of competition from other layer ones the kind of lunavax Worlds which obviously Solana and Luna are either non-existent or struggling um so I was curious kind of where you thought that was going to go if there were going to be credible competitors in 2023 because related is sort of this scaling dilemma because in 2022 we did see some of these layer twos take off so I kind of wondered how you thought the scaling competition would play out in 2023 I think similar like you said generally there's just going to be less appetite for projects that are just alternative player ones because there's just less there's going to be less speculation and less cash in the system overall so I think those narratives will slowly kind of be less powerful as they were in 2022 on the other hand exactly like you mentioned I think layer twos are all kind of coming to the point where they're maturing as technology as and and especially in the bear Market there's slightly more time to build you can you can take your time a little bit more uh prior to shipping and actually properly built product I think that's going to be the largest Focus uh obviously we already saw optimism arbitrum gain some traction and some activity I think the first half of of the of 2023 will be uh ZK relapse actually launching for the first time I I was kind of optimistic this would happen in 2022 unfortunately didn't I am now again optimistic this will happen in the first half of 2023 I think you know even the solutions that polygon is building to kind of transfer to proof of stake chain into uh zkevm chain is really interesting you have start net launching relatively soon uh Z casing as well and that scroll like those projects are actually really Advanced when it comes to technologically almost solving the scaling to a lot in my opinion while inheriting really good security for the system overall and I think that's where that's where most of the focus will be what I think the dynamic that will be interesting is that a lot of these projects will have their own tokens we already have optimism token arbitrimple no doubt do a token relatively soon you have Stark that already said that they will have a token and all of these projects will have tokens and then how does the value accrual look like for these projects if they get a lot of traction if it actually becomes a layer where a lot of the smart contract applications happen how does that battle with the with the main chain uh with ethereum when it comes to investability uh I think that's going to be really interesting to to see and and to kind of witness as we go into the next bull market hopefully within a few years uh it's not completely clear to me which chain actually kind of accrues the most value like if start that becomes the most valuable or the most activity happens on strike that and ethereum is kind of just for validating those those actions that happen there then where does the value actually crew all right I'm not totally clear on that I don't think many people are actually yeah I completely agree I think the there's been a reckoning of l1s as well right in terms of what is truly their value proposition uh and I think with Solana specifically are the trade-offs that come with that level of scalability actually worth it I can tell you you know trying to do hunting analysis on Solana was incredibly difficult in the aftermath of Dev Dex collapse you know Solana in one day produces more data than Bitcoin produces in an entire year that's roughly around 100 gigabytes of new data per day which is quite drastic uh and it entails some quite unique challenges when it comes to looking at historical information because you need to go back in time and store that data historically to be able to answer some basic questions of like what was the balance of Alameda uh you know back in early 2022 a lot of nodes just discard that information by default so transparency is not something that a lot of these yellow ones truly embraced which I think now because of the severity of the FTX collapse will be top of mind and at times might be structurally incompatible with how these l1s were even designed from the from the get-go so there will be a gigantic I think push to improve the transparency of these networks to give you one example of this we found some really interesting mints of the serum decentralized exchange happening in ethereum and going straight to Solana via Bridge not non-disclosed mints comprising about 60 percent of the circulating supply of serum just Supply those just mince it off thin air and Center wait when that was uh that took place I believe in early 2022 and then mid-2022 so when we think about you know how did uh Sam make bail and was able to get bail money just the percentage of it right that that was that was no no no there was no okay literally yeah it's pretty complex right they just put up the house and then like the 250 mil is just like kind of you know celebratory thing I guess it's like some yeah just a number they put on there it's like if you don't show up you know your parents and and these other signers will have to pay this money yeah yeah but there was no money actually exchanged yeah I was making this point because there's a lot that you can't really assess about you know Sam's true net worth as of today because you can't really look at the data uh from those mints going into Solana right there's a lot of transparency issues with a lot of these uh ones that prevent you from being able to do due diligence at their full extent and if it's true that you know VCS have also been through this Reckoning of having to be more due diligent uh when it comes to um investing new layer ones I do think transparency will be at the top of kind of the priorities even more so than something like scalabilities now that we have roll up solutions that uh are fully scalable uh live so I think it's something that layer ones will have to rethink a lot of the layer ones that really made strides in the previous run will have to be redesigned so that they're more friendly towards you know on-train analysts and and optional transparency as a really a requirement for for an investment I just wanted to add like really quickly two things that I learned since the FDX collapse really one is that very few people are actually checking the chain like you can say well everyone's watching the blockchain all the time it's actually not true like sometimes I find things randomly by manually scrolling through scan and no one found before and it's like a really important thing so I would say that needs to change as well into the next market like there need to be better monitoring tools people need to pay more attention just in general because exactly like Lucas said there were a lot of things that we could have picked up on if we actually looked for the right things hopefully that will change second thing that I've learned as well is is how important distribution of coins and and just in general how these layer ones are actually distributed you know people would say even if Solana is like relatively decentralized actually ultimately doesn't matter as much if so much ownership is concentrated in someone's pocket that then ends up being a bad actor we just see how much that will and just bad attention and just in general the the fact that something like this can have on the project itself just because one person had a lot of discipline was publicly associated with it so those two things I would just point out to people that I think were kind of I I learned that they're more important than I initially thought based on some of these action that happened last month yeah oh my gosh I completely agree with you on that first point like in the days leading up to the collapse when people couldn't find any wallets that looked like cold storage for FTX like that just effing blew my mind I was like how did nobody ever notice that before like that is like with the whole point of having an exchange is is that you're supposed to store these things for people and protect them from being hacked and the notion that they didn't even have anything like that was just like what like you know how did this never get noticed before I kind of couldn't believe it I was just yeah my jaw was on the floor um all right let's talk about stable coins which you know most people probably thought that this was sort of a sleepy part of the industry and then lo and behold when the macro environment completely changes suddenly competition heats up and this year we saw this battle in stable coins Finance leveraged busd to try to take market share from circles usdc or or at least you know who knows what they were actually trying to do it just sort of seemed that way um a huge collapse of the world of algorithmic stable Coins Plus you know just the general fact that they've never really worked and tether somehow taking more criticism and yet surviving what do you guys think will happen in the world of stable coins in 2023 look it's it's an insanely good business model in an environment like this like you look at like crypto companies and the outlook for the next year you know Circle and tether and as well as paxils they're insanely good position when it comes to their business Health uh currently and how they will perform in 2023 because as long as the interest rate keep relatively high and as long as they don't pay out any of that interest rate to users they're they're literally printing cash and we're talking about like large magnitudes I don't think people realize like we're talking about like 100 billion total Supply you multiplied it by like roughly five percent what you can get on on that it's it's a lot of money uh and those companies will continue growing and continue doing well and exactly like you said there will be battle for for those for those interest rates for their revenue uh because it's actually a lot and I think binance understood that relatively early on um and obviously they're working with paxos and my understanding is that they have a 50 50 split when it comes to revenue so you know it actually this year it might be a decent chunk of the total revenue that they make even compared to trading fees and lending fees and all that uh because it's just the environment that's really favorable to stable coins and I think just like the last bear Market in 2018 2019 they've continued doing well like of course there are some redemptions but actually people continue using them their use for investment and start used for trading they're used for some Commerce already as well and they definitely have one of the largest product Market fit in an environment where there's not as much speculation as before so I think this is going to be actually like unirradically this is going to be one of the more exciting things to look out for in 2023 because it's just it's just these companies will go at it uh and you'll see Circle talk smack about paxos you'll see I'm talking smack about tether they'll just be going at it and I think that that could get interesting uh 2023. yeah as an instrument to you know attain stability right I think the reserve-backed stable coins have certainly achieved a product Market fit I think uh the collapse of of algorithmic stable coins like Luna I think really shed light on the dangers of some of these structures uh we also saw a lot of You Know Drama for a back lack of a better word within maker uh with the assets that support Dai as a stable coin I think you know a lot of those concerns have been remedied at this point but the reserve-backed stable coins I think are are here to stay and have certainly attained substantial liquidity uh you know we did one of our most popular state of the network newsletters this year was in analysis of usdc and usdt it's very clear if you look at when these assets are used the time zones where the when these assets are used the most tether has achieved a pretty strong product Market fit in APAC so a lot of very large liquidity providers in the Asia Pacific Zone using tether as the instrument to attain portability between exchanges access services and D5 holds USD equivalents that A Team level of disability whereas usdc has achieved the same exact thing in the west so if you look at Europe and U.S usdc is the stable coin that's most predominantly used in specifically in U.S business hours so the momentum with these stable coins is really difficult to break because they are a core component of how a lot of these funds operate I also think while this is true and they've certainly achieved product Market fit uh there's definitely a large liquidity providers that are surviving through this bear Market that leverage these products I think there will also be scrutinized by Regulators that are now taking a closer look into crypto assets specifically now from this risk perspective because stable coins even the reserve-backed stable coins they're not risk-free right and when I'm talking about risk it's really the potential for them to be exploited and that leading to chaos and destruction which is a big part of my job at coinmetrics is is you know thinking about these attack vectors for a lot of these stable points one key can mince any arbitrarily large units of these stable coins one admin key enables YouTube actually one trillion usdc which for Defy is a gigantic problem right because if I can print a trillion dollars worth of usdc I can just trade any Market that has a pair with ustc and deplete all the liquidity in those markets because their automated market makers amms right they're they're structurally uh conceived to make markets regardless of of who I am so I do think there's going to be some scrutiny on the governance of stable coins uh that will likely come in the form of Regulation I don't think it will kill these stable coins I think these are problems like the presence of admin keys and nearly all reserve-backed stable coins um that are somewhat irresponsibly implemented I think will be scrutinized but not an impossible issue to to solve I just think it's going to become top of mind because now you have this massive focus on security and really investor protection uh which you know stable points play a gigantic role in all right let's quickly talk about defy what's interesting to me is you know it definitely had certain wins which were you know how during the great financial crisis of crypto in 2022 a lot of D5 functioned very well but trading is down and total value locked is down although you know it's obviously because the value of the coins themselves have gone down the thing is the sector is also seen obviously a ton of hacks so I wondered what you thought would happen in D5 in 2023 I think exactly like Lucas mentioned previously I think we need to focus more on the user experience and on just abstracting away as much of the blockchain as possible like like ideally you get to a point where you have to you know the FTX level of experience in terms of trading I don't mean in terms of anything else or you know binance is a better example uh but just something that works as well uh that actually uses blockchains and and allows people you know let's say in China or people where maybe there's more restrictive activity to actually use these tools properly you know I think the uidx probably gets the closest but it's still not quite there yet uh it's not there yet for multiple reasons and a lot of them go back to to scalability but regardless I mean they're still a long way to go there um and I think with the collapse of FTX with some deep cyclic liquidity concerns that you now have with exchanges like their concerns there Genesis goes down what impact they'll have on on Gemini and you know those sort of concerns I I feel like we've seen every single exchange uh being illiquated on Twitter over the last three weeks uh those consensus can actually be addressed properly in D5 but I think the the main roadblock is still the usability of these protocols and and I think hopefully that will be the focus of 2023 is is to try to make something that people actually want to use not just actually Farm to to make money out of but something that I actually want to use just like I wanted to use Finance or I want to use other uh products in the market yeah I completely agree I think product Market fit is is definitely uh going to be the biggest topic for D5 I do think there are things that excite folks that go beyond you know the use cases that people are usually interested in uh in terms of of trading you know unisop is an amazing product uh but the amm model might not be the best for users right the fact that you don't know exactly what price you're going to get uh the fact that your transaction will likely get uh sandwiched through Mev I think there's a lot there that that can be improved but there are also things in defy that you can't really do anywhere else right the notion of a flash loan which is a loan that you don't need to post collateral to attain pretty massive amounts of liquidity as long as you're sending it back to the lender in the same transaction is not something that you could do in finance you could potentially do in finance but it would be a contract thousands and thousands of pages long so that all the edge can conditions are are addressed so there are some very unique use cases that I think will be tested I think you have to have a strong kind of foundation of services that you're providing things like flash loans for market efficiency uh better you know lending protocols that manage risk more actively and you also have to have you know products that are built on top of those foundations that potentially abstract away even the notion of that there there's a blockchain in the background there's going to be some trade-offs in terms of centralization of course but I do think there's going to be this path where we need to focus more on what is unique about this technology that you really cannot do and it's not just oh I'm gonna buy and hold this token because it's going to go 20x you can't really blame people from doing this because historically you know that's what's happened people want to be better off financially so they're naturally gravitating towards these use cases I think D5 projects they need to really distill what is unique that they're doing provide focus more even on the front end side of things once you've determined you know from a foundational perspective what services you're providing and try to replicate in a non-custodial fashion the level of experience that you sell with things like FDX and even binance when it comes to trading and lending I think that will be critical to to the success of D5 and I think there's even from an from an investment perspective VCS I think are now better aware of this Dynamic given what happened to to FTX and some trauma of that you know happening again I think those Solutions will also see the funding all right let's definitely discuss nfts trading in them is way down in April trading and ethereum nfts was at over a billion dollars now the trading volume is at around 200 million dollars so where do you expect nft interest in trading to go the question I think uh we've already seen some like slightly higher activity towards the end of 2022 again I think nfts have actually shown to be relatively resilient when it comes to kind of keep coming back when you know there have been almost like multiple mini cycles for nfts that I've seen over the last two years where the activity goes Super High people are speculating and then all of a sudden goes down again and it recovers again and I think the reason for that is that it's just a very easy concept for non-crypto people to grasp which is like let's collect things that have that have Rarity to have value like I'll provide an anecdotal example like I do these lectures two or three times a year for University classes and and I do them just basically intro class to crypto as a whole and the part that people always care about the most and these are like 21 22 year olds it's always done FTS like they just ask so many questions like how can this be so valuable why like why should I be holding these things why Apes why not punks and and I think it's because it's just a really relatable topic to to younger people and and because of that I think this will continue coming back up in terms of Interest I don't know about the prices and I don't know about specific nfts but I think there's also really large product Market fit that maybe hasn't been as realized as as it could be like there's no reason why some of the trading cards should not live on a blockchain why a lot of why people shouldn't be trading these things online instead of actually in person uh so I think I think they'll continue being a ton of development there I don't know if this will happen in 2023 but it is something where I've personally see enough evidence that this is a really really sticky concept I will continue coming back and it will be more more and more used in in some games and in some things overall even though there is also this hate like almost irrational Hate by some normal people there's also an insane amount of Interest and one follow-on question do you also think that the Creator royalties will continue to be kind of um jettisoned by marketplaces or do you think because obviously we've also seen certain ones sort of embrace them so what do you think will happen on that score yeah I I personally think it's something that's very difficult to enforce on a smart contract level and I think in the in the nature of just in general how crypto is conducted and how blockchains work I think long-term royalties will not exist just by the notion of it's really difficult to make them mandatory uh even though openc has a you know 80 90 of market share and they can kind of like decide what will happen there uh they need to compete with other marketplaces and like you mentioned some have followed but some actually haven't uh and I think the most pragmatic view that I have on this is that long term this is not going to be a way to monetize nft so that's it's going to have to be in a different way purely because of the technical complexity of implementing something like this and for example the openc solution that we've seen I I think personally I think it's a joke I I think it leads to like there's no point in nfts if if this is how we will go about enforcing royalties in my opinion because it leads to effectively kind of like unfair competition and it's almost like a really large play of bullying all the other ones and I don't think that's going to be long term sustainable so yeah in my opinion would be it's just not going to work yeah and just for listeners what he's talking about is that their solution is that if you're a Creator and you say that you want to enforce royalties then your nfts will be blocked from being sold on the marketplaces that don't exactly um yeah have royalties so Lucas what do you think will happen to nft trading and also nft royalties yeah I think the royalties model is something that's really interesting because uh it it it is enhancing the utility of nftus to an extent that uh in my opinion make them a lot more exciting I think right now if you think about their utility it is really as a as a mechanism to demonstrate wealth in a lot of in a lot of ways which I think is what uh in a lot of circumstances drives people into them like how can this you know nft be worth so much money and I think for a lot of folks it's a more tangible uh thing right oh I own this this is this is mine so they're they're naturally gravitating towards it um I I do think with the nft uh uh sector if you will of of this industry the marketplaces have taken a much more substantial role in you know making markets for nfts uh determining really how these nfts will be issued uh in a lot of ways imposing upon like creators uh on as we just were talking about how these nfts should operate I think there are a lot of technical issues that are circumvented by a centralized Marketplace but in some ways uh not in a positive way I think marketplaces are going to be deeply scrutinized in in 2023 I think for two reasons I think the first reason is there's an argument that they do hurt the utility uh capab cap capabilities of uh what creators can can do and the policies that creators can Implement on who owns their nfts and what that represents I think what excites me the most in terms of of use cases goes beyond just oh I I hold this I own this it's really what can you do with it if it's a song for example I'm particularly excited about music nfds can you create a system whereby you're receiving payouts from the song being used in a commercial fashion via a commercial or a movie things like this I think can be incredibly empowering to artists but marketplaces because they're trying to do so many things at the same time uh I think they're unable to focus and explore the other thing that I think will drive a lot of scrutiny to these marketplaces is that you know in 2021 we saw a pretty severe Market manipulation taking place in a lot of these nft marketplaces there was a paper that has just come out in December of 2022 that focused on Market manipulation specifically wash trading in nft marketplaces and watch trading is when a buyer and a seller are the same entity or controlled by the same entity and they're just making markets to simulate volume and potentially increase the prices of a specific asset and this paper I think is is really interesting because they found that 3.4 billion dollars was used last year to pump nft markets via wash trades that happens predominantly on uh looks rare another looks rare Marketplace and attackers were highly sophisticated not only in terms of manipulating specific nft markets but also manipulating the token disbursement mechanism that these markets use to reward their participants so looks rare for example they have their own looks token and it is issued on the basis of the volume that we're making the platform so not only were these attackers manipulating these markets to increase the prices of nfts that they had no interest in holding the long term but they're also uh getting a disproportionate amount of uh the token in that platform for making so much Market and this analysis shows that there's some pretty large entities involved in doing this so I do think uh as we continue to uncover um instances of of potential uh unhealthy Behavior in these marketplaces I think they're going to be scrutinized more aggressively by Regulators they're both good and bad things about this I think the good thing about this is that it will really focus on um adding more utility to nfts Via more technical methods um I think there are services that might emerge as a result of this then my focus on specific parts of issuing nfts music for example I think uh it is at this point underexplored but I think it will hurt some user experience right because nfts have served this role as the stepping stone for a lot of new users into this industry the marketplaces they play a massive role when it comes to uh usability and and interfacing with with crypto so it's kind of tough to make predictions but it is something that I see being scrutinized in 2023 all right so last question that I want to ask is FTX Finance is now incredibly dominant and amongst crypto only exchanges accounts for nearly 90 of trading yet it's also reportedly the target of an investigation by the Department of Justice so what do you guys think it means for the industry to have this one player in particular binance which you know as I mentioned likely has some regulatory baggage to be so dominant and how do you think that could affect the industry in 2023 um yeah I mean it's not ideal like we saw with FTX you know FTX was probably 10 times smaller in terms of the size and it really really affected the industry in a bad way like and the Ripple effects have still maybe that some of them have still not be been seen yet and it's it's been like month and a half or something so I mean to answer your question very bluntly and pragmatically it would be insanely bad if anything happened to binance in my opinion it's where most liquidity is for most spot pairs for most Futures pairs as well and it's it's it's just you know yeah I I don't I don't think it's even comparable to anything in traditional Finance it just has like near perfect Monopoly currently and if something were to happen to it including some some regulatory issues or including anything else it would have a really bad impact on the overall market and and on top of that just like the faith in the industry alone like I think F takes a lot alone in itself will have impact on regulation for years to come and and also on the faith of new entrants that maybe just started using FTX didn't weren't familiar with any of these risks and ended up losing all their life savings you know if if you if you if that happened to binance and you have 10 10 times more capital on the platform and it's 10 times more important for for volume for overall trading it would be a complete disaster in my opinion like I think it it would be actually significantly worse than among Cox back in the day if something were to happen to binance uh that being said on to be slightly more optimistic I think of course planets will have regulatory issues in the US right like just like bitmax did of of course initially in the first two years they had very relaxed kyc everyone knows that like they had almost if you wanted to use it without kyc you could you could just split your account between multiple and do the daily withdrawals it was very simple they've ramped it ramped it up really a lot over the last two years like I just saw last few days how they're still kind of harping on people to update their kyc there there's a lot of kyc now on binance and they're quite diligent they have large compliance tips as well but there is a lot of baggage from the early days just like there was a lot of baggage with bitmax and now the question is like what could actually happen like is it just going to be kind of a slap on the wrist fine that's easy can pay off you know 0.5 percent of his net worth or is actually going to be something slightly more significant I personally think the risk of you know binance being affected so badly by by regulations that it dies completely is quite low myself but on the other hand there could be an effect and it scares you know me a lot that something could happen the binance and it would affect the entire industry for you know years and years and years and I don't I don't know if that would be recoverable probably would be but it would it would be a really really bad shock and a lot of the questions we get from our customers these days is exactly like what will happen to binders like people are actually really freaked out they're freaked out about stable coins buying it freaked about tether everyone's freaked out about everything but binance would be by far the worst in my opinion I completely agree it's terrifying the extent to which you know binance is now predominant in terms of liquidity in in this ecosystem uh I I think you know two a very concerning degree not only because you know there might be regulatory scrutiny that gets potentially overreaching and impacts their ability to continue to provision liquidity or something more concerning you know total regulatory scrutiny right and and really a massive decrease in illiquidity in the market so it is terrifying I think it is something that uh will hopefully be um addressed with more competition both on the decentralized side with better products that are built on on decentralized platforms as well as better competition but potentially by entities that were responsible you know the coin basis of the world which you know probably there are two or three of those at this point it is to me a good thing for binance right now to see what lessons could be learned from the FTX collapse I think especially related to BNB to me that's one of the areas that is the most unclear I think we have a good sense of their reserves even though their proof of reserves was lackluster in a lot of ways could be completely manipulated if they wanted to their custody scheme is not super sophisticated or it's very simplistic so we can see that they have a lot of reserves in the tokens that they support in their platform and have liquidity for my concern at this point is mostly around the transparency around BNB BNB exists in three different blockchains uh uh at least right in a native format it exists in ethereum as a near C20 token it was how they initially raised funds it exists in the binus smart chain which is the ethereum fork it exists in the BNB chain which is a cosmos SDK implementation there isn't a ton of transparency around historical supply for BNB and at the same time there are some very concerning transactions where they likely minted quite a lot of BNB to sell to you know private entities like any other token the base other users I think the time or the the circumstances surrounding bonus at this point will not be aligned with this type of activity I do think they will have to bring a lot more transparency given their role as a central liquidity provider to the industry not only on the reserves but also their BNB Holdings uh the distribution of BNB across all of these blockchains and potentially being a lot more frankly care careful when it comes to new products that they that they launch because now they are being further scrutinized I would say that bias in 2017 is very different than binance today from everything I can see both on chain and off chain it's completely different it's a much more mature exchange and I think CZ has done a really good job maturing it it is at the same time terrifying because there are these ghosts from the past that my haunt them either because they might have not abided by all the regulations at that point in terms of a Milky wayc but also so because they were operating on a much more experimental you know Carefree way especially with the issuance and and dynamics of the BNB token will likely learn a lot more about bonuses operation either because of this investigation or because of voluntary disclosures hopefully the latter but um it is something that I think will will get scrutinized in 2023 as well because of their role now as the predominant liquidity provider in the industry all right so we're gonna wrap with one sentence for addiction from each of you for 2023 one sentence zika robs will finally launch and actually be usable by normal people I like that I think that's pretty good um mine will probably be on chain analysis is here to stay and we're just scratching the surface of what is possible when it comes to diligence love it all right where can people learn more about each of you and your work for me uh you can find me on Twitter at lawmaster
