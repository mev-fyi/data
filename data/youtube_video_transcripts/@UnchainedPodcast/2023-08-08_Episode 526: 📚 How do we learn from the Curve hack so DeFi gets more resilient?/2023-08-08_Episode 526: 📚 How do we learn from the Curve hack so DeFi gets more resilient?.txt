whenever we see an error like this if it's old hat like if it's a repeat of something then everyone just gets like strips torn off of them if it's novel then people within like 48 hours will confidently assert that anyone could have seen it and only like the malicious or the novice would have overlooked it we saw it even happening at the Dow we've we've started seeing it now with the Viper um incident and I think I one thing I'd like to bang on about like is kind of some what some group of us need to kind of like put the book together of the web to not you know like A Hitchhiker's Guide to not getting wrecked at some level and I don't think it's ever going to exist so the the the nature of security much like the nature of finances it's always this cat and mouse game yeah whatever Edge you have is it's hard to make public so anything that gets written is always a bit post-hoc it like never is kind of can be written
