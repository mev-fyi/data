is kevin zoe co-founder of galwa capital welcome kevin hey laura how's it going thanks for having me on this was a pretty dramatic week in stable coins on monday a stable coin called neutrino dollar or usdn lost its peg falling to a low of 68 cents why don't you begin by telling the listeners what usdn is and how it works yeah so usdn is neutrino dollar it's basically a stable coin that's pegged to the us dollar and it's an integral part of the waves ecosystem the way it works is that the creation and the minting or redeeming of usdn is done through burning so if you want to create usda you burn waves you know you burn an equivalent dollar amount of waves to get an equivalent dollar amount of usdn and the reverse is true when you want to redeem usdn then you redeem it for waves so for every x amount of usdn that you burn you get x dollars amount of waves back this is what we would call an algorithmic stable coin and algorithmic stable coins have historically had trouble so in this case how and why did usdn d-peg yes it was for a number of reasons but the main reason is that uh people found that on chain there was a really large address that was doing uh what we call recycling right or leveraging and the way that that works is that and and many people think that this is the waves team themselves uh that was doing this and the way that works is you know you first you start with usdn you put it into a virus and vires is basically like the ave of uh of waves so it's a bar lending platform you can deposit uh you know usdn over there get some yield um you can borrow other types of assets like usdc tether vera's itself waves a lot of different assets so the way that this loop works is that usdn is first put into vera's as deposit and then from that they're able to borrow hard assets like usdc and usdt they use that then to buy waves and then use the waves to convert it to usdn through the mechanism that we talked about right before and then redeposit that usdn back into vera's completing the cycle and continuously do this until basically all the deposits for usdc or usdt are depleted because then the cycle can't continue anymore so basically there was a lot of this recycling going on and that's what's been causing uh this huge pump in the price of waves and then afterwards uh at some point you know there are a lot of people on twitter for example like xerox hams for example um a lot of people pointed this out uh which is that you know this whole thing is unsustainable because at some point the whole thing has to come come back down once uh this cycle stops because of the running out of uh of the deposits of usdc and usdt and also on top of that you know there's more of the story because you know sasha comes out you know who's the the founder of waves and he starts uh you know putting together this conspiracy theory that it's actually like alameda that's causing a lot of like problems for the for the waves ecosystem and uh saying that oh you know these guys are really short you know and he put out a proposal uh for a governance vote which was basically you know without getting into like all the for them to get nitty-gritty because he wanted to liquidate the shorts uh unfortunately this kind of backfired because alameda responded and saying uh we're not actually just naked short on on on waves uh or usdn really they have this like hedgeplay that's going on where they're taking out a borrow uh you know of uh waves and and to short it but at the same time they're long the perks and the reason that they're doing that is that there's some basis to collect in between in other words like the funding rate i was very favorable in this kind of hedge trade right so they're not actually having any net kind of exposure on waves they're they're really just doing this kind of hedge play and then on top of that then the community um also had a backlash against uh sasha saying that you know we can't just willy-nilly you know liquidate shorts just because they're short right i mean it's just a you know it's a fair short i mean they want to express that bet whether it's um you know an actual short or whether it's a hedged vet you know regardless uh that's that's their that's the right to do that and we shouldn't just change up the protocol rules just so that we can squeeze the price higher so i think overall ended up backfiring on them and then from sort of the revelations of this recycling which is unhealthy generally considered unhealthy and generally considered you know these these kinds of prices uh that were waves pumped to was considered generally inorganic then basically all this stuff have to have to go it gets to get sold down and then on top of that there's some unwinding effects where you know as as waves starts collapsing in price you know you know trust in the system uh you know starts to get depleted um there's a lot of circular effects just overall trust you know trust kind of erodes and a lot of other people start selling too so that kind of compresses the price you know so that's how it it got d-pegged yeah so that's um the reason that waves ran up and then crashed and then the depending itself is that you know at some point if if you're looking for an exit from this sort of like spiraling or failing system uh there's two ways to do it if you have usda right one is to convert it to waves and sell the waves and the other is just to sell the usdn so depending on whether the mechanism is gated or not and you know we can talk about like uh luna and terra later but depending on whether it's gated or not if there are very strict restrictions on just how much usdn you can get out into waves then the usdn itself depicts as long so that's sort of like the the end state the end state is where there's not enough liquidity in waves itself or the convertibility between usdn and waves uh gets um short-circuited somehow and then the coin itself the stablecoin itself depends otherwise uh people would just convert it uh convert the stablecoin to waves and then get out through that angle so essentially though like people wanted to sell out of usdn and they couldn't and so then they were willing to sell it at lower and lower prices is that basically what caused the dpec yeah exactly it's it's basically there's there's two outflows for capital uh in that kind of system either through waves or through usdn right so the dpeg happens because there was not enough bandwidth uh to go through uh to go through waves okay yeah i mean such a fascinating story yeah i was looking at the comments on the proposal so by the way the wave ceo sasha ivanov and alameda research is um the market maker associated with ftx founded by the ceo of fdx sam bakeman freed and um i saw that the comments on the virus proposal was like this would basically mean because it's supposed to be borrowing and lending protocol and people were like okay if this goes through nobody's going to use this so um so i mean it was it was fascinating but in general you know we've as i mentioned earlier we've seen so many of these algorithmic stable coins d-peg so why is that so common yeah so i think i think the idea is that you know in in crypto there's a lot of different ways to make money and i think what people have found is that running sort of like griffs or scams generally is is a good way at least in the short term for these founders and these um very short-term oriented investors uh to make money and uh at least historically even though um almost every single algorithmic stable coin which was not backed by collateral has so far failed you know maybe with the exception of luna so far you know it's still like uh in the process of doing that because of these like giant pump and dump cycles a lot of the founders and the investors are able to make a lot of money so even though there's a lot of failure and even though everybody kind of understands the risk with sort of like the advent of new capital coming into the space and a lot of new people coming into the space you know i think there's always like you know a greater fool to sell this kind of product to a repackaged version of this product tool and as long as i think these founders and these investors continue to make money i think that'll continue to happen so i think it's it has to do with you know building a mechanism which is basically an obfuscation of basically trying to mint money out of thin air right through like the very very complicated contraption or mechanism or some kind of rube goldberg machine at the end of the day is you can't really generate value from nothing right and i think that's one of the reasons why you know ultimately these things fail now each one has a different mechanism right so if you look at like for example basis in the past you know ample four esd dsd ohm to some extent and time and now like lunatera and waves you know all of these have slightly different mechanisms but i think in my opinion they all reduce down to kind of it's the same thing which is that you're trying to get this weird flywheel going uh while uh basically minting money on a dinner so you basic it sounds like you feel that ust then runs the same risks that eventually it will depend like the way you're talking it sounds like you feel like all of these algorithmic stable coins will fail and just none of them will ever succeed yeah i think at least all of these types of designs right so like this senior ridge based kind of like supply contraction supply expansion type of designs that don't have any external backing underneath it or any kind of external collateral i think pretty much those will all fail that could be wrong i mean maybe somebody comes up with some genius design and some kind of like skyhook thing that actually works but for the most part it's all basically uh variations of the same theme right so because of that yeah but then so ust since it now is going to be partially backed by bitcoin are you saying that then you don't think that ust is likely to fall into the same trap uh yeah i think that the risks are still there i actually think the risks are much bigger than waves just because of the size of it um you know there's like 16.6 billion uh ust in circulation i think 12.2 or 4 billion is now stuck in anchor so i think it's it's a much bigger problem but i will say that i think the backing of um you know having some kind of bitcoin a hard collateral or even just like other types of stable coins or even like avalanches they just did uh basically any kind of backing which is not circular uh i think would be helpful so i think they're going in the right direction i just i just disagree about the size i don't think the three billion amount of bitcoin is enough of a cushion on this kind of unwind on anchor and anchor is basically the barn lending protocols the ave of of the terror chain yeah yeah and the yield on that right now is about 20 uh so okay so in a moment we're going to talk about a potential plan to try to make these kinds of stable coins stronger but first a quick word from the

been happening with these other stable coins and this week we did see a proposal from someone on the terraform labs team someone named ezan who proposed something called 4-pole what is 4-pole and also since it uses curve why don't you explain what curve is as well uh yeah so curve is basically an amm and it was originally used for stable swaps and what stable swaps are uh is uh you know it's a way to basically um transform one stable coin to another with a fairly low slippage so generally you know i think it depends on sort of like the context that your viewers have but you know assuming um some understanding of uniswap it's basically like unison but there's a lot of flatness on the bonding curve uh where it's you know kind of close to balance when the pool is kind of close to balance hence allowing for really large sizes of stable coins to be swapped against each other at very minimal slippage and minimum fees so that's sort of what what what the curve model is and you know the idea behind four pool i think before that we should we should talk about what three pool is because it's sort of like the the game plan there is that they want to try and replace three pool right so uh three pool is a curve pool with the assets of usdt usdc uh and dye right and uh it's one of the most liquid pools on curve and it generally not only is it itself very liquid but it also functions as a counter asset to some of these other stable points so for example right now if you wanted to trade ust on curve you could go to the ust three pool pool so that's basically a meta pool it's a pool that consists of on one side an asset ust and on the other side this three pool which is itself a pool right so that's what makes it medical so because of three pools use first as a pool itself and second as one of the pairs in a metapool you know it has a lot of use and has a lot of liquidity and the idea behind four pool and this is a proposal and basically a partnership between you know between the terra luna guys and frax and usdc and ust as well as redacted cartel and the idea behind this is that they want to have these four assets right so that the two kind of centralized stable coins that are big usd same usd frax a new algo stable coin and then uh ust luna's stable coin and they want to overtake three cool they want to make this sort of the de facto you know pool uh where you know everybody goes to everybody uses as a pair in their own metapool for any new kind of stable coins that come out and the plan on doing that uh and i think it has some merit uh which is that they're gonna point well i guess we should talk a little bit about how convex works so both of these groups fracks and tara luna have a lot of of convex right cvx right and what that allows them to do is it allows them and we're shortcutting a little bit but basically allows them to point a lot of the rewards of curve right so for using curve or staking to curve a curve itself gives out crv tokens right as an incentive to provide liquidity but in order to decide which pool gets how much there is basically a gauge uh which is voted on based on you know the state's crv or the ve crv vote escort crv that people hold so convicts is basically a layer on top of that you know i mean long story short basically governs this kind of voting scheme and can basically increase the yields of certain pools to the detriment of other pools so in that they hold a lot of convex uh you know both the frax guys and the luna guys they have a lot of voting power on making their you know their four pool when it comes out um have making it have a very high yield they think that by having that they'll be able to attract a lot of capital from other curve pools to stake uh into their pool hence drawing liquidity away from three pool and introducing it to four pool and in that way um you know this is basically what's called the curve wars in that way uh you know promote the success of you know increasing liquidity for their individual tokens yeah they they say um that this follows the ethos of stable coin pegs are stronger together than competing against each other but you've been very vocal against four pool and also usd as we've sort of hinted at um previously in the discussion why is that yeah so i think i should just qualify that and say i have been very vocal against luna and ust uh but not actually against four pool i think that is actually a good idea and i think certainly the buying of bitcoin collateral uh even though it's it's too meager right now three billion i don't think is enough i think it's a step in the right direction so i i'm actually fully in support of those two proposals i think they're trying to uh you know i don't know if i could say that they're basically trying to cover their asses uh because things have gotten a little bit too big right now so i think it's a step in the right direction but i still don't think that the entire system is solvent i think that right now on anchor which is the ave of the terror ecosystem there's a reserve and they're there that's basically bleeding out you know millions or tens of millions uh per day and it's like uh it's basically uh subsidizing depositors to anchor right so if you deposit ust to anchor you're getting a 19.5 yield which is a very high yield given that you know currently there's not many quote unquote safe ways to to farm uh reasonable like double digit yields you know it's basically a subsidy given out to people who bring capital uh you know and basically lock up ust and in the hopes that you know they think that with this marketing spend they're able to get they're actually able to get people to actually use ust and it's just a way to kind of like bring the customer in first you know which i which i don't particularly have a problem with it's just that you are they are bleeding a lot of money and then at some point that yield has to come down right like the borrow rate is like you know 13 something like that uh the lending rate is is 19 and a half percent so you know there's literally free money there right like you could you could just you could bond you bond luna this is another there's another problem which is the bonded loan you can bond luna you you you basically pay 13 and you can reinvest the ust that you get from bonding the luna and staking it to anchor uh and you can reinvest it into the deposit to just get that extra juice right so you know anytime the deposit yield is higher than the borrowing yield is generally unsustainable so that has to come down at some point i think they're going to gradually do it probably the correct choice to gradually do it but it's just it just won't be enough i think somewhere between the i think the the equilibrium yield will be i think they did since they they did some analysis on this it's going to be somewhere between like 7 and 12 on the deposit yield and the question now is basically how much of that ust that's currently locked up and at 19.5 percent is going to leave that ecosystem once it drops to 7 to 12 right so what i think is that generously and i think it could be my actual advocacy is way worse is you know much worse than this but i think generously nine billion uh luna has to leave the ecosystem right so if nine billion leaves and you know what are the avenues for it to leave well you know people can you know dump some of it on curve i mean but how much can you really do there maybe half a yard you know 500 mil maybe some of it you know is just not dumped right maybe people find some other uses of it because their marketing campaign works right so you know there might be like a bill over there but you know overall it's just like a lot of these avenues for exiting out of ust um there's just not much liquidity there right so you're still stuck with multiple billions that need to that need to exit and they can either exit through the bitcoin that they bought this three billion or they can exit through luna that three bill is covered by by bitcoin at 98 cents to the dollar uh you're still left with a lot of you know ust still multiple billions maybe four maybe you know five billion of ust left to unwind generally you know whenever you know and i think we should we should take a step back and talk about this generally when you buy an asset for every dollar that you use to buy it the market cap goes up by some multiple right it's not it's not one for one basically right if you buy an apple um stock if you put like hundred dollars in apple apple's market cap jumps by more than a hundred dollars right so what is what exactly is this multiplier value well they've done you know historical analysis on on stocks and it's uh basically three to three to eight x depending on uh the elasticity for for crypto i think it tends to be on the higher side uh and maybe even higher than that and then for something as reflexive as the design of this algostable coin i think it might be even beyond that right but even on the conservative side let's say maybe like an 8x right so 5 billion leaving ust through luna would probably compress the lunar market price by 8 times 5 billion which is maybe like 40 billion so like i i see that there could be in my opinion you know when when all of this thing all of this stuff unwinds you know i see that there could be some very serious compression on the lunar price now that depends also on the gating mechanism for how much ust can be minted or burned per day for luna if there can be uh if if they release all the gates um then basically it's luna itself that takes on the brunt of all the selling pressure you know market cap tanks you could see huge drawdowns on the price there now if they gate it and they say okay only 100 million ust can exit through luna per day well then if more wants exit per day then you start to see ust um depending so you know it's really kind of like a pick your poison if you get it then it depends if you don't get it then the price tanks right and in the most extreme cases where the solvency of the system itself has come to you know comes to question there might not be enough luna market cap to be solvent for the entire amount of the ust ust to exit right because in the absolute worst case right let's say that all of the borrowers are all of the deposits and borrows they're recycled right so all this 3.3 billion ust uh that's borrowed is then re-injected as deposits to basically claim this arg on the yield then basically the amount that unwinds is a 9 billion ust it's like you know 12.2 billion ust plus 4.8 billion of b luna which is bonded right because you need to bond b luna in order to do the borrows in the first place on this 3.3 billion uh of ust borrow so if the unwind is much greater than nine billion and you know we're talking about uh maybe like 16 17 maybe 17 billion and let's say the multiplier factor on selling against market cap is you know let's say 10 or 20 or something like that then the entire system is insolvent we're not just talking about a crash in the lunar price it's basically luna goes to you know 0.001 penny one cent you know or 0.001 and then it goes through hyperinflation to try and create enough luna for a full dollar for every dollar that exits and on top of that ust uh dpegs so in the worst case all of that stuff goes to zero altogether right so in the best case we're talking about a massive drop in the lunar price in the worst case we're talking about the entire unwinding of the entire system and the contagion effects from that right and namely being that when retail gets burned first of all they go complain of regulators uh and then second of all you know the traditional media is as kind as uh business kind of you laura you know they're gonna they're gonna take this narrative and they're gonna run with it and they already hate crypto so they're just gonna they're just gonna slam us they're gonna say oh look at crypto it's just filled with scams this this and that could have a very big chilling effect on the market for a very long time and and i for one am not that interested in you know just bearing with like another two three year super cold you know crypto winter so you know i think for the most part we need to defuse this bond you know as quickly as possible if this thing is uh fated for failure then we might as well unravel it now and we should spread the word to unravel it now before it becomes too late now obviously the counter argument is that in fact it is not fated to failure um that if they can get enough usage or utility out of ust then that itself that circulating effect of the actual stable coin for its use case will uh basically cause like a supply sync in ust and hence it won't unravel i generally don't buy that argument i think there's no real use for ust right now in size except for farming on anchor right so like you can you can literally talk to anybody everybody that i know everybody that i've talked to many of the firms that are in the space uh many of them swinging very big size you know there are a lot of them are farming anchor and you know they don't even use it for anything else so i mean maybe like here and there for an ico that's on the tara blockchain or whatever but i mean we're talking like orders of magnitude less right like here in anchor we're talking about high single digit billions or to low double digit billions you know elsewhere we're talking about like at most like you know double digit millions maybe triple digit millions at best right so you know we're talking about orders magnitude difference so you know i understand the play that they're making they're they're basically buying time they're bleeding money they're paying marketing costs you know they're buying time to try and get actual use from this thing um but uh i just there's not enough time and i think i don't think it'll work i wanted to ask so i you know obviously they're not going to cut the yield on anchor like in all in one go down to 12 so don't you feel that there would be kind of like a gradual way to do it where you wouldn't have like all these people trying to you know close out their positions and and tara and redeem for luna or whatever like is super fast and so if you sort of ratchet down slowly wouldn't that be a way of preventing the scenario that you outlined i agree with you i think if they if they um reduce the yield slowly it'll be better but overall the net effect is nearly the same because it's the it's about the amount that has to unravel over time to settle on finally an equilibrium point for what the yield should be on the deposit side such that the reserve doesn't believe so i i agree that it may be a little bit more gentler but still a lot of this money has to kind of leave because if you think about it they're sort of like marginal sellers along the way right like at 19.5 everybody who's in it is in it right at 19 like some marginal group leads right it might be small right but some marginal group leaves right and then 18 and a half then some marginal group leaves if you sum up all the marginal groups is that the same effect as immediately taking the deposit yield from 19 and a half to 12 right so on one hand i agree with you in the sense that it's not as bad i think the sum of the the parts is actually less than having an immediate drop i think the sum is actually less than uh than the whole um but i don't think it's that much less than the whole okay well this has been um incredibly interesting i guess we'll have to see kind of who ends up being right obviously there's kind of a lot of a lot vested on one particular side um so they're probably you know thinking a lot about these issues and maybe trying to take your criticism and improve um before anything bad happens well it seems like that already but anyway yeah it's much appreciated yeah yeah it's been great

recap ronin will be reimbursing users eight days after losing 600 million dollars to the largest exploit in defy history sky mavis announced plans to reimburse all affected ronin network bridge users sky mavis will be raising 150 million dollars in a funding round led by binance with participation from animoka brands a16z and others that 150 million dollars in cash along with balance sheet funds already owned by sky mavis will replace the 173 600 ether and 25.5 million usdc that was drained from the ronin bridge last week in a social engineering attack that saw four of sky mavis run validators and a third party validator run by axidao compromised the news comes just a few months after the wormhole bridge announced a similar reimbursement funding round from jump crypto following a 300 million dollar exploit in the aftermath ronin bridge will be upgrading its security which previously relied on only five out of nine validator confirmations for a transaction to go through according to a sky mavis blog post the new validator group will be upped to 21 validators in the next three months split amongst various stakeholders rather than just sky mavis ronin bridge which was shut down in the aftermath of last week's hack will go live after a round of upgrades and audits that could take weeks meanwhile binance will be supporting each withdrawals and deposits from ronin interestingly the 56 000 each drained from axidao will not be fully reimbursed by binance or sky mavis's balance sheet instead sky mavis explained the 56 000 each compromised from the accident treasury will remain under collateralized as sky mavis works with law enforcement to recover the funds if the funds are not fully recovered within two years the axidal will vote on next steps for the treasury in related news the ronin bridge hacker was active this week moving roughly seven million dollars through the coin mixer tornado cache stable coins are coming to bitcoin lightning labs a lightning network developer announced a new protocol this week dubbed tarot which aims to make bitcoin's layer 2 solution a multi-asset network as explained by lightning lab ceo elizabeth stark in a blog post in essence tarot's purpose is to bitcoinize the dollar stark wrote with tarot developers will be able to issue assets on the bitcoin blockchain and then move them onto lightning for speed and scalability making use of bitcoin liquidity to ensure interoperability between assets notably according to stark tarot will also allow assets like stablecoins to route through the bitcoin network via lightning interestingly tara was only recently made possible by bitcoin's taproot upgrade which made significant improvements to contracting security and efficiency for the chain fun fact the launch of tarot was on april 5th aka satoshi's birthday the same day that roosevelt ordered u.s citizens to return gold worth more than 100 for fiat in 1933. major raises was the theme of the week
