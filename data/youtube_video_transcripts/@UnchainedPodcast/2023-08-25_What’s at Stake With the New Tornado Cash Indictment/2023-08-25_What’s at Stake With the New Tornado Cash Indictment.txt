they should be making a distinction between software development right and alone and doing more than that and I think here in the indictment what we're seeing is an allegation that um the conspiracy to commit money laundering from September 2020 to August 2022 is the creation of the software that allowed various people all over the world to use it to anonymize private transactions and I think that we haven't seen this exact set of circumstances come up before and I think the question of whether facilitation is the right word also comes into play with the money transmitter allegations which we can also talk about but for the money laundering charge it's really my guess to give the government the benefit of the doubt I think what they're going to say is it's really more about the concealment of potential proceeds of a crime versus like the facilitation of that crime
