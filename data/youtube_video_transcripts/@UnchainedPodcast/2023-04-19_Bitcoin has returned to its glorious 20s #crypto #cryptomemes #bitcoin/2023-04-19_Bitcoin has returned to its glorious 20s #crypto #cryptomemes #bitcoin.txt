following a massive sell-off Bitcoin is back under 30 which means Hollywood could technically cast it to play a teenager after an increase in bitcoin's price last week people are calling this a correction which is a wonderfully subjective term babe I'm not breaking up with you I'm just correcting my life by ending this relationship but crypto Traders stayed optimistic because of course they did dips or gifts really tell that to my brother who said that the spinach and artichoke one was cheap for a wedding present I removed the price tag I do feel like describing this particular chart as beautiful is offensive to actual artists honestly the last week of Bitcoin prices looks like you asked a two-year-old to draw a straight line so why the drop well people are citing a sell order from binance they're also citing UK inflation numbers but personally I think it's the fact that 420 is right around the corner all those Bitcoin holders are selling off their Bitcoin to get cash to buy weed it's too bad you can't use cryptocurrencies for drugs oh wait
