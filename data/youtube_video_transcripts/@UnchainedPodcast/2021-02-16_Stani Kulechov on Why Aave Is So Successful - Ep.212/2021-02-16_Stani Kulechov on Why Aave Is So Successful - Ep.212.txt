happy to be you have an interesting background that pulls together several strands that touch on different knowledge areas relevant to crypto why don't you tell us how you got your start in this space yeah definitely uh not a usual background in um in in in our industry well everyone has quite a unique background here but i started probably four and a half years ago uh getting into the space uh practically in the product side and and and building uh protocols in decent us finance and uh actually i found ethereum when i was still studying law so so by education i'm a lawyer and during my last years of my studies i i wanted to understand better uh how we could make contracts like legal agreements uh more efficient and part of my research i i started i tried to research uh ai and and a bunch of other automatization but i stumbled upon ethereum and smart contracts and the idea of immutable contracts and code uh made a lot of sense to me in in form of execution that you don't you always have legal agreements kind of like that execute no matter what and before that actually funny i i was building before law school financial applications in fintech and which focuses more on user experience and somehow there's sort of regulation involved in in fintech so ended up kind of getting more excited like understanding more the illegal and jurisprudence side and that's how i ended up all the way here yeah and i think it's interesting because when i look at ave i feel like i can kind of see that background coming through you know um especially like right now at this time in crypto where a lot of um stuff that needs to be built in crypto actually does uh look more like fintech because you need to connect this new financial system to the traditional one but let's also talk about kind of this little interim period where you had started something a different project called eathland what was that how did that lead you to ave and then i'm very interested to hear you tell the story how you manage that transition from one project to another well it started mainly uh when i definitely started to practically understand more smart contracts and and how they work and uh because my always like i tried to solve kind of a idea that how you make legal agreements more efficient but i quickly realized that actually uh what smart concept can do they can actually provide more efficiency into finance and one of the things i i try to kind of like understand like how we could make a uh kind of own chain smart contract where there is a lending transaction where the actual borrower has an incentive to repay back the loan and normally it's it's not so obvious because the ethereum how it is uh it's practically so anonymous so addresses do not have any identities so it's very hard to do any kind of lending or loan transactions and what we kind of realize is that uh actually you could use various cryptographic assets as a collateral post a collateral as a borrower receive funds from the lender and then as there's more collateral in the in the uh protocol you are incentivized to repay to get back your collateral whatever it is and back that back during that time uh there wasn't that many different collaterals uh collateral types uh but the idea of work i mean the whole uh d5 space is more or less about over collateralization and collaterals in in essence so it was just a small proof of concept that we we developed and evolved into a community and then just evolved into something else i never wanted to do a startup like this i i it was not my plan at all and so how did you decide to um transition from ethan to ave it was a difficult decision because uh i mean we when we created the the italian product it was very early was 2017 and we kept building it but you know we're practically creating a product into a market where the ecosystem wasn't kind of wide enough there wasn't many users and there wasn't even stable coins so people were kind of posting collaterals and borrowing uh it or or practically usd packed eat and you know it was very very challenging environment plus the user experience wasn't as good as it is today if you look at avid today or uni-swap we didn't have that kind of things and and what we realized during 2018 is that as the ecosystem started to grow is that you know a a pooled model makes a lot of sense and this is what for example uni-swap had and we understood that now that the collaterals that are in in on ethereum are getting more and more market capitalization and what essence this does is that you could actually pull the liquidity and pull the risks and at that point we decided to uh build ave and we actually rebranded first because we italian in some uh some way was actually also kind of like a meme this was just here for ethereum landing and it was funny name back then that you could land out ethereum when people return it and it was a bit of a meme and we just wanted to have some kind of like a branding that was easy and recognizable and you know maybe at some point even something that is easy also for the mainstream if we are willing to go that far and so then how did you decide to make the transition ave and how did you even you know message that with the community well practically uh at some point we just decided like how like what takes steps we should do i mean we we started to discuss with the community like what kind of naming options we could have like what kind of branding we have uh could have and at that point we were even thinking like should we hire actually like a uh branding agency that could just make some sort of like a facelift and come up with the branding and we actually heard a lot of people and and and received offers but eventually we we wanted to do something ourselves and at some point we just went to the community and said that hey this is what this is what we have in plan and this might be very interesting and people love that because somehow our community always understood that it's more than just ethereum lending and i think it's usually the community that pushes you like further than you want to be you know you want to focus quite a lot but there's so many things happening and your community wants you to like spread in multiple ways and do everything and uh which is kind of like we're also excited to do a lot of things at the same time but there's just not enough boundary to do things uh securely so now ave is the second largest d5 protocol after maker dao it has about five billion dollars locked in it and so actually i was originally supposed to interview you last summer and for various reasons we um i just like the news changed and i wanted to to do something that was kind of a little bit more um uh just some breaking news at that moment but i looked back at that original script i had written and even justino last summer it said avi was the fifth largest d5 protocol and it had 150 million dollars locked in it so suffice it to say that ave has seen a really fast growth um but i'm just curious uh why don't we have you describe because i tweeted that you know i was gonna interview you and a number of people said have him explain ave the way he would to a five-year-old or someone said to his normie friends so why don't you take a stab at that well i i usually explain very simple that uh with ave you practically see your crypto grow that that's that's about it because what technically what it is i mean you practically deposit cryptographic assets and you get healed but end of the day the yield is in form of uh getting more uh that particular crypto so if it's eat you get more eat if it's uh let's say uh stable coins uh you get more stable coins so so i just explained that you know it's a way to grow your holdings you know not just like in value but in quantity and it's that's simple basically it's just like of course there's the landing part uh someone is on the other side consuming you know and and those kind of things but in essence it's just pretty much depositing funds and getting getting yield and you will see your crypto grow and actually this happens very uh directly because uh the way we design the protocol is that if you deposit uh assets you get uh a tokens in return so 100 usdc means that you get 100 a usdc and we actually developed this algorithmic formula which means that you will see every second your balance increase wherever you're holding those assets so it could be on your metamask called storage you will always see the balance increase depending on how how often the your wallet provider is is calling the balance of that asset but that's like a very unique way to to create assets because normally that happens in banking but not so often in in our space and so ave in a way is imitating banking right people deposit and then yeah i would say what we're trying to do is we're trying to not just not imitate but we are trying to kind of like uh uh fix the back end of of finance in in general so let's say uh when i when i used to work in fintech uh what we were focusing quite more heavily is pretty much like the user experience so how how to make the the user experience in in finance better and this is what neobanks have been doing and all the challenger banks uh electronic money providers and whatnot and all this fintech is trying to solve like improving the user experience but everything else is hold by the financial infrastructure and that is not moving anywhere and what ave is doing and also kind of like others in the d5 space is actually taking that kind of like a back end of finance and improving that so making it first of all open that is accessible to to to everyone to participate to build upon so you get developers from all parts of the world and have this kind of like transparency that is like what we are essence like trying to trying to solve us as a as of an and defined general yeah and one thing i was looking at is in terms of how quickly ave has grown i think something that's interesting and impressive about it is that ave's closest competitors maker and compound which at the moment rank first and third in terms of total value locked both have silicon value backing uh they both have investment from andreessen horowitz and um well definitely obviously compound also has uh offered a yield farming scheme and ave hasn't done that yet so what do you think accounts for ave's success i think there's a lot of factors involved into it uh but but i think kind of like we definitely created very good technology in in one way but also we were able to attract communities that were underserved so i think that's the key component so back then i i think maker was pretty much focusing on having it as a collateral maybe a couple of other collaterals very very conservative even though they they have this kind of like a depth gap so they can actually list new collaterals but with limited exposure which is uh really good in my opinion and and then uh compound was also pretty conservative i mean they in in in form of um basically what kind of assets there could be listed how we came to the market is that we we started to look like different communities and seeing like what are the active communities and and who actually could use our product and and also like are currently underserved so they might have uh some collaterals that they could use but they cannot use it anywhere else and the thing is that we we started to actually look on those and started to list them as a collateral and one of the interesting part was there is that we adjusted our risk framework in a way that uh we get less exposure than other protocols that we don't allow let's say borrowers uh to get that much out of the collateral but still they we're touching upon market that no one else is serving at the moment and that's that's how i think was one of the part of uh success of course there's also like a lot of work involved in the technology the communications branding and we participated in a lot of hackathons like we're very much developer friendly protocol so i guess like one time we calculated that like 80 of the liquidity just comes from elsewhere than our user interface so someone builds a product or protocol and it consumes deposits there could be yield aggregator and i i think we try to be very developer friendly at the same time and we have touched a lot of communities in in very very good moment i think those are key things and probably other people have more to say because it's always difficult to assess like what's the real real deal behind of the success yeah um but it is interesting i i think what you said about the difference in strategies and kind of accessing maybe more of like a long tail interest um and you know uh just yeah finding the communities that are enthusiastic one other thing was so you know earlier i did ask you to describe avi but also recently in early december ave launched its version two what are the new features yeah so version two is like by itself the the the protocol we made a lot of savings in in the gas costs that's like one of the things but i think the main things is that actually we make made the the protocol more uh useful for the users so when you're depositing into ave uh you can actually then swap your deposit let's say from uh usdc to die if die gives you more interest rate without actually withdrawing the deposit and going somewhere else and swapping there and coming back and then at the same time you can also swap your collateral so let's say that you deposited a collateral let's say ethereum you borrowed uh usdc and and you maybe converted that to uh usd then you went to a tesla store or online just ordered yourself tesla and bought that and now kind of like you already spent those funds uh then you can still without returning your loan uh you can actually swap that collateral to something else let's say you you have everything in ethereum but you want to have that part of your collateral is in some other asset you could practically do that as well with with the collateral swap and also you can repay your loan with the collateral and that practically means that if you have bought a car and and and you don't have those fonts anymore you could actually close the loan with the collateral and that's that's very like very much user uh centric features but they're really uh [Music] real really good because it it actually kind of like makes the makes the protocol more useful yeah so basically if i have a certain type of collateral that i've put up and i wanted to keep that collateral because i want exposure to that price movement but then there's some other shiny new token that i want yeah price exposure to i can switch it easily without um without having to close out my my position in ave is that is that it yeah and i think like where the cool part comes is that the way the ava protocol is designed is that you can create new markets and each market can have different kinds of collateral assets so in the in the some point in the future when we can tokenize more real world assets and other kind of assets and then you can just swap your exposure for for whatever whatever that collateral is and it becomes more interesting let's say if you have exposure to real estate in somewhere some part of the world and you can swap it let's say from malaysian real estate to south african real estate if if those will be tokenized of course like there's a long process still on that kind of like frontier but it this just shows like how how exciting could be at some point and of course the fact that you are already able to draw liquidity against those collaterals is is fascinating and um so one other thing is with the debt tokens if i so if i have these tokens that represent my debt and then someone holds that but then sells it to someone else and i default then what happens in terms of the debt token so so so the a tokens are transferable so it's practically a receipt of of the deposit so you could uh sell your a token to someone else and and let's say you could actually use it as a payment currency so if you deposit it uh usdc you get ausdc and that grows in the balance and and you use it as a payment whoever you pay it will it will still increase so that's kind of very cool payment currency but the depth tokens itself so if you take depth we mean depth tokens they they're not movable at the moment and pretty much like they could be immovable but we didn't want to make it movable yet because we're still unsure of all of the edge cases and like whether it's a security concern or not so we we decided that we we meet them maybe there's some use case that some developer might find in a hackathon but we just don't make it movable yet but we're still researching whether it's possible to to do that and kind of like trying to research like page cases and so forth yeah also just all the different jurisdictions probably have different um you know rules around what's a security or what isn't and so that could also make things challenging so speaking of security but in a different way i wanted to ask also about the safety module which is a key feature in um in ave to keeping the whole system secure it's basically kind of like a way for people to stake um and you know i'm sure people who've been following the device phase know that there have been a number of hacks in d5 so can you describe how the obvious safety module works how you designed it to help ave in the event of an attack like that and you know whether you've had to use it in any way yeah so uh the the safety module is part of the whole kind of like uh avenomics so kind of like how how we are letting the community to to govern the protocol and also kind of like uh carry the risk of the protocol it took us like roughly six months to to design like perfect of a avenomics i mean we had it's not just the teamworks we had a lot of feedbacks and everything and it was a lot of work but but uh in terms of how it essentially works is that the the other token it's it's a governance token so the token holders uh in the community they are practically this uh participating governance decisions that are uh risk-based decisions so let's say what kind of asset could be added to other protocol what kind of uh risk parameters for example how much you can borrow against what could be the incentive in in in liquidation to the liquidators and so forth and and because you're kind of adding or uh taking this this kind of risk you could transfer the risk to the uh token holders and the risk transfer is either passive or active the active one is is where you take the other tokens as a community member and and you deposit into the safety module and that practically means that uh in the safety module you're backstopping the protocol in case of any kind of like a exploit uh it could be a failed liquidation simply similar that happened with maker in in black thursday last year when when the collaterals went decreased in value substantially and uh pretty much like 30 of that uh stake can be slashed if this kind of like a shortfall event happens now currently the safety module is roughly i haven't looked on a daily basis but last time when i looked i think it was uh last week there was one point i think five billion worth of value there in in total uh and that is practically 30 of that is backstopping uh the the protocol and of course if that doesn't cover there's this kind of like a passive uh way of covering deficit protocol deficit which is the recovery issuance and and where new office minted and this is something similar that maker for example has so we tried to kind of like pick whatever we saw during uh in in dfi this different kind of backstop modules and and implement something that's uh is is quite quite innovative backstopping with with uh governance in community members and let's say tokens is a very bespoke model you really see something similar in in traditional finance but i guess i guess somehow it it makes sense it's not like full hedging so so i would say like if someone needs additional like uh let's say uh risk they should go for insurance but the idea of the backstop is that it takes care of the protocol uh we haven't used it uh yet but it's something uh i mean something that it was designed to be used if something happens so it's practically ready there at any given moment to be uh used and that's how that the reason we actually wanted to build the avenomix this way is that we understood that the most important thing for dfi and especially to other protocol is that we have a healthy protocol and and that doesn't it's not in deficit and that that way we get more deposits and adoption yeah so speaking of your plans to decentralize governance that is one of the trickiest processes that any team can undergo and there's a lot of discussions about how to do it and what really constitutes decentralized so how did ave decide to do it and how do you feel that that process has gone over kind of had this progressive decentralization so when we launched a product we we basically we had keys to the product and and what happened is that uh there's two reasons why you usually keep as a as a d5 protocol funding team the the uh the admin case and and one of the things is that uh if something is found you need to fix it uh quickly and and that's that's the kind of like the main thing and and second thing is that you also need to do it very very quickly so if if you are able to fix a some sort of an issue within 10 minutes or or one hour that's like a that that is very important thing compared to let's say if you have a governance process like full-fledged governance you have to wait two there's two days folding period one one day of kind of like a cool down delay and then you have the kind of like a fix then it's it's it's it's uh it might be problematic of securing the protocol and in our case like we uh we were definitely like confident on our work and usually like things are phoned very early when you launch a protocol maybe even like even after audits there might be something that might be found in the first weeks or maybe a couple of first months uh maybe in three but then then it's already kind of like you start to kind of like get this uh general consensus that pretty much the protocol is safe because there's so many air pairs that has been looking at it at the code and for us for us like we had to accelerate the governance mainly because the amount at in the protocol started to be substantially high and we never ever expected it to be this high so like we were joking like when we launched ava that if if this thing goes ever like we will have like 30 million in the protocol it will it will be huge like it will be so so cool and you know and when we just saw it crow and joe we were like at the same time kind of like uh i would say like nervous that this is like taking off and like at the same time it's it's good but at the same time you you we started to actually think now we have to actually give the power to the governance and do it as soon as possible and and then we practically gave the keys and uh i mean since then it's it's been uh governance was very new to me in the sense that you know usually internally you can brainstorm things and maybe ask from the community but now you have this procedures you know it feels like very procedural you know and getting things you you have to actually campaign and nothing is it's like even if you have a good idea it might not get executed if people are not active enough to vote or you know maybe some of the parameters aren't like what people like and this is like super new to me like it's actually you need to work a lot to campaign and it's kind of like uh it's i love governance but it's just like it's one another kind of like building blocking in our workload at the same time yeah yeah no i can only imagine going from being you know not this extreme but almost like like a dictator of your own little world to suddenly just being one of the players although you know obviously i'm sure as the founder and still is the ceo of avi the company you have a lot more sway than the average person um so what is your vision of a fully decentralized ave and how far is ave from that now like what else do you feel you need to do to achieve that i think basically we have quite wide distribution in the sense that uh like there are sort of token holders but the the problem i see two problems one problem is that even though we have white base of of hollowers our governance is too much relying upon the team and kind of like not just the team doing the work but also kind of that the team makes the right things and and it's kind of like it's it's a very heavy heavy load on us at the same time but also kind of like it it's it's not very contributing to the the actual governance and we're trying to figure out like how we can get a wider base uh to participate because but there is participants but the problem is that they're active when it's like very big topic to vote and and then or it it's something that really concerns them all but like how we could make everyone to participate not everyone but good amount of uh activity on let's say even smaller votes that make sense and one of the things which is very problematic is the gas that people just pay gas to govern and that's that's a problem i mean if you have to pay to vote you know transaction fees it's it's not that incentivizing and and and that's one of the things why what what what is kind of like a bottleneck there so we we kind of like from the voting perspective we want to have more addresses voting and of course we want to have more addresses delegating to other addresses and having uh this kind of like a protocol politician so so this is the one thing and this problem is a bit common widespread in in defy another problem has in in governance is that our governance is a bit different than others because in in other governance you can actually delegate voting power just to kind of protocol politicians and also separately uh the governance power to sorry the proposition power to someone to put a proposal on chain so that if if it gets voted in it will automatically execute and you can delegate that power to put proposals on chain to uh someone more technical kind of like a lawmaker code makers and what we are trying to now to do is that there will be others that are creating proposals to improve the protocol and and this is something uh we we started to work upon recently i mean the version two that uh governance allows to actually delegate proposition power uh went live on on um december so it's fairly new but we're trying to achieve a kind of like a state where you know there's other themes asking grounds from the from the avid dao and also building the protocol so that the other theme actually competes with others as well in in in in form of building the protocol and that's that's something we want to achieve and it takes quite a lot of time but it's it's kind of like an issue at the moment in in my opinion yeah this is this is a really really interesting part of the discussion so in a moment we're going to discuss a little bit more about this concept of protocol politicians but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible crypto.com the crypto super app that

you were just talking about what you were calling protocol politicians how do you define that and do you see protocol politicians as being a good or bad thing for d5 and or decentralized projects in general i see it kind of being good and bad but mainly good because it's very difficult to do bad things in in in the e5 um because kind of like if something is really bad you know the good people can always fork create a new community and it's just there's no modes here and this is something like once once you see happen you know it's it actually activates the the the forked uh kind of like a protocol and and you know they it has to like kind of like respond to that and you know you know with the narrative and everything but but i think like with protocol politicians uh i i think it's good because you know you kind of delegate your your your voting power to someone that has similar values as you have and more time to actually go through the proposals uh very uh deeply and maybe they it might be a team actually and they might have technical people that could actually review the code and and what what what it actually has um there and i i think that the the problem of course is that you know after after like if you have big holders and and they are getting like in into coalitions that that's that's a problematic thing but i think forking is is the the solution uh in every single problem i mean we see like we can look back into linux and see how how how things work but in that sense but uh they also like one of the issues of the protocol politicians is that there is no incentives at the moment so i was actually talking uh in clubhouse uh with with rick burton uh who's been in defy space so for a few years now and in practically he he was trying uh trying kind of like to to participate in in default governance as a protocol politician uh style and it's just like the the incentives aren't like there because like there's if you want to do it like very well being a politician it's it's like it's a full-time time job and just doing being a protocol politician just for the sake of decentralization uh might not be sufficient especially one defy and like cryptocurrencies is all about incentives and uh this is like the missing parts and i think uh to solve this thing i think taos need to step up and start to kind of like somehow distribute actively grounds and not just grounds but you know uh stream funds into let's say protocol politicians that get enough support and then you have the system that they don't need to worry about like who pays what and actually the dollars will pay and they just can focus on campaigning what's important for their agenda and and whether they get mandated and so but you were saying some of the protocol politicians might be technical but then there might be others that aren't they're just advocating for certain changes they want to the protocol is that how do you envision what a protocol politician is yeah and the thing is like in politics as well we have people who might be also kind of with a legal background and some that are not and and the thing with uh thing with proposals that are in efi is that the proposals are technical so you can write a nice description of what the proposal is there's some discussion but the law is actually the code so when that goes to the on-chain voting and it's important to understand like what's what the code actually has in in in terms of like the payload and uh it it's good if you understand because if there's something that actually isn't correct then you know you can actually say that okay this is a problem in this protocol but uh it's really it's a real occasion that you put something on chain that is uh highly different what you kind of like described in terms of like it's very would say like a rare case and and that is why you don't need to be a technical person and i i think you shouldn't be a technical person because this is the part where non-technical people can contribute and participate so i i think that's the the power of of being a protocol politician that you don't need to be necessarily technical but it might help in in some cases yeah it would probably help in terms of whether or not you actually do the coding at least understanding what's possible and kind of yeah just how different different technical considerations might affect decisions that you would want to make so this is sort of related um you know just in terms of the fact that this also uh kind of bleeds into that legal area but one thing is you launched that credit delegation product last summer and it's interesting because that was what people were calling unsecured loans where they were essentially based on legal agreements and i was wondering you know in the time that you had that so there was the first version of it and now with v2 of ave you have a a different version of it but i wondered even in in v1 how did people tend to use it like who were the lenders and borrowers and then you know if they were in different jurisdictions how did they decide which jurisdiction they would handle any disputes under and stuff like that that's an interesting question because like uh how we did the great delegation version one we practically uh developed a a kind of like a vault where where you could just put eight tokens there as a as a depositor and and because the a tokens are there as a kind of like a collateral so whoever you allow to to access that vault uh they can draw practically to that world and then to themselves uh credit from from other protocol against someone else a token a tokens what it's actually allowed allowed the delegators to do or the depositors actually is that they they have now technical capability just to lend out to someone with their kind of like against their collateral which is deposited there so so the cool part here is that you deposit into ave you're an interest you delegate you're in a bit more interest but the thing is that uh how this different than you will do normally is that you you would actually just uh borrow yourself from ave against your collateral some some other asset and send it to someone else and this is kind of like less of a good user experience but in this relationship what we did actually is that uh there was one borrower for example diversify and and they they borrowed what happened in this relationship they they made an agreement through open law and open law is is just a kind of like a docusign type of a a application which with additional twist and the twist is that you can actually put into the document executions as well let's say point certain conditions to certain addresses and then when the contract is signed whoever signs the last as the last one uh can deploy a contract so in this open law template uh which which is pretty cool you could actually the the last person who signs it deploys the vault and once it's deployed then the delegator just funds the world and then another person draws the credit and this open law template you could just choose like different jurisdiction england uh dispute resi resolution clause uh arbitration how many are arbitrators uh you could choose choice of law let's say um english law and then you could of course the parties put their names and everything pretty much like the same way as docusign uh works and then of course the addresses who is who and so forth and and that that was was the case so we created a legal wrapper but also at the same time we had another kind of interesting great delegation type is that where depositors uh were delegating into a smart contract world that uh did something in dfi and could only do one particular function and and that contract didn't allow the the funds to be used to anything else so there was a uh wiring walt uh called ya link which borrowed uh two credit allocation imports roughly 15 million worth of usdc from from ave via credit delegation and there is there wasn't any legal wrapper here because everything is on contracts and obviously as the the the this world could only practically deposit into a i think they were like uh farming something and then then kind of like all the revenue they were paying back to the delegators and and because this is like a close loop relationship between smart contracts and there's no like a additional like a credit risk because it's in the system that was the second type kind of like so there was this uh one type where you just borrow and under your serve the legal rapper or just trust someone else or you do the smart contract uh closed loop system those are the two type of uh crit delegations oh that's really interesting yeah the what you described with the open law thing is almost like it's like some kind of it's almost like legal zoom but specifically for these blockchain contracts um that yeah it just sounds really interesting i also then wanted to ask so in version two so in version one especially if you were dealing with a specific counterparty rather than uh doing the smart contract version of using this of these um credit delegation products that was kind of more of a work around but in v2 you've made it more native to the protocol so how does that work yeah so now it's super easy so basically as a depositor uh you deposit assets into the version two and then you just grant a credit line to to another address and that another address just can come come and borrow this is pretty pretty interesting because uh it's way easier and and this is something that we're not we don't have a user interface for this yet but this is something we're uh launching in let's say a couple of weeks and the idea is that practice you can you can delegate uh through the user interface to someone else uh and also whoever gets the credit line can also manage and repay the credit line through the uh user interface of course we don't have the uh kind of like um it's a more of a trust based relationship so you will not pretty much dedicate that way to to to someone that you you just don't know you know it will be like sending funds to zero yeah yeah yeah and but what's cool about this is that uh then the other governance they could actually decide uh hey what if we what if we allow uh let's say third parties uh they could be projects that are working on other collateralist loans or they might be cfi landing desks or traditional institutions what if they can create walls where they can ask credit delegations and that will be in the user interface so so practically uh there might be a world where uh that can accept credit delegations and depositors could add there it it gives certain kind of a premium and that wall then borrows under collateralize but does some sort of uh functionality it could just borrow to land out in centralized uh markets or it could it could be another protocol that is borrowing in the closed loop system or it could be just some fintech startup that that is having some sort of lending activity and their source the liquidity uh this way to the traditional finance and let it out further so practically what it allows actually to do is that today we we think about defy in a way that it actually vacuums like quarity so right so so we're trying to kind of like get more deposits into the space more people's using dfi that way but one of the things that we're not working that much it's actually how we get the liquidity out of the efi into traditional finance with the trust networks and in different kinds of uh ways and create delegation just pretty much that so i could imagine some beautiful day very soon all the governance could vote that this particular walt uh could accept credit delegations in a user interface and it could be a some sort of financial institution or a lending service provider and then each one maybe would have its own parameters for the type of borrowers that they would allow or something like that right like they might have their own way of of scoring people's risk or something yeah yeah so one one interesting like there could be just like a project that manages let's say create risking and and and maybe lending activity and they just take the cr source to source the liquidity with the credit delegations and then they decide okay uh we're going to give credit uh based on this and this and this uh particular parameters and it could happen in traditional finance so practically they would could do even credit checks they could do even the normal stuff that is happening but uh what's interesting here is that the person that is getting the credit whether it's consumer credit or let's say b2b credit let's consume a credit and and buys a car and and part of that liquidity or fully could be sourced from aven and defy this way so so there is like a uh trust relationship between this financial institution and the other governance and and the the that way there's like you need to trust trust it but but because they are doing like let's say landing activity you kind of expect that they they do things right if it's only based on let's say this kind of a reputation and and then uh pretty much the learning institution that is lending out to their consumers they do the credit checks and they have recourse and so forth and then could borrowers kind of build credit by showing their behavior on you know like this is my main wallet that i use to interact with ave and hear all the debts i've taken out and paid back or anything like that like could that also be built on that i think so i think so we've been talking with uh defy that practically because uh travis blaine for people here he works at zapper and he's a super cool guy and uh yeah and by the way he wanted he wanted me to ask you who's your favorite dad in d5 well that's of course steve i doubt okay i'm glad we got to ask that i wasn't planning to but since it came up anyway go ahead yeah and i i think like what's interesting at dfi that besides that he's like bringing like d5 to water adoption and making actually explaining it like to five-year-olds and i guess he's doing it on a daily basis but is is that you know if if you could actually have this some sort of uh you get credit delegations you repay loans and and end of the day maybe you hold in your wallet other things nfts and so forth maybe you actually form this this on-chain identity that is so valuable for you and it has provenance and you know and maybe that becomes a a credit facility so it becomes this kind of a new reputation like i think our problem usually is with with uh under colorado's lawns is that we always think that we need to always think how we chase the person all the way to the end that they repay all the debts but actually the traditional uh lending doesn't work completely like that because for example in b2b lending companies go bankrupt and you might not see most of the funds that that you have landed out uh to to to a business or to a startup many startups fail so in terms of like like private equity that happens uh quite a lot venture capital and also in in um in many european countries and in the us you have this this kind of like uh possibility to you know kind of file for bankruptcy as as a person as well or have this kind of like uh arrangement that you repay part of your debt so we should never kind of like think that the recourse have to be like that you have to chase someone and actually uh i started insolvency law i mean like bankruptcy law uh and one of the interesting thing is that our economy is more based on this kind of like remorse so if someone fails you kind of like uh try to settle as much as you can but then that the person gets back into the economy and could be like productive and you know healthier compared to the old kind of thinking that where debtors should get everything that they they invested into and i think if you get this kind of thinking uh into the on-chain like identity and and under coletta's lawns then we will start to see more like interesting interesting uh under collateral stones not the kind of like ways where we go all the way back to traditional finance and try to figure out how we get part of the payment back but actually like you have so-called address-based reputation with everything that you have achieved that you don't want to lose it but if you lose it once it's totally fine if later you you you make something good yeah it definitely would depend on a really good identity system though because otherwise although i know okay i was just going to say that somebody with bad credit could just keep opening up new addresses but then they would still have to build the good credit and the good behavior with each one so anyway all right so let's switch gears for a second to talk about the e-money license that you got in the uk which was granted to the uk business entity that ave has and i checked out the website it says that that is still being built so what are you building there and what do you plan to do with that license yeah so so one of the things we our goal was to kind of like get get more adoption mainstream and like it's just so hard to to to get people direct people to let's say to an exchange and say that go go there buy some meat and go to other directions buy some stable coins now it's a bit easier you could just say that go to go to this exchange uh get some stable coins get some heat and and then create a metamask and and do this and that and then you can deposit and so so there's like there's less steps now but still too many steps to actually like someone to get like uh exposure into the efi and what we want to do is is kind of like uh narrowed that gap quite a lot so practically uh that you're able with your traditional currencies so let's say pounds dollars euros you could convert them into stable coins and and later deposit into d5 as well so kind of like having this some some sort of like an end-to-end relationship with the users in the sense that you know you have the d5 back end but then you have the actual back front end where you're reaching out the norm is the mainstream that is what we are trying to achieve and we we're building it like it's more of like a side thing that we're trying to build and it goes quite slowly but i think we're going to launch something quite soon maybe in q 3 i think will be the most uh kind of like optimistic or optimistic plan yeah this is probably the part of your work uh like i was saying earlier that touches more on fintech and is more connected to the traditional banking system and so it will definitely probably work a bit slower and there's probably a lot more compliance that uh you'll have to deal with well one other thing that i wanted to ask about was ave had pioneered flash loans and i wondered how you feel about the fact that 10 of the 16 most prominent attacks in d5 in the past year have involved flash loans is there anything you would do differently about that yeah so yeah this is an interesting thing i actually um i have been thinking that quite a lot and uh well one of the things is that most of the flash loans are used for for actually like good purpose and not just arbitrage but actually refinancing depth uh closing long positions uh let's say uh before liquidators can get in and and take the uh borrowers uh kind of like part of their collateral so they can kind of pre-liquidate themselves and there's flash loans used so flash phones are actually used quite heavily in in many things last year i think there was uh 2 billion worth of flash loans in in from from ave so that's like substantial amount compared to the hacks what the hacks kind of like dude like i mean those hacks are possible to do without flashlights just having the pre-aimed capital of course like if you're a a 16 year old kid or like something like that and you know you figure out flash loans and and that's the kind of way you you can you know make this uh kind of like uh exploit then of course like it it does help in certain extent but what flashlight actually does more for this kind of like security is that it actually bulletproofs the protocols because you can't deploy anything out there that can't withstand that kind of an attack because if you can if you can uh defend a flashlight attack it means also you could defend a whale that will do similar kind of an attack so that is my kind of like a key component and in in uh in terms of like uh flash loans and in in and whether kind of like they're good or bad because there's they're actually innovation they bring something new and they empower developers and they empower users and and also at the same time they they ensure that developers are building good protocols that they are not getting exploited so so kind of like every flashlight exploit means that the development team just didn't find something or uh they cut corners somewhere and that is like that's the problem in dfi general because you know d5 is not equal you know there are projects that are putting a lot of effort in security their projects that aren't putting effort in security and this is a this is kind of like a problem for the space yeah so with v2 you did introduce flash loans to ave itself and i wondered what did ave do to try to protect itself from potential attacks that's a good question that's a good question because i i think i don't i think like pretty much how security is handled is is it's really about reviewing code thinking different kinds of scenarios understanding uh potential attacks re-entering reentrancy uh any kind of like attack that related to flash loans understanding each and every attack like what happened why and and other potential scenarios so those are one things and whenever you introduce new code you need to think about what are the the cases that this particular code could lead to so so and then you have a rotation system in in your team that like each every kind of developer tries to review the the other developers code and there's there's good procedures on that so that's that's one thing and then the second important thing is to have test cases enough test cases for various different type of uh behavior so so you should be testing more than you are developing that applies more into smart contract based development and then of course once everything is ready and you're confident with your code then you can actually go to auditors and say hey uh we heard that you are doing very good work i read your your previous work and and we're very confident that this is something that fits your your uh and then you take those third-party audits and the version two for example we have five audits our fifth audit came uh recently and we had formal verification which is the mathematical proof of how the protocol works and behaves and that's also not none of this are guarantees it's just like how much you put effort on security and the more you put the better like there isn't limitation like how much you should or should not put like you should just put everything everything because the stakes are high the example where we thought that there was 30 million will be in other protocol and then there's billions it just shows like shows how high the stakes are yeah i did an episode with taylor monahan and dan guido about this and taylor was just like people don't think that just because there's an audit that everything's safe you know she was just like this is not any kind of seal of approval um and yeah she agreed with you that you know it's just kind of a continual thing and i think i can't remember if we discussed it in that episode but you know obviously where you have things like new token standards coming out like what was that uh hack um was it the imbtc one where um the new er 777 standard i think caused a bug um but they like that was a known thing they just didn't do anything about it so yeah it's like you have to constantly keep up on developments and and watch them for how they'll affect your protocol yep and that's a common security thing i mean if if if if there is a improvement you need to up update your your uh software so let's also now talk about office partnership with realty which is a project that tokenizes real estate on ethereum by creating llc's for properties and then sending a share of the revenue for each to each that each token holder holds um to their own ethereum wallet in staple coins which is i think super interesting um and an ave realty tokens can be used as collateral for people to borrow um and so since real at least in the us realty tokens are securities i was wondering how uh you know ave uh like what changes you needed to make to accommodate that in a decentralized protocol it's a good question because it's kind of like a it's a completely different poll it's it's so called like private market with permissions uh permission access so so practically in in this case the realty they're using uh the the other kind of technology the the smart contracts but the market is completely private so so everyone who participates that market has to go to their own process of kyc and and so forth and this is kind of like interesting because you know we we recently created the feature of uh practically white listing and blacklisting addresses so practically now anyone that has an interesting project in mind they can just take the other code and and deploy a uh market for their own purpose it's it's the same as someone will use uh mysql database but instead of like using like a common mysql database they just use for themselves for for settlements and and so forth for this elements sake of transparency and like what is the yeah so it's practically that's the only way in my opinion to to approach the the kind of like a security aspect and also kind of like those assets that are not like uh purely cryptographic uh assets and i think we'll see a couple of other ones coming uh during this year uh and it's interesting to see like whether the catch and what kind of attention it catches because you kind of lose the permissionless factor where you have this interoperability compatibility and then you're kind of left with the you know security of ethereum and the transparency that the the public ethereum uh provides and maybe like fixed settlement systems so you the the participants that are going through the uh compliance and participating in that market uh they don't need to rely on written agreements they rely on smart contract execution so there are there are still quite a lot of benefits on that and i'm interesting like will those benefits by themselves be enough for this kind of projects to uh take the take this market further and uh i don't know yeah well you know i have to say something that interested me about this project and in general just listening to some of the other interviews you've done it seems that you and avi are pretty eager to integrate where real world assets and frankly i feel like most crypto and d5 people view that as kind of a headache to interact with off-chain assets because i feel like it just introduces a whole host of other problems so why why is that something that's interesting to you yeah it is a headache and the the good thing about it many of the things that we are kind of like partnering and talking about we're especially like real world assets we're pretty much like technology providers so we just give the infrastructure and and rest is on the the kind of tokenize whoever is tokenizing those those assets and and managing so practically we we we have a smaller headache in in one sense but of course like if they their project succeeds that's that's amazing but also we we tend to forget that uh most popular assets on ethereum are real world assets which is practically tokenized dollars which is interesting part because you know usually when we think about real world assets or tokens in real world anything we they think it quite widely so so like how to do it globally but if you look at like the biggest organizations they're just one jurisdiction practically let's say dollars what what the usdc is doing and and they they're they had just one jurisdiction which is u.s u.s dollars in in that sense that's what they do and i think we'll see more of like projects doing it more locally so they try to actually solve locally the organization and then if it works scaling a bit uh further but also it's kind of like a hope at least personally that we will see more value in and transfer more value from real world to the cryptographic ecosystem because in the cryptographic ecosystem this interest finance value could move very quickly uh developers could build very interesting concept products and and and efficiencies and it just the transparency itself is is very fascinating and of course if you solve the transparency in the off chain as well the custodians and so forth and the the stuff related that that's that's that's fantastic but i just think like having this value network is there's sort of potential and we we just are scratching the surface yeah yeah no it will be interesting to see where it goes and how it can affect real-world assets when you bring those features um and so obviously right now ethereum has been experiencing a you know a state of high fees for loads of different types of transactions for a while how has ave been thinking about scaling are you looking at layer two solutions are you looking at other blockchains we are we are quite a lot like but we but we are also like we do have a strategy but we are trying to a bit of not to share it too much because at the same time the layer two is not super important for us it's more important for trading facilities order books something that has a lot of transactions in that sense and ave is kind of like a follower in the sense that you know where there's transactions there's liquidity issuance uh then there's a need for secondary you know liquidity lending borrowing markets but we are talking to every places and there there's already like a ecosystem project called avagachi and they ported the other tokens into the uh he tokens into the uh malik yeah and that was just one example and there's other kind of like folks in the community that just want to port them and it's already like a good start so that we see that it's more of a community initiative to get like layer two uh experimentations but we're still kind of like looking at it but we definitely have a interesting uh solution at some point when we are uh ready and that that might come quite soon even i mean it's uh it really depends on how how serious the lts will become and so also would you consider leaving ethereum or or trying a different blockchain well kind of i was born and raised in ethereum and i and in terms of like we've been always building here but uh at the same time i also would say that like that's our like on-chain headquarters so i like in that sense like it's very difficult to leave because the culture is here the ecosystem is here the compassibility is here but there are some cool things happening in our places uh i've been following what's happening in polka dot i've been following also like layered twos and and just keeping like uh keeping like curiosity always and i don't think people will copy what ethereum has but what i'm interesting to see like these new cultures evolve in like you know other blockchains and seeing like which direction it takes and and and maybe if ave has placed there because ava is more about not even about d5 but like building culture and being part of everything that that is is in their own chain like we want to empower like finance is is big space but it's just a space that empowers other economies and cultures so we want to empower what's happening in the creator community the e-commerce community on chain and and be involved in various parts and that's why we focus more on culture and with the branding and everything uh and that's why i'm following like what's happening in other blockchains as well but i would not say we would ever live in ethereum i hope not i mean this is like super cool to be here with so many uh i mean the community is very healthy so yeah yeah yeah i feel like i asked this question of a lot of people and i get a a kind of similar answer i think you know they're kind of seeing where things go but people do i think seem to have some kind of uh loyalty to ethereum and recognize that that's where a lot of the activity is yeah um and and where you can get network effects um so earlier we did talk about kind of the difference between ave which you know doesn't have kind of the traditional silicon valley venture capital backing i mean you do have some investment but um you know that it's just a little bit of a different uh beginning that you've had and if we even just look in general you know obviously d5 and decentralized projects in general are really different from traditional startups so um in this open source world you know which is quite different from you know what it would be like building a traditional startup what can a d5 project do to build a moat i think nothing because it's impossible to build a mode i we tried because i think what's interesting in d5 is that especially compared to traditional finance and other businesses is that there is nothing that actually protects anything because you know the code base is open source and the idea is that anyone can contribute anyone can just take that code and prove it and and create something else and then you can look at that and create something more better and the liquidity also works the same way if someone creates a better algorithm the liquidity just moves there and and also better user experience so there isn't that much of a thing that is protecting but what's cool about it is that the innovation speed of innovation is is very very quick which makes the space very attractive and and very promising at the same time so i think like as a uh d5 project or newcomers i think what's important is actually like how much you can keep up with the rate of innovation so it actually doesn't matter like what's the product currently you're working upon but uh how you vision to improve it and uh what you might be doing after that product and what are the next kind of things and it always kind of like to some extent in my thinking it always boils down to the theme like how open environment they have to be creative so if the team the the the founders and if they can be uh openly brainstorming and kind of like come up with ideas uh fairly usually like there is constant innovation and we see this indeed happening like protocols are innovating like constantly even though we're we're kind of competing as as crazy here but at the same time like it's stressful but as you get used to the idea that you know everyone is just like coming out with cool stuff and you're expected to cool come with some cool stuff and people like that then you kind of like i get into the uh mode and do you feel that the community can sometimes make it like you know earlier when we were talking about the difference between just being able to implement changes that you want and now having to go through this process does that make it harder to keep up with the pace of innovation yeah but it does there's three elements kind of like you you you kind of miss a bit the surprise element in one way so you have to discuss it quite openly on what you're building what you're going to implement otherwise if it comes uh after the bushes and there's going to be a proposal vote they have very little time to actually educate everyone what's what's going on and campaign on on the improvements and then uh of course there's the procedure that you have to do but uh at the same time that's it has stability it has stability and it adds certainty the the certainty is very important so so even though like protocols have to innovate they have to be very secure at the same time and changes has to be applied in a not light kind of like weight manner so i one way it slows down but it brings a lot of value by by having more stability in the in the protocol and uh yeah that's those things are kind of evolved all right well what's next for ave next for avi i think um yeah we're deploying new markets so that's amazing thing because we've been like promising to deploy new markets for a long time and you know uh we we actually found a community developer that is working on on deploying them so the next market we are deploying is actually uh this kind of like a uh amm market where you can use not just uh uniswap liquidity provider shares as a collateral but also social swap shares and balancer shares and also uh kyber as they come as they are coming up with their amm so automated market maker kind of like uh where you can trade like unispot yes yes exactly so you can use them as a collateral and get liquidity more what's interesting here is the governance so we decided because our governance motor is quite unique and allows this kind of like uh voting strategies and have like inclusivity on multiple tokens we decided that we actually are going to govern that market in a way that uh the other tokens has some voting power as well but also we give voting power to uni uh val knc and sushi tokens so practice it makes kind of like inclusive governance so that we're not even though it's a other product it's not only that we're not only ones governing because it relates uh in one ways to the other protocols and i think this is the next thing coming up in in in d5 that you know you have projects building together things governing things together and this is where you will see like a lot of interesting stuff yeah that does it does sound really interesting all right well we'll have to have you back when when that happens where can people learn more about you and ave i think uh following us on twitter so available is our our handle uh we're quite active in telecom and uh and of course discord and i'm actually frequently now in in clubhouse i'm just listening and sometimes talking there and you know that's a nice nice place to to chat about things and if someone wants to to look what our markets look like it's ava.com and uh yeah and if there's something uh i mean the theme is very reachable i'm quite active everywhere try to be as close as community as i can and uh yeah okay great well thank you so much for coming on unchained thank you
