use cipher trace to comply with regulation and to monitor compliance my guests today are sebastian santa the new CEO of local bitcoins Amica impala software developer at local bitcoins welcome sebastian and mica hello nice to see you most listeners have probably heard of local bitcoins but they may not be fully aware of what it does or how it works Sebastian can you describe local bitcoins here so local bitcoins in the sense of course it's a place where people can trade with Bitcoin so they can buy and they can sell bitcoins but the local bitcoins in core is that it's from people to people and of course it's speed different than exchange so our idea is that it's it's bit similar to create lists but facility us users probably know pretty well so it's kind of a place for Bitcoin able to meet and create an advertisement that I want to buy Bitcoin I want to sell Bitcoin but that is basically what the local paid course is about and mica can you walk me through one example of how a buyer and a seller transaction on the platform yes so the buyer let's say that I want to buy bit concerned so I go to the local PD website that create create the account to also resign and with that account I get this Bitcoin wallet as part of it this account and with this Bitcoin wallet I can transfer bitcoins in and out so after that I I can search for for advertisement on on localbitcoins dot-com at and when I found find a suitable advertisement let's say for example that I want to use Swift to settle the payment for the bitcoins so I really searched for for advertisements that advertise selling of the bitcoins with Swift payment so after I I have found a suitable advertisement from the site I will I will start trade by pirate going to that out with advertisement and and what happens then is is that the amount of bitcoins that I am about to buy will go to our escrow wallet and then well that's us we are now doing the payment us with the Swift I will I will make the transfer to to the seller of the bitcoins using the Swift Network ad and once we both me as a buyer and the seller of the bitcoins agree that the Swiss payment this is done we both mark the payment and the trade has done and at that point point the local Beach Coast service escrow wallet releases the bit goes to me to my local Bitcoin account wallet where I can then we troll them if needed and so you named Swift as one example of ways in which buyers can pay but what are and I was gonna say what are all the ways in which buyers can kit can pay but obviously you don't need a list every single one but just give some examples of the full range yeah well Swift GB all eBay and beside it really doesn't matter what is like settlement type I mean if users have some unknown or new payment method in their in their local area they can also agree to use that one so we don't in a sense limit so a limit the other part of the trade so it's just whatever the seller is willing to accept yeah well mostly of course there are some aspects there which we are limiting there because of the safety of users and so on but it's pretty much open for the users to decide that how they exams the other currency not the Bitcoin but data currency and what would be an example of a way that's unsafe to pay with yeah so the cash trades was actually disabled during the spring and there was actually kind of lot of news especially from our competitors noticing that we have removed the cash trace from them they were actually small discussion in the company if we should keep it and how people they'll see it but then again it was very limited at how many people were still using it so we literally didn't see that it is important anymore but it was also that there are problems with the caster's because when you are using escrow service the whole idea is that you don't completely trust the other party if you would trust completely taught apart then you don't need escrow service you can transfer bitcoins directly wallet - wallet but when you need the escrow service there is not complete trust between the parties and of course if you have to meet the person face to face to trade the cash it's a really problematic safety issue but then it's also really hard for to prove that the cash has been traded what if the other party says that I did transfer the cash that the body says no it did not happen so there is really hard way to prove this kind of cases so essentially it was kind of because it would be like difficult to resolve disputes so that was kind of removed as one of the options yeah that was actually one of the reason Davis also regulation post it was not really happened in the regulation or at that time but we the main reason was that it was to save the end the dispute it did cause us course but then again kind of the benefits and use was very element actually Micah has some numbers also related to how papa lord gastrous was makin what percentage of transactions were cash trades when we eventually decided to to stop supporting cast race on our platform amount of revenue that was generated from from the gas price was less than 1/2 percent of the company's revenue tow so it's a it was just this really small branch that we kind of like decided to cut down I mean there is no justification for the overheard of of the service flow so you know was it more popular though in certain geographies like in a particular country for instance might it be you know I don't know like 20% of the transactions there even if it was only half a percent of your revenue overall and they wasn't there wasn't a clear market area or or anything like that where it was used more than in dollar places it was more like where we had users anyway they were always a couple of gas traders also on there so there was it wasn't like it was quite steadily spread amongst the markets okay we were like present but you know these these gas trades in you know it's it's really confusing topic to me I mean when I'm I'm out there in the white encountering other bitcoiners and and they learn learn that I work for the local bitcoins we we usually start talking about local bitcoins that many times they talk about this thing that people meet in some places and they excess gas for bitcoins and and that's really like confusing for me because I I don't see local pit guys doing that that I mean I mean we haven't do that is not what local Bitcoin does well it's it's not completely true yet yes you can do to also that but people who does that is so small percentage of our users users that you could also think of it as non-existing but I do understand where this all is coming from I mean in the summer of 2013 the majority of our traders were gas traders but already in the end of the 2013 gas traders were only one third of the customer base and when we come to the year 2016 the number of gas traders was like less than 5% of our users so we might be considered as platform where where gas rates were done a long time ago but but I mean well long time ago in Bitcoin world three years is a very long time I think that is definitely true but I mean there there comes time to every company to like streamline the business and concentrate to the core of the business and and when you have something that is used like or is can generating less than a half percent of the company revenue and you are in this streamlining mode those things just like gets cut off yeah I also vote for that because of course the company mission is to bring Bitcoin to every city of the world or allow everybody on the planet the trade with Bitcoin so in that picture cast rates is not important it started matters that really matters yeah I mean I think probably some of the anger that you kind of experience from some of the users or some the coiners about this is that I think there are people who view your service as somewhat political at least in concept the idea of allowing people to trade peer-to-peer typically means you know more anonymously and under certain jurisdictions where perhaps people don't have very much financial freedom that could be a very very important service and so you know for them I think that they view this as like an important kind of it's almost like for them of a political stance or something but in a way maybe I feel like the the passion that they feel about that is sort of similar to just in general where you notice in politics that there tends to be some people who passionately about one thing and then the majority of the population unfortunately doesn't even if it's kind of a worthy stance and so yeah so I think that's what I'm hearing you know when you talk about the disconnect between what your users are saying and then how you see things from the business perspective mmm and also that of course what we have noticed is that it might be that in developing countries what are kind of the core things that people are needing their in in case of Bitcoin is bit different and investor world so for example the caste rates I understand this that there is the the idealistic way of viewing it but if you are in developing countries and you kind of want for example save money and save it from the inflation I don't know if they consider cash option or not it's more important that there is the option to kind of save yourself from the hyperinflation for example but that's actually what I was asking about whether or not cashed rates were more popular in certain geographies because in some of the developing countries are they're kind of like are there enough options for payments for people do you know what I'm saying like like in certain geographies is that the case where cash is one of the main ways that people transact and if so you know is that kind of preventing people in that country from getting access to Bitcoin yeah that is actually really interesting question of course like I said that Oxley macaque mentioned that of course we based our decision on data and we were looking that it's going down and even though there were more people from everywhere in the world coming inside they were using less cash threads but that is really interesting was of course there might be that there is huge market out there who are only able to use cast rates and that this I really feel that is really important because if there is that kind of user Club there should be a Bitcoin service for them as well yeah I would like to I would like to argue that that if we if we consider those countries which are experiencing hyperinflation they don't like to use cash because you have to use so big piles of cash it's easier to use some kind of bank transfer or mobile money and also what we see in in a developing countries is that they are they are in many ways leapfrogging to to move by money and and mobile minutes and office these apps that you can use on your phone phone from your phone and people are actually using those kind of payment methods instead of cash yeah that makes sense yeah but this is really interesting topic and of course if I understood correctly Terrace of QN is making research on this but of course there is this kind of societies and blizzards organization also researching because I have to admit that me or the company of course we are not really the specialists to understand that how in developing countries people are behaving so of course if we would understand a bit but how they are using Bitcoin and how they kind of wish to use the Bitcoin in future of course that is also our vision that we could give them a service but it's really hard of course the really know how people in different markets and different areas are using yeah and I actually think one other kind of difficulty in trying to do this research is that I imagine when people are not under duress that then of course they're happy to use these different services but if you look at what happened in Hong Kong recently with the protests there as you know a lot of Hong Kongers were using cash to pay for their subway tickets to go to the protests rather than using any sort of payment method that could be identified back to them and so you know these like you instead of just generally looking at you know like developing countries or something it would need to be maybe more specific like geographies that are undergoing some kind of political upheaval where they don't feel comfortable transacting with their identities something like that so I understand it it would need to be something where you would need to be in kind of the right place at the right time to to get the full picture yeah it's it's exactly like that yet yeah so but it I think that is why you know some of there's some pushback on this because I think some people who like the idea of peer-to-peer training of local bitcoins then understand that if it's not offered the cash transactions then in times of duress then people won't have that option um so actually let's just go back though to the very beginning of how local bitcoins got founded I think the founder of the company Adam yes jeremy --is saw the tower or tried to try to like find ways to buy bitcoin or sell bitcoins and kind of like didn't find any good services and so he he decided to create this this correct list type of place where you can advertise buying or selling at and thus the first version of the lock of bitcoins was created that it was really like done in in a few weeks or something like that and and in the beginning of local bitcoins there was no way of creating any revenue and it was maybe in half year after the beginning or one year after the beginning that escrow service was introduced and with the escrow serviced the company was able to generate revenue as as we charged like one process the amount of escrowed bitcoins during the trade and basically that's that's the basis of the company that we still are running providing the advertisement space and providing the escrow as service van when users are making the trade and you charge that fee to the seller right yes okay and so are there any other services that you have begun to offer over time or is that really you know just kind of your bread and butter and and that's the main way that local bitcoins makes its revenue there has been like local Bitcoin ATMs at some point and and we had this invoicing service at some point maybe maybe there are others that I am not that well aware of but we we are kind of like being focusing on streamlining and to to the main product and trying to do it as good as soon as we got and how has usage and reach of your platform changed over time yeah so yeah we did actually if you check the volume so how much there is transaction ongoing on the platform and this is probably really interesting for the listeners as well so there are public sources where you can compare different exchanges and trading points and services like woke up eight coins going dance and there we can see that of course before 2017 the market was much smaller but it was growing steadily and of course 2017 the crowd was insane during that year but the interesting part at least mine is that of course there was the processors it ended like was it $17,000 per Bitcoin then in the drop-down but the volume of local bitcoins has been it has remained pretty much the same as average of 2017 and that is insane and Micah actually know there's something really interesting about if the Bitcoin price remains so if you because you can share it yeah so I mean I think that we have this steady growth we have had this steady growth from the beginning of the company and it just seems to be growing and growing it but one one thing that affects the speed of the growth is that if the Bitcoin price is moving we we seem to have more growth so when the Bitcoin price is coming down we have a little bit more called and when the Bitcoin price is going up we have a lot more growth when the Bitcoin price tastes somewhat stable we still have a growth but it's it's not that that peak where when the price is actually moving a lot of so basically it basically would you would you could say that we are growing with the beat Scott yeah that makes sense obviously being kind of like an on-ramp you know as the price grows that reflects more people coming into the system so and you know obviously we've been talking about kind of the way the platform has changed over time and Sebastian no so why did local bitcoins change its CEO at this time previously the CEOs were you know is erm eius the founder and then also I think Nicholas I guess has his brother yeah and so you're kind of like the first I sort of outside CEO so why did that change happen yeah so the background story Jeremy and Nicole estaphan at the company and the Irenaeus was CEO until 2016 or 17 around that time and since then the CEO has been Nikolas now actually already last year Nicholas has been talking that he is more interested kind of division where the Bitcoin market is called a Bitcoin scoring of course the company it has really grown on huge one it's not anymore kind of a start at mode there are kind of lot of position lack of human resource management and whatever and Nicola says that he is more interested to deal with the Bitcoin understand that fund it was actually bit the same story with the arrhenius what he s be saying so they are interested kind of the big picture and not really maintain the human resources and stuff like that that is one thing and of course it's also that when you have pair of fresh eyes of course you get the different view of the company so new person it's easy to know this if there are kind of position that needs to be filled out if they are kind of lacking something if some people are stressed out because they have too much to do if there are some people who don't have enough to do so of course it's easier for somebody new to come and help just fun a Sebastian you recently started as CEO what were you doing before and how did you get into Bitcoin and come to local bitcoins here actually I have a PhD in technology way back in the years I was already interested in Bitcoin already 2012 or something I was mining Bitcoin myself but then I I got more interested after technical career at the business side and I went for the business management and I found it couple of companies and then I have been in the Paris three four years in the management of different companies all support members in difference in his companies but I have been following the bit code and especially the local bitcoins closely because of a bit course is the biggest Bitcoin company in Finland that is and of course early on I was not interested then it was in creating specific companies but now when the regulation is coming finally their companies are turning from the gray area to white area so of course it's it's also easier for for me to pieces Manny's have to come this kind of companies who are going to pay really official companies and what else is there to say I really think that bitcoin is of course itself is really interesting this really it seems to be helping people around the world and local because itself is certainly really interesting company it's it's there how would you say missionary or settler of that of the area so it's really playing in kind of because those people who don't have access yet and Mika what about you how did you come to work at local bitcoins yeah so I think I thought bitcoins first time around here 2012 and in the beginning of it was this on-and-off thing for me I would spend some time studying it and then forgetting it for a while and so on and I did some mining I traded a little made a trading potent that didn't work and got some out coins and so on lost bitcoins to scammers and hackers just by my own mistakes so basic stuff stuff the normal mistakes and the process of learning Bitcoin and figuring out what it actually actually is by expel by experimenting with it but I think it was in the beginning of 2015 that I I like finally decided to get into Bitcoin and Porsche carry a career in a Bitcoin and I started by getting some ATMs and trying to fight locations to ten man it didn't go anywhere but I I made some friends and quite soon after after that I ended up working for localbitcoins Oh an ATM project and well that that bro the company decided like to concentrate to to the main product anti-gm project was was like sat down but III stayed around and started working and helping on the website and coding and mostly maintaining our server and Bitcoin infrastructure is what I've been doing ever since and actually just to go back to earlier when we were kind of discussing the philosophical stance or the political stance and you talked about how they really wanted to do the peer-to-peer trades and so why was it that they didn't think oh you know why don't we just pull this liquidity and create kind of a more typical exchange like what what's the reason for that yeah so the mission actually it was pretty old one this that that bring bit going to every city of the world and of course they really feel why they are in Bitcoin at least of course this is my my view quite a bit cold they might have a different story so take a bit of salt hearing me saying what they wanted but of course the admission was early on to pre Bitcoin the ethnicity of the world and of course if there is an exchange like there are a lot of exchange it really makes sense course the price kind of sell and buy prices close to each other of course the transaction cost are low but then the problem is that there is usually only one way to buy it you buy directly from the exchange and so on and if you go in different areas different markets the problem is with financial inclusion so we already mentioned for example that if you have a natural and oh well actually I have to admit that for example for my parents even in Finland it might be a bit hard for them to kind of buy something from the stock exchanges but then exchanging with the people-to-people is what easier but especially if you go areas like miniature Ella it seems that it's easier for people to trade each other than the call with stock markets and it's probably due to the how not Bitcoin currency but the other currency is involved alright so in a moment we're gonna discuss some other kind of news issues with local bitcoins such as stopping services in Iran and some of the changes to its platform but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible will the world follow France and advocate banning privacy coins will government backed stable

back to my conversation with Sebastian Sontag and Myka Impala so we were just talking about kind of why the founders wanted to do a peer to peer exchanges and I just also wondered do you know from the users perspective like the buyers and the sellers why they choose to do trades this way rather than on an exchange yeah don't really know the reason I don't know if you have done Studies on the reason and probably it differs from the market and from people to people and to be honest I don't know if it's our place to really ask people of course if you want to develop the service forward of course we have to pit understand better why and how the service is being used but we have not really started that too well and of course when I mentioned that the background with the founders of the company and what they had this great system is that it was really early on when they found it they were really kind of really early adopters with Bitcoin and with the company so of course during that time there were no exchanges and they find a position with this peer-to-peer trading and of course because they are and there are a lot of competition between Bitcoin exchanges it doesn't really make sense to try to turn localbitcoins yet another exchange and back in May I had Vera xavier local bitcoins community manager and Elena torneio and chief customer six officer on my other podcast unconfirmed and at that time they told me they were seeing about forty to fifty thousand trades a day and about maybe a half million active users every month what are they usage numbers now yeah they have reinstate stayed pretty much the same I mean like I earlier said that seems like we crow crow with the beats going so I think the Bitcoin price has also stayed pretty much the same yeah same so that's why the growth growth of the of the users is not that much from from the main yeah also it's a short period of time and what's the breakdown between developed and developing countries yeah it is when we were checking that there what currencies people are using for the kind of when they are traded the money we have noticed that it might be a bit more users in developing countries done in there so interesting yeah and when you say that are you are you talking about number of transactions as opposed to the amount of the transactions or just number of users is actually yeah it's it's a volume so not number but really kind of how many bitcoins is exchanged oh well okay well that's actually pretty remarkable because then you know you would expect that in developing countries the amount of Bitcoin is higher per capita simply because they're probably wealthier countries but if in the developing countries they're kind of exceeding the amount you know not not just from a number of transactions perspective but from the BTC amount then that means that there is pretty significant trading on your platform in developing countries yeah and I would guess that the one reason is do these exchanges because of course it's possible and it's easy for to use them in the developed countries but of course if you are in developing country it's a bit bit more hard to use chains that might be one reason right right also I would like to make a point maybe to the earlier question or also that is related to this why we have a user so much in the developing countries is that ma I imagine that in developing countries you don't necessarily have for example a bank account so to speak but you have maybe some some mobile payment method like NP space hour or something like that that you use use on your phone phone and there isn't really exchange is providing like on and off ramps from that mobile payment method so if you want to get out of that mode if you want to get bitcoins you would have to have that bank account that you don't have so you need to use us because we true us you can find someone who is using the same mobile payment method on and thus you have like like this direct roll route to transfer your your value from from that mobile payment metal directly to Bitcoin San and wherever you want to go from there so yeah yeah it's I guess what I is probably very appealing about local bitcoins is that it's pretty I don't want to say customizable to your local geography but what I mean is it's very flexible so you know if you're in one country and you have this particular way where you keep your money then the chain you know instead of being limited to whatever few payout options and exchange offers you can just keep browsing you know this kind of craigslist site to find somebody else who will accept your payment option one other thing I definitely want to urge the listeners to do is in the show notes I'll put a link to the charts of local bitcoins trading broken out by country because it when I looked at this I just it was so fascinating there are certain trends that you see and then there is just like certain outliers where you know whatever was going on with trading in that country was just particular to what was going on in that country and what I mean by that is that the charts basically show trading volume you know by country over time and so there are cotton there are a few trends I noticed where these tend to be stable economies and essentially the trading was all fairly low volume for quite a long time and then a spike in trading at the end of 2017 early 2018 and then a drop back down to fairly low levels kind of and and though for people who want to look this up like Switzerland Norway New Zealand they all kind of exhibited that sort of chart and then there was another type of pattern I noticed amongst some what kind of probably I guess what you would call troubled economies where the volumes just sort of somewhat steadily goes up like for instance Argentina Mexico Venezuela but then you know aside from those trends there are just a whole bunch of charts that really don't look like any of the others and that it was just really fascinating to see that so there's no question to this unless you guys have a comment on on that but I was so fascinated when I was looking at these charts oh and actually the one other comment I wanted to make was that the US has a very very fascinating a chart because it just shows so much more trading than any of the other charts which you know I guess kind of reflects that the u.s. is the biggest market at least for a peer-to-peer trading of Bitcoin but anyway do you guys have any accountants about about these charts well yeah I also encourage people to go and look those charts and and maybe like once a week go and see that what's happening there we go so you can actually get this feeling that you you saw this little spike in some of the charts and then you start wondering at what what is going on in this country and and you google and then you find out it's like you can little bit predict predict and use news from those charts remember any particular news events you know that you noticed via looking at the chart notice that of course I was already interested in local bitcoins and we already had this interview ongoing and so on but there was this Venezuela and of course there were a lot and a lot of news on coin about the miniature Ella and in the same time I would say from the co Indians that hey there's more and more transaction ongoing in Venezuela so at least for me this was really Austin is in moment kind of that it can really help people in that area but I have a question about the Venezuela one which I saw the New York Times reporter who covers crypto tweeted about this because since the chart is denominated in Venezuela and bolivars then obviously the value of that is decreasing so is it does the chart reflect actual increase in trading volume or is it simply reflecting that it takes more Bulevar eyes to buy a Bitcoin than it used to do you know what I'm saying yes but if you if we are still talking about the coin talk - service you can actually switch the the nomination to PTC from the right upper corner of the of this chart so then it's of course gets a little bit difficult than you need to remember what was the price price of the beat going back back then and so on but we do we do provide a public going to dance is using our public API to create these charts so if there are are some ways to improve them you are welcome to try try out and get the data for it for yourself and and try to figure out how to present it more nicely one thing about this of course it's also really interesting what we happy following is that how the Bitcoin itself behaves now there is a turbulence on the world markets and it's really interesting of course there's also news news from the big economic magazines as well that it's interesting that the Bitcoin has thought to act a bit like the cold or kind of this kind of metal that keeps the price and it's really interesting because we have on the history 2017 and even before learn that the Bitcoin is really volatile and whatever and now it starts the work bit more like a gold which is probably not the most volatile asset you can get I'm sorry you're talking about gold yeah yeah well and that is probably the reason why for example in Venezuela so if you kind of want to retain the value of whatever for example salary you are getting and it might be I don't really because that is the problem that we don't really do studies that why Venezuelans are using but it's just my hunch that it might be a race and that it's because there's a hyperinflation so you need some way to kind of retain the value of your salary and so on and Bitcoin might be an easy way to do that yeah I remember I think it was Vera in the last podcast I did she was saying that some of the activity you're seeing from Venezuela is Venezuelans trading bolivars into USD via Bitcoin and then when they need it when they need the money you using Bitcoin to trade it back to bolivars and actually what I did just now I just looked up the BTC volume of trading in Venezuela and it did spiked quite high earlier this year in like March roughly it looks like or maybe February but it's back down now frankly actually so that's kind of interesting I wonder what's going on there oh oh I know it's because the Bitcoin price has gone out the duh okay okay so actually let's uh move on to some other kind of changes that have been going on in your business you know local bitcoins obviously stopped offering services in Iran as well which I mean I don't know that you know to my mind and I think a lot of people who watch the Kryptos fees that sort of feels like there's kind of been a lot of changes at local bitcoins recently with stopping cash services now of stopping services in Iran you know bringing in this new CEO so what would happen with the Iran service and how does that kind of fit into whatever new trajectory local bitcoins is on yeah about well the CEO process didn't really reflected this but a lot of these changes that has happened is there is a push from the regulation of course finally finally but anyway the government's are seeing a Bitcoin and of course they are acting they're pushing the regulation and so on and for example Iran we are using a lot of us services for different purposes and now because the Iran isn't the least they were companies u.s. companies who who we are buying services devastating that we cannot continue doing business if we do a business in Iran and even though of course we didn't use these services in Iran but only that we were giving a service in Iran was enough for them to be afraid and of course now we have to choose between two evils if they continue supporting for example Iran or there is a possibility that we have to shut down shut down the whole service and of course if our mission is to bring Bitcoin to every city of the world putting Iran down it's not really serving that mission but if we have to turn the whole service down that is even worst scheme area so we had to choose between two evils and of course the regulation is happening and also we will we are regulated and we will go under the regulation yeah and it's a new finished regulation that comes into effect in November right yeah and I know on the platform you are now implementing some changes to meet that regulation how does that affect the users yeah so most notably tear artists know your customer and that's why they are they will be eight years we have already announced that they will be tears and of course depending that and here you have to we have to know a bit more about the customer of course one would argue it's only because of the regulation but then again if you read the ruling or reasoning behind this recreation is that the better the company's not the customer better they are able to secure the farms so it kind of kind of makes sense also customer voice but of course it's really annoying for the customers and the history of crypto obviously is littered with exchange hacks local bitcoins is a little bit different but local bikinis did suffer a hack on its forums that enabled the hackers to post some fishing links but when you because you you know manage these wallets for people is that also a form of honeypot is that something where a hacker could obtain a number of bitcoins at once yes so so if you are I don't know I'm not going to go into details about the forum forum thing just saying that I think writing a Bitcoin business is a little bit different than running any other other web services there is money involved loved and thus we we seem to be under constant attacks from hackers so it's been a it's been well how to say interesting in a way and also very stressful as being a target so to say and yes we we are we are custodial service we help some of the bitcoins of our customers and unfortunate unfortunately that's how we need to operate to operate this way and and we but we are let's say taking a really big measures to to make sure that our customers fonts are saying so I guess what I'm asking is it sounds like obviously there's a way where individual people can be compromised but then it sounds like from what you're saying there is also a way where local bitcoins can be compromised and that then exposes all of the users funds is that correct yes you are correct that that the easiest way to to get hacked on local Bitcoin seized is by by making mistake on your yourself like a say user and most of the hacker seems to like target the user stem cells more more than the actual service and to fight that we of course at you get our users and and and we I think we have many many many system in place to to like guts guts those kind of operators and trying to protect our customers but like any other exchange we are we are also holding customer funds and because well yeah and so you're doing that not only during the period of escrow but then also if people keep their bitcoins in their local bitcoins wallet is that what you're saying yes oh okay so I think I didn't fully understand how it was set up all right so one other question I want to ask about was for the Bitcoin cash Fork at that time local bitcoins made this decision to convert that money into bitcoins for the users and then they've simply added it added that money to the users balance and subtracted a little fee for doing that but then it also said it wouldn't it would not in the future support any airdrops or Forks so obviously since that time there's definitely been other Forks and airdrops I don't even know if I could count but if local bitcoins isn't giving that money to its users are you guys just leaving it sitting there unused are you accessing it or what are you doing with that money we are not using it but I mean by the way about this folks of course sorry being a CEO here but folks they have been actually since then with Conchas oh oh sorry you know what I was thinking of was the the further Bitcoin cash fork so you're right if it was converted then that's no longer because it was just beacon Casper's if I understood correctly it was excised Bitcoin for the users exactly right you're right right but so what so what happens to you know for instance like Bitcoin gold or something which happened afterward well III think we have made it green that we don't we don't this was a one-time thing that we decided to like credit the users for for money from the for and we don't plan on doing it in the future and we haven't done it after that and it's yeah I think there's no more to say about it okay but you're also not accessing the fund so they're just sort of sitting there yeah we are not accessing the phone see it's easy to check if you don't believe me but yeah okay yeah and people can't with rather them themselves I guess so we'll logo bitcoins just always stay with Bitcoin or would you ever consider adding any of the other crypto assets you know if I know recall correctly we are supporting some what is their payment method we actually support him of course not with escrow but as a payment method we are supporting something but the stance is at the moment that the Bitcoin is that leading the cryptocurrency pack and that's why we are also using it because of course supporting other cryptocurrencies cost for us and our mission is being these new markets which is they are probably not speculating on group those estimates they are using it for other purposes so at least the current stance is that we stay with Bitcoin and Sebastian as the new CEO what plans do you have for local bitcoins yeah so of course because our mission is to provide bitcoins trading for ethnicity of the world every people on the planet and like we have actually stayed it is a spiritually interesting interview because we have been discussing that we really need to understand the needs of the people who are using bitcoins and it really varies on different markets and of course this is kind of studying what are the needs for different customer different markets different people for bitcoins and then with surf those so that the more people on the world can access and trade bitcoins alright and I also wanted to ask about how you guys are based in Helsinki what is the Bitcoin or overall crypto scene what it what is that like in Finland well I would point out one thing that seems general people seems to forget is that the second developer on Bitcoin after Satoshi or with Satoshi was was going using the hundred series which is also known as mark Tamala me who is from from Finland in Helsinki multi mom it doesn't seem to be active in scene anymore but as far as I know he no he still owns the Bitcoin dot-org and Bitcoin talk or domains and as far as I know I know they were from 2012-2013 they were active Bitcoin meetups in in Helsinki and they are still active once in month I think we have a Bitcoin meetup here so and there are people there so so we are a small country and but we've we've been in the Bitcoin for a long time I think and if you have been interested in VidCon
