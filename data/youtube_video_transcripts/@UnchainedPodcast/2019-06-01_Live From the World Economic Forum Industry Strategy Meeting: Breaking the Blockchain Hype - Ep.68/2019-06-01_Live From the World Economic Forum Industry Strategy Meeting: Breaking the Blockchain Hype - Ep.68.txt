hi everyone welcome to unchain your no-hype resource for all Finn's crypto I'm your host Laura today I'm releasing a live recording from a panel at the World Economic Forum industry strategy meeting the speakers include Shiu Fischetti senior director of the corporate strategy group of SA P Adam Ludwin CEO of chain who is a previous guest on my show brian behlendorf executive director of hyper ledger at olympics foundation and sheila warren project head of the blockchain and distributed ledger technology group at the world economic forum if you work in private blockchains or interested in how governments and corporations you know and love might use them this talk is chock-full of information on topics like these and more in this discussion we dive into the pros and cons of using long chains for elections as you might have seen on Twitter this topic is quite a lightning rod which types of problems are best suited to be solved by plot chain and what types of identity related data might be safe to put on a blockchain it's a great discussion with lots of insight so please enjoy the show blockchain warehouse is an international blockchain accelerator offering a wide range of token sail advisory services to promising blockchain based ventures with the leading adviser Network bcw is at the forefront of building landscape changing blockchain companies and hosting successful token sales with more than 20 million dollars raised so far hello everyone welcome to our panel breaking the blockchain hype my name is Laura Shen and I am the host of a of a couple of podcasts on crypto and blockchain one is called Unchained and the other is called unconfirmed right retrieve you check them out we're gonna be discussing blockchain and the hype around it and also when it makes sense to use a blockchain and when it doesn't in recent years you've probably heard all the hype around blockchain people are very excited about it it's being talked about as a way to solve problems ranging from financial and equality YouTube tracking goods in the supply chain and yet here we are we haven't seen a ton of actual products that are a lie using 14 technologies so we're gonna be talking about when when it is appropriate to use a block sheet and enterprise and how you figure that out and to discuss this issue we have a spectacular set of panelists if to my left here is Shwetha shetty who is the senior director at sa P so her left is Adam Ludwin CEO of chain and we've got brian behlendorf the executive director of the hyper ledger foundation and finally at the end Sheila Warren who's the project head of blockchain and distributed ledger technology at the World Economic Forum so a couple of quick notes first of all we're gonna be releasing a recording of this on my longer podcast unchained so for that reason I urge all the panelists to do as I'm doing and speak directly into the mic and I also would urge you all when you ask your questions to make sure to speak into the mic so my podcast listeners can hear your questions without further ado let's start with an overview of the way block chains can be used what are your guys's most or what are you most excited about when it comes to different applications of blockchain I think I'll go first because I love the smarter people tackle though use cases once I have run through my list but I think as I say P the use cases that we see early benefits from the low-hanging fruit of you may say a blockchain would be use cases around supply chain or either tracking trees ensuring the provenance of your goods trade finance is another area which i think is ripe for disruption using blockchain and personally I'm super excited about you know what governments in the developing world are doing with blockchain for example a Land Registry where all of a sudden a lot of developing countries are you can potentially put the you the ownership of land onto the block chain and make transactions a lot easier that way I'll go next I mean I think I think it's helpful to start by understanding having a kind of common understanding of what the what blocks technology is because I'm sure many of us see headlines about icos or coins and for us for some of us that might characterize this term blockchain but it's really this underlying technology that is this novel break from what was possible before which is a technology that's a little bit of a database it's a little bit of a network it's but what it's really for is bringing together a consortium of participants sometimes a consortium as large as the whole wide internet sometimes as small is simply four or five organizations that need a common system and what it does is establishes a common ground truth without needing somebody at the center to play God and that's useful in almost any scenario where you have multiple parties who don't necessarily you know distrust each other entirely they trust each other enough to do business with each other but they need some way of being able to verify the things that they trust right some way to agree here's a transaction two parties did and and and that becomes now a part of a long-term record right here's a statement that was made by one party about another and now everyone remembers that so it gives us this this history of what happened this kind of immutable ledger obviously it's more immutable the more participants are on it and Metcalfe's law still applies which is the value of these networks is still greater the more participants are on it and so it turns out there's a bunch of use cases that today signify for us and low trust environments where we need to have that history of transactions in supply chain that's a pretty obvious thing whether we're tracking food now and where that's entered the system to try to make sure that if lettuce goes bad that we can try to isolate where it went bad and and and do a recall on just those products rather than all lettuce in the entire food chain as has happened recently and cost that industry billions of dollars whether it's diamonds why and where they've come out of the ground to make sure you're not buying diamonds mined by slave labor or used in gun purchases weapons purchase is that sort of thing or fish bought caught by fish quotas but it turns out there's lots of other transaction types as well I you know settlements between financial organizations those sorts of things or even just the establishment of common directories health care for example there are applications of this to keeping track of who's credentialed to serve as a surgeon or as an OP you know any type of like medical profession and when they move from one state to another today it often can take weeks for a doctor properly credentialed to earn the right to be able to practice weeks or months when really that should be a simple look up into a common shared directory so there are live projects now and all of those sectors live meaning either late stage pilot or production and these are all kind of a world away from the cryptocurrency use cases we all know about but but are starting to provide some value and hinting at potentially applicability to to every sector out there and I'll briefly add I think that there is room for engaging with blogs and blogs and deployment where we're already seeing movement from a sector itself towards decentralization of digitization so there are Peregrine's for example we're seeing movement towards a centralized power grids in places where either there is no grid or even places where there is a grid the micro grids becoming something of great interest as more and more consumers have in their home solar panels you know etc so there are new economic models being created in that industry already and blockchain can support those models in some cases similarly digitization where you have a big paper trail so in shipping logistics for example where there's already a movement Pro digitization in certain parts of the supply chain blockchain can help accelerate and amplify that too so I don't know I mean we can keep talking about some of the different use cases that we're excited about but I'd actually like to shift it to different applications that you guys are actually working on and I actually think Adam you might be the perfect person to say take that baton sure I'll start by briefly answering the prior question around use cases of blockchain technology our point of view is that a blockchain is primarily a mechanism for creating digital bearer instruments our work at chain has primarily been focused around the new asset classes emerging around crypto assets as well as tokenizing existing assets like securities currencies so that they can also be in this internet native digital medium of a token and we haven't seen much traction outside of that scope of financial assets we haven't seen much traction in industry around you know data supply chain identity and Beyond kind of initial explorations yet so so far we skew a little more closely to kind of the origins of the technology which relate to you know new financial instruments new financial mediums pioneered of course by Bitcoin so we're chain has been working is with customers in the financial industry like these Nasdaq and looking at projects where they want to stand up new networks or new services but instead of using traditional market structure where you have an organization in the center with a database that's tracking balances and tracking histories for everyone participating with that service instead to have more of an open architecture where different partners can participate and view access read and write to that ledger and thereby sort of distributing more of the trust to the edges of the part to the participants then you would see with a more traditional architecture so to be even more explicit about it payments securities issuance and transfer new types of mobile banking that's where we've found the most kind of fit between the technology which is really a database for value in our minds and industry and who else wants to jump in with how their company is using blockchain now I can talk about something that we are doing and it's in the pharmaceutical space well now serialization is something that is mandated by the FDA that is pretty much every SKU needs to have a unique number and drug this should help drug companies theoretically and you know recall drugs at the right point in time and ensure that you can verify the or ten or tenth a city or of any medicine that anywhere in the value chain now that's that's great in theory but if you actually think of in practice the number of hands that that medicines change over the entire value chain is a lot and need to have all of these people enter their data into a central system is challenging and it's challenging because all of them use different databases in the back end some of them don't even use databases right depending on which part of the world you are dispensing drugs in so what we have done is we've done we started we and we tackled a very small use case which is ability to sell drugs that have been returned now if you look at the economics of it one to two percent of the drugs that are returned can be resold they're all you know within the expo you know the right you know is right length of time from the expiration rate etc but you cannot sell it at you know it's more challenging to sell them at this point in time because you cannot prove the authenticity of this drug actually being what you manufactured so we said let's tackle this use case we did a pilot with Merck in ameri Salzburg in the pilot went well and at this point in time we have 15 other pharmaceutical companies that are doing a more advanced proof you know proof of concept or pilot around this so but it's still at the pilot stage I will not say it's production and took take it from pilot to production is going to be not a technological question in my opinion it's going to be more of a governance you know are these competitors ready to work with each other sort of a question yeah so let's talk about kinds of that or kind of the questions that you ask yourself when you're deciding what use case is to tackle here we've laid out kind of a whole bunch of different ones and I'm sure you know even in my intro I also named some additional ones but Adam mentioned that you know payments securities issuance those are kinds of ones that they realized my way more for them and shweta is talking about pharmaceuticals in combating counter in that area so amongst all the other things that everybody is claiming blockchain will sell how did you come up with those as the areas that you wanted to tackle and Brian and Sheila I'm sure also have it she like definitely no shut up this whole like little flow chart that she created that was pretty awesome but why don't we just discuss this because I think this is like where a lot of people get stuck sure and I can go a little bit more into that so we did develop a toolkit we call it blockchain beyond the hype and it came out at the end of April and it's a very it's designed to give a quick initial assessment of whether or not blockchain is appropriate to the problem at hand blockchain of the technology and it is not a solution to everything and we think it's very important to recognize it it is more applicable to certain kinds of problem spaces than to others so to answer your question more directly you know we tend to focus on the removal of an intermediary or a broker so is that something that you're trying to accomplish is there a reason that you want to decentralize or disintermediate what you're doing we also look at things like is there a benefit to having an immutable record a transaction record or it was actually something you don't want I think it's interesting to just briefly note with the challenges of gdpr and the right to be forgotten that gdpr is intended to provide to citizens of the EU what does that mean for the creation of an immutable record in terms of data since they're interesting kinds of policy regulation questions that come into play and you have to be very mindful of your regulatory environment when you think about the creation of an immutable record and what that means who should have access to that record is it important that multiple parties have a single source of truth it may be that that's not the case and in many cases we find that when you really push on a particular potential use case you wind up realizing that the permanence is really immutability but the permanence is not desirable for some reason or another or that you really wind up with a benefit to having centralization that there is such an obvious authority figure on the transaction record that you're trying to create as an example that it might be worthwhile to explore other options that already exist rather than moving immediately or directly the blockchain that being said we're certainly quite often mystic about the use of blocking particular as a technology evolves it's still a quite an early-stage technology but as it involves these are all known problems and there are safe brilliant minds and many of them working on the protocol layer to solve some of these problems to increase speed to increase throughput now all these kinds of things are are things that are being focused on by the technologists in the space I think it's important to add there's no use case for blockchain technology for which somebody couldn't come back and say well couldn't you just do that as a centralized system wouldn't it innit and I don't think anybody credibly could argue that it wouldn't be faster it wouldn't be cheaper it wouldn't be i-i-i-i've more flexible even because we know how to build big centralized systems we know how to build an AWS or a Twitter or a Google search engine we have them already right it's a technology that solves not a technical problem but a political problem which is there's a reason why there's not a Bitcoin calm keeping everybody's balance is straight because then the question of who runs that site how corruptible would it be etc becomes a big challenge and it might be okay to do that in a social networking site right it's definitely not okay when we're talking about international balances or areas where where parties don't have that all degree of trust in one central entity it's very similar to as the internet launched we didn't have secure email we didn't have secure eight web web transactions because we thought well the people carrying our packets for us they're not going to sniff and look at what's inside those packets right well it turned out they do so now we need encryption between endpoints and it's one reason why markets now realize they need to avoid centralizing their their their systems on and the trust that they have in one entity can we talk a bit about elections because this is something Brian and I actually talk about a lot and we both are a little skeptical of the election use case but I think and I'm just thinking for you at this moment but we both acknowledge that there are certain aspects of elections to which blockchain is quite suited and others where it probably isn't suited I'm just going to tu up because I know so and I don't want to steal too much direction or thunder but I so there and there's this there is a lot of perhaps irrational exuberance around the idea of well if elections could just be digital if we could vote by phone maybe we wouldn't have what we had here in California two days ago which is only 20% of population actually bothering to participate in a fairly major election right and I it's well intended and it's you know driven or this idea we're always on our phones shouldn't we just be able to vote from that but for lots of good reasons we know that there are there's our challenge is to actually getting digital voting to work and blockchain is not magic pixie dust that suddenly makes that a trustworthy process but the two parts of the election system that would benefit from having a distributed ledger involved a mostly public distributed ledger would be in voter registration making sure everyone's registered to vote and where they are and the status of that registration if it's been withdrawn or whatever and that's that's the same database that you could see at home as you would see when you show up to the polling place and then at the tail end of the election when you're adding up the results from each polling place being able to do that quickly but also verifiably both those steps I think would help ensure the integrity and auditability of elections to a degree we even don't have today and I would give us a it allow us to actually get to answers more quickly as to who won the mayoral race in San Francisco those sorts of things but it would help anything ensure that that public confidence in the in the voting system which today people proxy through their governments you know it you know here in California we trust the the state to run a competent election in Oregon they trust them so much they do all mail-in ballots which is remarkable right but you don't you can't take that degree of trust in central institutions for granted in many other countries of the world and hopefully that never happens here yeah I actually have had this topic come up a couple of times in some of my recent podcasts and you see this kind of polarized view of blockchain for election purposes in the two pockets I'll mention you so the first one was and these are both on my shorter podcast call to unconfirmed what one of them was with to Micah Tillman of the blockchain trust accelerator and the New America Foundation and he worked with a group of different organizations to do a pilot of election of blockchain based voting in I guess it was I think normally it's like it's recently like military personnel you know what's Virginia that don't typically have access to voting at all because of the way they're deployed or something like that I don't remember the circumstances but it was some where this was a population that when they're you know deployed in this particular way then they can cannot vote at all and he talked about you know the promise of what they saw with using this pile and how they also I think had like a paper component as well and on Twitter just in the last couple of days I saw that somebody had caught wind of this and had just written like you know block gene based voting know just know like don't do dangerous things with this technology something like that and Vitaly booter and of aetherium even weighed in and said what's interesting is you know you have kind of that one side that feels like this can be used for that and then you have this other side that is concerned about it and someone who expounded on that concern in my podcast and confirmed with Alex Gladstein of the human rights foundation I happen to be at the Oslo Freedom Forum last week and he has been thinking a lot of really interesting thoughts around how blocking technology can be used both for good and for evil when it comes to human rights and so he talked about how if you develop a blockchain based election system but it's like you know in a place like Russia or something where there is a dictator then you know this idea that block team kind of creates an element of trust for you just goes out the window because then it's obviously very easily manipulated so and yeah and I actually I like the distinction in those two cases because I actually am a fan of the west virginia military case i think what you're doing there is providing access to a group of voters who are legitimate voters it's very easy to ascertain that they are legitimate voters who don't otherwise have access to the voting system so you were basically enhancing democracy in that sense i think is a legitimate claim to be made but i think that as a general proposition if he's very careful we're at a time with this technology what any successful use case runs the risk of being scaled the situations where it's not appropriate and what blockchain cannot solve or any technology really is the coercion problem she may be able to prove that i using my biometrics voted it was me and i did vote for a certain candidate that's all verifiable and true right you could do that but what you don't see is the context around me in which there is the run risk of the soldiers running through my village and all these kinds of coercive elements that happen not just in dictatorships but actually happen to ordinary people and happen even the united states photo coercion is a real thing it's documented so so if you can't get around that how do you trust what you're actually seeing and I think that these are the policy kinds of questions we're focusing on at the center how do you ensure that blockchain is not just cementing a pre-existing problem providing accountability or providing this sort of new form of trust where you really shouldn't have trust so that's because that's something that we think about a lot in our work blockchain warehouse is an international blockchain accelerator offering a wide range of token sail advisory services to promising blockchain based ventures with access to heavyweight technology leaders the accelerator is heavily involved in crafting the blockchain technology token sale and regulatory landscape blockchain warehouse will launch the first ever crypto shark tank in June this week's episode features block 66 an innovative blockchain mortgage platform that streamlines and organizes the facilitation of residential and commercial financing block 66 reduces the amount of time persons involved and money that it takes to complete a full mortgage cycle previously real estate transactions on the blockchain required 100% funding upfront but that's a thing of the past with block 66 find out more at WWDC I just to bring this back to enterprise let's kind of shift a little bit more back in that direction Adam did you want to answer this question around how you determine whether or not to apply on blockchain or or a regular database yeah so I think it's like really important to if you're sitting in a company thinking about this technology to be just like incredibly honest with the analysis and start by asking are what we are we really saying we just want modern software and we want to do more of a traditional like transformation project and whether it's voting or supply chain or any of the cases that we've discussed so far things in healthcare feels like oftentimes what the leadership of a company is actually asking for is for the thing to just work well and to function like a modern piece of technology with like a good mobile experience and a good online experience and and I think sometimes that gets conflated with blockchain unnecessarily and I think in most of the cases that we've seen a traditional solution is called for because as Brian pointed out there isn't a market politics trust problem there's a we need a better modern solution problem so I think most of the time you should be ruling blockchain out and it's it's a very unique tool when there's a market failure and you need a different trust model between participants and even then it's still very early days for the technology it's still very much a grand experiment and a sort of an experiment and a new type of infrastructure and a new type of architecture and it's good to just keep that in mind so that you don't sit in the audience and have FOMO that if you're a CIO you're not like doing enough in blockchain so as I say that's how that would be my frame I don't know if this gets into kind of two proprietary or private information but I'm sure you guys have so many companies that come to you saying hey a chain can you create some solution for us so how do you choose like which customers you're gonna work with or rather really on the flip side how do you decide which ones you're not going to yeah there's a very easy test if in the first meeting the customer says we want to do something with blockchain then I don't work with them okay let's go to a more Oh more gray area what are some ones that you kind of really struggle with a little bit where you thought oh this might work and then ultimately decided that's you know just on the other side of the line just to be clear about why I said that I think that the kinds of customers the types of projects we want to take on are ones in which it's an unachievable outcome without a blockchain versus somebody thinks this technology is hot and they want to like make sure their company is like you know like Long Island blockchain or something yeah right or it's like TT yeah it's like you know the other thing that we see a lot I hope this doesn't cut too close to home here but is there are a lot of I call Silicon Valley safaris that happen where you know management team from a from another country or another part of the the US comes out to Silicon Valley in a very nice air-conditioned luxury bus and they create a schedule and they go to all of the companies that are like we're being written about in The Economist over the last three months basically the blockchain companies the AI companies you know whatever and they show up and then they say like we want to do something with blockchain so we do we take a lot of those because part of being on the vanguard of new technology is educating the industry about what it is and why it's interesting and so we like to do those meetings but they don't tend to become customers because their frame of mind is not oh we have a specific thing we're trying to solve it's more interest in learning about is there something here so that's that's why I said if the opening statement is we want to do something with blockchain it's usually it's usually downhill from there if any of you are gonna do one of these bus tours let me join as a reporter I'll make something fun out of it I promise yeah and feel free to come to chain so what we found to be most effective is because we're closest to the technology we have a set of hypotheses about where it's going to apply and then we're much more outbound so our relationship with Nasdaq with visa with Citi we're all outbound where we went to them and said we think there's a massive opportunity around international payments because of the trust model required and correspondent banking and you're best positioned as visa to do something about it let's have a conversation and that has led to the most productive the most productive outcome so I would say be open-minded about hearing from startups that approach you because oftentimes they're closest to the state-of-the-art and they might have something of value to propose so that's that's been the most productive path for us you know I find that interesting because those companies have you know pretty entrenched processes so like what was your pitch and how did you convince them to especially at the time that you did it was 2015 which it definitely was a Fronteras from 2018 where we are now where everybody is experimenting in this 2015 definitely was you know kind of the Bitcoin is criminal money days and it was long before even this blockchain not Bitcoin mantra became part of the part of the blockchain hype that were we're discussing so how did you make that pitch and convince them it wasn't easy it actually tended to start with me educating or our team educating a set of executives about Bitcoin in fact the curiosity around Bitcoin was very real in 2015 2014 even and still today so that tended to be the way that doors were opened and then it became a conversation about now that you understand the model that is Bitcoin let's think about sort of a similar architecture but instead of around a new currency around existing currencies around existing assets and that tended to be the way the conversations became meaningful and interesting and since you brought up blockchain not Bitcoin that was also the kind of dominant narrative at Davos this year right was was as someone that works in the space like usually that was the nature of the dialogue with folks that I met at the event and I encouraged people there and I'll encourage people here to not be trapped by that dichotomy to not get into the one is better than the other blockchain is better than Bitcoin bitcoin is better than watching they're two incredibly different arenas still what I think blockchain quote-unquote I think primarily about a context where you have existing financial assets and you're trying to put them into a new type of market infrastructure and and that's not really competitive with Bitcoin or other crypto assets those other crypto assets are creating an alternative system an alternative set of software services that have a totally different arc and possible future to them and I think it actually boohoo's folks not to view them as one threads the other to understand them on their own terms because there are going to be contacts where the enterprise especially financial institutions will want to participate in the crypto asset world and you see this increasingly at Nasdaq at ice which is also New York Stock Exchange at fidelity and other asset managers where their clients are now showing up and saying we want exposure to this new asset class can you help us because we don't want to use a start-up to manage or trade and so now the issue is sort of being forced and for the folks that were not dismissive of crypto currencies but we're investigating them alongside alongside other blockchain solutions they've been best positioned to build those next sort those next generation of services to sort of ride the wave around that asset class so I wouldn't I wouldn't again rule out that coin or rule out crypto assets if you're in more of a traditional Enterprise role because I think they're here to stay yeah let's um let's actually also shift a little bit toward more questions that are a little bit more detailed around when you use the blockchain and I was just wondering if there's a difference about when you use the blockchain in a b2b context versus b2c or if there's a different way to think about it or if it's it's the same yeah I think predominantly the value that's gonna be realized in the next five years will be in a b2b setting rather than b2c I mean with cryptocurrencies asides I think that is very much a consumer driven kind of thing even with the institutional interest and it now is predominantly about serving their clients so I considers more C rather than B a lot of the stories will be about you know here's a set of banks that now have a settlement network between them here's a set of participants in a supply chain that now have a provenance tracking system between them and in many cases ROI will be very elusive right it's it won't be easy to measure cost savings right you'll have flashes of this if Maersk is able to say hey we've cut the cost of the paperwork and delay and getting a container from Shanghai to Los Angeles by 30% that's great there'll be little bits of that but it'll be hard to systematically I think say you know the that the GDP generated by or cost savings by this usage is a number of billions in the same way that was hard to make that case for the web for the internet when I so much that that impact was implicit or kind of ephemeral in a way but I think I think a lot of it be there where I think the next wave will hit the b2c space though thanks to blockchain technology we'll be around identity I think with distributed Ledger's with some of these underlying tools we now have the ability to get closer to what there's a second holding world called self sovereign identity that builds upon blockchain technology in some meaningful ways and this is a way to get out of the trap of login with Facebook log in with Twitter and you get closer to something that acts a little bit more like the IDS in your wallet like the Diploma you have on your wall like the medical records that in theory you should be able to take around from institution institution and blockchain technology there's a bunch of projects out there that are focused on using that to invert the relationship between consumer and identity provider and put much more power and agency kind of very much following along the GDP our kind of view of how the world should work and and that gets a lot of us really excited in the space I think it Enterprise you're definitely gonna agree with that completely you're gonna see a primarily b2b for at least a short term medium term but I do think there are some interesting government use cases that really are b2c in a sense of government working with citizens so everything around travel and passports an identity is of one of the things into identity space but also government records land titling some of the things which I mentioned earlier I think are interesting use cases as well that we're starting to see more engagement with on the part of governments and I actually also wanted to ask about you know when you put a data into a blockchain it's immutable as they like to say and I just wondered how do you ensure the integrity of that data you mean entering data into the blockchain integrity at that point in time like I just want to frame this actually a little bit more which is that obviously as a journalist I get pitched a ton of startups and projects and one time somebody pitched me their new startup which was going to be some kind of like time stamping sort of like a notary and I think they were I don't know if they use the word notary but it was something like you know we're gonna put this data in the blockchain and I said oh how do you prevent false data from entering the blockchain the guy literally did not have an answer for me and I was just amazed that they hadn't thought of this it was my first question for him and it was something you know then I said well you could put like a spam email in there and he was like well yes then we would prove that the existence of that that that spam email existed at that moment in time and I was like okay this is not useful to it well I didn't think it was so so how do you ensure the integrity of the data I mean I think you've hit the nail on the head this is like the printing of the perennial problems you know so I often joke that we talk about garbage in garbage out problems and technology and this is really garbage and garbage and forever you know kind of problems so if you haven't you know sanitized and done data hygiene on your database it's a big issue we're looking at a policy project on anti-corruption work and one of the challenges and tensions and blockchain is how do you preserve some measure of its pseudonymous systems how do you preserve some measure of privacy and security to an individual for example is logging a complaint of some kinds right against a system whether that's logging a harassment complaint against a manager or whatever at a company or whether it's logging a corruption complaint against a public official for example how do you balance that with this troll that bought spam problem where if you do enable someone to anonymously and we sleep some internet all the time you enable people to anonymously comment on something what they say you know there's a lot of latitude and how accurate that really is and the ability for others to glom on to that even in an automated fashion and kind of just fill your database with junk data so it's it's a I don't have a great answer to it I think it is a perennial problem and I think it's one of the reasons that we remain cautious about that use of block chains if you if you aren't confident that you have a an authoritative source of truth that the record you're creating is an accurate record not to mention a meaningful record right which i think is also important something we gloss over in my opinion too much and if you can't do that then this is perhaps it can even be a dangerous technology frankly if that's not a solved problem believe just to add to that I do believe that with blockchain it's a little easier for you to ensure data integrity for example it's if my identity is on the blockchain and I'm not sharing every piece of information with every single person around it's a little less easy for someone to steal my identity and if you link data that's entered to a valid user at that point in time your you can be more the probability of data being entered by the right individual is higher then it would be you know since you cannot steal identity that easily on top of that what we do a lot of thing a lot of times in the supply chain use cases is you use IOT right at any point in time to link the actual physical with digital so that's another way we are trying to make sure that data in the blockchain is more accurate of course you can go and tamper each single piece of IOT device but that would be challenging given you know you can set other things around it an example that would be so a boat shows up at Port there with a load of tuna that it claims that it caught in this one region at this one time that would put it within the quotas for a certain country right and yet you have data from sensors tamper proof sensors on the boat even on the nets there are companies that sell tamper proof GPS sensing and video sensing sensors for nets as well as satellite data data from sensors on buoys out in the in the water all of that data could be writing to the ledger signed by the or entities that you know built these sensors right and use to either enhance the integrity of the claim that this boat is making that it caught this fish at this place at this time or to refute it right and this is data that could feed auditing processes could feed other types of checks and balances perhaps even feed a whistleblowing or a you know investigative journalist kind of a framework that would give us a greater in the sense of integrity to claims that are being made about these types of things so in a minute we're going to turn to questions so if you have a question feel free to get it ready but we're gonna ask one last question before we got to here questions which is I wanted to go back to digital identity and what we talked about you know putting them on a blockchain and giving power back to people over their data but how do you make it secure and then also how does this square with a business with businesses need to comply with regulations so I'll chime in I don't really understand by identity on a blockchain candidly I'll talk about what identity means in the context of Bitcoin as a simple example so if you don't use a third party service like a wallet provider or in exchange and you want to interact directly with the Bitcoin network it operates a lot like a safe deposit box system in a bank where there's a box with a number on it and you have a key that corresponds to that box and to say you own Bitcoin or have Bitcoin is very similar to saying you own or have whatever is in the box in your safe deposit box so the thing you actually control is that key so on your laptop would be a private digital cryptographic key that allows you and gives you the sole right to access a digital address or box on the network and move those funds to someone else and so the question of identity is like is your identity that number on the box kind of but only if you explicitly make that link and publish that link somewhere and say you know my name is Adam and my address on the Bitcoin network is XYZ but even then who's to say that that's true you would need to have some third party validate or verify that you made that claim and then you in fact did move some Bitcoin out of that address and they saw that happen and so in a way there's a piece of the identity or there's an authentication mechanism inherent in how a blockchain operates but when we think about identity in the in the in a general sense of like your driver's license your passport your real human state and its relation to some some service it's not quite there and I don't think it's a great idea to put like your name social security number driver's license number address phone you know mother's maiden name into a blockchain record because most of the time that data is transparent shared distributed and immutable so it's not a great fit in my mind for like identity data per se and as a slight tangent GDP R is also interesting with respect to these issues because the requirement to be able to remove data delete move transfer etc doesn't really square with how a blockchain functionally operates so you actually you actually can't comply with GD P R on traditional public blockchain networks I read a great opinion piece saying that basically the legislation was created before block chains existed and it was predicated on this model that a lot of people are thing is probably going to so privacy identity GDP are all this it's not at all clear how it all makes sense at the end of the day how it shakes out and I'm sure there are like technical solutions where like our blockchain technology allows you to you know remove records or change things etc but then you start to get into like well then why are using a blockchain and so it's it's all I guess what I would say with protect identity is it seems all very early days and it's not really clear yet if it's a good solution to solving this perennial problem of how we how we pair our real identities in a digital context okay one last comment from Brian and then we'll take questions and we should get together for lunch sometime because I'll walk you through it and happy do that for anyone else as well because it is much longer than a quick common concise but the system of self sovereign identity it says in the use of that with block blocks means say don't use the ledger to store any PII right you may use it to store encrypted you probably don't even use the pastori encrypted personal information by the way you might use the DES store metadata and you probably use it to store public keys right and and probably as well signatures on relevant documents and and finally use it as a way to record who have I granted consent to to be able to access information about me and and this is why you want to use a ledger for this the ability to withdraw consent in the future right so as an auditing tool is a tracking tool to keep track of where that data might lie off chain all right and and ways to manage that permissioning that's where there's some unique properties to it and and happy to walk through that actually since we have plenty of time just one more thing to build on that if you don't mind go ahead okay I don't see any burning questions yet so when we've done identity like identity projects and specifically around voting where we tend to end up is creating an account for someone that is verified in a more traditional way it could be in person it could be through another auth system and then essentially loading tokens into that account that are almost like tickets so before a vote would happen you would put a bunch of tickets into that user account that are like Laura Shin tickets right so we know who you are and we've generated these tickets and now they're now in your account we've issued them into your account and then when you go vote what you're actually doing is just like moving a Laura Shin ticket into an account for a candidate and so that's just way to think about kind of identity as it relates to you know sort of a blockchain or a token model and and we at our office that chain next time you come by you should check it out we have this heirloom from the World's Fair in San Francisco a hundred odd years ago that is exactly that the paper version so it's a booklet where they took your photo and they didn't print it into this booklet and they put all your identity into like the first page and then behind the first page when you flip it open are like a hundred tickets and so every day they assumed you would want to come to the World Fair like a hundred times because the only thing to do back then so you would show up and you would show them the booklet with your face attached to this book and then they would open it and tear off a ticket and then you'd go in so you know in a lot of ways these old bearer instruments are the best analogues to think about how a digital bear instrument would function and so anyway that's how we think about identity I love that I think that such a great analogy and such an interesting story and so let's turn to questions we've got a couple of mics floating around just raise your hand I guess we've got one there hi there this might be a not not Bitcoin blockchain question but I was just wondering about power consumption if there's you know a lot of people have made a lot about comparing the amount of energy bitcoin is using to Denmark I was just looking it up it looks closer to Pakistan now I was wondering if that's at a problem inherent to Bitcoin or if that's something that we're gonna have to worry about is blockchain is used more and more I can take that one so I think it's more for let's say a public blockchain where pretty much anybody can be on the blockchain and in order to for one party to not manipulate be able to game the system each person needs to do a very complex computational solve a computational problem and only then can they do they get the right to then order things on the blockchain and I don't think Private Networks suffer from this this particular inefficiency there is the question of data the same data being replicated across multiple different nodes that is an inefficiency that a lot of private networks have but not the one that you're talking about in terms of power consumption proof-of-work was a scientifically and algorithmically really fascinating kind of innovation it something it predated Bitcoin by a little bit it's when they've been floating around in cryptography circles for a while as a way initially proposed as a way to fight email spam but I think we're going to recognize that this is a temporary blip the the many of the public cryptocurrency communities are already looking past it to things that are much more energy efficient like a proof of stake or other types of delegated authority mainly they try to ensure that there's a way to have this publicly the system publicly operate without attempts at DDoS or spam and so I've started to use the metaphor it'll be kind of like mercury mining of gold in the middle of the 19th century where you know if you were a scientist the idea of using you know elemental gold well I'm sorry mercury Quicksilver right to separate out elemental gold from gold was nothing short of alchemy and yet now we're still paying the price and Superfund sites and the Sierras for the use of that - extracting gold from those mountains and and it was a terrible legacy that was left behind I am highly confident most of the cryptocurrency communities will move away from it and I think those who don't will probably see assets and interest in those currencies move away from from those currencies ok great we've got another question up front what the users of blockchain you've talked about different things election is a very interesting one have people thought about moving the passports and taking the the stuff in terms of fake passports to placate passports moving the visa regime on on completely on blockchain yes people here in u.s. probably don't have that problem but people coming from some other emerging third world countries who have to give their passports for a week 10 days 15 days to get visa make their travel pieces around it but passport has an identity proof on blockchain which the government's across the world I know it's it's it's a pretty difficult thing but is that something any talk around that or is that something people have thought about yeah I can take that one so so I will start by saying I don't I'm not convinced there is a problem or youth space that someone has not talked about so the answer is always yes if the question is has anyone talked about or engage in this yes yes they absolutely have and are at the moment but in this particular one I think it's a really interesting use case there is a project out of our Geneva out of our headquarters that the forum is looking at called known traveler where they're working with Canada thinking about exactly this problem like how can you more efficiently and more authentically authenticate people's identity using in this kind of system of travel so I think there are well just one thing is I wanted to comment before and then I kind of move to questions but I think it's an important distinction to draw between identity and credentialing I actually think that there was a really strong use case for credentialing on the blockchain so a credential is when you basically as a person I can prove I have a medical license I can prove that I have a passport I can prove I'm a citizen of a country I can I can prove various things about my identity that are really moral on lines of credentialing so credentialing you do have that central authority that is providing the veracity of the claim right so my alma mater and Harvard is going to be able to verify that I have a Harvard degree for example right and if you can do that there are efficiencies to be realized there it's not my favorite use case for a variety of reasons most of which is because I feel like the social impact isn't necessarily high and a lot of the pilots that are we're seeing but I do feel like there's promise there and it's important to distinguish I think those two things yeah um if you have more questions on this I actually have a few podcasts that went into this one of them was with Kathryn Hahn formerly of the Department of Justice and she and I did an event much like this actually at the Commonwealth Club and because she worked in government for so long she has pretty strong opinions about how blockchain technology can be used to combat fraud waste and abuse she just described it as so I'm pretty sure was in that episode and if it wasn't in that and that was on my podcast called Unchained I did two other pockets with her she's just such a font of knowledge that she's been on my podcast multiple times but what I'll do is when I released this on my podcast I'll link in the show notes to these episode so you can listen because she she went into detail and then the other project I would have you check out is civic by Benny Lingam and he also was on my show and talked a little bit about his bar chain based identity system oh right there I have to say I'm a little hesitant to ask the question because I don't really understand all of this yet but here's my question who enforces bad actors if there is someone who or some entity that is able to the example that you gave with the tuna the bad new the tunas shows up and maybe so two questions who enforces bad actors if somebody put in information you know is this is it self enforced and in that case could it like get rid of all government regulations that would be great and then the second thing is say that tuna arrived and there was Salmonella in it and later somebody ate it and got sick how do you handle liability things so I think for every one of these applications and in some cases that will be baked into the structure of the network itself governance still not alright governance as we know it is about how to we as participants in any sort of activity come to an agreement about how we talk to each other and then what happens if things go wrong right and so in some cases this will be you know algorithmic lis enforced one thing that blockchain technology gives us is the ability to enforce certain things that sometimes we might require auditors to have to catch after the fact one of the biggest top examples of this is what's called prevention of double spend I can't spend the same Bitcoin twice right and in the use in supply chains I can't send the same diamond to two different parties when I try to send that same diamond a second time the network rejects that doesn't let me actually record it as a valid transaction right now there are some behaviors that we'll be able to implement like that and be able to either prevent from happening or catch very quickly there are other behaviors that may be much harder to enforce so for example if we're using this as a way to point to and attest to the integrity of medical records and it turns out a node took that data contrary to the agreed-upon convention or legal context of that and was selling that to a data broker well we don't have a technical way to claw that back what we need are either regulatory and you know government-imposed or simply self regulatory mechanisms that introduce you know penalties hey now you can if you're on this network and you are found to be a bad actor pay a fine and you can stay in or you can leave or if you're a really bad actor you don't get to come back right these are heavyweight you know hammer blows of course you want finer grained things and I think the design of these consortium will will be you know a really interesting topic for every industry to go through over the next 5-10 years it won't look that much different than the EDI integration that a lot of organizations our industries went through as they started to tie their ordinary IT systems together but it'll be this mix of algorithmic and human governance and typically the more that you can put in the algorithmic governance the more predictable the more objective it'll be the less subject to politics and and wrangling and who owns who and that sort of thing but you'll never do away entirely I believe in almost every scenario without having some human governance lair that probably acts as a fail-safe in the case of the technical stuff breaking down or simply encountering new conditions that hadn't anticipated and I'll just act quickly yeah when I was talking about the pharmaceutical Network and I said to take this from a pilot to production it's not going to be a technical challenge it's actually going to be defining the governance right and for us the question is who is going to define the governance I'm a we we are a technical company we made products do we want to get into this business or will we have a consulting firm as a partner who will come help us define this how will we make fifteen competitors work with each other and agree on who you know who is more equal amongst the equal right in a way so I think that to me is actually a bigger challenge in terms of b2b implementation of blockchain than the actual technology is it's a lot simpler for private blockchain networks than it is for the public ones yeah but just the way I heard your questions I think is slightly different which is what do we do if somebody deliberately put bad tuna into on the blockchain as an example right and so I actually think in this case the liability is it's made more straightforward by the existence of distributed ledger of blockchain in the sense that as Brian wrote earlier in the lettuce example you can actually almost micro trace let's call it like what was the source of the tuna what other to know is in that lot you can more quickly identify where that went where distributes you can instead of having a wholesale recall on tuna you can say this particular lot or batch or boat of tuna you know is is contaminated and it went to these places therefore don't buy it these two you can really kind of trace that very efficiently in a way you can't really do effectively now in terms of liability I think you'd launch a similar investigation to the one you would now which would be to say what controls were in place at the point at the boat of refrigeration shipping you wouldn't that wouldn't be different in many ways you'd be able to go about and examine but what would happen is you would save a lot of time because you wouldn't have to examine every point to point for every tuna that wound up in some state for example you'd be able to track where it came from and what supply chain it came through yeah and I think sometimes the the legal liability questions are really just it's you know traditional law applies like just because you're using this technology doesn't necessarily mean that there's anything different about the legal framework so we're nearing the end of our Q&A time but I know that Sheila wants to wrap up with a few comments so yeah we're going to take one more question if there is one I think all right then I will do a quick wrap yeah so thank you all for attending today I wanted to give a couple of comments on the work we're up to at the center so our office we have a San Francisco office called the center for the fourth Industrial Revolution and we focus on policy and governance and I think a lot of what you heard today and the questions reflect that some of the real challenges here in this policy and governance space how do we build protocols particularly in early technology that don't preclude or cutoff certain kinds of use cases that may not be we don't be quite ready for them from business standpoint but down the line we could have a lot of opportunity we also focus a lot on impact and inclusions what we're trying to do is create policy that I facilitate the adoption of technologies like blockchain we also look at AI digital trade precision medicine IOT facilitated after these technologies in smart strategic ways to ensure that we're not leaving behind sectors of society that are trishla left behind because we run the risk of just recreating similar power structures and new places and calling that a win it might be it's certainly different but different isn't always significantly better and and finally we're looking at cross-pollination of these technologies so I think one of the things that makes us unique as a center is we're really examining technologies not in isolation but how they operate with each other so how do we think about data policy GDP our digital trade cross-border data flows healthcare data medicine AI blockchain how do all of these technologies interoperate and what are broad policies whether regulation or whether business practices and protocol or even Technology protocol layer decisions that can actually ensure that again we can envision the transformation in these technologies at the fourth national mission promise and better societies result so we welcome your engagement with the center and with any of these projects that we have running at the center great well thank you so much for joining us today that's a wrap for our session [Music]
