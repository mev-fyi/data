hi everyone and welcome to unchained i'm your host laura shin happy thanksgiving to our us-based listeners instead of a normal episode today this is a discussion from stellar's meridian conference in which i moderated the panel crypto on every corner driving adoption the speakers were jeremy alaire co-founder chairman and ceo of circle and milton demers chief strategy officer at coinshares it was a super fun chat made even more fun by melton's tie-dyed grateful dead dancing bears t-shirt thank you so much to stellar which disclosure has sponsored my shows for hosting the conference since the talk takes a half an hour there won't be a news recap this week but next week we will be back with our regularly scheduled programming till then enjoy your holiday crypto.com the crypto super app that lets you buy earn and spend crypto earn up to 8.5 per year on your bitcoin download the krypto.com app now so the topic of today's discussion is how the crypto industry can drive adoption i just wanted to find out from you guys how do you define that what do you think the world will look like once crypto's been adopted you know there's there's two sort of visions and i think i don't know maybe we can just be honest with ourselves sometimes i worry about the vision we have for cryptocurrency so where i started um and i have a lot of respect for jeremy and the team at circle uh because back when i was in grad school in boston i actually used circle to buy a lot of bitcoin back in the day so kudos to you jeremy you saved me from my days of buying bitcoin on craigslist and using gox fans glad i could be helpful yeah so you helped me stack my my stats in the the early days of bitcoin um but look i think there's sort of two visions and they're two very different visions the vision i've always had for bitcoin that i think is a really compelling one is the separation for the first time of money and state money has been an object of the state since julius caesar stamped his face on a gold coin um and i think really the experiment we're attempting here like the world is no longer defined by physical borders we live in a very digital world um anyone can be anyone on the internet we have many different identities many different communities we're part of sometimes as our default reality selves sometimes we're pseudonymous you know there are a lot of like eggs on twitter who are anonymous individuals um so i think we live in this really interesting world that is truly becoming borderless and to me bitcoin really represents um the evolution of money and transfer value in that world but in the same time i think governments are looking at bitcoin i mean right now we're living in a world where governments are trying to ban math they're literally trying to so we've done this time and time again for the last 25 years since encryptions existed um but you know the advent of central bank digital currencies and certainly what we've seen in the asia pacific region in particular with the advent of dcp and sort of national uh quote-unquote digital currencies um you know i do have a lot of concerns around the ability for people to have financial privacy privacy and transactions privacy in their communications so we have these two very different paths down which we're heading i don't know if they're gonna coexist i don't know if it's going to be an epic collision and i know jeremy you've also you know been working a lot on usdc which which arguably has a big role to play here but i think the future of cryptocurrencies in our society is sort of at this very interesting impasse i want bitcoin to exist i believe people have the right to privacy that people have the right to pseudonymity in their transactions um but i think governments certainly uh do not like that and are advocating now for the antithesis of that which is central bank digital currencies and um monetary systems that give them complete control and the ability to exert financial censorship at every level of society so jeremy i'll pass it to you yeah no totally i mean there's so much so much there um you know i i guess i um just as a technologist uh the to the question of of you know you know when will this be you know whatever uh mainstream or however you want to call that um you know my view is that you know things are mainstream in terms of technology when they disappear when they're invisible to people um and um and where when when essentially like people just take take them for granted right and so depending on your age and depending on where you are like you might take for granted social media but obviously that wasn't something that existed uh you know whatever x number of years ago or you might take for granted that you know you have this amazing you know uh super computer um and that's just like that is reality that is what the world was but obviously that had changed so at what point is the use of crypto so ubiquitous and so embedded in so many things that we just take it for granted so we're um we're we have quite a ways to go on that um but i think we're making really really strong progress i think when i also think about that question i really think about um you know crypto and blockchain um is it's a pretty broad surface area right you can be narrowly focused and sort of say there's you know non-sovereign stores of value that use a blockchain infrastructure you know bitcoin zcash you know etc etc which i i completely agree with melton right there's this this is this new form of borderless internet money and it will continue to grow and scale and i'm i'm you know quite quite optimistic about that but then there's the the fundamentals of the broader technology right so you know public chain infrastructure as effectively a new operating system layer on the internet um a new set of operating systems for storing data conducting transactions and executing code that's what operating systems can help do and so these new operating system layers you know are very very general purpose in many respects they're well suited to what i call fiduciary trust applications but can also be you know i you know i was in a hackathon panel with melton the other day and we were looking at someone who built uh you know a decentralized messaging application on top of solana the point being uh and decentralized fantasy football football right so digital games uh uh you know messaging applications you know all these things on decentralized infrastructure web 3 et cetera like that part of this is also a very very important part of this and so and and you know something like stable coins like regulated stable coins like uh uh you know usdc or or potentially libra like these these are also like apps that run on this these new operating systems and could be quite popular and so i think in terms of the question of when does that become mainstream i think we're really close there i think in the next 12 to 24 months many of the most popular digital wallet products in the world that are used that we think of and use like as peer-to-peer payment apps or things like that they're going to turn on these protocols they're going to turn these on and you're going to have you know all of a sudden hundreds of millions of people that can make interoperable payments with each other and that will kind of be in the background that will kind of be invisible you'll you'll just you won't be trapped in making payments to people who have venmo uh you'll be able to make payments between venmo and square cash and paypal and swish in sweden and vips and norway and you know go around the world to all these different um apps they're all going to speak these common protocols and i think that's that will be a a a mainstream phase in digital currency um that's that's coming and i think ultimately you know uh you know that same number of people who might feel okay like i'm using euros or dollars or whatnot feeling comfortable using bitcoin that will grow too um and uh eventually yeah i would expect billions of people will will want to use bitcoin too yeah the way that i think about it also is you know 10 or 15 years ago i didn't wake up and check multiple um communications apps you know like imessage and whatsapp and signal and telegram and facebook messenger and twitter dms but this nowadays it's like you know probably one of the first things i do when i wake up so i imagine that it'll be the same here but for different for like a huge variety of financial transactions and you know like jeremy said across the globe not just with people that i know and i also think that there will probably be a lot of ways to make passive income off these networks and it will be you know not with like a huge company at the center of it but just kind of like little mini democracies around the world so let's now kind of talk about where we are in this cycle because even though we're far off from this vision that we created i do think that this has been a landmark year in some ways um probably with the biggest news being um paypal introducing um the you know sale and and um purchase of bitcoin and three other cryptocurrencies on its platform um so how would you describe kind of like where we are in our current stage yeah i can i can jump in quickly um look i think at this point i'm shocked that it took paypal this long to be candid um there are a lot of stories unfolding here and if we sort of pull at the the threads here i was listening to reid hoffman in the last session i'm chatting with danelle from the found stellar foundation about you know his journey at paypal and he used the word we were so naive when we we started paypal which i thought was interesting um you know when we look at uh traditional fintechs i think many of them have recognized the power of adding crypto to their platform number one it's a huge revenue driver um square's bitcoin revenue has grown quarter over quarter um by really really large uh percentages i think this last quarter their bitcoin revenue grew close to 200 percent and not only that i think executives are seeing the impact to both private company evaluations and public company evaluations of adding crypto uh similarly you know if we look at the paypal story uh paypal you know has 300 million users um they only though transmit i think about 700 billion dollars of value a year if we look at what's happening in apac alipay last year transmitted 17 trillion dollars of value on their network so i think there are these radical differences um in how people around the world are using payments payment systems and there is a competition afoot right like at the end of the day what we're competing for is what we were competing for with the internet i remember my first interactions on the internet were with um you know uh chat apps but then aol came along and sort of made the internet accessible for people like my parents who weren't you know playing video games and playing around on the these chat groups with weirdos all around the world and i kind of view money the same way right we have people who are building these closed networks but all of these payment apps have the same fundamental challenge and i think jeremy articulated really well if i have paypal and he has venmo we can't interact with one another even though we have the same phone even though we live in the same country we're standing right next to each other but we can't transmit value how insane is that so um in my view at this point you know large companies adopting crypto it's a must-have i'm shocked it's taking them this long and it is driving valuations it's driving revenue it's a no-brainer and let's not forget when you add crypto you also get access to one of the most powerful marketing channels in the world which is crypto twitter like people are we have an army of people on the internet who are obsessed with crypto and anytime anyone does something like paul tudor jones talks about bitcoin if you look at his google search results like flatline the minute he talks about bitcoin huge spike so in terms of relevance i think a lot of companies have recognized if you market to bitcoiners like it's a great way to get eyeballs on what you're doing so let's not underestimate the power of crypto twitter shout out to everyone um because it's an amazing community to market to crypto.com the crypto super app that lets you buy earn and spend crypto all in one place earn up to 8.5 per year on your btc download the krypto.com app now to see the interest rates you could be earning on btc and more than 20 other coins once in the app you can apply for the crypto.com metal card which pays you up to eight percent cashback instantly reserve yours now in the crypto.com app yeah i mean just checking in on like where we're at i mean i think yeah this year was a really big year i think that that um having you know mainstream consumer fintechs you know we we've had you know revolut and robin hood and square and and others like i think as malcolm said it was only a matter of time that you know paypal would would would introduce some support and obviously um you know there's been this tremendous rise in in many different dimensions here right there's been obviously the rise in the absolute price of bitcoin there's been this incredible surge in growth in stable coin usage uh like usdc we've seen 200 billion dollars of on-chain transactions it's just incredible to see that amount of growth and you know obviously you're seeing credit markets that exist now that are smart contract based these yield markets which is phenomenon that's grown you know uh enormously this year all these things are are thematically um you know these were twinkles in someone on someone's eye a couple of years ago two three years ago and and and now they're actually playing out so i think um you know the twinkle in the eye that we just talked about of like interoperable digital wallets and people using cryptocurrency within that whether it's stable coins or bitcoin or both which i i think it'll often times be both um you know that that may be much faster than we than we expect um and i think we're we're seeing um you know digital wallet projects in every corner of the world in every currency market in the world who are embracing this and so um you know that is gonna like the the early internet it's gonna light up this global network and all of a sudden everyone will be connected uh and that's gonna be fun to watch yeah i do agree it sort of feels like right now is sort of this tee up moment where like a lot of people are just kind of getting access to what would be necessary for a kind of next big step um and yet i also think that there are some other things that need to be resolved before the ball can really move forward and i think you know maybe one of those things might be regulatory questions that need to be resolved or like certain kinds of other infrastructure that need to be built so what do you think are kind of the next critical steps for where the crypto industry um needs to go you know i guess in the next year or so i've been thinking a lot about this um i can touch on a couple and and and um and go from there but um you know on the infrastructure side i mean clearly and this is really just from from a little bit of a narrow perspective here which is sort of stable coin view um you know in order for this to work at scale for consumer scale payments we need to be using blockchain infrastructure that is designed for that and so you know one of the really key thing you know i am not what i call a a um a blockchain maximalist like i don't have a blockchain that i say well that's gonna that's definitely that gonna be the dominant blockchain um there's a huge amount of innovation in the space uh you're you know you're seeing you know obviously projects like stellar really starting to get traction with a lot of different financial applications uh you see d5 happening on things like ethereum but it's hitting constraints you're seeing other new chains that launch that are focused on things like you know uh decentralized markets or regulated securities or other kinds of things so but all of this needs this infrastructure we need scale we need to be able to have um applications like if we if we have these consumer wallet applications that are pointing at a public internet network and pointing their users at a public internet network and you're settling transactions you need to be able to support you know thousands and then tens of thousands of transactions per second and we're now we're seeing that we're seeing blockchains that can do that um and so that's really really exciting um and um that's been a missing that's been a really a missing piece is that that that combination there there's a lot on the regulatory side um but even there and maybe we'll come back to that in more detail the um you know for some people the regulatory work you know you can call it progress meaning that there's there is actually increasing amounts of clarity or rule making that's happening in different parts of the world and other people that that's not progress that's actually restrictive and will will uh i think you know potentially destroy some of the potential benefits of this technology and um but i think um for everyday users and businesses to say yes this is this is a legitimate financial infrastructure for the modern economy for this digital economy there will have to be you know these these rule sets are and they're going to need to be consistently applied in a lot of places um and so that is um that's a key piece that's unfolding literally as we speak milton do you want to jump in sure um look let's just be very realistic um i run a regulated business jeremy's in a regulated business right uh we've certainly had a lot of interactions with with regulators um at this stage you know i i like to joke it would have been easier to start a bank than just start a crypto company because it would have been less onerous um yeah totally yeah right i'm like oh well why are we but look um let me maybe take a slightly contrarian view because i think it's fun when we get to disagree on things um well certainly you know i think right now we're going through this phase um and we've been talking about it forever the institutions are coming what does it look like for crypto which really like let's for a minute talk about how unique cryptocurrencies are we built an entirely separate market with its own infrastructure with its own unique um sort of marketplaces its own unique financial instruments entirely outside of the existing financial system for the last 12 years that is what we've been doing that's what i've been investing in that's what jeremy was building you know initially at circle and he was trying to create that first bridge between the traditional u.s banking system ach and you know being able to use the correspondent banking system to buy and sell cryptocurrencies that really has only started in earnest now but the question is does adopting cryptocurrencies mean that institutions continue to exist in their current form and i'm certainly personally of the mind that institutions should not continue to operate in their current form i don't think it would be a step forward if for society if we took cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and shoved them in a vault at bny mellon or jpmorgan chase or another institution and gave people synthetic bitcoin to trade that is not the point of what we're doing here yes maybe we get slightly faster transactions but you don't need a blockchain or a digital currency to do that i think the true um value and the true potential of cryptocurrency cryptocurrencies and their ability you know to jeremy's point to create these open protocols these open source networks um where anyone can build anyone can interact on them yes a business that you build in a particular jurisdiction will obviously be subject to the rules and regulations of that particular jurisdiction but the whole point of the internet is it's open and it's borderless and permissionless and anyone can interact with the internet obviously if i'm accessing the internet in china versus accessing the internet in the us my experience is going to be different due to the service provider in that jurisdiction but we're still utilizing the same protocols we're still utilizing a lot of the same infrastructure and we're accessing a lot of similar platforms i think the challenge i have is um i really want to see cryptocurrencies change the way that institutions function i think we are long overdue for change in our relationship with money i am of the mindset that um you know the separation of money and state is one of the most important experiments that we have ever conducted as humanity it's profoundly interesting from a philosophical perspective from a political perspective a cultural perspective i always like to say like bitcoin is a social movement first and foremost also i'm like the crazy radical here um i'm not ashamed to say that like welcome to our cult we have great swag and great memes but um look i think the core question for me is is how can we use cryptocurrencies to evolve how our institutions function right because at the end of the day um humans don't define themselves by the the jurisdiction in which they're physically located anymore and we're in this really weird world and i do sympathize with regulators because they're grappling with a number of challenges on a number of fronts that come from like the shift from a physical world to a very digital world and the digital world doesn't have jurisdiction not in the traditional sense so how are you going to regulate something that has no ceo that has no headquarters that has no physical jurisdiction you you can't you you have to change your mental framework for how you think about these things and i think that is what's really taking time it's going to take a shift in who's in power and we're seeing that right a lot of younger people are in congress there are a lot of people from communities who haven't historically been congress we have the most women in power in the us than we've had in our entire country's history right like that is also crazy it's the year 2020 and just now do we have an elected official in the white house who's a woman it's bizarre to me but there's a lot of change happening and there's a changing out of um the old guard as i call it and there are people with different mindsets who are coming in who are looking at the world and saying well why are we doing things this way and that's why i love working in technology and venture capital is i get to interact with people like jeremy everyday who say wait a minute we don't have to do things we can actually change what it means to be a financial institution that's what's so exciting to me is like we get to create a new narrative and we get to rewrite the story of what it means to be a financial institution and that i think is actually going to be the most powerful thing that we can build that we can do i am so excited about it i think it's amazing hopefully coming through the screen i am so excited about it i i would like ladder off that quickly which is just to say um like the the the the changes that become possible um when money works the way the internet works and when and it's it it goes so much deeper than that i mean i think um to melton's point like we are seeing experiments right now with the creation of new what i call kind of corporate forms basically new structures that are entirely governed in crypto where the entirety of the the way in which participants are involved the way in which governance happens the way in which value is exchanged the way in which value is created and derived that's all being managed on blockchains no connection to a externalized legal system or no connection to uh you know a the traditional financial system and you know in economics and i studied economics as well and you've got micro economics and you've got macro economics and in microeconomics you're focused on the theory of the firm and what is a firm and what happens in a firm and we have joint stock corporations as they're the modern you know kind of you know model i believe we are right now seeing a revolution away from joint stock corporations and into digitally native entities that are entirely exist in tokenized form and entirely exist on blockchains and you know if you're starting a project and you want to collaborate with people and exchange value and and ultimately create work output and so on it's going to move to those kinds of forms and that just goes so far outside of the the global legal system is even con table capable of contemplating and but that's what that's what people are doing yeah so i'm going to jeremy let's do it let's get right yes and i'm excited to walk to cover you guys at creating this brand new thing which is amazing so we literally have just one minute left so i'm gonna ask one quick question you only get to say one sentence with your answer and then i'm gonna just do um these uh some of the q and a's that are also short answers but um what are some of your favorite success stories when it comes to adoption so maybe just pick one company with like one reason why that's one of your favorite success stories so far with adoption and while you're thinking about that one of the q as that came in was when is usd coming to stellar someone wants to know when they can trade it on a dex i uh i can answer that that audience question so yeah we announced usdc for stellar um and it's coming soon um okay you don't have a date okay favorite success stories then we're going to close out go ahead what are your favorite success stories when it comes to adoption so far and just give a one sentence reason yeah favorite success story um bitcoin is savings technology um i'm from turkey people in countries like turkey are able to use bitcoin to protect themselves from the debasement of their own currencies and preserve their wealth and their financial sovereignty i think that's so empowering and to me that's why i love cryptocurrencies like let's empower individuals not institutions i i like like really really small world anecdotes which is um they're i i heard a story of a first-hand story of a person who was fleeing colombia because of specific human rights violations and they they knew that they were going to have to cross a border to get out and they were going to be confronted with police and everything would be taken from them and they you know they created a brain wallet and they walked across the border with their bitcoin in their brain and all their wealth was preserved and i thought that's changing the world um that is amazing yeah i'm sure i would forget the brain wallet but that's just me but anyway okay you guys well this has been so great i'm so glad i got to see you again and um thank you so much for participating in our panel [Music] [Music] you
