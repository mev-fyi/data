product ousg today's guest is Lewis Cohen co-founder of DLX law welcome Lewis hey it's great to be here Laura thank you in December 2020 the SEC sued Ripple labs and two Executives Chris Larson and Brad garlinghouse and it said that they had been raising over 1.3 billion dollars in an ongoing unregistered Securities offering on Thursday we received our first major order in that case but before we get into the details on this latest news why don't you start us off with a background on what this case is all about sure a lot so I think a lot of your listeners are aware that the sec's concern about the way you know various digital assets have been distributed goes back long before the Ripple issues um after Prosecuting both some some more innocuous cases and also some fraud cases I think there was a general perception that people understood where some broad parameters were um there were no really big cases at that point that had had been prosecuted and the SEC decided at the very end of Jake Clayton's tenure as SEC chair I believe was on the last day the day before his tenure ended to sue Ripple labs and that was really probably the single largest token that they'd gone after uh there have been prosecutions of kick as you know which was relatively uh kind of small time Ico and telegram which was a large project but was nipped in the bud before the tokens were ever released so this is the first time that the SEC had gone after a project where the tokens were out in the market and you know I think everyone believed that the SEC sought to use this case to make the point that you know the whole industry is violating federal law and it needs to be brought under control and so the order by judge Annalisa Torres on Thursday was quite significant for various reasons what did the order say so the order really focused on two main aspects of what transpired the first were the institutional uh distributions which is where uh Ripple Labs sold xrp tokens directly to hedge funds and other large investors the judge distinguishes that from what she calls the programmatics the programmatic buyers exactly the programmatic buyers uh which is where Ripple Labs raised money by uh making tokens available on digital asset marketplaces and allowing uh participants or users of the marketplaces to buy tokens uh right right there and blind bid asked transactions and so judge Torres said well hang on a second these are two very different kinds of uh transactions and sales and one of the transactions in her mind met the status of an investment contract transaction that were the institutional sales the other the programmatic sales did not and she really in this decision makes a clear distinction between a transaction that meets all four problems with the well-known Howie test and transactions that do not necessarily do that we'll get into more detail so she kind of split the baby to some extent she also concluded there's a third category of what she referred to as other distributions which were made to employees and others and other Market participants and she was remarkably generous to that category as well but that's somewhat of a secondary point to the her main decision as far as I understand I think her reasoning here outlines reasoning that you and I believe another lawyer entered into and tell me how to pronounce this is it okay I've always wondered um uh into an amicus we and essentially she described the institutional sales as meeting the four prongs of the Howie test for you know certain reasons so can you kind of walk us through what that reasoning is and then also walk us through how it is the programmatic buying on the exchanges did not meet those four prongs sure Laura so so I think maybe just first for some of your listeners who are not as technical any litigation particularly civil litigation the two sides right briefs and present arguments to the judge who ultimately has to make decisions in most uh courts judge will allow Friends of the Court or amicii his friends or Amicus a friend of the court and those Friends of the Court where they're permitted they submit uh filings as well to say hey I think there's some information that would be valuable to you so that's a pretty common practice and um in the Ripple Labs case there were quite a number of amicus briefs that that were filed we were fortunate to work with our good friend Kevon zadeji I don't know if you've had on your show before of General block and we submitted a brief of our own on behalf of Paradigm the uh the Venture investor and in our brief we really focused on the issues that it turns out for the judge were quite important and asked her to think carefully about the difference between sales and which the four prongs of how we were met in the particular transaction at a sweeping ruling generally about xrp being held a security it's important to bear in mind Laura that the first line of the sec's Brie that was originally filed says this brief concerns xrp comma a digital asset security so the SEC has taken the position from day one that somehow the Howie tests and the concept of investment contract has fused with the digital token and that they're one and the same for all intents and purposes in this decision probably the most momentous aspect is to judge soundly rejects that back position by the SEC and so how was it that she was analyzing the institutional sales that she determined that those were unregistered Securities offerings and what was it about the programmatic ones that did not meet that standard for her sure so the the institutional sales uh were I think what you might call down the middle investment contract cases the status of the token was not was relevant to the judge what was relevant to the judge is that number one there was an investment of money that is to say the institutional buyers provided 750 odd million uh dollars over you know a variety of different transactions to Ripple apps so there was an investment of money money was was was provided directly to Ripple Labs number two there's a common Enterprise there was some general expectation that everybody would do better if the price of the xrp tokens went up there was a reasonable expectation of profit and this becomes quite important when we talk about the programmatic sales in a moment but there was an expectation of profit on the part of the institutional buyers that why are we giving Labs you know quite a lot of money help that's because not necessarily we want to send a lot of you know funds from Mexico to Peru or something but because we think that the uh token price will go up through Ripple's efforts and um they they clearly depended not only did they have an expectation of profit but was on Ripple labs in this way the case lines up with many other uh cases that have come before it what is of concern is not the subject of the investment contract but the understandings and the reasonable understandings not the subjective understandings of the participants hey am I giving you money Laura you know I'm expecting you to do something with that money I'm giving you and later we're both going to be doing really well out of this whole thing you know if you do that and you do that sort of broadly without having an exemption you violated the Federal Security laws so the institutional sales and the conclusion there probably didn't surprise too many people I think the more interesting part are her remarks around the program after sales and so for the programmatic sales what was the difference that she felt uh you know merited them not being deemed unregistered Securities offerings absolutely so so I would start with a A unfortunate subtlety here the question of primary sales versus secondary sales um although in footnote 16 in her order the judge says that she's not commenting specifically on secondary sales that is someone who bought xrp tokens and later we sold those same tokens that they bought that would be a secondary sale she's not commenting on that but what she does say quite critically is that the individuals who bought xrp on in through the programmatic sales which he writes is the vast majority of those persons who bought that did not invest their money in ripple at all she points out that only something like one percent I think of all of the programmatic sales actually went to Ripple so so they were not necessarily people were buying and selling uh xrp tokens on exchanges mostly trading with each other not necessarily providing money uh to Ripple and so she continues that whereas the institutional buyers knowingly purchased xrp tokens directly from Ripple pursuant to a contract the economic reality is that the programmatic buyers stood in the same shoes as a secondary Market purchaser who did not know to whom or to what it was paying its money so what she concludes is functionally a secondary Market transaction in a token like xrp is not inherently a Securities transaction even if those same tokens had been sold in investment contract transactions to others so one could read this as a fundamental rejection of the morphing concept the idea that a token starts off its life as a security and then and later upon some extrinsic events people refer to centralization it stops being a security that's this idea of morphing and she rejects that she says no look it's very clear to her and she has another quote earlier on forgive me for um for trying to repeat from the keyword itself but I think it's the best thing I love it yeah yeah she says um the plain words of the Howie case make it clear that an investment contract for purpose of the Securities act means a contract transaction or scheme but the subject of a contract transaction scheme is not necessarily a security on its face in fact she refers to a number of earlier cases and notes that in all of those cases the subject of the investment contract was a standalone commodity which is not itself inherently an investment contract and then finally she says the xrp token as a digital token is not in and of itself contract transaction or scheme so what she wants to say is very clearly GSA is that hey if a digital token and it could frankly be Bitcoin it's irrelevant I think consistent with and there have been cases where Bitcoin was used as the object of a scheme it's not important whether it's Bitcoin xrp or anything else what's important to me is was there a scheme among the participants and when the programmatic sales took place which he concluded was the people buying and selling uh the xrp tokens on the exchanges were not engaging in investment contract transactions with ripple it doesn't matter and she particularly talks to and I think this is quite relevant Laura she talks to the marketing and this has been a big part of what the SEC has argued is come on everybody knows maybe you're buying in a secondary transaction but everybody knows what you're doing it's a big scheme and you're all participating in and the judge disagrees and she says again I'm reading nor is there evidence that the programmatic buyers understood that statements made by Larson garlinghouse and others were representation undertakings formal or info right representations of Ripple and its efforts so she said yes they said things but how is the particular person to know is that a promise that they're making she contrasts that with the institutional buyers who negotiated carefully and understood the sophisticated financial decision that they were making so that's really critical especially where we see in some of the SEC complaints you know the idea that if you have a rocket ship you know in your tweet that you're telling people you know this is a secure you know number you know and and I think she rejects that because we don't know what the parameters are it isn't that if if you sell directly to people and you kind of give them a nudge nudge wink wink that they're going to make money that's a problem but in sales between two third parties it's it's not so much the judge strongly endorses that uh that conclusion yeah one thing that interested me that quote that you pulled out this came up in a recent debate that I had on my show between Aaron Kaplan of promethium and Rodrigo Sarah and Rodrigo kept saying the subject I'm an investment contract is not itself necessarily a security but anyway so I do want to ask you more about the implications of this order but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible ever wanted to use

judgments came up a few times in this order on xrp and before the um order from from this judge I had thought sort of like the general way things were headed was that the SEC was going after for-profit companies that had tokens and saying that those were unregistered Securities whereas and obviously this doesn't map one to one because there are plenty of counter examples but that generally um more of the structures involving non-profits stewarding decentralized protocols with tokens were were kind of less subject to action from them but I feel like the Ripple case sort of bucks that Trend so I wonder if if you could just explain a little bit what it was that separated ripple from the kick and telegram cases look well Kink is is probably the prototypical example of a prosecuted um Ico case uh where um you know really the sort of 2015 to give or take 18 period where people had a website and come buy my tokens and and kind of let's go for it and um the judge and in the in the kick case said look you're you're going out to the general public you're you're telling them you're going to make a lot of money if you get a token early there's a countdown clock there's all these factors that really align with that and so that is really I would call an unsurprising decision telegram was more subtle one a telegram were advised by a very sophisticated counsel judge costell and his decision there honed in on a really kind of precise coin which is the initial buyers of the gram tokens from telegram um although those were perhaps valid private transactions let's assume that they are they were necessarily part of the scheme to distribute the gram tokens they were a pretty small number of functionally institutional buyers in in Telegram and the judge recognized if they didn't distribute the tokens they would have no value and so really what the judge and telegram said hey this is about sort of just an extension of your distribution you didn't do it yourself telegram you kind of found these other people and got them to do what happened and kicked directly so you did kind of indirectly or you were going to do if we didn't stop you uh in in that so both of those still related to those kind of of sales well you don't have in either of those cases are the kinds of equivalent of secondary Market transactions that we have here with the the programmatic sales by by Ripple that is what for judge Torres made a big difference and I think what she's saying is when when people are buying in a market and they don't know who they're buying from or any particular assurance that the money that they're spending is going going to concoct a scheme that they're going to profit from then you can't say they're part of an investment contract transaction so that's really in my mind how you kind of take it from Step you know a kick you have a clear Ico type case where uh the company kick I was going out to the general public with their kin token then you have the telegram case where they did not go to the general public they took a lot of care only to go to institutional buyers but the judge said those resales by the institutional buyers were just part of one big scheme by telegram here now we see the judge saying okay when you go to institutional buyers you probably have investment contract transactions but if you just are putting your tokens into a Marketplace those are not the type of transactions I think meets the highway tests and so I know that this still has to go to trial but let's say that this kind of um had staying power that you know the way she reasoned all this then would you see any kind of Revival in any of the different ways that projects were trying to distribute tokens to users such as for instance I don't know like airdrops or doing something like an Ido or I I don't know I was just your ieo rather what are your thoughts on versions of the same thing there yeah Dex offering or exchange offering yeah so I mean you know crypto is a wild and wonderful place and few people know it better than you Laura um people are going to do what people do I will say clients that work with us are not going to be doing any of those things anytime soon you know rest is short um you know I think this is still a time it's a time to be happy that we saw a federal court validate a lot of what we've been saying in terms of tokens themselves are not Securities however there's still many fraud areas here and I think it's still appropriate for crypto Market participants to be cautious in the way they distribute their tokens in addition to the trial on some of the more specific facts there is a near certainty I would say that the SEC is going to appeal the thing is that's going to take quite some time for that to go when when you're in the southern district of New York you appeal to the second Circuit of them our circuit courts the second circuit is a very well respected court that process will be very time consuming it's possible the SEC don't but I that strikes me as quite unlikely so until we have at least a circuit court decision which is really the strong binding precedent we don't really know and it is possible that judge Taurus's decision could be overturned or what we call remanded where the Circuit Court says hey go back and do more fact-finding or figure things out or or proceed differently so I think it would behoove everyone all of your listeners to be very careful going forward Laura even though this is a moment to celebrate and a moment to recognize that the very broad claims that the SEC has been making have by at least one very important federal judge in uh in New York and one of the most important districts in the country has rejected many of the very broad statements that the SEC has been putting forward and when you say that second district court decision might take a second second circuit yeah um Court District decision might take a while or is it again on the order of years or how long would you expect sure I'm I will say firstly I'm not a litigator but you know it's certainly not less than a year and I'm sure probably could be more depending on how the the pace of things go so it's going to be an extended period of time but you have many wonderful litigators on your show and ask them all right so crypto exchanges including even coinbase which has long been seen as the most compliant Exchange have been under Fire by the SEC and I wondered what you thought this order meant for crypto exchanges in the US well it's certainly encouraging there's no doubt I think um had a judge Torres gone in a rather different direction and agreed with the SEC that because xrp tokens were sold initially in investment contract transactions then all subsequent sales for the foreseeable future are themselves functionally Securities transactions whether it's because the xrp token is literally a security which the SEC does seem to say from time to time or whether it's not literally a security but any transaction in it is functionally a Securities transaction had the judge gone in this other direction that would have been very problematic that would have certainly been exhibit number one as the SEC uh litigates the cases against the three exchanges and potentially others potentially other Market participants because all of those cases as far as I think you understand turn exclusively on the question we wrote about in the inelectable modality paper which is when a token is sold between two persons not involved in the ski when is that transaction the Securities transaction and just Torah is basically validates our conclusion for the time being at least that is only a Securities transaction if there's specific factors that make it a security so just trading on an exchange would not make the two people you and I if we buy and sell xrp between each other we're not making promises to each other we're not doing anything we're just here I got some of this you got some of that um so so the judge has validated that and that's very good for coinbase it's very good for the other exchanges it's it's it's very very encouraging but again you know we we need to have notes of caution this could be appealed it will likely be appealed we don't know where that's going to go and we're going to see you know you know the law develop further many exchanges delisted xrp when the SEC first sued Ripple what do you think will happen to xrp now do you expect that it would be re-listed yeah it's a great question um it possible I I would again I'm a cautious guy that's why I'm I'm a lawyer um I I wouldn't I wouldn't go uh doing that right away but I think there's gonna have to be some interesting questions around that topic and I think different exchanges May uh take different views on that certainly I I you know um there's a quite a large and vocal community of uh of xrp owners who feel very hard done by because of the value loss when their the token was simply delisted and for an agency whose primary purpose is investor protection I think they're quite a lot of folks out there who feel that you know the the mission of investor protection was really skewed when xrp was delisted and it just became much much harder to buy and sell uh that asset just a quick note after Lewis and I wrapped coin Kraken and bitstamp all announced that they were re-listing xrp and Gemini said it was considering a re-listing at the same time the crypto industry is in a battle with the SEC over a spot Bitcoin ETF and I wondered if you thought this xrp order would affect the likelihood of such an ETF getting approved I would say oh if if at all only in a minor way I think you know to the extent the SEC takes into account um you know sort of matters extrinsic uh to the the actual uh issues that they face they could potentially calculate that well we took one a bit on the chin here maybe you know it's an opportunity to sort of even the tables a little but we're speculating at the highest order at that point I I would expect it really wouldn't influence things I think many of your guests Laura have talked about this and and have sort of had a general expectation that time is running out on the SEC and we're going to get um uh you know a spot ETF you know soon enough but you know we'll we'll see um I I think I probably call it a wash at best all right so earlier we talked about how this will likely be appealed by the SEC but I also know that the judge ordered that there be a trial so can you walk us through yeah kind of what those steps would look like so the the and again as a non-litigator so you should you should get a letter on the show um whether uh the appeal is stayed while they have the trial or whether um the appeals can go forward and they they kind of hold up the trial or they do go simultaneously that's a little above uh my favorite the smart people work on that kind of stuff there are specific questions though uh that she does raise uh at that are factual matter so so basically when there's a summary judgment in either direction either for the SEC or for ripple Labs it means the judges concluded that there are functionally no issues for what's called a finder effect which is usually a a jury but it could be the judge herself as a finder of fact everything we decided as a matter of law but he or she said there were questions that were you know factual questions that had to be considered so in in again on matters of law as a general matter uh the two parties agree as to what the facts are for example so many xrp were sold you know they were no registration statements you know etc etc she concludes however that um there were questions about a particular garlinghouse and Larson whether they recklessly disregarded facts about the Howie elements so the parties could not agree amongst themselves and therefore that's why we have it's like you know if you're watching a sports thing and they got to go to the replay Booth back in New York and somebody's just got to decide well what exactly happened here so that's what jury trials are so there were specific questions particularly around Garling house and uh Larson as to their state of mind and in particular whether um also whether Larson consciously assisted uh Ripple in some active way so those are questions so they're relative relatively smaller scale certainly they don't affect the wider crypto industry um what I don't know I regret to say is whether which which comes first in terms of the pl or the trial on those issues all right so overall all as we've been discussing throughout this show crypto has been in this kind of what feels like years-long Purgatory in the US when it comes to legal and Regulatory Clarity especially about the status of crypto Assets in terms of whether they should be regulated as Securities or Commodities and so I wondered what you thought Thursday's order meant for the crypto industry overall particularly regarding that issue in the U.S um yeah I I think this certainly helps point a direction in particular on I think the most vexatious of the positions that the SEC has taken that somehow sort of an investment contract fuses in or what uh we refer to in in our article as the embodiment theory that the the token comes to embody a scheme and that seems to be rejected at least in one important decision and that's very good because I don't think that's correct as a matter of Law and it's very problematic however Laura you know it's still important to remember that they're you know the SEC are reasonable people and and they they have genuine concerns the people who work in the staff are you know not paid an incredibly large amount and they're there to to provide you know protection for regular folks and I think sometimes the crypto Community gets a little caught up and misses that there were real yeah and and I think we know we need to stand up for for those folks I think what is really kind of the heart of the matter there's two issues I talked about in a in a Twitter thread yesterday about the lummus gillibrand bill that was just reintroduced the two issues Laura really which are not addressed right now in which this decision doesn't punctually change number one information asymmetries projects the token may not be a security but the project teams may have information that is not available to the general public for example Ripple Labs may know that they're about to enter into a giant partnership with some you know uh you know General Motors and and ripples could be the xrp is going to be the only way that people pay for goods and services in their driverless cars some crazy thing and that that could have real important price implications for the xrp token right now we don't have any way to address those information asymmetries and in theory at least insiders can trade on that you know knowing that information without anything and I think in many many many projects particularly those that haven't really fully decentralized are subject to that kind of issue they know what's going on it's not so much decentralization in in the terms of how many nodes there are who can control this or that it's what's going on that's going to give price action to the tokens and very often that's extrinsic to the blockchain it's extrinsic to technical matters I think we could use legislation and both the house crypto Market structure proposal coming from chairs McHenry and Thompson and house financial services and house Ag and the lumos Jill brand bill go at addressing this from slightly different angles but basically the same way to address these these information asymmetries and try and ensure that market participants have access that information that's important even with this decision the second thing besides information asymmetries is Market structure itself and in particular over we don't have a federal regulator of crypto asset markets and I think again the large companies in the space do a great job of complying with those laws that are applicable to them but we don't have federal laws of this and I think at this point most of us recognize that a federal regulatory scheme for secondary markets would be beneficial it would traffic cop there is Market manipulation there's all kinds of things that go on and we need legislation for that too so I think while the decision here today is very helpful it's really the beginning of positive steps forward to allow people to use crypto assets as they're intended for peer-to-peer transactions without worrying about violating Securities laws that they don't even know they're subject to but we still need to do more work on the legislative front and certainly Laura I'd encourage all of your listeners to engage with the political process talk to your representatives and your senators and let them know that that in sensible legislation you know is something that's important even if you don't agree with either of those initiatives you can say man that's the worst heat up Bill I've ever seen in my life that's fine tell them that right engage so I think that's just my kind of call to action there for the community all right great well thank you for unpacking all of this on Unchained it's my pleasure Laura thank you
