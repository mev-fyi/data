description today's guest is wasse lawyer a lawyer specializing in restructuring and insolvency welcome wassie lawyer hello hi laura very happy to be here so the crypto space is now seeing three big bankruptcy cases that are all happening simultaneously three arrows capital voyager and now celsius before we dive into the details on these cases lossy lawyer since you are an anon can you give us a short description of your professional background and how it is that you came to have expertise in these types of cases yeah sure i'm happy to sort of explain a bit more so i'm an english trained lawyer i'm working in this london based law firm and i've sort of spent most of a career working on distressed companies restructuring and insolvency matters mostly structuring less full-on insolvencies as you've noted i'm also an anons so online by night i lob as a penguin receipt during an nft project but in terms of professional background i've worked on quite a number of sort of multi-billion dollar restructuring matters now not non-crypto related so far all right so let us start with three euros capital as recently as march the crypto hedge fund and proprietary trading firm which was run by classmates and friends su zhu and kyle davies managed about 10 billion dollars in assets at its peak its aum was 18 billion and at the moment it is in bankruptcy because of how many major entities in crypto it borrowed from this will have ripple effects out onto the whole industry and already has the story begins with a liquidation process ordered by a british virgin islands court back on june 29th let's just start by explaining what liquidation is and what in this case the liquidators are going to be doing yeah okay so sort of starting off with the liquidation process that sort of kicked off the bgi actually i think it may be sensible to start right before the liquidation process so in order for a company to go into liquidation and instead of insolvent and someone has to kick start an application to have the company wound up or put it to litigation so when we look at what the liquidation order that's now public uh the bvi call has sort of uh handed down what's happened is you've got derebit as the creditors of three hours capital applying for provisional liquidation order and at the same time trials capital themselves carl davis applied for liquidation order from so normally one thing it was actually fairly surprising to some of these insolvency practitioners in space because you don't normally have a company going to liquidation quickly and certainly not one with you know 10 billion dollars in assets normally what happens is for creditors they start doing gender demands they put in what is known as a winding up edition they put in what is known as provisional liquidation application which is what therapy put in and the purpose of that is to sort of make sure the assets aren't dissipated while everyone figures what the hell is going on in there now it seems that sue and kyle the founders of 3ac weren't keen to contest the liquidation thing at all and they were so happy to say let's liquidate this company entirely surprising because one would expected that to be some sort of bailout some sort of discussion for a restructuring deal but there wasn't any such thing in this case which is full of liquidation so what does a liquidation mean so it's not like referred to of the earlier when the company is bankrupt doesn't mean it's the end of it because you can structure it you can save it someone has come and buy the assets you can figure out some sort of new financing but that's not the case for trees at the end of the liquidation triangle is going to cease to exist company and in this case professional third party the global advisory firm to mail have been appointed as liquidators imported to note that teneo has been appointed by the creditors of three arrows and not the founders the founders themselves put forward their own uh nominee as uh their own nominee for a liquidator and what they called it eventually was they went with the creditor's choice which is a smart one which would make all the creditors feel a lot more comfy because you want a liquidator that you know that's aligned with the credit this rather than one that's sort of appointed by the company especially in situations such as this so what's the liquidator doing now liquidators are coming in to the two to three hours capital they're gonna assess what assets are available how much i owe to creditors and then the next steps they'll probably start holding their call creditors meeting and sort of provide an update on what exactly is going on some stats to the company the initial findings et cetera and after that the responsibility is to simply liquidate the assets in three hours capital wind down the company and pay out proceeds in accordance with the insolvency priority of payments and so what will be the priority of which creditors will be paid first or is it that everybody is going to get kind of like the same percentage of the assets that's a really good question so this normally is you know what they call certain liquidation waterfall priority payments and assuming we're all unsecured creditors of trials capital all they have are unsecured creditors then yes we would basically recover pro rata what is known as pirate pursuit so if three hours capital has a million dollars in there and they owe us a million dollars each recover 500 thousand dollars but what happens is that pretty much every jurisdiction in the world your statute that comes in uh statutory regulations sort of commit modify that so you would normally have your insults practitioners let's say pineal they would be paid out first good for them then the lawyers will be paid out first certain employees who paid out first it's normally a sort of protected class there tax liabilities will be paid out first and then from there you have potentially secured creditors secured creditors will be paid out ahead of the unsecured creditors out of the collateral that is secure but apart from that trend is in the same class which recoveries for rata and then so i'm sorry so that would mean that companies like voyager and genesis where would they rank unfortunately it appears that voyager's unsecured creditor against capital so they will share with all of the unsecured creditors and triangles captain unfortunately not very high up and i wouldn't expect that to be recovering that much to be honest okay so do you have any sense at the moment what for for those who are unsecured what amount it is that they might be able to expect or what percentage of the assets that they had loaned that they might expect we can't say that because we don't know how much assets are at three hours capital we don't know the value of those assets and that's actually uh you know that's the point we're going to need more clarity from from liquidators because if i may i'm happy to sort of chat about the sort of assets that might be a tree arrows capital so the easiest bids right if it uh cash in the bank account right that's that's simple and they've got liquid trip to assets let's say you've got bitcoins for each solana stuff that you can sell and the bvi called all this specifically gave the liquidators the power to sell these crypto assets into u.s dollars usdt and usdc they would also have and this is the interesting bits they would also have a lot of illiquid assets for instance you would expect them to have a large large amount of luna too they would likely have a lot of locked tokens they would likely have a lot of equity in private companies which they cannot easily sell they would also probably nfps uh and this whole saturday night capital then this uh is a whole discussion until itself saturday night being a sub fund of treehouse capital and finally there's also the contract rights and that's kind of what sue came out to tweet about right he's disappeared for a bit and they showed up to accuse the creators of reaching their duties because they didn't exercise certain certain uh warrants for starkwear tokens so there's some assets that are in there right now and it's not easy to value all of them at this moment i'll be very interested to see how liquidator does that and just out of curiosity so is was sue correct in saying that they had reached their fiduciary duty by not exercising those warrants probably not so it's incredibly difficult for a creditor or and especially credit as a founder in this case the company to look at is generally just unfound liable as long as they're acting reasonably in good faith and we have to know that what's the role of liquidator here the rule of liquidator is to preserve the assets of the company and maximize value for the creditors as a whole and well yes in this case sue is a creditor so you may ask all right so why don't they maximize value by exercising the stock where tokens i think there's just two points to make here one uh denial probably aren't crypto natives and they've only just come into the company so for them to sort of make a call as to whether this is a good investment it's it may be also gonna embed and they may just say we don't want to give up cash which is it can be distributed to creditors in exchange for these tokens which may be locked they may not be as liquid as you want them to be so that's probably the the first piece and the second piece is well you're unliquidated your job is to liquidate the company it's not to make more investments it's not too you know it's not to keep running the business the neo isn't here to keep running three hour schedule it's here to just sell stuff get rid of stuff liquidating into acids that can be distributed to um creditors well it's incredibly fascinating so in a moment we're going to talk about some of the other developments uh both with 3ac as well

extension from google chrome's app store today back to my conversation with wassie lawyer so subsequently 3ac filed for chapter 15 bankruptcy can you explain what that is yeah sure so chapter 15 is actually a recognition a procedure in the us so when when the rumors swallowing around 3ac going down there was some discussion among sort of colleagues other songs professionals around where 3ac where trees he might go into an insolvency procedure the obvious choices were a bvi because they were covered in bdi b singapore because they headquarters in their operations substantially out of singapore nc in the u.s via perhaps chapter 11 because first of all the us came to a very wide jurisdiction and secondly i think i saw some documents where all claims on twitter that they have a fair bit of dealings with us counterparties what happened eventually is we went to pdi company and the creditors went to bdi now you've got a bva order and this needs a bvi liquidation order and business be recognized around the world so that's what the chapter 15 procedure brought me was which is they're taking this pci called order and saying to to the u.s look i've i've done this in the dvi now i need to recognize the fact that this country company is in liquidation and the liquidators are now in control and reasoning this recognition is because that's how you that's how you exercise and liquidate its powers in the us against u.s assets because what happens in liquidation is sue and cal are out of the picture they are still direct company but they have to disenfranchise and the liquidator steps in and liquidator x basically wields all the power that sue and kyle used to use to build so i would expect um almost exac a similar procedure to happen in singapore given the fact that operations are in singapore the banking council presumably in singapore i expected a recognition sort of a sort of recognition procedure to be found in singapore sooner or later okay so basically sounds like that was a positive development for creditors yes like it oh okay so something is that even as we record the whereabouts of zhu and davies have remained unknown although it was revealed that they did leave singapore does that mean anything for the bankruptcy and liquidation process it's a really good question and it's one that i have been asked a lot by my friends in the crypto space because you can talk forever about what a law is but at the end of the day you kind of have to think about practical repercussions and everything right so i guess they're affecting some shoe levels i mean firstly how does it affect the role of liquidator first of all not much they're still getting charged now so they can do whatever they want they can deal with their best company they can seek regulation all this they can pay out creditors they pay our employees et cetera so liquidator services sitting happy doesn't matter what where where suicidal but practically you'd say wait a minute sue and kyle are holding on to all of these private keys some of these you know assets maybe off exchange wallets they may develop private wallets called wallets what do we do now and this is a difficult question it really is because what you could do if they were in the jurisdiction that you are comfortable with let's say they were in the u.s or they were in bvi or they're in singapore you go ahead and you seek a call order and one of those jurisdictions that say sue and cow you guys interact with the company please head over the keys to the liquidators and if they don't they get found in contact with god and there's trap there's this actual permanently there's actual jail time being threatened here and you would think that they would probably you know comply rather than go to jail i think right away this that makes things a lot more difficult because your body where they are and you start going after them and the and the jurisdiction of choice everybody just move countries so that is difficult i suspect that they will end up cooperating and this is not so much this makeup's anecdotal because they're fairly young guys they don't want to straight up become futurists and what is likely to happen is in my opinion what may happen is to me or we just offer them some sort of deal like here's a small amount of money for cooperating because that's cheaper than bringing you the card or trying to enforce all of these things they also have kids so that's another fair point there's another point to make if you've got the kids if you've got kids you don't want them to be you want money in a bank account that's clear you don't want to be a fugitive you don't want to have be basically a party in the banking system another question that i have about this whole situation is that zhu tweeted sadly our good faith to cooperate with the liquidators was met with baiting and he talked he kind of had these screenshots of the letters that his lawyer sent to liquidators and i was wondering were zhu and his lawyer in the right or were the liquidators okay in having you know gotten it was something like they got information from them and you and his lawyer didn't realize that they were going to use it for something else it was something like that but i just wondered like if you had any opinion and who was actually in the right we didn't see the entire correspondence we just saw few snippets coming out of of his lawyers my take on it is the liquidus of the top they're fully in the right to request information and in fact that is what they should be doing because the liquidus have just come in they've only been appointed about two weeks and three hours capital is a massive fund with a lot of you know contractual obligations that may be a greener paper some of it is you know complete orally via emails via whatsapp text messages etc etc and it certainly should be the case that they should be asking for for information and you know ideally he is cooperative the directors definitely should be cooperating liquidation situations like this and then a new york bankruptcy court ordered the remaining assets of 3ac frozen how might this affect the outcome it's essentially just to stop sue and cal from dissipating the assets even further um if they have at all so it's essentially just to protect the essence of the company and so at this point what would you say are the chances that any of three of these counterparties will get anything back and why don't we focus on the unsecured creditors or or i mean you can go through all the categories actually because that actually is still interesting i think the unsecured credits are the big ones because the secure ones are normally quite comfy given the thing the sports are over collateralized some of them are on chain so you know you just sold off the assets and cut it out you still liquidated the collateral and sort of got throughout sound like quite comfy it's the it's the unsecured creditors and i think the big one and all this would be voyager and voyages account holders we can touch on that later so i think this comes down to what assets are in there and what assets the liquidator is able to realize i'm particularly interested in what they're going to do with the tokens they're still investing because there's definitely a lot of money locked up in that are they going to option to someone are they going to sell otc to someone else how does that play out that's a question for me and the other big question about is how about the monies that are brought to 3ac this creates the accredited to anyone else who maybe hasn't paid that money now they didn't know that 3ac has sort of gone into insolvency so it's also the role for liquidator to investigate what claims can be made against potential trade counter bodies against potential persons that may have transacted trierro's capital in the past it's also the response to liquidators to pursue claims against sue and carl themselves because one of the and i checked this uh before this call one of the key principles doctrines in insolvency law is that of wrongful trading or reckless trading depending on what uh jurisdiction you're in and is essentially a principle which states that if a director knows or should have known that a company is insulted or about to become insolvent and they continue trading anyway that director could become personally liable and be asked to contribute funds into the pool for creditors sharing and the reason for this obviously is to stop directors that are deeply underwater from simply making very very high risk leveraged bats to try and trade out hole and it almost seems like exactly what treyarch's capital did right right and didn't work out super well no it didn't work out super well so would you say that creditors will probably get nothing or what's your if you were to make they absolutely would they would get something the question is what they're getting and i think i think this i think there's probably going to be a creditor's meeting soon enough and the moment credit is attended meeting and the liquidators provide an update stuff that's likely going to leak and we'll probably have a better picture of what assets tree arrows capital half and what sort of claims that you created subsuring because the liquidators are almost always making a call they're always making a cost-benefit analysis now like if i sue cow it's my chances of recovery higher than you know simply not suing him it's all about maximizing the values of acting in good faith in acting decently etc okay so let's switch gears just for the last question obviously this week we also saw that celsius filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy what is your take on kind of what this step means in particular for celsius account holders so chapter 11 is incredibly different from a liquidation chapter 11 is a bankruptcy proceeding in the u.s and what is intended to do is for cells just to sort of reorganize its debts reorganize its liabilities so that it will emerge as a company going forward so we have this so so it's the same as voyager so voyage and celsius at the end of the insolvency procedures will remain as companies whereas trial schedule will not because it's being liquidated so now onto celsius and what it means for account holders so firstly i have to stay up front i don't know because we don't have as much details on celsius yet as we do on voyageur voyager has a very detailed chapter on filing there's a plan of reorganization that happened discussed briefly whereas with celsius or the status we're filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy now so watch this space yeah and i should note that for various reasons we are recording this on thursday at 11 a.m eastern time so there who knows if there will be more information in the hours following the recording of this show but at the moment this is what we have absolutely and i mean so the chapter 11 documents of it filed it shows information that's i guess it's not very helpful because you kind of think what it's kind of a thick box exercise for them to file the check in the filing and they take the box that says that we have one to ten billion dollars available in assets for distribution and we have one to ten billion dollars in liabilities you can see there's an incredibly large range so you could have nine billion liabilities one billion assets um so we just don't know at this point just take the box which says that they have 100 000 creditors so it's helpful you know we know that they have a ton of account holders um maybe the interesting point here which you can discuss in the absence of further information is this custody point which which has come up a fair bit recently like laura you're sort of familiar with that but you're talking about how for a centralized platform like celsius customers don't have custody over their assets sort of so when you are someone who has deposited monies or assets into uh something like celsius you ideally want there to be a custodial relationship when everything goes under because what happens you know you should recall we discussed earlier that the unsecured credit is all share in the pool if assets are being deemed to be held in custody they are not sharing that pool so you kind of get all of those assets back it doesn't go to other creditors you got to share it for the creditors oh if you're segregated you mean if they're segregated exactly so um the sort of bad news for people generally is that i think celsius is quite explicit about the fact that as long as if there's positive money and you're earning interest on it your funds aren't held in custody they are not segregated in insolvency and you approve this unsecured creditor i think the equivalent here is let's say your average bank depositor right if you if you deposit money into your average to your local bank you're actually an unsecured credit of the bank and the reason you're protected is because your statutory rights or you know insurances that protect you up to a certain amount okay so basically at the moment it doesn't look so good for celsius customers it doesn't look so good for celsius customers um celsius has all lined up with the same firm as voyager curtain alice i think we can maybe look at the voyager fighting to see what celsius saucers might look to do because i think at this point there is a certain opacity around what celsius has done we know that they have made some you know fairly high risk trades they've sort of made some if there's to put money into this gptc state each etc that didn't play out very well for them but i think at this point we're not very clear where the whole the balance sheet has come out of whereas i think in voyager's case we're not very it's not very clear what where where the the shortfall has come from okay all right well then i guess we'll have to see as more news trickles in um where we think this is headed but anyway this has been uh like an information packed episode i so appreciate that you came unchained so thank you thank you very much i'm glad i was helpful don't

link in the description [Music] thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap celsius files for chapter 11 bankruptcy reveals 1.2 billion deficit in addition to celsius filing for bankruptcy later on thursday as more news trickled out bloomberg reported that celsius's largest creditor pharaoh's capital aka lantern ventures actually seems to be connected to ftx founder and ceo sam binkman freed pharaoh's capital's chief executive officer tara mcauley is a co-founder of alameda research and worked at another organization with sbf three additional staff had also worked for spf linked organizations though alameda told bloomberg the trading firm currently has no relationship with lantern ventures similarly celsius revealed that it had a 1.2 billion hole in its balance sheet that includes an estimate that its holdings of the cel token are worth 600 million dollars after the news of the bankruptcy filing the cel token was down more than 10 percent however some analysts told coindesk they believed that this could be a fresh start for the company and that the token price may rebound as the bankruptcy process goes on celsius mining the btc mining subsidiary of celsius also initiated voluntary chapter 11 protection on wednesday this was not the only entity that joined its parent company seeking bankruptcy protection as six other subsidiaries follow the same path in march celsius mining had submitted a draft registration statement with the u.s sec to become a publicly listed company however these plans will not be fulfilled due to these recent developments the crypto lender also made other news this week the firm has repaid in full its debt to d5 protocols maker compound and ave after doing this celsius reclaimed hundreds of millions of dollars worth of collateral especially in bitcoin ether and steath the liquid staking derivative of ether on tuesday celsius reclaimed 416 000 teeth from ave worth more than 400 million dollars and the markets are fearing a massive sell-off of that collateral as a consequence the steep discount which is the difference between the price of steath versus the price of eth widened to 4 percent inflation hits a 40-year high the u.s consumer price index or cpi reached 9.1 percent in june its highest number in more than 40 years the increase in the prices of gas food and housing were the most significant contributors to this month's cpi the consumer price index measures the overall change in consumer prices over time based on a representative basket of goods and services persistent high inflation is not good for a country especially if it's unintended the fed which is responsible for controlling inflation is now pressured to push further with higher interest rates which is the only tool it has to achieve its goal of price stability there's almost nothing in an economy that can escape this decision from the fed as the interest rate represents the price of money for crypto it would mean that there is less money for investments in new projects less innovation and a potential sell-off to purchase safer assets the fear of a huge increase in the interest rate is already in the market is already pricing in an 85 percent probability of a 100 pips increase or plus one percent in the feds rate in the next meeting which will be on july 27th the last time the fed hiked 100 bips was in 1984 said macroeconomic researcher jim bianco one of the main narratives around btc is that it is supposed to serve as inflation hedge because of its monetary policy however the inflation rate is at its highest in decades and btc has not been able to serve that purpose market has shown bitcoin should be thought of as a monetary debasement hedge not necessarily a hedge against cpi inflation said will clemente a bitcoin analyst open c lays off 20 of its staff thursday afternoon open c announced it would be laying off 20 of its employees this was communicated internally by open c ceo devin finzer in the company slack we have entered an unprecedented combination of crypto winter and macroeconomic uncertainty said fencer he added that openc would now be in a position to resist up to five years of a crypto winter open c volumes are down to about 12 million dollars worth a day whereas this past winter they were above 100 million dollars daily coinbase loses market share to its competitors coinbase the largest crypto exchange in the us and the first to be publicly listed is struggling amid market conditions the crypto exchange continues to lose market share to its global competitors according to research analyst dan dolev coinbase seems to be having troubles both in relative and absolute terms in november 2021 it had a monthly trading volume of seven billion dollars whereas the estimate for july puts it at roughly 1.2 billion dollars a month if we compare the same months coinbase had 5.3 percent of the global trading volume in november and now it only accounts for two point nine percent dole of targets coined to be priced at forty two dollars as of today the stock is worth fifty three dollars and forty two cents last month coinbase was downgraded by goldman sachs which gave a recommendation to short the company with a price target of 45 vc funding for crypto is down 22 according to a report from the block research venture funding for blockchain related projects suffered a 22 decline in the last quarter going from 12.5 billion to 9.8 billion this was the first time that the sector took a dive in vc funding since the second quarter of 2020 however to put the drawback into context crypto venture funding accounted for 629 million dollars in q2 of 2020. even though this quarter's numbers were down against the previous quarters they are still 15 times higher than only two years ago the reason for this decline is most likely a combination of the macroeconomic environment the possibility of interest rate hikes and recession and the state of the crypto market in general with many companies going bankrupt and laying off employees something worth noting is that vc funding is a lagging indicator this is because there might be a considerable time between when the deals are announced and when they are made public it appears that smaller projects were the ones that suffered the most the deals under 50 million dollars accounted for 50 percent of the total amount invested during the first quarter and they now account for only 44 voyager token soars amidst short squeeze since tuesday the token of distressed crypto company voyager has experienced a massive spike in its price byg was trading at roughly 15 cents reaching a high of 94 cents which accounts for over a 500 percent increase it is now settled at around 40 cents it appears that a short squeeze was behind this massive appreciation pumping coins of insolvent businesses seems to be becoming a meta ck chung investment analyst at defiance capital told coindesk similar pumps have happened to tara's lunc token and luna's cel token mostly because of a short squeeze cz wanted to help but received harsh criticism on monday binance ceo tang pang zhao tweeted that a potential exploit had been found on uniswap according to the wallet provided by cz hacker was able to steal 7574 eth which are worth nearly eight million dollars immediately after cece's tweet the uni token fell by as much as 21 however hayden adams ceo and founder of uniswap confirmed that this had nothing to do with the vulnerability of unisop's code this was a phishing attack that resulted in some lp nfts being taken from individuals who approved malicious transactions he said chain link god a crypto influencer said that cz's tweet seems like an incredibly irresponsible thing to tweet considering the fact that it was not an exploit finance was also in the news this week because the platform experienced a massive spike in bitcoin trading volumes after the implementation of the zero fee policy went live last friday this provided the incentives to perform wash trading a market manipulation strategy for that reason cz said binance would exclude btc trading from vip calculations in order to remove all incentives to wash trade and according to reuters binance continued to allow trading in iran despite being banned by the us government to operate in that country time for fun bits elon musk tries to terminate the deal with twitter but he is laughing about it elon musk decided to terminate the deal to purchase twitter for 44 billion dollars in the letter sent by musk's lawyer it said that twitter has not complied with its contractual obligations this refers to musk's contention that twitter allegedly didn't disclose the number of bots that are part of its platform despite musk's intentions it doesn't look like he is going to have it easy the twitter board is committed to closing the transaction on the price and the terms agreed upon with mr musk and plans to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement said twitter's board chair brett taylor however musk took it quite lightly and posted this meme on twitter which reads they said i couldn't buy twitter then they wouldn't disclose bot info now they want to force me to buy twitter in court now they have to disclose bot info all right thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about wassi lawyer and the bankruptcies of 3ac
