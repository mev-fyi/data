of money volumes 1 2 and 3. welcome andreas thank you so much for having me on the show laura in recent weeks there's been a controversy on crypto twitter about what the actual supply of ether was and whether or not it is independently verifiable before we get into the particulars about the total eat supply though can you just explain why this metric is important to some people and to whom it is important um well i'm i'm i'd have to speculate on their state of mind but i'll try my best i think it's important because it's a framing assumption that drives the interest in bitcoin uh bitcoin from the beginning uh was defined by its fixed uh and immutable supply of no more not even up to 21 million coins and a fixed issuance schedule that is um set in stone or rather set on the blockchain which is even stronger and will not change it's um it's also one of the key characteristics because bitcoin is first and foremost money and uh in fact it's money of a particular kind it's hard money or sound money and that drives a lot of its appeal especially within some groups who are interested in it with a very specific austrian economics ideological interests and so then once this debate had been going on for a few days he finally wrote up a tweet storm that was really interesting and dug into some of the technicalities that uh informed this question and in that tweet storm you begin it by saying that this debate was a silly gotcha why did you say that well because it reminds me of the kind of questions that reflect um some very deep-seated framing assumptions um and an inability to see past those framing assumptions that is so often leveled against bitcoin by people who don't understand why bitcoin matters or what it is and to see it being used by people who are very much interested in bitcoin against ethereum and to frame that question with some very specific assumptions behind it that don't actually make a lot of sense in the ethereum context it seemed to me to be not necessarily a good faith question or even a very interesting question to answer and um and a lot of the pushback to the answers that had been given to that question um further reinforced that framing so that's why i didn't think it was it was a very useful question i mean there's plenty to criticize about ethereum there's also plenty to criticize about bitcoin if we're being honest and i just didn't think that that was a particularly valid um criticism and then you did explain for technical reasons why this question doesn't necessarily make sense for ethereum or why it is actually difficult to answer what are some of those reasons to just to clarify because i think this point has been lost um ethereum supply has validated every block and it's validated according to the consensus rules and everybody who runs an ethereum node their node validates the supply there's no difference in that fundamental mechanic from bitcoin's fundamental consensus rules with regards to validation of supply the difference is that because of a variety of factors um that are different in bitcoin than in ethereum in bitcoin there is a specific api method you can ask your node to give you the current sum uh and in ethereum it's not so easy to do that that doesn't mean there is no sum that doesn't mean that the sum isn't validated or part of the consensus rules it just seems that it just means that that's not an easily accessible answer and depending on how you write the script that comes up with the answer and the methodology you use you might come up with some slightly differing answers and but some of those just to lay them out for listeners are that ethereum uses an account balance system right as opposed to the unspent transaction output system of bitcoin they have burn addresses the block times are different ethereum also has this uncle system do you want to maybe just pick a few of those to kind of explain a little bit about why that question is somewhat difficult to answer sure absolutely um the first one is that uh bitcoin doesn't use a double entry bookkeeping account balance system instead it uses a system that's more like um tracking um fixed amount coins through the system and these are called unspent transaction outputs and at any moment in time it keeps a database of the current unspent transaction outputs and so it's it's very easy to just sum them up um so the the current state of the unspent transaction output database is easy to access ethereum doesn't use um fixed amount coins um indivisible chunks of currency as bitcoin does instead it uses a system of accounts these accounts have credits and debits these credits and debits are reconciled as part of consensus and have to add up but in order to figure out what the exact balance of any account is or to sum the balance of all the accounts you have to go back to the genesis block and then you just have to run through the pluses and minuses until you arrive at an answer and so that takes more work it takes even more work because of some historic anomalies in the um ethereum blockchain there's a period where um validating the state takes a a significant amount of computation due to a bugs that allowed a denial of service attack that's not neither here nor there you can't validate it it just takes more time and so once you add up all of these numbers you can get an answer however that answer changes every 15 seconds because bitcoin has 40 blocks in the same time sorry ethereum has 40 blocks in the same time the bitcoin has one and then let's also actually just talk for a minute about the uncle system what function does that serve in ethereum so um the on-call system is part of a consensus mechanism for the blockchain called greatest uh greedy heaviest object um states tree or something like that i don't remember the exact observed i think observed tree thank you so what what that is um is a mechanism where unlike bitcoin where the winner of the block takes all in ethereum the um spoils if you like are shared by the winner plus the second third fourth fifth place um answers so um this acts a bit like an on-chain pool mechanism almost like a mining pool on chain so in bitcoin if you want to um get a partial reward for participating in the mining of a block even when you don't win you use a mining pool and that's an off-chain system that coordinates rewards based on the share of effort you put in uh in ethereum that's an unchained system because of this protocol why it's done that way whether that's the right way or the wrong way to do it is really a matter of design philosophy but that's simply the way it's done for proof-of-work and so as this debate raged on we saw also that people were kind of gloating in the difficulty of pinning down a single number for the east supply what did that say to you that that was their attitude about it well i mean i think that kind of um attitude is both unproductive uh really because focusing too much on what what one might think about what other change should be doing instead of building their own solutions is a bit of a waste of time um i think it's also a bit of a dangerous attitude and the reason it's a bit of a dangerous attitude is because um no system is without criticism no system is without flaws uh no system um has no bugs and so if you take a position which is one of absolute purity and rejecting any um alternative perspective on anything that's dangerous because what that means is that when we do find a bug um or when the system doesn't behave as expected you have no retreat from that position so i don't like these absolutist arguments this is immature um technology that is still evolving and the same types of arguments that are being leveled against ethereum are exactly the same types of arguments that outsiders level against bitcoin so jumping up on a high horse um i think is is kind of petty and not really very productive in a moment we'll discuss ethereum 2.0 but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible with the latest ups and downs in the world's economy investors need new ways to grow their wealth nexo offers

offers until the end of september back to my conversation with andreas antonopoulos what's your opinion on ethereum 2.0 and how staking will change interest in eth as money i think ethereum um has been migrating towards proof of stake for a very long time and that's one of the reasons why criticizing this proof-of-work system doesn't really make sense because you know it's just an interim system i don't know whether proof of stake really makes ethereum better money i still think that some of the design tradeoffs required to run a smart contracts platform that make ether a utility token for the explicit purpose of being used as gas to meter the execution of smart contracts all of these things involve some pretty fundamental design trade-offs which in my mind don't make ethereum um primarily sound money it can have the function of money also just like gasoline can yeah sure you primarily use it to put it in your car but you could build an underground thousand gallon tank and use that to barter in the apocalypse um and some people are i'm sure are hoarding gas or beans um that doesn't make those things money um even though they have value so and again you know i have this i have a similar and opposite impression of bitcoin which is that bitcoin isn't a good platform for smart contracts and that's a good thing because it was never meant to be and shouldn't try to be because everything that it does to be sound money um kind of undermines its ability to be a smart contracts platform and vice versa and these compromises serve a purpose um these trade-offs serve a purpose i've talked about this extensively in a video i call the lion and the shark where i describe um these types of divergent evolution where you have a cryptocurrency or blockchain that is an apex predator within its own domain of applications just like the line is a apex predator in the savannah and the shark is an apex predator of the ocean and kind of comparing them or trying to apply the framing assumptions of one on the other doesn't make sense um so to give you to take that analogy a bit further criticizing ethereum for um its total supply is a bit like the um denizens of the savannah saying well shark you you don't have sharp claws and four paws so you can't run and catch gazelles and we all know that catching gazelles is the most important thing in the savannah um you know sure it's it's a valid argument if that's what you're trying to do but that's not what the shark is trying to do and it doesn't make sense to criticize the shark for not having claws any more than it it makes sense to criticize the lion from looking really ridiculous when it's trying to swim in the ocean these are not systems that compete directly against each other and not because they're weak but because their strength lies in specialization that adapts them for one purpose while cement simultaneously maladapting them for other purposes and that's a good thing we need specialization um so you know that's why i think it's it's all a silly argument and you you can go on forever down that path um but the bottom line is they're not really competing so you view them as eventually coexisting comfortably yeah absolutely and and they'll be joined by many other species um that won't have money as their main purpose but we'll have still value and use in different applications and contexts and and i think there are some real trade-offs here you can't just pretend they're not there and that when you make a choice to become really good at one thing you kind of have to become less good at something else and and and then again there's all of the competitors that say we're good at everything we're the low fee fast propagation completely decentralized cheap smart contracts platform usually they tend to suck at all of those things right so the jack of all trades doesn't work either that doesn't mean that everything has to be single purpose only it just means that there is a benefit to a degree of specialization and adaptation in one direction is necessarily maladaption in another this is kind of a two-part question but obviously over the course of bitcoin's history we've seen that there's been competing visions and now they've kind of slid off into their own coins but in terms of bitcoin as sound money it does feel like it's steering more in the direction of digital gold instead of as you know kind of like a medium of exchange which is maybe now what bitcoin cash i was trying to do or originally tried to do and i just wondered um at the same time we're also seeing that bitcoin is kind of in a very interesting position because of these larger macro forces with the pandemic and the quantitative easing and even the fact that the having happened at the same time as all that so i wondered um how you thought these current events will affect that uh vision of bitcoin as money or maybe what has been happening more in you know the fact that it's maybe gotten more in the direction of digital gold like do you think we will ever use it more as like currency yeah actually i i think we will um it is true that the the compromises required to make something very sound money and very decentralized end up hurting when it comes to the ease of transmitting transactions at low fee which is exactly the argument that bitcoin cash makes against bitcoin um in a very similar way to to the to the cheap argument that we heard against ethereum um but the we can make some adjustments to that compromise and i think the lightning network which is uh technology that i'm working my writing my next book on is is part of that solution but what the pandemic what the um stimulus what the enormous debt has crystallized for bitcoin is that um soundness um soundness combines and relies very much on the permissionless nature and the very strong element of decentralization the bitcoin has to have because when the going gets tough what we're going to see is enormous pushback against bitcoin not only will it be not only will it be kind of maligned as the currency of criminals and all of that the cheap propaganda tricks we've seen before but um if we do end up in a situation where the economic crisis deepens um i think history tells us that it's going to be blamed um so those who seek an exit through bitcoin will be blamed for causing the trouble in the primary economy we've seen that story play out many times in many countries right it's it's it's never mismanagement internally it's always foreign elements and strange people who are making choices that undermine our patriotic destiny right um for that reason i think being permissionless being robust being censorship resistant is much more important than being a cheap transaction currency because when the going gets tough they just shut down the cheap transaction currency and then you have nothing left and that is going to validate i think the the model for bitcoin which is also why i find this whole argument um a bit silly i think some of it goes from comes from some uncertainty or insecurity about bitcoin i don't think bitcoin needs defending by gatekeepers or people who will protect you from being drawn into the scam of ethereum um i think it stands on its own two legs solidly and doesn't need defenders gatekeepers cheerleaders etc you explain it and those who need it get it and and will absolutely use it um and and nothing especially in alt ethereum can challenge it in that way so you know no one hired these gatekeepers um and and if necessary you're fired there you go see easy and i also wanted to ask you about ethereum which i also feel is at an interesting stage of development because of what's happening with d5 yeah at the same time that is trying to transition to ethereum 2.0 and while a bunch of competitors are waiting in the wings how do you see all of that playing out well um i've said before um that the ethereum is the next ethereum just like bitcoin is the next bitcoin these competitors in the wings face a fundamental innovation dilemma that they can't solve which is differentiate not enough and you lose to network effect differentiate too much and you're no longer solving the same problem and you lose the network effect the ecological niche that the shark ethereum has uh occupied in the ocean of defy is occupied done um it would take an enormous misstep uh to lose that position and so those waiting in the wings aren't really going to be very successful in my mind any more than all of the other things that we're trying to challenge bitcoin were so it doesn't concern you at all that ethereum 2.0 looks like it's still quite a ways out from being finalized and fully here well i mean the the the phase zero launched august first uh sorry august four tests yeah yeah um it's it's not just the test i mean it's it is running on testnet for now but it is a a full uh implementation of a beacon chain with validators for the fundamental function of proof of stake and the slashing algorithm um and it's going to grow from there the the the to me that road map is very clear very solid uh very well researched and has a very good chance of succeeding exactly as is and an even better chance of succeeding with with minor modifications as needed and the thing is the ethereum culture encourages exactly that level of experimentation and part of the reason it encourages that level of experimentation is because it's not held back by trying to be sounds money and because it has the big cousin bitcoin holding that position for it which gives it some freedom to experiment much much more flexibly i think that's a huge advantage and and that also means the ethereum needs more iterations there will be some big big front page um crashes problems bugs vulnerabilities we just saw one play out yesterday with yam these things will continue to happen and there will be another ico wave and craze that will find its its platform in ethereum because that's the that's the right platform for icos whether they are very good ideas and very legitimate funding opportunities or outright scams same platform so we're going to see all of this repeat very much like we saw in 2017 and the important thing to keep in mind is that with each iteration um ethereum actually benefits from this level of experimentation and that's one of the things that make it interesting okay yeah i mean you're more of a technical person than me but looking at the high fees and everything i i did wonder oh demands already so high is this going to happen in time uh yeah but i mean and we're going to see um chains fragment off of ethereum perhaps again now especially now that ethereum classic suffered a 51 attack people are going to try and use these high fee the high fee environments to say um e2 scaling solution isn't ready on time so here's a better option well you know learn from bitcoin cash they they tried that it didn't work um the network effect and the value embedded in the chain and the development libraries and all of the other things that that ethereum has already gained uh means that people will tolerate higher fees for much longer than you expect all right i actually just want to ask you one last quick question because i saw that one of the responses to your tweet storm was that you have a blind spot for what the person called inclusiveness and they put it in quotes and uh that was meant to be a criticism of you and i it's something that i've also been criticized for and i have always found ironic because this is supposed to be a democratizing technology so i first wanted to say i appreciate that you do speak up for that but also wondered why that's something you choose to be vocal about for one thing because i think this is a historically important technology and that historically important technology only reaches its fruition if it's broadly adopted and you can't start anything on this scale by automatically excluding big chunks of the population um and gatekeeping gatekeeping all kinds of um moral um moralistic rather attitudes that have no relevance to to what we're trying to do here so it's it's important in my mind to recognize that um meritocracy is one of those um kind of illusions that serves to maintain a hierarchy and maintain unequal access to opportunity and you can't just sit back and let the market play out when when it when the market itself isn't a level playing field when um all of the things are tilted in a certain way since i've benefited from that you know i'm on the downstream end of that tilted playing field and everything rolls my way quite comfortably um i i think it's it's important to do whatever i can and i encourage others to also to change that now i'm not forcing that on anyone you don't want to play my game that's fine i won't come to your conference but at the same time you can invite whoever you want um right now i'm not going to any conference anyway so it doesn't really make a difference um but that's the principle i go by and uh and if you can't respect that or if that causes you to feel uncomfortable about following me on twitter bye-bye i'm quite comfortable with not giving you all of my free work for free um there are plenty of people who understand what i'm trying to do and i'm much more interesting interested in in giving them more power sorry if that was a bit harsh but you know i feel strongly about these things and um very often the backlash i get for being interested in technologies like ethereum is accompanied by all kinds of other ad hominem attacks that have to do with my political opinions my opinions on inclusivity etc etc let me let me be very clear about this part of the reason people get so upset about this is this it causes them great cognitive dissonance that they are um in agreement with many of the things i say and think that they are well reasoned and well thought out arguments and then they come across an opinion that is in complete opposition to what they believe yet they sense that it's also well reasoned that cognitive dissonance can only be resolved by kicking me to the curb well i'm quite happy to encourage more cognitive dissonance um some people eventually break through that yeah i i just have to say i probably agree with you on a lot of those points and i really do appreciate that you stand up for what you believe in and you're willing to take those attacks so take it from a woman of color in the space well thank you so much i i appreciate that all right well thank you so much for coming on unconfirmed it's been so much fun chatting with you yeah i think the the first um one of the first interviews you did on your your show i was uh an invited guest and it's been way too long so why don't we do this again sometime yes we definitely should we'll we'll have you on my longer show again um i'll i'll reach out to you to arrange that thank you so much laura thank you don't forget next up is the weekly news recap [Music] thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap first headline microstrategy is first public company to buy bitcoin it seems the pandemic and other macro forces are prompting investors to take a closer look at bitcoin for the first time a publicly traded company has bought bitcoin as part of its investment strategy microstrategy announced on tuesday that it purchased 21 000 bitcoins at an aggregate of 250 million dollars microstrategy ceo michael j saylor said quote our investment in bitcoin is part of our new capital allocation strategy which seeks to maximize long-term value for our shale shareholders this investment reflects our belief that bitcoin as the world's most widely adopted cryptocurrency is a dependable store of value and an attractive investment asset with more long-term appreciation potential than holding cash meanwhile the correlation rate between bitcoin and gold has reached 70 percent for the first time which suggests that at least some do agree with sailor's view of bitcoin as a dependable store of value next headline the rise and fall of yam yam a yield farming token launched on tuesday generated tons of community enthusiasm and criticism at one point had 500 million dollars locked in it and then collapsed within a few days described as an experiment in fair farming events and elasticity yam came together in 10 days and combined the features of projects including compound ample fourth and yfi despite being completely unaudited the yam token rose from zero to 138 dollars within 20 hours of launch leading shape-shift ceo eric voorhees to label it a scam or at least quote fairly transparent pump and dump nonsense after rising to a market cap of 60 million dollars in two days the yam team first found a bug that they thought could be fixed if enough votes 1.6 million yam were delegated for a fix to be submitted before the next rebase which was to happen the following morning at first it looks like it would succeed because enough whales had planned to chip in to reach quorum however once the votes were submitted the team figured out that the bug also affected the governance module so the proposal could not succeed at that point the market cap collapsed to zero within 35 minutes and approximately 750 thousand dollars worth of funds was lost with em founders tweeting apologies and replies condemning their irresponsibility yam has said in a blog post that it is planning to launch a new version of the protocol hopefully the team will heed the words of lefteris karapetsus a central figure from the days of the dao who wrote an amazing blog post i urge you all to read that chronicled every step of the yam fiasco and why this whole thing could have been avoided as he puts it quote the minimum precaution that should have been taken is write contract tests have some sort of security audit of the code if you claim it's an experiment then treat it as such by putting deposits deposit limits in the code to protect your users putting an escape hatch in the code to protect your users all of this is worth a read for his explanation of also why this was a ponzi game in which as he puts it quote the first farmers were incentivized to pump and shill yam via social media so they could find victims onto whom to dump their tokens after the rebase next headline ethereum transactions transaction fees reach all-time high ethereum gas fees reached an all-time high of 6.9 million dollars on wednesday meaning 2017's previous high of 4.6 million dollars bitcoin transaction fees have remained low in comparison reaching only 1.4 million dollars in total on the same day the numbers reflect a high demand for ethereum and a willingness to pay for that high demand but pose questions about entry points for other layer ones if ethereum 2.0 continues to roll out slowly next line coinbase plans to offer loans to crypto investors plus resigns from the blockchain association coinbase is branching out from its conservative routes starting this fall the exchange is planning to offer cash loans with eight percent interest for bitcoin-backed loans and credit lines capped at twenty thousand dollars coinbase's sales pitch directly appeals to consumers who don't like paying taxes on what is usually their considerable crypto gains on wednesday afternoon a waitlist opened on coinbase with the tagline have you ever needed cash for something urgent like a car or home repair in the past you might have sold bitcoin to cover it and incurred a taxable gain or loss now you don't have to although coinbase plans to only offer bitcoin collateralized loans initially they do have plans to expand into other crypto assets and are pursuing licenses in other states beyond the initial 17 in which they will launch in other coinbase news the company represent from the cryptocurrency and blockchain advocacy group the blockchain association in a statement issued by coinbase the company said that its decision to resign was based on the association's actions in recent weeks industry watchers say that the catalyst was the admittance of rival binance.us to the association which is a subsidiary of binance the global exchange known for playing fast and loose with regulation finance u.s launched only 11 months ago but already has around 40 crypto to usd trading pairs while in contrast coinbase which has a reputation of being more cautious with regulators has about half of that next headline jpmorgan leading consensus fund raising with 20 million dollar investment the blog is citing unnamed sources to report that jp morgan plans to invest 20 million dollars toward ethereum infrastructure firm consensus which has been trying for months to raise money the plan is part of a 50 million convertible debt deal with other investors as part of the deal consensus would also take over the maintenance and support of jpmorgan chase's quorum assets consensus has previously been involved in several high-profile enterprise implementations that use quorum next we have our hacks attacks and crimes roundup another 51 on ethereum classic coming five days after the august first attack ethereum classic suffered yet another assault which took 1.7 million dollars from the network adding further scrutiny to the question of whether or not the blockchain possesses the ability to protect itself from meaningful exploits next in the roundup bin publishes postmortem on the eth put exploit the open team released a detailed analysis in response to the exploit however the fact of the matter is they cannot turn the protocol off and so once the exploit was discovered all they could do was minimize further damage next how north korean hackers laundered millions from a bit this deep dive into the methods used in 2019 that led to 283 million dollars worth of cryptocurrencies being stolen from the south korean crypto exchange upbeat shows that hackers moved over move the funds over 10 hops or often created multiple intermediate wallets before sending the funds to an exchange and at last in this roundup the department of justice seizes millions in bitcoin from al qaeda isis and hamas the doj says that it seized bitcoin from 155 addresses allegedly used by al qaeda having obtained the money through telegram channels al-qaeda having obtained the money through telegram channels fortune gives the details on how full agents from us into sending bitcoin straight to the us government next headline fred ursim on crypto native insurance with all the hacks and exploits in d5 insurance is on the minds of many in the space fred ursim of paradigm capital wrote a comprehensive post about crypto native insurance and the design challenges it poses including the especially tricky question of whether or not payouts should be manual or programmatic while entirely programmatic systems do sound ideal as ethereum creator vitalik buterin pointed out if an insurance system is programmed to make a payout when x event happens then token teams presumably would know that they should build into their protocols a way to prevent x from happening so this kind of leads the insurance to seem moot if it's already accounted for by the token teams all right fun bits vitalik scraps ethereum 2.0 to audit supply of ethereum for those of you who were following the eighth supply date that andreas and i discussed earlier coin jazeera weighed in with a story reporting that vitalik will be abandoning ethereum 2.0 to find the true supply of ethereum and the story asks whether the fact that the supply isn't unknown is due to ethereum's infamous lsd-themed sex parties alright thanks for
