here's something um a bit ominous so there's we're talking about GTX earlier and there's already a couple other claims marketplaces out there including one called X claim um where you can trade you and your FTX claim or your block by claim or whatever and it's funny because it's you know kind of morbid because it looks like a normal sort of Finance startup kind of thing but they're sort of like green and emojis around like these these bankruptcies and like people trading their their claims of these bankruptcies and they have like a pending section so like they have silvergate and Gemini like stay tuned we're monitoring it's like an upcoming product and I feel like it's just like very you know uh it's it's funny when like uh that's where my father starts to do that but like you know I certainly hope not I certainly hope there's no uh upcoming product here
