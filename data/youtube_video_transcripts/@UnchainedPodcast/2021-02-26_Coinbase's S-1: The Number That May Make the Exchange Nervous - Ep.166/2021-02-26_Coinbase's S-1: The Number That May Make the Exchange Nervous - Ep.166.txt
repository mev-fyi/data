editor at decrypt and author of kings of crypto welcome jeff hey laura always a pleasure the most recent big crypto news this week was the coinbase s1 becoming public having written a book on coinbase you were extremely familiar with the company's history what were your big takeaways from reading this one uh yeah this was a big day i mean i think for coinbase and for crypto getting to look under the hood and discover things yeah even i didn't know um i guess a couple of big takeaways were um i mean they're killing it financially i mean 322 million dollar profit that's very good but also compared to the other big name unicorns going public i mean you know uber aaron airbnb those are all still losing money so i think the fact coinbase is profitable is impressive and also they've been on an m a spree so the amount of of money they raised also it's a bit of a wonky detail but they did a direct listing which normally means you can only sell shares you already have but a new rule by the sec lets you issue new shares meaning they could have raised more capital but they chose not to so i think just the that's one big takeaway he's surprised how well they're doing um other thing that surprised me is um i think who owns the shares i can't believe mark andreessen owns more common shares than the founder brian armstrong and also the firm andres and horowitz owns a ton of it too so that was sort of a surprise uh what else is in there another big one was um there's lots of good nuggets in there including the shift between uh institutional customers and retail customers i think two or three years ago it was 20 institutional now it's closer to 65 so i mean i think this thing's built to last i mean it's really coin bases to lose at this point you know i'm not sounding bullish because i wrote the bulk on them it's just you know i've covered a lot of startups and this is some of the nicest you know s1 results i've seen oh yeah for sure yeah no i wouldn't say that you're looking at this with rose-colored glasses because this was definitely impressive one thing that i was looking at is that um currently coinbase stores more than 90 billion dollars worth of crypto assets and um against the you know total market cap of all crypto assets that's 12 and i was just like wow one company and i really feel like that's kind of speaks to um probably one of its core values which is security you know they've kind of famously been one of the few exchanges to not ever suffer a hack so um and let's talk a little bit more about this institutional shift because i feel like this has been a major storyline in crypto over the last few months like what does that say to you when you saw that that transition has been happening within coinbase well i mean i i think it's no surprise we all knew it's happening with you know the likes of uh you know i think microstrategy was a bit of a you know an exception or when they bought start buying but when you saw square command and tesla come in and you know probably some names who don't know about are doing it too so and i don't think it's a surprise for going with coinbase because these are concern you know big companies and for you know financial advisors are conservative and they want a name they can trust um you know and for better or worse says coinbase but the other takeaway from this is for coinbase it's a double win they think probably take a nice cut for you know arranging the transaction like they did for tesla you know arrange the subtle purchases of it nice service fee for that but also their custody business too you know i bet you most of these companies are also parking their bitcoin with uh with coinbase you know for the low low fee of 25 basis points or whatever it is so i mean i think that's interesting because my one reservation financially about coinbase is it's very uh you know prone to booms and busts you know the good times they're making killing prices are up volume's up and then it all drops 80 percent so i think they're probably better poised to ride out the next crypto winter because that custody business so you know those are some my original thoughts and obviously we're still appealing to that filing but there's a lot of goodies in there including the uh setting uh satoshi on the on the on the front page i like that i know i tweeted that um sending the s1 to satoshi's address made me tear up literally um because i do and i really think that speaks to the momentousness of this occasion you know just to imagine when satoshi first sent the white paper out on that cypherpunk email list you know just i don't know how many people are in that email list but it wasn't a huge number and just to go from that white paper to then just a few people running the network and then now this massive industry has been built on this i mean it's really against all odds you know this currency that just came out of nowhere and was you know not the kind of currency that most people are used to like a brand new revolutionary thing i mean i think it's i just think it's amazing like when i tweeted that i teared up somebody tweeted back at me like i don't see why this would make you tear up blah blah blah and i was like okay clearly then you don't understand the single thing about bitcoin because like the odds to go from where we started to this like it's insane but anyway um oh did you want to add something on that no i got to hold you on that too i mean i i didn't i saw your tweet and i thought i was kind of touched too because i get it i mean i've covered bitcoin since 2013. not all in like you but you know the amount of times people have asked me this is stupid why bitcoin blah blah blah and you know it takes a bit of faith to really do it you know it's not my job as a journalist to have faith but you know i i've met so many entrepreneurs including you who basically bet your careers on moving into crypto despite the risk and i think you know coinbase going public you know almost at the size of facebook is a really validating moment for you know whatever you think of crypto and bitcoin and all the rest of it you know i just think a lot of people really put themselves on the line and work their asses off to build this up so i think for them you know it's it's a good day you know that's let's not you know diminish that yeah well so to go back to coinbase and your point about how the company's revenues really are dependent on how the crypto markets are doing that was one thing i noticed was that um 96 of the company's net revenue comes from transaction fees which you know that to me sounds like oh boy definitely going to see a lot of swings in that regard but i did wonder you know for the so for the subscriptions i was looking at what uh makes up the subscription uh part of the revenue in its custody as you mentioned but also staking the earn um you know service within coinbase where you can earn some crypto for learning about certain crypto assets and then also licensing for analytics but i just don't see any of those being like huge huge businesses the way that the exchange would be so how much do you think that shift towards subscriptions can help yeah i confess i missed that part are you saying only four percent is from non-transaction revenue yeah so right now it's like tiny tiny and and i just i don't know how you know i was kind of like hmm all right so maybe if custody gets big enough and maybe staking but like i can't imagine they make a ton of money from earn or the licensing for analytics i mean yeah that's interesting because you know the other thing you know their trouble they're facing is i think basically brokerage services can become a commodity quickly i mean look at robinhood what they've done to traditional brokerages people are used to not paying fees and as paypal gets into it as robinhood gets into it and you know maybe the big brokerages will too you know it's it's yeah that's it's a pretty uh pretty big risk for them you know the flip side is they've got some time to figure it out because they've got such uh you know war chest of cash and the numbers we saw today don't even include q1 you know that's all from you know late december when oh my god bitcoin broke 20 thousand dollars they've had like a full quarter of bitcoin at like near 50k so you know even if yeah you know even if the competitors come and cut down their profit margins they've still got this big war chest to figure something else out but i do think it's it's it's a red flag if only four percent is coming from other stuff because i know they've been talking up custody and staking the rest of it for years but the flip side is i mean if they're right the stuff will grow and if they can get their teeth into part of you know the defy market the thing is that the amount of acquisitions they've had through the venture arm and directly you know it means even if someone else springs up to you know be the new big dog in crypto there's a good chance coinbase is going to own part of it yeah yeah and my thing about coinbase 2 is i just feel like they're sort of the leaders when it comes to security and i feel like they you know no matter how well square and robin hood do in catching up like they definitely probably have to catch up when it comes to for instance detect detecting fraud on the platform or you know other probably around security like you know a number of these other things and that's why for instance robin hood at the moment doesn't allow people to withdraw crypto from the platform because they don't have you know all that infrastructure built up and the algorithms um really down and just to also go back to your point earlier about the institutions i did want to also note um just in the sheer number of institutions so it's not even just like the share of the revenue but the number of institutions um has gone seven times from what it was at the end of december 2017 and so that's over three years and you know that to me um i think really says something about this next phase of how the crypto industry will go and um coinbase looks definitely poised to capitalize on that yeah and the other thing with institutions too i mean i'm no authority on the banking industry but you watch like you know the goldman's jp morgan's you know we're gonna see bank of america saying all dipping their feet in it one thing i've learned about banks too they don't build their own tech you know they just they would much rather license it banks are not built to do tech whereas coinbase is so i mean i i can also given the existing relationships between jp morgan and goldman and coinbase you know i can see sort of like you know white labeling services or consulting or something like that which could help their revenue you know so but you know again that number you said four percent that surprises me because you know it's been three years coinbase has been talking about all these other avenues of revenue and you know four percent ain't very much yeah yeah and as far as the white labeling is going i i think paxos right now is kind of trying to corner that market so all right so in a moment we're going to discuss a little bit more about this s1 but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible crypto.com is

subscriptions more details can be found in the show notes back to my conversation with jeff roberts and so earlier you were talking about some of the coinbase executives and investors who are set to become quite wealthy off of this public offering um one name that you know isn't super familiar i think to those who follow coinbase is surojit chatterjee can you talk a little bit about who he is and um where he shows up in that ranking in terms of his shares oh yeah that surprised me because obviously to bring on talent you give them equity but i think the ranks were um you know mark andreessen brian armstrong of course co-founder fred ursam and i think fourth was a surge of chatterjee and that took me a minute i was like ooh i was like oh wait a minute that's a google guy they poached a couple years back he's your head of product but i wonder if they're having second thoughts about that i mean you know obviously he's probably doing a good job coinbase has got nice products but i was a little surprised to see um to see how much uh he was able to pocket through this yeah friendly has pretty good negotiating skills it looks like um and so another thing obviously that uh we've alluded to but i want to talk about this specifically in regards to coinbase so corporate treasuries have been quite the talk the last few months in crypto and you know obviously we've seen all these different corporations that have allocated to bitcoin and what did coinbase reveal about its treasury and s1 um it's interesting because as you know there's a lot of accounting quirks with companies owning crypto um you know one of which is i thought it would be counted as a uic on a balance sheet um cash and cash equivalents equivalents usually bonds and you know t-bills stuff like that but that's not part of it but there was a little line in there that said they own um 130 million dollars worth of bitcoin as of uh december which today would be worth probably you know double that but i think it's like 2500 bitcoins which is not very many of course they have massive amounts on behalf of other people but in their own treasury they've got that little bit of ethereum not much and a little bit of like altcoins and they're talking of their stable coins they've got a reserve of like 40 million of their like usdc proprietary stable coins and i know some people on twitter were like you know come on put your money in where your mouth is this is disappointing but i think um you know i don't want to offer them a copy but the reality with accounting is we saw this when tesla made its move uh just a quirk and gap accounting sorry if i'm boring all your listeners with this but you haven't asked it on your balance sheet you have to mark how much it's worth but for some reason crypto if it goes down you have to take an impairment and say hey your company values diminished by x much if it goes up you get to do nothing so i think when you're a fast growing startup you know that's you know basically fueled on borrowing growing fast you probably can't tie up capital or make your balance sheet look ugly that way in case of a dip so that's my best theory but i'd be curious to know yours i mean you know you watch the stuff as closely as me were you surprised oh i was really surprised by how low that those figures were um i think your theory's a good one um i have actually frankly been interested in this gap accounting thing because um i don't know much about it and i from the start i kept wondering is there any like kind of corner case where actually it works out well because you know obviously on the face of it it just seems like a bad thing um but another idea that i had was simply that you know kind of like like maybe they just want to sort of diversify um in the sense that like since their whole business really does swing with the crypto markets than to have like these additional assets that are literally going in the same direction as their whole businesses i just wondered if that's like another reason but i don't even then i just feel like if you're in it for the long term then it's sort of you know that isn't really probably something that would sway them so yeah i i don't have a super good theory of probably the accounting one is the best one but it was surprising you know well also too i think they're probably downplayed because i found this for two-thirds of the way down the filing in a like weird line and you think you know if they if they'd own more they would have put it up like you know sort of like you know proud and bold at the top and say we're doing this before other people but you look at the list of companies with the most bitcoin in their corporate treasuries i mean this puts coinbase at like number 10 or something you know yeah and they're way behind like you know even square and micro strategy and stuff so yeah it's it's it's it's curious the point i'm making is i think they were kind of aware of it which is why they buried it yeah yeah so one other thing i'm very fascinated and so i i really liked reading their risk section uh it was very long and detailed and it really fascinating to me to see how the birthday i mean it's like i guess if you follow this space it's nothing super surprising but what interested me was that they did call out the risk from decentralized exchanges and this is something i've been watching so the seven day moving average of volume on uniswap is roughly one and a half billion which is about 27 of what coinbase does and uniswap is way younger and it's much harder to use than coinbase and so you know the s1 does cite competition competition from dexes is a real factor and then i was just thinking about it you know because coinbase also lists the um competition from unregulated centralized exchanges like binance at the other end i just kind of felt like oh they could sort of be squeezed there what do you think of that barry yeah okay i think this is one area laura where we're gonna disagree a bit we're dming with this earlier you know i think dexes are cool i think they're the future and stuff but i think they're for hardcore crypto heads and you know for it's the mainstream is this stuff is still like years away you know at least five years away um and then you know there's always been you know before binance there's other cowboy exchanges there was you know bitfenix there's poloniex there was mount gox there's always been that kind of fastness exchanges and they rise and they fall but coinbase has you know kind of made his bet being the respectable one for better or worse um so i just don't think as a strategic threat the dexes are going to be uh posed a threat to them long term also i think coinbase has invested in quite a few of those dexes so you know i think they're going to win no matter what happens uh yeah so i i just i don't think it being a and finally as people say look it's it's a rising tide or like uh the pie is big enough for everyone or i'm mixing my metaphors here but this crypto is growing and growing and as long as the whole pie grows you know there's enough for everyone to eat so i you know i don't see this being a threat for um at least five years some of your listeners might agree but that's my tuesday right yeah no i i don't see it being a threat for at least five years um as well uh i just do wonder long term how that will work out because i do feel that what's different about the dexes from something like binance is that um it's sort of like well i mean i i would say the regulatory clarity around things like dexa's is is somewhat unclear but if you're you know if you've been reading the fincen guidance which tends to say oh you know uh regulations um you know if you're not custodying customers assets then um you know you don't have to follow kyc and et cetera et cetera so in that regard like at least i think some of these dexas can breathe a little bit easy in a way that like a binance couldn't so um if if it is a kind of like a more legit non-kyc version of interacting with crypto then in that regard i do feel like in the long term maybe it will really take off but you're right coinbase is invested too so yeah oh maybe uh oh sir one other sort of digression on binance it was kind of a cute i saw on on twitter today um cz congratulating brian armstrong which is kind of a nice moment because i mean there one sends bitter rivals and you know finance did his best to take coinbase out so it's kind of neat on coinbase's big day cc was very gracious about that so it's kind of fun to watch yeah yeah well i i think cz is actually a really nice person and generally kind of a cool character um all right so one other uh thing well oh no just in general so what would you say do you think are the challenges that coinbase will face after goes public i think the quarterly results are going to be very uneven because in crypto boom they're going to kill it and then you know they'll be a crypto winter and now every three months they're gonna have to publicly show the results i think their stock price is going to move all around um i think the company still has management challenges i mean ryan armstrong is one of the most tenacious you know focused ceos i've ever met but at the same time i think the sort of debacle over the black lives matter stuff last summer created a massive distraction and a lot of people say he doesn't have the emotional intelligence to run a big public company so i think that's one to watch they've had more turnover in the past but they're they're in a very you know they're in probably in the best phase they've ever been right now so i think it's coin basis to lose at this point all right so based on the s1 how well do you think the direct listing will do what valuation would you expect for coinbase out of the gate i think yeah what's the word pop i think that's what's going to happen uh just because you're seeing with all the other ipos you know these crazy first day you know 50 100 jumps for like you know airbnb and a firm a kind of boring fintech company so i know they're trying to price on the private market last you know the latest things reportedly is 300 bucks people at coinbase tell me they're gonna go higher so yeah i think the stock's gonna go crazy yeah yeah i would expect the same all right well thank you so much for coming on unconfirmed oh and by the way for people who are watching the video and for those listening be sure to buy jeff's book james crypto beautiful cover and um you can learn even more about coinbase thanks so much laura you're too kind always a pleasure don't forget next up is the weekly news recap [Music] hi everyone thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap first headline tether settles with nyag for 18.5 million dollars after an almost two year long investigation the handing over of 2.5 million documents and usdt growing from a two billion dollar to 35 billion dollar market cap bitfinex and tether agreed to a settlement with the new york attorney general's office on tuesday in regards to the 22-month inquiry into a possible cover-up of 850 million dollars in losses by bitfinex the nyag will bring no charges as part of the settlement in a tweet thread tether claimed to quote admit no wrongdoing and said that there had been no finding that quote tether ever issued without backing tether agreed to pay 18.5 million as part of the settlement and will submit quarterly reports on the composition of tethers reserves to the nyag for two years new york attorney general leticia james was a bit harsher in her description of the settlement in a press release she said quote that fenex and tether unlawfully covered up massive financial losses to keep their scheme going and protect their bottom lines tethers claims that its virtual currency was fully backed by us dollars at all times was a lie while it is too early to decide winners and losers of the tether versus nyag saga it seems that both sides got what they wanted the new york attorney general's office gets to be a quasi regulator of tether and tether is allowed to continue functioning with only a minor fine however tether cannot serve new york citizens or businesses whether or not this ends up being worse for tether or for new york which is currently considered one of the financial capitals of the world only time will tell the settlement and resulting transparency should help resolve unfounded suspicions that issuance of tether somehow

on how bitcoin could be stopped he says quote there is an enormous amount of speculation on the internet about how bitcoin might be attacked but few stop to think about why it hasn't already been destroyed the answer is that there are political and economic incentives for more and more people to push the system forward and strengthen its security and strong political economic and technical

who has claimed he is satoshi nakamoto to enforce copyright claims to the bitcoin white paper time for fun bits fab protocols strikes again this fun bits is for all of those of you who remember the quiet days of 2016 when the fat protocol's thesis was all the rage the fat protocol thesis was the theory that in the crypto round of the internet that protocols and their native trends would be worth more than applications built on top this was in contrast to the original internet where protocols like http and smtp were worth very little but the applications built on top such as google facebook and amazon became hugely valuable well if you were wondering how that works out when you compare a seed investment in coinbase to an investment in bitcoin at that same time a site called casebitcoin.com has your back it judges the seed investment in coinbase to be around september 12 2012 and says that assuming a seed valuation of 10 million dollars coinbase's valuation upon going public would need to exceed 47 billion dollars and with the way things are going right now for coinbase that looks like it's been locked up all right thanks for tuning in to learn more about jeff and
