how can the crypto Community rebuild trust in the industry after the collapse of FTX FTX like Tessie said was a centralized exchange run by a very small amount of people that's not what crypto and web3 stands for FTX is a Big Lot on our entire Industries uh you know phase so definitely it's a big issue I'm Laura Shin reporting for Unchained I asked a few people at East Denver how they think the industry will recover from what has been its biggest black eye trust has no place in this world in this crypto ecosystem this technology was was created so we wouldn't have to trust that going down being as opaque as it was was very similar to Banks and so if anything um it shouldn't have hurt crypto as much as it did right the collapse of FTX has been compared to the theranos and Bernie Madoff scandals some people think the alleged fraud at FTX reflects on crypto itself others say that because FTX was centralized like a traditional financial institution this shows the power of decentralization and ideal that the crypto Community is working toward we have to educate people that the decentralized exchanges are not the web 3 values that's a web 2 value when you have a hierarchy of people or a very small amount of people controlling all of that they were not transparent they were not transparent about their balance sheets only one thing that that we all have in our in our hands is to keep building good stuff that we are building right so uh I think like crypto Community can in in general like we need to build those Next Generation apps which will bring you know Mass adoption into crypto but the focus on decentralization uh has to be brought up again and people have to understand that this is exactly the problem that we are solving the decentralization solves the problem that fjx presented so I think what's really important is that you're transparent when building a protocol and also when you Market it the best the industry can do now is to minimize the amount of trust that it asks for we still haven't explored every possible way to do a centralized exchange so what's really important in particular is that people know who gets called study over their funds because that was like really the deal like the deal breaker and the FTX case where people were kind of assuming that they uh the defense that they deposited were belong to them but apparently they were like misused but that's not really possible in D5 at least in those D5 applications that are built the right way there's a spectrum between FTX all the way down to totally decentralized protocols that we already know about so this is something we have to educate people about and also like bring forth The Narrative of like being very clear that the centralized exchanges and how they're run is not what web3 stands for basically can the industry rebuild trust in crypto after the collapse of FTX if so how let us know in the comments foreign
