the reason you alienated the community Aaron is because you called everybody a scoff law and you should have a little bit more empathy for the entrepreneurs that have been with the best intentions trying to make this work and you go around saying that everybody's violating the law willingly and that you've somehow magically pulled you know a rabbit out of a hat which this is like frankly like this is a space where a lot of people have been you know actively working on it uh and and it's even more insulting when you don't have anything really to show for it other than a license what's a little bit insulting is that you basically say people who are trying to do it the right way are trying to do the wrong thing and essentially what your argument is is that people who rush to Market and disregarded the investor protections should be rewarded and should continue to be rewarded as new legislation takes a half a decade to go into place basically you just don't care about the public and what's in their best interest
