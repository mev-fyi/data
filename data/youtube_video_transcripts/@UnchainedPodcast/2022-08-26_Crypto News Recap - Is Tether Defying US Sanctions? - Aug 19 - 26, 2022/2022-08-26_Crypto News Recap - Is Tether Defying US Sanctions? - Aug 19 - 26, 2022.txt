[Music] thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap tether is not yet abiding by the sanctions on tornado cash tether the world's largest stable coin issuer announced it would stick to its decision to not freeze tornado cash addresses at least for now the announcement came shortly after a report from the washington post that alleged tornado was defying u.s sanctions on tornado cash earlier this month the u.s office of foreign assets and control sanctioned tornado cache a decentralized cryptocurrency mixer for allegedly laundering billions of dollars following the sanctions circle the us-based entity behind the stablecoin usdc froze over 75 thousand dollars in funds linked to tornado cash addresses however tether a hong kong-based company whose legal obligations to the sanctions are unclear has decided to take a different path as it has not yet frozen any assets related to the platform according to the statement released on wednesday tether has not received any requests from either u.s law enforcement or regulators to freeze addresses involved with the mixer unilaterally freezing secondary market addresses could be a highly disruptive and reckless move by tether the company stated still the company said it is in contact with law enforcement almost daily and also hinted that it would comply with regulators if it was asked to freeze addresses speaking of tether last week bdo italia the accounting firm hired by the stablecoin issuer to publish attestation reports revealed a 58 decrease in the company's commercial paper holdings at the end of the last quarter

dollar credit line sam bankman freed's company got the option to acquire block fi for up to 240 million dollars however coindesk revealed that the minimum price of the deal is actually 15 million

liquidators got approval from a court in singapore to recognize the liquidation order in that country this will allow teneo the company appointed to liquidate three ac's assets to dig deeper into what happened with the hedge fund as it will be able to request access to all the financial records the case against nfts as securities a lot happened around nfts this week nathaniel chastain former head of product at openc filed a motion with the doj to dismiss the charges that he engaged in insider trading chestine is accused of defrauding openc by allegedly buying the digital assets prior to them being shown on the platform's homepage and then later selling them for a profit his lawyers are arguing that since nfts are neither securities nor commodities the charges should be dropped in addition chastain's attorneys made the case that their client wasn't concealing anything as every transaction was made public on the ethereum blockchain board apes hit the floor speaking of nfts the floor price of the board a bia club or bayc nft collection hit its lowest since the beginning of the year it was even momentarily flipped by crypto punks the second largest nft collection by market cap this drop in the floor price caused concern about a major liquidation in the nft market because of a situation that arose in an nft lending protocol called bendao the protocol basically allows people to put up their nfts as collateral to borrow ether as the prices of the nfts were declining liquidations were on order and the risk of a death spiral was now a real thing to make matters worse ben dao started suffering a classic bank run as lenders lost their confidence in the platform's ability to repay them and decided to withdraw their eath however at the moment the issue has stabilized because the dow voted in favor of an emergency proposal to change its liquidation parameters the lending rates on the platform which had spiked to over 100 percent at the time of the bank run now at three percent again in addition it looks like the recovery in the major nft floor prices helped as well in the past several days bayc's floor price has increased by more than 10 percent anyone saying that this is the next 3ac luna 08 housing crisis etc was being sensationalist the scale of the problem wasn't that big for the market said nft statistics.eth the director of research at proof collective

kobe donated 100 000 usdc then ben armstrong the man behind bitboy crypto decided to drop the legal charges because he never intended the suit to be public it could be argued though that he dropped it
