all right so now that we have this order I wondered also what you thought it meant for a number of the tokens that recently have been named as Securities by the SEC as some of the bigger ones obviously are soul and Matic and yeah I was curious whether you thought this kind of could help them in any way or if um yeah if people need to still exercise caution around those tokens I think it's a a massive help and I think it's a massive help because again you know not to keep repeating ourselves but right the order stands for the view that the tokens themselves are not Securities and what that means is it is far less likely there would be a whole thing that any of those creators of tokens have Securities compliance obligations as a result of public trading of those assets what it means is the SEC and courts will have to look at the initial distribution of those tokens and this is where I think it is really important to distinguish what you know is it Ripple was um was doing sort of before modern industry standards and best practices were developed and what some of these more recent issuers were doing one really important thing is and Kayvon correct me if I have this wrong but when Ripple did its distributions to institutional investors it did not take take advantage of the regulation D exemption for a private placement to accredited investors that really became the industry standard only a few years after you know Ripple uh decided to distribute xrp in the way that it did and what it means is when you look at those initial distributions for many other projects what you're going to find is there was no unregistered public distribution of a security because those distributions were compliant with the Securities laws explicitly because they complied with regulation D and in that case as long as all of those compliance obligations were respected meaning you know the tokens were only sold to accredited investors they were locked up the right way and you know all those other sort of requirements under that regulation it means there's not going to be any violation of the Securities laws so if I'm any other issuer who followed those modern industry standards I'm feeling very good much more comfortable than I was before this decision came out yeah I think I I generally agree with you know pretty much everything uh Jake just said I think in particular the character of the tokens in Commerce you know this provides a lot of comfort that most tokens will not be viewed as Securities as they're being used you know as they're being told on exchanges but not third parties or used in the network or all those things which led to a lot of concern for a lot of projects I think the institutional sales component of this does you know continue to you know present risk for any project that you know that sold tokens in their their own initial sales as to whether those sales might be construed as Securities offerings and we still have issues as we saw in telegram that and in telegram there was a Saft so there were initial sales that everybody agreed the agreement for future tokens was intended to be an exempt Securities offering but that the subsequent distribution of tokens would not be in the court rejected that theory and said this is all one integrated scheme and therefore it enjoined the subsequent distribution of tokens so there are still going to be a lot of wrinkles and how um you conduct initial sales but for all those projects that you mentioned that are out there that have tokens out in the world they should you know feel much more comfortable I think that the token itself won't be construed as a security all right so while all of this is going down
