ethereum and founder of the defiant welcome camilla hi laura thanks so much for having me excited to be here i just want to say first of all congrats on the publication of your book that must be so exciting it is i'm so happy with it so happy with all the feedback it's been amazing so let's start with your background you've done so much in crypto but i don't know if people really know how you got started so how did you come to be covering the space sure so well before being full-time crypto with the defiant and the infinite machine i was a reporter at bloomberg news for around eight years i started in an internship in new york then i went to argentina for over four years in madrid and then back to new york and in argentina i was there in christina fernandez's second term and at that time she imposed really harsh currency controls and inflation as always in argentina i was you know in the double digits um and so i was covering argentine markets and how people were protecting against inflation and currency controls and that's how i came across bitcoin for the first time in 2013. so i wrote a story for bloomberg on you know how argentines were using um this digital currency to protect against inflation and after that i was like always really interested in crypto you know to me it was like a really powerful concept um this idea of having a parallel and independent um financial and monetary system that you know especially after living in argentina and living through all that it made a lot of sense to me so i always kind of kept track of it um but then it was back in new york in 2017 when i started really covering it again um and focusing more on it so um at this time i was at bloomberg's markets live blog which is kind of um a live feed of market analysis and i mostly covered emerging markets but i had the freedom of to write whatever looked interesting and 2017 was obviously huge for crypto so i started writing about crypto and then started writing for like the general wire wire because bloomberg um didn't have like dedicated cryptocurrency reporters or a dedicated crypto team so i became kind of the de facto crypto reporter at the time and that kind of you know dragged me into space um i had a front row view of the huge bubble of 2017 and i just you know was fascinated by it and kind of never left after that and earlier when you said that having lived through the currency controls in argentina that that was part of the reason that you got fascinated with bitcoin what was it like living through that you know what did you experience and why was it that you felt that bitcoin was related to what was happening then it was really interesting to to be living through that because i'm i'm chilean and in chile the situation was very different chile is a much more conservative country like fiscally and in its monetary policy um like nothing ever happens there uh the peso is pretty the chilean versus pretty stable so coming to argentina where um you know there were all these like uh stimulus and like money printing and and just like very populist um policies with with the cursors and i'm just living through um currency controls like firsthand because i was i was earning in argentine pesos like bloomberg paid journalists there in their local currency i mean they do that in every every local bureau you get paid in obviously the country's currency so i got paid in argentine pesos and when i first got to argentina the first thing i was told was as soon as you get your salary change it to dollars um because of the like the huge inflation so what happens with inflation in practice is that you know you get say 100 argentine pesos in in january and that lets you buy a certain amount of stuff but then at the end of the year you can buy much less with the same 100 pesos so effectively you become poorer by holding um your local currency so that's why people in argentina and countries with really high inflation are always seeking a more stable currency and that's usually us dollars so that's what i was doing as soon as i got my salary in pesos i exchanged it two dollars and then one day i think it was like just like two or a couple of days after christina fernandez got re-elected i was at the bloomberg office kind of covering this announcement where she said um you know now us dollar purchases are prohibited and i was like okay like i covered it and but then i went to my bank account uh to see if like actually i wasn't able to trade pesos for dollars anymore and that option was just gone from from my bank so i really kind of lived that and then i was like stuck with argentine pesos and having to go to the black market and the like the the us dollar black market in argentina is like it's illegal but it's like everyone does it like everyone is using it um and it's just it's it's just crazy so people were were doing like all all these um like schemes to try to get access to dollars like they would go overnight to uruguay to punta ellis and like cash casino chips for dollars and like do all this like crazy stuff including like bitcoin so um and and yeah like just seeing how frustrating it is to have a government dictate what you can and can't do with your own money and you know banks like prohibiting uh and enforcing those those laws and regulations it was just amazing to me like it just didn't make any sense it was like this is my money i earned it like why are they telling me i can't buy dollars with it like especially because the reason why the business being devalued is their fault so why do i have to pay for that right um it just felt like so insane and so yeah it's this the ability to have a hedge against crazy governments and irresponsible policies um it's just was just groundbreaking and yeah i think that's what bitcoin enables so but something that's so fascinating to me is that i obviously can see how your experience in argentina would get you interested in bitcoin and i've seen this pretty much the same story happened with people like juan ciscosaurus and michael casey who lived in argentina it just feels like you know with mario and kante everybody who has experience with argentina somehow finds their way to the crypto space but why do you think that you instead ended up focusing on ethereum rather than bitcoin yeah so um i think like the reason is is is uh like a practical one uh as well as uh like not ideological one but like um one that's like focused on ethereum itself so the practical reason was that end of 2017 um i thought what happened this year is crazy and it needs to be documented like this is an incredible space um and i had always wanted to write a book a nonfiction book so i was like on the lookout for like what interesting stories i could tell and so crypto was to me like that opportunity to tell an interesting story in a book and so i just you know started thinking what's the most interesting story in crypto that hasn't been told and the story of bitcoin had been told before um really well i thought with digital gold and other books and it was just more widely known but ethereum you know people didn't really know much much about it uh beyond you know it's a platform for icos um there there was no history of ethereum which was crazy uh it was the second biggest cryptocurrency it fueled much of the craziness of 2017 yet nobody knew much about it and how it got created and started so that's that's the reason i started um looking at writing a book on ethereum and then you know after my kind of initial research i i realized it is really a book worthy project because while bitcoin tries to um do you know peer-to-peer money uh ethereum wants to do peer-to-peer everything like to go beyond just the peer-to-peer transfer of money with smart contracts um so to me it was you know whether ethereum meant out winning or succeeding in its goal of becoming like the world computer it's still you know it's still one in in in the sense that it was the first to to to try this to push blockchain technology forward and so i thought that was a story worth telling and at some point you also left bloomberg why when was that and why did you decide to leave bloomberg so i left bloomberg january 2019 and i left in part because i really wanted to focus on on finishing my book so bloomberg gave me a few months of book leave and that was amazing um and i'm really grateful to them but then you know beginning of 2019 was when i had to go back to to bloomberg and do like my full-time reporting job and i still hadn't finished writing the book and so i just like couldn't see how i would be able to do both well and i didn't want to delay publishing my book um so that was like one side of the decision and then the other side was just you know i i was there for eight years um i i covered so many different markets i was at three or four different bloomberg offices if you count like some time i was also in the chile office so i had like a lot of experience uh covering financial news for bloomberg and i just thought it's time to to do something else like i um i was excited to to freelance to maybe start something on my own like i left without a clear idea of what i would do after finishing the book but i knew i wanted a little bit more freedom to to explore other things after like all that time at bloomberg and so you did start talking a little bit about your book but why don't we just dive into the particulars what is your book about so yeah my book is on it focuses on the history of ethereum um especially the early days so how vitalik came up with the the idea of ethereum how he inspired a group of very diverse uh characters from different walks of life to follow him in this journey of building this this new platform the challenges they faced how they overcame them um and then you know the the 2017 boom and and bust and in 2018 and then also i i come to pretty much um present day kind of hinting about like the future of ethereum with d5 and and web 3. but really the focus is on the the early days and and how um how ethereum got got started and and launched and so what would you say were the most pivotal moments in ethereum's history first at the beginning of ethereum history there was this tension on whether like on the very kind of soul of ethereum uh whether you know it should be a for-profit company or a non-profit foundation um fueling development of like this open uh public blockchain and so i think the moment the decision to to make it a a non-profit foundation obviously really defined ethereum going forward um so that was definitely a pivotal moment another another key moment i think was um the pre-sale ico pre-mine however you you want to call it you know the decision to structure the distribution of ether in this way um with with our pre-sale instead of uh just by you know proof of proof of work mining like bitcoin um so ethereum has been really criticized for this aft after that it's it's always um face kind of had had this kind of sort of democracy hanging over its head with like regulators on whether this was actual illegal um like if this was a securities offering or not like that was always in doubt until recently um so i think that was another kind of big moment for it like that decision to do ether distribution that way um and also like deciding to do it in the us and you know that took like a huge amount of time with lawyers to to decide all the like specifics of the sale also big but i think less known is the shanghai attacks um so ethereum went through kind of this this phase of uh like huge tests to it and one was the the shanghai attacks when when it was uh receiving these um denial of service attacks on like spam from from hackers for like an entire month um and then right after that came the dow hack so it was like a really intense period of like huge tests to the network uh so i think these these two kind of attacks were were like pivotal moments as well um and yeah like it kind of like um made ethereum feel i think kind of more worth it tested after after they happened yeah and and just uh it was reversed that the dao happened first and then the the ddos attacks were shortly thereafter so as you yeah as we approach the five-year anniversary of the ethereum network being live how would you characterize where ethereum is now it's been it's been incredible to see the the progress of of ethereum since when i first started writing the book until now um so when i first started writing like i mentioned it was like the main thing were you know icos and like enabling this fundraising mechanism but now it's really enabling this more complex um and like sophisticated financial system that goes beyond just fundraising and into lending borrowing exchanging um and you know use cases that we never would have imagined on on ethereum their birth of of this new financial system is is kind of proving that ethereum is doing what it's set out to do to to be this this layer for an unlimited number of of applications built on top of it and so at this point everybody's waiting for the launch of phase zero of ethereum 2.0 and there was some chatter recently about the fact that that might be delayed until 2021 rather than coming out later this year do you see any risks to ethereum due to these delays risks i don't i don't think so because ethereum has been waiting for proof of stake and eat two since like forever it's basically you know been um the thing that they've been working towards since i think like 2016 or so like proof-of-stake is coming from you know so um and it's been able to to continue um going forward even with all these delays so i i think and and i think now it's it's um at a stronger place than ever to to keep uh to keep surviving even without if two um layer two solutions are are in a really good place like they're they're actually working you know there's um actual taxes using zero knowledge proofs and optimistic roll-ups and um omg uh network launched recently with its plasma chain so you know layer two scaling is actually a reality and i think i think that will really help bridge that gap between eth1 and if two so for that reason and also for for the fact that right now the way that users are are using ethereum it's been more of like whales using these uh financial platforms to to to transact and so far it hasn't required you know that much uh scaling i mean it has put ethereum um to the test with like gas prices rising and the network occasionally being clogged up but it's not as bad as like cryptokitties and you know like thousands of people just piling on or even like as crazy as the ico days i think it's like a much more measured use use case of not like so many people using it at once but it's like a more like sustainable uh way of like transacting so between those things i think you know ethereum is in is in good shape to to continue working well um until each two comes so we'll see i i still you know i'm not sure whether a proof of stake will launch this year or or next year but yeah there has been some the vitalik is is really kind of pushing for for our lunch this year and like other like prominent developers are too so we'll see what happens but i think it's it's good it's a good sign that they're they're focused on having it done like well right instead of like just pushing out something that's not ready are you watching any of these other competing layer one protocols that used to be dubbed ethereum killers but people haven't been using that term so much anymore and do you think any of them have a chance of taking any market share from ethereum i possibly yeah it's hard to say i think er so far we can comment on what's happened and um so far it's been really hard to compete with ethereum i think ethereum has a really great advantage of like a first mover advantage with um a huge community like um there's i don't know like thousands of developers building on ethereum i think they're supporting that they're even more ethereum developers and bitcoin bitcoin developers and just um the level of connectivity between ethereum applications will be really hard to to replicate because of this like composability of of d5 and other applications that they all start working with each other it makes it harder for a single application to move to another chain and just be there by itself so there's kind of these network effects the communities there builders are there users are there um so that's been it's been really hard to compete but that's not to say that you know if any of these new chains launches and it's just like many many times better than ethereum technically and if two it keeps being delayed and maybe layer two solutions aren't you know aren't fixing it um aren't fixing scaling as as you know people hope then yeah i mean they very very well could start taking market share we'll see and other than that are there any other obstacles that you think ethereum faces i think regulation is always like it's always a risk especially if ethereum's main focus is is finance regulators are always going to be watching that closely i think they they haven't yet because it's still like d5 is still uh pretty small um but you know with with two billion now it's not nothing i think what what kind of protects it a little bit is that so far it's really been crypto whales playing in in these platforms so you're not seeing kind of inexperienced retail users getting burned but if we have some sort of like ico boom type of frenzy where retail traders come to defy like to yield farm and they you know are paying 100 bucks of gas fees and you know getting you know wrecked with their leveraged loans uh you know you could see kind of regulators raising their eyebrows and taking a closer look at this um so i think that's that's um that's one risk i think what happened with with icos and what's happened in general with with theorem on blockchain technology is that at least in the us i regulators realize that they have taken this kind of soft touch to allow innovation to to flourish um because they really i don't think they want to stamp out this this industry and have um everyone go somewhere else and like i don't know maybe china having like the be the center of blockchain innovation so i i think you know what will likely happen is that there will be uh regulators looking closer at the space you know one thing that interests me is when you said that the regulators have been having a light touch there was a moment um i'm just trying to remember when this was i think it was about a year ago where i feel like the frustration from u.s entrepreneurs with the regulators was sort of at a peak and um do you feel like that's changed because i think at that time that's when a lot of entrepreneurs were saying oh yeah people are leaving to go to other jurisdictions so do you think just that they were overreacting or do you think that things have calmed down since then yeah i think the the peak kind of concern with regulators i think came with icos i think you know people people were moving to other jurisdictions because u.s regulators really took a stance there that tokens can be securities and and these sales are very you know are probably securities illegal securities offerings i think you know they were they were rightly kind of concerned the developers in in the space but i think that's that's that's subsided now first because i icos aren't being done in the same way anymore i think the space has matured and and realized that the way fundraising was happening in ethereum wasn't really healthy um i don't think the incentives were were placed in in the right way like giving a team of entrepreneurs millions of dollars right off just based off a white paper on website um and expecting them to deliver everything they promised after you already gave them all your money you know that didn't really turned out very well in in many cases in others you know they did and and we have like really good teams who raise money in the ico days like building right now and and you know some of the top defy projects raise money in the ico days but many many others didn't and just like didn't do anything and ran off with the money so i think um the crypto space has really learned from that and matured and is seeking other more responsible ways uh to to fundraise and i think that that's helping with uh regulators as well and so when you look back at all the history that you uncovered for your book and you look at how far ethereum has come what's most surprising to you about the ethereum story oh there were many surprising things i think so okay so one thing that was surprising was kind of this clash of the like for-profit non-non-profit the the other surprising thing to find out was just that right now vitalik is the the only one of the initial co-founders who is still building for ethereum um and everyone has like gone off and to do their own like other blockchain things or non-blockchain things um so that was also surprising i think like i said too the watching this new kind of financial applications ecosystem thrive uh right now in ethereum after after the the bear market when everyone thought ethereum was dead has been like a really nice surprise as well yeah i guess yeah those those have been like the the biggest surprises all right so in a moment we will talk about the defiant d5 and crypto media but

you cover there yeah um so the defiant is a well it started out as a newsletter which i founded in june of last year so it has a little bit over a year um and i started this newsletter because like i said i was watching this incredible financial ecosystem being built on ethereum and i really thought it wasn't being covered at all or or at least very well um by even by crypto media and much less by mainstream media um there were hardly even any newsletter focusing on d5 at the time when i started the defiant so i really saw this incredible amount of innovation growth activity happening in the space and to me it was you know these these developers are delivering kind of the dream of of crypto like the cypher found dream of being your own bank and you know having your parallel financial system and they're actually building it and it's working and like nobody's paying attention um so to me it was like it was a an opportunity to come in and after you know researching and learning about ethereum for my book and also having covered markets for four years at bloomberg i thought you know it's a good space for me to come and cover and i was just like fascinated by it so um i started this newsletter and at first i was i thought you know let me try to do it daily because i think you know that kind of helps build an audience that consistency uh but without really knowing whether i'd have enough material or you know what would happen but i just like i i started it and and yeah like there was so much going on that i i never i never was like lacking material to to write a daily newsletter and it grew really quickly like i had really good uh response to it people really were needing this information source for d5 it kind of evolved into more of a i want to make it into a media company for the open economy beyond just a newsletter so i recently launched a a podcast as well um looking to start a youtube channel soon and i'm building kind of uh the defined website to like host all these things on like in one place so yeah that's my my idea with with the define to to build it into um a trustworthy content platform uh for a decentralized finance and i think kind of the difference with other newsletters and and people covering the space is that i really do want to bring my kind of my journalistic perspective to it so i'm i'm covering the space from the perspective and with the expertise of a journalist and i do have a contributors who who are also writing for for the defiant now and i you know i edit their pieces with always with with that in mind i'm obviously you know super bullish in in the space and my bias will be towards you know this is amazing but always you know keeping the objectivism and and the standards of that i had at bloomberg you know like i'm not going to stop reporting the bad things that happened the scam the hacks um and i think that's that's especially important in such a nissan space so yeah and how would you compare doing financial coverage at bloomberg to covering d5 how are they similar and how are they different oh my god let's see it's obviously a much smaller market so there's there's uh there's less to cover but at the same time it's like one one market i don't know because okay so so d5 is just a global ecosystem and it's like all part of the same thing whereas in uh covering markets for bloomberg you had like very separate markets so there's emerging markets developed markets within emerging markets you have like like brazil or like latin america and asia and like each country has its own specific uh rules and systems and securities and they're all like in little cages you know but in the fights because it's like a global network it's all one thing uh so i think that's that's you know that's a little bit different it's also um 24 7. so it's not like a bloomberg you know once the the market closes you can kind of like go home and not worry about anything in d5 you can have hacks in the middle of the night like on weekends which is when they usually happen you know so it's like yeah you need to be on all the time and i think this is i don't know like very personal and more of like a colorful uh statement but i enjoy covering this space more because i kind of can communicate better with the people building these things like i can relate better to them so um just to put it more concretely you know covering financial markets at bloomberg um i was always in you know in a room with like all men in suits in their like you know 50s or whatever just like old white men in suits and it just felt like it was obviously just a job for them like they they didn't really there was like no passion for what they were doing um and it's so different covering crypto you know and especially covering ethereum and the d5 community like they're it's much more diverse so obviously still male dominated but you still get women um and female founders who are absolutely doing amazing stuff there it's a lot it's a lot younger crowd and it's so nice to be covering a space where people are actually passionate about what they're doing i mean and you can just you know see it you know come across uh interviews and their products they're like really putting their hearts into this um so yeah i think that's a big difference from covering traditional markets yeah i relate to you on so many different levels and everything you just said and how would you say that launching and running your own crypto media company compares to working for traditional media oh i've been loving being my own boss so much um so you know when i when i left bloomberg i always had like in the back of my mind that i would one day start my own thing um and you know when i was thinking of it i was like am i glamorizing being an entrepreneur and like starting you know having a startup and actually like it's been amazing like i'm i i really you know i'm glad that i i took that step um but it's obviously very different because you know i'm doing everything it's like i'm covering like i'm doing the journalism i'm also doing the editing i'm um running kind of the infrastructure like you know like building the website doing the podcast like editing like making sure like talking to the subtech people when the the site is down or you know like getting the crypto payment on board like all that kind of logistics that at bloomberg there were like entire teams of people working you know i had like nothing to worry about um are all on on me now but it's really fun because it's like i get to think of bigger things like the strategy and like where am i gonna take uh this this media platform and like what does the future look like and what who do i partner with like what sponsors do i take you know like all of like the business side of things uh which i had no experience with before and like now i'm i'm doing has been really fun to learn and and it's exciting building my own thing so you know at bloomberg i i often you know stayed really late working on stories and and it was fine like it was still kind of my my work that i was proud proud of to deliver a story but now it's like even better because it's not just you know this one story but it's it's you know working towards my my own thing you know my own brand so um yeah i really enjoyed the experience and so are you are working directly with your sponsors or are you trying to do that oh you are okay yeah yeah i took i started taking sponsors um in april like late april okay but are you trying to do the church and state separation between business and editorial or oh yeah definitely okay yeah yeah so i'm i have sponsors who place kind of banners or logos at the top of the newsletter but all the content i mean that doesn't affect the content i'm still like covering um the spaces i would if i had no sponsors oh right right yeah but yeah i i actually hired a separate person so i don't even oh yeah yeah but yeah i should do that that comes next yeah no i'm right now hiring more on the editorial side so i think you seem to have built that out first but but also i'm still working on my book so our our timelines we're probably doing similar parallel track things but on different timelines and so i was curious who are you finding is subscribing to the defiant are they people who kind of already tend to be in the industry or are you also getting people who are just interested in d5 but don't necessarily work in the space already so at first i i think it was mostly people in the industry so i had um tons of vcs like a lot of like the crypto funds uh subscribed to the defiant and all of the like big d5 projects and ethereum projects subscribe to it so developers from from these projects um i like team members subscribe and also like just traders like users of d5 platforms are also subscribers but uh recently i've i've seen um people who are like more like adjacent to to defy an ethereum subscribing as well so not not so into in into like the the car so yeah i've seen you know i i can tell from from i have this subscriber chat on on discord and and you know some sometimes if people introduce themselves and now i'm seeing more people who are just like oh i'm just starting to learn about define ethereum and you know excited to to learn with the defiant and um whereas before it was just like more people who were already in this space so yeah it seems like we're getting kind of an influx of of new new people that's great you also said in the hidden forces podcast overtime show that you think one trend that we're seeing in crypto media is people prefer to follow individuals rather than institutions and i wondered coming from internal a traditional journalistic background where obviously like you know we try not to state our opinions or we try not to become the story how are you dealing with becoming more synonymous with your brand or your publication um yeah it's it's been like a weird transition and it's something that i i i wanted to to do to to be able to express my own opinion um and just be my own agent um at bloomberg i kind of struggled with that especially because i was obviously a lot more interested in in crypto and much more bullish in crypto than most people at bloomberg so i always kind of found that struggle with with my editors who like wanted to push the story one way but i was like no like that's that's not really what's going on um so now it's great to just be able to uh cover the space how i see it and not have to like ask for permission to go to like all these different events and like even go to on on your podcast i would have had to like go through like three layers of of like permission uh so it's so great to just be able to say yes to to everything at the same time like i said because i wanted to find to be a journalistic platform it's not you know it includes my my opinion but it's i try to be a lot more measured with it and if i have an opinion i'm always going to back it with with facts it's not like oh i i love this thing uh because because you know and you should use it it's like no like this is great because it has like it's tons of volume it has never been hacked it just added and whatever like i'm i'm going to provide a more more substance to whatever my opinion is yeah it's something that i'm still kind of figuring out what the the right balance is of uh like me being the figure for the defiant versus having kind of the brand uh take the the front stage and i think it'll be kind of a transition that will just have to happen organically with time as i bring in more contributors and you know the defiance starts being the defiant and not like kami russo's project you know um but you know we'll see i think i think for now i'm i'm happy to be kind of the face of it i'm like pushing it and like use my i don't know whatever influence i have in in this space to to build out the brand but i think hopefully you know with time the the define will become a bigger brand than my own run and along the way you've launched something called the cami token tell us what that is and how people can use it or earn it yeah well i think it's just part of me testing these things out as i report them you know and this is something else that's different from reporting at bloomberg because at bloomberg we were very restricted in owning the things that we cover rightly so i think but that like was so strict that i couldn't even like it was hard for me to to to own even a little bit of crypto to test all these platforms out but now i have more freedom to do that and i've been using that to to test different d5 platforms and nfts and all this stuff um so that's what kind of the idea of coming tokens came from i was covering i wrote a post on a role which is the platform that facilitates the issuing of your own personal tokens and at bloomberg i actually had wanted to do like my own ico at in the ico bubble just like i thought it'd be like a fun story like what it actually takes to do an ico but like yeah obviously i i wasn't allowed to view like everyone freaked out like you'll go to jail you like get a suit so i couldn't do that um but now with withdrawal um and like these personal tokens i was able to finally have an accounting token and yeah it was just like more of a way to test how these these things work and it was like actually super easy like the like interface is just you know how like what what's your token's name like how how many times you want to issue and building kind of use cases for for the token so i haven't been like paying that much attention to it but my idea was that people would be able but at first i i could reward my readers and audience with the token so if people were um recommending the defiant or like tweeting about it or like tweeting about my book i would send them kami tokens and then the other side of the market would be that uh cami tokens could be used to buy things like a subscription to the defiant and i think so far one substrate subscription has been bought by june julian yeah yeah um so yeah it hasn't been like an exactly active market but it's it's been fun to test it out i should give it more more attention and did you do any kind of legal work to make sure that the different use cases you had for it didn't run afoul of securities laws well i i did um you know talk to some to a couple of lawyers about like personal tokens and where that line is and you know as as long as you're using them to to exchange like actual things um they're more like airline miles but i think the that line is crossed when you are promising like future profits that come from your work like when it's like more like um a dividend kind of thing that's where it it becomes uh trickier but if you're just you know using these tokens in exchange for a subscription or in exchange for like an hour of my time then then it's um like safer and i also saw you participated in some of the git coin grant rounds describe that process and what you've been getting grants for i think what they're doing is is really amazing in enabling um funding for for different open source and like ethereum projects what makes the git coin grants work is this idea that with donating a a little bit of money of crypto you can actually make a big impact so that because of the the matching um so that really kind of incentivizes people to donate even you know if it's one die because of like how the the system works um you actually end up donating a lot more so that kind of generated this like feedback loop of like everyone in ethereum donating to to these grants and yeah i started i made the first grant in the previous round that's when they opened it to to like media projects and it was really great like i i got over a 4 000 die in in the grand and i've been using it to compensate my contributors so it's been like really instrumental and then this time around i also got close to 4 000 dying in donations and i want to use that to help build out um part of my website yeah i think i think in in general the the the whole kind of experiment in in in these types of of funding around generates this like sense of community that they're all kind of helping each other building for each other um so yeah we'll see i think um i'm doing it quarterly feels like it's helping these projects be like more more sustainable in general how do you think media companies can take advantage of crypto tokens or decentralized business models ah that's interesting um i think this you know there's a lot of work to be done in this phase i don't think anyone has like really figured it out yet but you know like one of the like big ideas on kind of holy grail ideas for like media and crypto is is this um kind of model where users pay uh like make micro payments for like reading single articles or you know this idea of like streaming content as you would stream um music or video so i i think you know i don't think that's been achieved yet um but that would be like an interesting model to to try out um you know it would require a kind of everyone being connected and very cheap transactions so potentially like in some like layer two a channel or something it could work out um but yeah that'd be interesting um unlock has been unlocked protocol is uh this project that's that's focused on like media subscriptions uh with with crypto and uh they've been working on on this idea of like unlocking content with crypto so and that's that's another way for now you know uh for me personally it's it's been a way unlock has allowed a a way to to give um crypto subscriptions where you know substance hasn't yet so it's like very very basic it's just like subscriptions but with with crypto but at least you know that's i've been able to implement that uh but yeah i think going forward this idea of like streaming content is where crypto can make a big impact so uh let's now talk again about ethereum because obviously we have this um five-year anniversary coming up you recently tweeted that the total market cap of erc20 tokens is now higher than the market cap of ethereum what do you think is the significance of that fact well what this obviously means by on itself is that the economy being built on ethereum is now more valuable than the token securing it so it's more valuable than eth itself and you know that really signals the the the amount of innovation going on on on top of ethereum and that's that's one way to look at it another way to look at it is wow it is uh really undervalued because the like the platform should be more valuable than you know the applications on top but you know that's that's a thesis that's that's a it's a hypothesis that's yet to be proven so it's been kind of the kind of assumed that in in blockchains because the the underlying layer one can now be made valuable with with that with its own token that this this would allow the the like layer one and protocol layer to to gain in value as applications are built on top and i think you know that's that's different from non tokens like from layer one protocols that don't have tokens uh like obviously uh the internet is like the the best example and so the idea there is that if the internet like the tcp protocol had had a token that token would be more valuable than all of the applications uh built on top but because it didn't have a token like nobody could actually profit from this network right and so that's the difference that blockchains are building to the table that now these layer one protocols can actually be made sustainable and people can invest in these protocols and that these tokens will become the most valuable so i think it's interesting that with um tokens on top of ether becoming more valuable this this theory is is being challenged so i don't i don't really i don't know if it's the case that you know that that theory was wrong and that really the tokens on top of the theorem can be more valuable than ether itself or that ether is undervalued and it just like needs to catch up um yeah i i wonder if it might switch back once we move to proof of stake or once ethereum moves in proof of stake right yeah maybe kind of the economics of proof-of-work aren't kind of keeping up with the actual value of ether um and once people start locking eve up to to stake it will we'll see yeah and uh just going back to d fight there have been so many hacks in the d5 space how do you think about balancing your coverage of the risks against like who your readers are and and the fact that they're interested in d5 yeah no i i think to me covering the hacks is probably the most important thing that um i can do because there everyone else is going to be covering how great the space is you know you have the projects themselves doing that you have like their press releases you have their tweets um you have like all these other newsletters covering you know like kind of cheerleading for the space which they're great but i think you need to balance that out with a more kind of objective view and pointing out the good and the bad and the hacks are definitely the bad so i think you know um it's it's really important for especially for new readers to to realize the level of risk that there is here and there is definitely really high risk in in d5 from um code breaking which it it does uh to just the volatility of the market how liquid it is yeah there's there's just risks everywhere and and i always say you know as excited as i am for for d5 and ethereum these things are you know difa is just like two years old you know how how long how how many years did the financial system take to be as secure as it is today we're just like in the very very early stages um this code needs to be tested it needs to be audited there needs to be some some sort of like protection for users i think so i mean the main thing i i i say is i encourage people to to check these things out but but with you know money that they they can afford to lose i think it's kind of the the safest advice for sure and so for the next let's say year do you have any predictions in d5 or are there any particular metrics that you're keeping your eye on or projects or trends let's see well i think like value lock this is like the main metric that people are are looking at but in terms of like trends i i'd love to see uh more like d5 becoming more secure and um i think that should be a big focus and and i i think it is um so there are projects like nexus mutual uh building insurance for defy others like open building kind of hedging options for defy so hopefully a big trend in d5 will be different ways to to protect traders and users and um another trend i hope to see which i think has has been very much missing is identity systems the ability to to have like decentralized identity will unlock so many other new use cases which might enable kind of a greater adoption beyond crypto whales and you know specifically the ability of having loans that require less collateral collateral than they do now because right now borrowing in d5 requires you to put capital upfront and so that right of the bat excludes a bunch of people who just don't have that um that capital um so having some sort of credit system some some way of like verifying uh payment history that will really kind of unlock so much more value and use cases in the ecosystem so hopefully that that will be a trend to look forward to and what about bitcoin on ethereum what are you looking for yeah as you watch that that's that's such an interesting trend um so yeah bitcoin on ethereum has really skyrocketed and it's been interesting to see that there's actual demand from bitcoin holders to you know put their their bitcoin and on like smart contracts or deposits and and using ethereum tokens instead on on ethereum um so i think this will be this will continue to grow as d5 becomes more useful and secure more bitcoiners will want to start using these applications and i think that will be the case with uh with other non-ethereum tokens and even with like maybe like real like tokenized real world assets there's this idea that ethereum will start kind of sucking in assets in into the platform um i i think the first one is is bitcoin but going forward i'd expect all types of assets to start kind of participating in in d5 yeah it's definitely a fascinating space i think it's really great that you carved out this niche to cover because you're right it's easily one of the most interesting beats within the overall cryptobeat so yeah yeah yeah well it's been so great having you on unchained where can people learn more about you the
