hi everyone some of you may have heard on my other podcast unconfirmed that last week I was at the Oslo Freedom Forum put on by the human rights foundation I was incredibly humbled to learn from and meet some of today's most courageous advocates for Human Rights from around the globe I met defectors from North Korea whereas some of my ancestors are from as well as human rights defenders from Iran Eritrea China Vietnam and other oppressive regimes I'm super excited to bring you the recording from the first day of the forum's tech lab which opened with blockchain versus the surveillance state a series of presentations by four well-known crypto entrepreneurs in a panel discussion that I moderated first you'll hear from Ryan Shay of decentralized technology platform blog stacks who is a previous guest on Unchained then from Galia Bernard C of smart token platform Bank or Steve Waterhouse of surveillance free internet project orchid and Arthur Brightman from smart contract platform tasers after that we have a discussion about health auctions can be used to fight surveillance censorship and privacy breaches by governments and corporations or be used by them to surveil censor and invade your privacy blockchain versus the surveillance state was just the opening event in a well curated program a lot of which touched on the potential in blockchain technology to combat human rights abuses I encourage you to check out the videos which are posted on the Oslo Freedom Forum Facebook page also if you have not heard again I strongly urge you to check out the unconfirmed podcast featuring Alex Gladstein chief strategy officer for the human rights foundation he has some really fascinating insights into help washing technology can be used for good or for evil by governments I'll link to in the show notes without further ado we'll start with a first presentation from blockchain versus the surveillance state at the Oslo Freedom Forum tech lab by blog stack co-founder Ryan Shay blockchain warehouse is an international blockchain accelerator offering a wide range of token sail advisory services to promising blockchain based ventures with the leading adviser Network bcw is at the forefront of building landscape changing blockchain companies and hosting successful token sales with more than 20 million dollars raised so far today's episode is brought to you by keep key the easy safe and simple way to protect your Bitcoin ether light coin and many other digital assets there's no time like the present to protect yourself from hackers malware and viruses visit keep key calm to order your secure hardware wallet today and use the code unchained 10 for a limited time 10% discount I've run so we all greatly value our freedom but there are many threats today to the future freedom around the world and I'm here to talk to you about the role that technology can play in promoting freedom and democracy and capitalism and many of the other pillars of a free society I will focus on some of the most promising technologies today in particular those that enable what's called decentralized applications and I'll explain what those are as well as dive into the types of applications that we can actually enable that can help us be more free so a little bit about me my name is Ryan Shay I am the co-founder of a community and platform called block stack for building decentralized applications if you want to tweet about this presentation mentioned me you can find me on twitter at ryan e che so in harry potter bear with me for a second and the about to make a point in harry potter there are three unforgivable curses and so those three are Avada Kedavra which results in in death there is crutial which is torture and then there is imperio which results in total control and i want to introduce the concept that there is this same equivalent in the digital world there are three digital sins that form the basis of some of the worst things that can happen in the digital world that can allow us to be victims in in the physical world as well and I would like to highlight these three as surveillance censorship and manipulation so surveillance is the collection analysis and sharing of our information without our consent censorship is the controlling of the information that we can receive and disseminate and then manipulation is the actual controlling of the types of information the actual content that reaches us often with the inclusion of false information that can cause us to change our behavior in ways that we won't even realize it and so this is a really big deal because these three digital sins can greatly influence the way that the world plays out this can greatly influence democracy around the world and we can take a look at a democracy map from 2017 it's very important especially in the wake of the recent events of the last couple of decades you know we saw the Arab Spring which was enabled by an in part by social media and so many other changes of the landscape around the world it's so important that we get the digital world right this is the way that we communicate throughout the world this is the way that we congregate this is the way that we work together this is the a very strong binding force of humanity but with the right software we can do a few very important things we can limit mass surveillance we can combat censorship and we can prevent and protect ourselves from manipulation I'm going to go into exactly what decentralized applications are but note that with decentralized applications there are three very important things to take away one is that you own your data your data is stored with you it's backed up in your own private personal cloud it is encrypted with keys on your device intend encrypted between devices - there is no central operator that can be coerced it is a decentralized network you can think of something like email or BitTorrent or Bitcoin no one operates that there's no single door to knock on like with Facebook or Google and the third thing is that there are you have choice between the different versions of your software just like with email you can choose between Gmail Outlook and many other pieces of software with Bitcoin you can choose your Bitcoin wallet with Bitcoin with BitTorrent you can choose the client that you want to use to download files with centralized applications that this is the traditional applications that we use today think Facebook Instagram you open up your phone and you connect directly to the data centers of these companies every single action you take is connecting to this massive server farm that hosts all the data for billions of people if you share a photo and I view that photo you've uploaded the photo to these massive server farms I've communicated to the same location and pulled the photos back down and and millions and millions of people are doing this every day billions of people have this information this is a model that is very problematic because all this data is stored in these massive massive data farms and everyone who can gain access to these farms can also see your data and also has the ability to manipulate the information I'll talk about a new model which is the decentralized model so with decentralized applications it's very different instead each of our data is stored in our own private personal clouds if you have a photo and you want to share it with me I will go and I will grab it from your personal cloud and the same thing in Reverse the data is goes directly between us and it happens with every person who's involved in the entire system this we believe this trend of decentralization is the next wave of the internet internet 3.0 so the the you know this is the early internet there was the internet 2.0 which really moved to the cloud an internet 3.0 is marked by decentralization as mentioned earlier I'm the co-founder of a network of a platform called block stack and this is a platform for decentralized applications for developers to build them for consumers to discover them and if you go to block stack today you can go and sign up you can create your identity and start playing around with some of these decentralized applications and I'll highlight three decentralized applications that exist today that you can use today so one of them is called graphite you can and this is an application for collaborative document editing so you can think Google suite Google Documents and Google sheets but in a way that's decentralized that means that we can collaborate on a document or a spreadsheet and there isn't a Google that is coordinating these edits that's pretty groundbreaking right we are directly collaborating on the on these documents between our computers right and there was actually a journalist Tom Simon at Wired who wrote an article about graphite and he wrote the article in graphite itself the second application I want to highlight requires a quick introduction we saw that signal you know it's a very very important application for private chat but potentially the most secure that exists today but one of the challenges with signal is it's being censored around the world and there's many people who don't actually have access to that application they've been using sophisticated measures using the tools that Amazon and Google provide to be able to circumvent this but even now they're hitting roadblocks that are very hard for them to overcome one of the challenges with signal is that it's still produced and distributed by a single corporation there's still one version of the application if signal were a decentralized application and any developer could publish a version of signal on a decentralized chat communication network then it would be a lot easier to distribute the application to people who need to be able to access it there's actually a decentralized chat application today that you can use it's called stealthy and this is very important because you know the software is open-source you can download it and when we communicate we communicate directly between our devices directly between our personal clouds and the third application that I want to highlight is one that's very very important for democracy we saw how social media has been so critical in promoting communication and promoting the ability for Freedom Fighters to be able to congregate and to be able to influence their Nations for the greater good of course there are some also dark sides of social media but we need to focus on ways that we can move it forward and continually improve and some of the ways that we can move beyond the existing model of social media is to move to a model where we have decentralized social media we saw how there are so many great benefits to email being decentralized we need social media to be decentralized in the same way that email is if we can do that then that means we can have a choice of our own software we can evade censorship we can have data sharing on our own terms we can have increased privacy and when there are challenges to fake news or the way that there that our feeds are being influenced with advertisements in ways that we don't like we can always switch to a different version of this of the software on the same network so you can see how this decentralization of the network and the competition of software between developers is critical to enabling us to move forward and have social media that truly supports truth and truly supports privacy and safety and freedom and these these types of applications mark the future mark a way forward for us to live in a much more free world thank you so much hi everyone I'm Galia Bernard C founder of the Bancorp protocol I just want to start by saying that I speak frequently in front of tech audiences and innovation audiences and financial audiences and never have I been more humbled and grateful than to speak in front of those who fight for freedom so thank you so the future of money and user-generated currencies I really want to use our time up here to zoom out a bit and talk about money itself what it is why we need it why we have it where maybe it went wrong and how we might be able to fix it and I start with this slide any useful statement about the nutrition at first seemed ridiculous this photo was taken in downtown Palo Alto where I grew up in the heart of the Silicon Valley and blessed with every human right truly that one can imagine and in Silicon Valley the the mandate and the ethos is that we can design and invent our way out of problems and that we can manifest the future through technology another book that I love to to share as a backdrop here is sapiens by Yuval Hari and in the beginning of this book he distinguishes how humans are different than other animals on a level of consciousness and the way that we're different he explains is stories we tell each other stories we tell ourselves stories and these stories govern our organizational ability and truly this arc of humanity over time so as a quick example if you were to put a hundred thousand Apes in Times Square you would very quickly see violence and chaos more than likely however if you put a hundred thousand humans in Times Square we generally figure it out and that is because of the stories that we've told ourselves over generations stories like how to behave in Times Square stories like walk on greens stop on red traffic lights are here to protect you and there are billions of other stories truly that we tell ourselves and the reason I bring this up is that money is one of these stories money is a story that we've told ourselves about how we can collaborate as a society so in the beginning of time we didn't have money money wasn't here before we were we brought it into fruition we invented it there are many reasons for this and some of the most obvious are that in small groups we had the trust the innate trust and the belief in the other people we were working with to not need to keep track of who was giving what and who had what we simply did what we did we woke up and we grew the food and we fed the people and we got the water and we the children and we did the things that we call living and we did them without any need for accounting of who was doing what or a kind of a non quantitative accounting as our collaboration grew into larger and larger groups not just in our family but in our tribe not just in our tribe but with other tribes and fast forward to today not just in our city or our neighborhood but in our country and in all of the countries we developed this shared accounting system this tool for human collaboration at skill and this accounting system in its most pure form in its ideal form maybe is meant to tell us whether any individual ourselves included is in balance with the system supposedly if we have a lot of money what that indicates to others and to the system is that we have given a lot to society we have given a lot to other people we have sold goods and services we have helped we have contributed we have invented we have provided some kind of value that allowed this money to flow our way and our big stack of money is meant to show people how much we've given and then to afford us to receive in return not necessarily from the person that gave to us but from someone else in the system it's a systemic flow accounting technology so let's talk a little bit about money what we actually used for this accounting system what money has been and what it is today so what we call money 1.0 money came from the earth right we all remember this time money was gold money was silver money was salt money was oil money was sticks or seashells physical objects from the earth that we could all point to and say you know that's our accounting system if you have a lot of it you've given and if you have not a lot of it you haven't given and we strive to stay in balance with the system ideally money 2.0 and this is the era that we're in today and perhaps changes upon us in money 2.0 money comes from the government right so the government of every nation has been given the responsibility and the privilege to decide what is money how much of it there is and most importantly who gets it when it's fresh off the printing press or fresh off the digital press where does it go and how is it distributed in society and now we enter what I believe is the most exciting era of money and this is the era where money comes from the people and when I say people I mean the people who invented Bitcoin the people who invented aetherium me and my team who invented a currency called bank or and thousands and thousands and thousands of other teams out there that are inventing currency after currency many of them you have heard of many more of them you haven't heard of and these are what we call crypto currencies today and so when money comes from the people we have a completely different paradigm right because any one of these people can make a completely different decision about how they're creating the money and most importantly who gets it what is the distribution mechanism for these monies what is the monetary policy for any one of these currencies so you might ask yourself at this moment and this is what me and my team did six years ago at the beginning of a very long startup struggle was why can't anyone just make a money we have the internet we have smartphones we have marketplaces what is actually preventing us side from laws on the books what is actually preventing humans from making money the jig is up money is what you believe it to be if I make a money and you accept it it's money so why isn't everyone doing this and what we discovered is that what makes a money actually money what gives it what gives it its value to begin with is its liquidity a liquid currency is a valuable currency an illiquid currency is play money right and liquidity is the ability to have someone else accept your money at some given time for the good or service that you want including some other money that you might want to trade your money for and this liquidity is the lifeblood of a currency and until today we have only known these currencies to be liquid generally there are a few outliers to this map and of course today Bitcoin and etherium and some of the other currencies join this map but you can count these currencies on a few hands these are a few hundreds of currencies that are liquid because the government's distribution of them has ensured to other people in other countries that they can use this money for some kind of goods and services and of course the exchange rates fluctuate and tell us how reliable is that promise of any given money so I'll walk you through a very brief experiment that my team and I did called community currency in Tel Aviv in Israel we minted a digital currency called hearts in Hebrew the word is Lev and this marketplace was called the heart market Lev market this currency was created for mothers and it was issued to Mother's and over 20,000 mothers joined the currency collective and essentially could earn these hearts for doing things that were valuable to this community of mothers those were things like volunteering in the schools volunteering in the after-school programs tutoring the children picking up someone else's child from school and bringing them home babysitting baking a cake for a birthday party really anything that you can imagine that was valuable to these families they received the hearts for joining they received the hearts for bringing other women into the network and they received the hearts for contributing in what we might call sweat equity to the community and then they could spend these hearts with other mothers in the community and what we discovered was astounding in under a year 20,000 mothers performed over 24 million dollars worth of transactions of commerce between them just in hearts not a shekel not a dollar ever changed hands and what we asked ourselves was why weren't they doing this to begin with we didn't really invent anything here all the mothers were there before all the goods and services were there before and of course Israel has a national currency the shekel just like most countries have a national currency and it's not even a very volatile or vulnerable one and so why wasn't this commerce opening before the hearts entered the scene and the answer was these mothers didn't have any shekels in their pockets specifically these mothers were from low-income or at-risk communities and all of the shekels that they had access to were allocated to rent to food to school - gasps - bills and health insurance and all of the other payments and there were no shekels left over at the end of the day to buy a birthday cake for a birthday party or to buy new toys or new clothes or things we might call discretionary spending and so what we've realized in this experiment was that when we injected a community with more money and of course that exercise involves trust and execution and user experience and all of the things but when we injected a high quality currency tool into a community commerce happened people gave to each other people bought from each other people collaborated around local needs and goods and services in the community and there was incredible abundance achieved in a short time I take you now to this book rethinking money by Bernard Lee Ataru became the president of the Bank or foundation he's well known as being one of the co-creators of the euro and in fact he's one of the co-creators of the euro project he came from the Central Bank of Belgium who abandoned the euro project as it was being let's call it redesigned by the politicians for other needs and and what Bernard has to say is that somewhere between one currency per nation and one currency per person is the right number of currencies for us to have true abundance among people it's certainly more than one per nation it's likely less than one per person and it's somewhere in the middle and the paradigm that he describes with community currencies and why me we might want to have more than one currency pronation really is the spectrum between efficiency and resilience both good things both bad things and I leave you also with this thought that nothing is binary right everything is is a conversation and even freedom can lead to democracies that lead to elections that lead to leaders that we may not consider good or bad right and so on this spectrum of efficiency and resiliency basically he says one world currency would be the most efficient the most efficient thing we can imagine no exchange rates everybody understands the money we printed in one place we give it to everyone it's highly efficient just like a bulldozer that can log the entire rainforest in five minutes is highly highly efficient however is efficiency the thing that we're striving for is that the thing that we're striving for above all and this is the question today that we find ourselves in capitalist societies as well on the other side of the spectrum of efficiency we have resilience that rainforest is not very resilient to a very efficient bulldozer communities are not very resilient to very efficient monetary systems that suck jobs away to lower income or more efficient labour economies right and so these are economic questions that are more about ethics than they are about math because the technology itself money included is morally agnostic and the designers of the technology the people are the ones to endow it with the morals that we choose and so Barnard notices that the UN sustainable development goals that we talk about a lot here amount to about four trillion dollars it would cost about four trillion dollars according to the UN to solve almost all of our extra central problems you guys are familiar with this list human trafficking water safety all of the all of the basic human rights and basic human needs four trillion dollars who's going to pay and we look around and I think all of us experience that that deflationary feeling that no one is going to agree ever to contribute these four trillion dollars to solve these problems and so what bernhard has to say is why don't we mint a new four trillion dollars why are we still relying on the old dollars the old euros the old yen's the old money too solve our problems when clearly it has been shown that the system itself gravitates towards the type of outcomes that we see today so this graph is is meant to describe an phenomenon in the internet that we call the longtail has anyone heard of this term before so the longtail is the phenomenon that says when you lower technical barriers to entry you have two to three orders of magnitude of volume in folks who might try to use a tool and approach a tool then you would otherwise and so the the thesis here is that if you lower technical barriers to entry if you allow people to create their own currencies and we're talking currencies you can't even imagine yet currencies that link their money supply to the temperature of the earth currencies that reward the teachers in a community before the bankers any monetary policy that you can imagine can today be coded into crypto currencies and manifests into society and so this long tail is what value looks like when not only governments or maybe large corporations can issue currency tools but truly anyone can try anyone can approach the platform's anyone can mint a money and will see two to three orders of magnitude of the value between people than we do today thank you good morning I'm here to answer this question and to give you an overview of what I've been observing over the last few years essentially the rise of the surveillance state and surveillance capitalism enabled by technology William Gibson has this famous quote which is the future is already here it's just an evenly distributed most people see this as a utopian kind of ideal as like as long as we just keep waiting we'll have the Jetsons or some other perfect world I see it in a very more dystopian way right now when it comes to surveillance we have incredibly powerful technologies being developed by States and by companies that are leading to a kind of world that we may not observe all the time in Norway or other parts of the world but when you travel to different parts of the world like China you start feeling it in a very visceral way four years ago Nikko cell stood on the stage talked about the growth of this and the prediction that this was going to happen and I think in the last four years we've seen in many different ways whether it's from States or companies in a very real way the rise of this kind of environment for example recently in China citizens protested by throwing paper airplanes which is the symbol of the telegram messaging app and telegram was shut down in a very severe way after they refused to hand over keys to the FSB to allow the FSB to actually access the messages that were going through the platform Russia thank you thank you for correcting me yes this is the Russia right China Russia I'm sorry thank you for lighting this up and they didn't that such a severe way that they actually blocked huge portions of IP addresses they're just willing to just shut down the internet in sections in Russia moving up to China the social credit system the social credit system is literally like some kind of episode from black mirrors TV series and this is real this is happening it's about to launch and essentially every action you take every kind of interaction and commercial action you take affects your social credit score and already millions of people have even blocked from flights in China and I don't know about you guys this is like terrifying to me and not only that but China is now actually Chinese companies are developing these technologies and capable of exporting them and already exporting them different countries closer to home I live in San Francisco this recent situation with Facebook and Cambridge analytic oh I think helps people understand that this isn't just a status you there are companies out there now and I think we're all starting to wake up to the fact that the current business models of most of the major internet platforms is based upon your information and selling it and gathering your information and selling it and every time you subscribe every time you give something up every time you click that little button that says yes it's ok to track me yes it's ok to take this data and use it you're buying into the system and you have no choice because we're also gonna do you knock me on Facebook you're knocking me on Twitter these are the mechanisms by which we engage each other right now in a distributed society going back in time a little bit in the late 1800s in England my home country there was a prison called the panopticon and this prison was fascinating in the sense that the prisoners had no idea where they were being surveilled the the warden was shielded from them but he was shining a light into all the different prisons in this architecture and essentially everybody had to behave as if they were being surveilled at any point in time because they had no idea what no idea whether they were being surveilled at any point in time and the point of this example is really that the architecture that we build whether its physical architecture or technological architecture influences the culture that we create and I believe this is even more important today another example of this in the real world here now today is in the Xinjiang province of China this is a predominantly Islamic area in China and the surveillance and enforcement of surveillance is so intense it includes DNA testing includes capturing people's phones at checkpoints and checking to see what kind of applications they have and stripping the ones off that they or potentially locking people up if they have the wrong kind of applications that are not state authorized and the point again is is that with this kind of surveillance and people just behave as if they are being surveilled all the time so to the point you don't even need to have such intense surveillance after a while and again Chinese companies are now essentially weaponizing productizing this technology and currently exporting it to other countries in the world that want to have this kind of control so surveillance really is this mechanism surveillance and censorship are intrinsically linked and the future of surveillance and data gathering is going to be driven by the people who are concentrating this information concentrating the information about you whether it's governments or corporations and then controlling you Laval Harare recently gave an amazing TED talk where he really talked about this specific issue of how the greatest danger that we face to contemporary liberal democracies is this concentration of power into the hands of a few and how fascism becomes a very tempting thing to build I think it's very important to think about this as like we are moving towards this environment because of the centralization of the systems so what can we do so whoever controls they did 10 as a future so what I see this as an existential choice so sense you have these two extremes we have complete control total surveillance or we have full anonymity now people are usually terrified when I say this like imagine if you lived in the world where you could literally communicate without being surveilled you could actually access whatever information you wanted to and the user response I get is well what about all the bad people so yeah what about all the bad people well the bad people use technology just like good people do but unlike Teresa may who believes that every time there's some kind of incident we must ban all encryption which is interesting given that the City of London require relies on that fall of his trading I didn't believe that encryption causes bad behavior I think that as Gary was saying people cause bad behavior and my friend Zuko actually gave me this quote as he said last year as I was starting this project with my team that he said you know if you get this right I'll explain what we're doing in a minute the internet could actually be the last place on the world where you have privacy and I think that I'm not sure any cameras in here surveilling I'm sure these these TV ones are but you just walk down the street take a look where I'm from in England there are more closer circuit TV cameras per person in the world and also no bill of rights by the way sir you'd be grateful if you have one and I think there's something to think about here is there's what if the internet in the last place that we can actually communicate securely privately without surveillance so how do we do this my belief is that you need to distribute the architecture otherwise you have central points of control and when I explain these two extremes people say well can't we have some kind of like halfway house where someone we really trust holds the keys and holds the data and I say well we're not doing too good at trusting central parties or third parties governments banks remember 2008 and the technologies I've been working on for a while now are fundamentally based on distributing the architecture and removing central third parties project that my team and I started last year is called orchid companies called orchid labs and we are focused on this idea of building a system which gives you the capability to have anti surveillance and anti censorship technology at a very low level in order to be able to build applications that can take advantage of these systems a little bit about the architecture I won't get too technical here you can ask me later essentially we've we we model our company and everything we do based around attack vectors and trying to build resistance to attack vectors the basic architecture has what's called an overlay network it sits on top of the regular Internet and traffic is routed through a series of nodes each of which is encrypting and routing traffic in an efficient way and allows the user to essentially be completely invisible in terms of who they are and where they came from and what they're doing to any of the people wanting to monitor in the middle or to the final resources whether it's a website or virtual reality app a game so what can you build on top of these things well first of all secure communications the ability to have messaging that don't have a central third party if you go to China you really have one choice WeChat there are a couple of other ones state-sponsored ones but that's your choice and if we entered into a totalitarian environment in any of the countries that we live in I think the very first thing people would do is take out the messaging apps or say this thing now needs to be centralized and controlled and monitored by the government and if you try and type certain things into WeChat they don't end up on the other side that she gets filtered automatically social networks we've heard about a little bit and we recognize these problems here and one of the primary examples were focused on first is actually secure access to the Internet I mentioned many countries so far but there are literally countries where you just can't access the sort of things that you expect you we expect to be able to access by default here and that leads to first of all surveillance if somebody's trying to access a site that is not allowed then they are monitored they are questioned censorship you can't access information you can't find out what actually happened at Xian square for example in China and finally I think there's some interesting spaces around distributed marketplaces and basically whatever app you want to build this is the core belief that I have on our team house and we believe that choosing freedom choosing the way that you build things the way the architecture you build fundamentally affects the culture of the systems and the kind of society we live in oh yeah I guess I was young thanks very much good morning so uh my name is Arthur Brightman I work on a blockchain project called tezo's and I'm going to be talking about block chains as coordination technology and trying to give a sense of what it is exactly that they do and what they can be good for so there's a French philosopher attended a Boise who wrote the treatise on voluntary servitude and in this release he wonders how can it be that you can have a tyrant in power and he's just a single person you have a population that could be Millions they do not recognize this intimacy and so they could very easily topple him but for some reason they don't and and the question is well you know as a is that voluntary servitude and the answer to this paradox in game theory is known as a prisoner's dilemma so in a prisoner's dilemma you have two prisoners who are being interrogated and it can either decide that you know they're gonna dish on the other one and say you know he did it give all the information in which case it will both get a both of them will get a heavy sentence if they both betray each other is it collaborates they get a life sentence and and here's a problem if one collaborates and the other one betrays the one who betrays goes free and so in this scenario you might look at this and say well clearly you know it would benefit by collaborating with each other and and and not betraying each other however if I don't know what the other prisoner is going to be doing I say well you know either either they're gonna betray me in which case I should betray them I might as well or they're not going to betray me in which case I still benefit from betraying Xiamen so both sides can think the same saying and they can Beach and they both betray each other and you get this poor outcome and this is described as the fact that what is a Nash equilibrium so Nash equilibrium is the equilibrium you have in a game when every size reasons independently of the other by saying okay you know they're gonna follow strategy and regardless of which strategy I'm they're going to follow I need to find what strategy I'm going to follow so that's a Nash equilibrium well what we would like is something called a parrot or equilibrium and in a parrot or equilibrium you're in a solution where everyone you know you you can't make anyone better off by changing things and so clearly in the case of the prisoner's it could be both better off by not betraying so you don't have a parrot or tellurium but that's and that's a problem how do you get there interestingly the way they can get there is not communication all right you can even if they can talk to each other it's not you know it's not here they did helps because talk is cheap they can keep talking they can keep exchanging information but at the end of the day ones if done you know once if done discussing they're still gonna be faced with the same decision the one thing that can make a difference is contract if they are able to make a contract with each other they can do credible commitments a contract with some penalty for breaking the contract so if they can have this ability to coordinate with reels with something real at stake with value with money then then perhaps now they can start coordinating so that's the generic idea of how you solve the prisoner's dilemma and it turns out that you can you can solve all of these problems in game series where you have everyone could be better off if only people co-op collaborated but they can't collaborate all of that in at least in theory can be solved by contracting if you let people have self enforcing contracts now the problem is contracts can be difficult to create and they can be expensive and so one of the one of the interest of this blockchain is that they allow this type of cooperation now when people talk about these blockchains network like like Bitcoin for example a very common metaphor is to look at the internet and people say oh look it's just like the Internet it's all these people communicating with each other but I think that what this metaphor misses is that it's not about it's it's it's not about communication it's not about data it's really about putting something valuable at stake when when when coordinating so what can you do where something that leads to coordinates well the first thing you can do is you can do money right so blockchains are mostly known for powering cryptocurrencies so you can build these units you can trade in those units and that it turns out is a really important building block for contracts money is coordination right it's say it's the idea that we're all going to agree that we're gonna give some value to some units and I'm going to agree to accept it with the idea is that someone else might accept it in the future money is the closest thing that we have to real to some full of real social contract you will see a lot of users of blockchains being discussed because obviously this was a big surprise that you could that you could do money like this and it could work and so there's a lot of hype around blockchains and there's also a lot of solutions which don't necessarily make sense so one thing to beware of you'll see sometimes a problem and people will say well clearly you know we could solve that problem if if somehow we could throw a new technology and if we can solve it so if there's data in my problem I'm gonna take that data and I will put that data on a blockchain and since block shuns can hold data and since my problem involves data and since block chains are good and new then it's going to solve my problem and that generally doesn't work there's been a focus on traceability on tracking information saying oh we know where we're gonna put the information on where goods came from in the blockchain most of that doesn't actually doesn't quite actually work because it doesn't tap into the ability of luxans to work as coordinating mechanism so I think that if you're looking for purported solutions using productions you have to look for this coordination element and so today when you look at this public's blockchain and the type of thing that they do so you have this one there's one side who says look we can do all of these sayings but but they're not very they're not necessarily compelling applications outside of really money and and contracts and you have another side that looks at this and say well sure you know you can do money and contracts with this block chains but you could do all of that with a data base right you know why do you need why do you need the centralization at all why do you need to go through the complicated exercise of having a cryptographic protocol a peer-to-peer network notes talking to each other you could just have a single company doing that or you can have the government run it you know why isn't the government running currency and the conclusion that some people reach is they look at this and say well clearly the only reason you might want to not run this as you know as a government database is because you're trying to break the law and you know all these Bitcoin and all of that this is all for for criminals and that's that's a very dangerous argument because the argument is these people are making is that whenever people are trying to reclaim some power to reserve some power for themselves and not completely give it away for the government somehow they're doing something bad an implication here is that governments is always necessarily virtuous and we know that's not the case there's plenty of evidence to that governments have killed hundreds of millions of people in the 20th century governments killed people today a quarter of the countries on earth are dictatorships so the idea is that somehow reserving some rights for the people to protect themselves is somehow nefarious is that itself is an extremely dangerous idea that needs to be fought so to conclude briefly on on what these blocks can do block chains are good at coordination and what coordination can enable is taking diluted interest a lot of people who are in vast numbers and share some interest and putting it against concentrated interest thank you cryptocurrency is vibrant and exciting but it's

everyone welcome to our panel blockchain versus the surveillance state my name is Laura and I'm a crypto journalist covering crypto as a chess set in blockchain technology and during the press conference preceding this panel we had an impassioned discussion around whether there's a moral equivalency between imperfect democracies and dictatorships and as an American whose ancestors come from North Korea I would definitely say that there is not a moral equivalency however you will hear in this discussion that we do talk about the dangers and potentials within this technology to combat over reaches of both governments and corporations and I also wanted to echo Ghoulia's sentiments earlier that I'm so honored to be speaking and exploring the ramifications of this technology here in front of people who are fighting for freedom I hope that through this panel you will learn not only about the potential for these technologies to do good but also for the dangers that they hold within them because as you can see from the speeches before that it is you know a double-edged sword and so one note before we begin which is that you can tweet questions at us we're not going to be taking questions here in the room you can cheat tweet questions and when you pose your questions just tag at Oslo FFF so that we can see your tweet and know that it's directed for this panel and without further ado we will begin with our four speakers Ryan Arthur glia and Stephen um so before we began this this discussion I actually read a book by Dave Eggers it was made into a movie called the circle and that depicts a dystopian society I'll just briefly described it for those of you who did not get to either read the book or see the movie but it depicts a company in this dystopian world where essentially it's a company that has aspects of what we would recognize as Google Facebook Twitter Instagram Amazon 23andme ancestry.com Spotify I try to write them all down down on Apple health Fitbit and many others that I probably didn't even notice the credit score companies and something that was interesting is that before the panel I'd been thinking like oh this is a kind of the sci-fi world but you know another question that I was going to pose to the audience was about WeChat in China and eventually had dawned on me that actually WeChat is probably not that dissimilar from this company because what happens in the book is that this starts out as a private company but eventually by the end it's sort of merges with the state and it becomes obviously quite creepy but here we are in this situation where we do have a company like we chatted as a company but it is very close with the Chinese government and does allow the government to censor and surveil the transactions of the users on the platform so a question that I wanted to pose for you guys was how you believe watching technology could be used to either combat or prevent situations like like what we're seeing now with WeChat or in this dystopian future put depicted in the circle I actually think that the Sun actually think that blockchain technology can completely enable that future if used in the wrong way so I don't think the blockchain technology is necessarily a solution I think it's very much on the design of a system and the examples this is the crypto ruble from China which is and being designed by the guys who built kiri which essentially as Russia's response to Visa MasterCard essentially Russia saw here don't build our Curie and sponsored that company to face the existential threat of the u.s. shutting down these robbed MasterCard essentially the future is not necessarily physical wars economic war its crypto war and so that system includes blockchain components but it has like very strict kyc very strict tracking of information and then you see some cell phone companies integrating blockchain technology into the chips which if done on the right way is great it's really helpful and out there in the wrong way then that links your location to your payment information to your identity etc and stored in the blockchain so it's very much how you design the system yeah so let's draw that out a little bit further because as you guys saw from the presentations blockchains are immutable Ledger's of transactions and so it done in the wrong way it can actually create a situation where data that you may not want about you will be permanently recorded somewhere so how can you design a system in a way that is you know good and and is kind of in line with what all the goals of a conference like this are about and then what are the ways in which it could be designed where it could be used for nefarious purposes so I'll jump in and say that maybe on the the positive side around this technology and Ryan mentioned it as well which is that once you reduce the technical barriers to entry and you let folks use these tools it's in many ways like a point of no return so for example one of the strongest ways that nefarious governments and also let's call them regular government used to control the people is they control the money right if they freeze your bank account if they put a sanctions on your nation this is one of the most accessible ways to control the behavior of another is to restrict their money supply so that they can't operate within society if you allow folks to create new money supplies you can circumvent a lot of that pressure think of the example of Greece Greece finds itself in a financial crisis where all the euros are leaving Greece all the people are still in Greece all the factories are still in Greece all the needs and wants are still in Greece but the money is gone and so the country's at a standstill and the people really suffer if the people or any anyone amongst the people could create a currency and have obviously the network effect and the credibility and the immutable ledger and the trust in that currency to kind of jumpstart commerce even locally it could serve as a bridge until bigger solutions are found until the euros return to the country and all of the other things so I think the answer to the question is not how do we design the perfect system and I don't think any technologist or company or advocate or activist can design the perfect system I think the idea is to design a decentralized system that constantly lets new entrants access it and build new tools and build new solutions and keep it open yeah building off of what Galilei said um I was we just had this conference a couple weeks ago called consensus which is this kind of industry conference for the blockchain industry there was pretty incredible there I was just thinking of the graph that you put up that showed the long tail of all the different currencies and crypto projects there are literally thousands of companies in this industry that are building different blockchains crypto currencies applications protocols and services so that's I think look at that that's the there's an entire industry that's been created with companies that are companies and individuals that are all around the world you know there's no there's actually no single central location we're at it centered that's really important because there's like a point at which you know it becomes so large and pervasive that it's like you can't put that back in the box and we have to make sure that we we focus more and I think like building industries and building like competition into the system as opposed to like relying upon single individual corporations like signal you know that even they can be censored and shut down even they can be targeted we need to we need to we need to strive for entire industries really taking a technology and allowing it to pervade all of the professionals around the world so it just becomes part of our of our fabric and I think you know just make another comment I think there are certain technologies that you know any technology can be used for good or for bad but I think there's certain technologies that lend themselves either more on the side of consolidating power or more on the side of distributing power you know you look at like that one very famous one is its gunpowder right and and the gun that was you know often referred to as the great equalizer partly because it really shifted the dynamics of warfare and really helped create the the distribution of power a very important thing and so I think I do think that while there are some perils of blockchain technology it's very similar to gunpowder in that it can distribute you know if we actually approach it the right way and that it can distribute power to people around the world and give them increased access especially through things like the ability to choose your own software and the ability to fork a system yeah I think there's those are all really important points but actually when I circle back a little bit to what Galileo was saying because um we had a question coming on Twitter earlier about the petrol which is a cryptocurrency that was created by Chavez in Venezuela and it's supposedly backed by the value of the oil reserves there in Venezuela however I think most people in the crypto world at least view this as an example of kind of a nefarious actor trying to use this technology in a way that probably doesn't further the ideals that are generally within this community and one of the Oslo Freedom Forum members who is from Willett told me that there was a point in 2007 where they basically lopped off three zeros from the currency so if you had a thousand bolivars suddenly it was one and since then hyperinflation has taken off and she said that at one point it was you know something like a thousand bolivars to a dollar and now it's eight hundred and eighty three thousand on the black market she said but the official rate is 80 thousand so hyperinflation is actually something that a lot of people end up watching and crypto as a community discuss so can you talk a little bit about how you think that the this technology can can help fight that I'll say that the technology is always part of the problem and part of the solution what's beautiful coming from a software background is that software allows us to program ideas into the application so you know I would leave it to the economists in a room or to the mathematicians in the rumor to the social anthropologists in room to suggest ways that we can combat inflation and currency and there are many many ideas out there for example de Mirage de Mirage is a negative interest so it basically says that currency expires over time meaning that if you hold it you lose it and so the way to get the most benefit are the bang for your buck is to spend it and to you know pass it on and that that's what money is essentially made to do is to spend and not to hold so it's just one example and de Mirage can be very easily programmed into a cryptocurrency and so can many other monetary policies so I think the the bigger frame that I see really is the access to the tools and letting folks try their ideas and program them into currencies and and run pilots and and see what happens and also kind of having the empathy as a collective for the process we need to go through I think someone mentioned it in the in the press conference which was you don't go from dictatorship to democracy in kind of one step right there's a process there around education transparency conflict resolution compromise different things that could contribute to a healthy democracy and the same with this right you don't go from national currencies and the regime that we've been under of national currencies and this economic slavery that many people can point to you don't go from that to great anyone can make a currency it's going to be amazing in one fell swoop there's a process there's a lot of learning to be had and as long as we open up the tools to everyone to try we'll be kind of getting the best ideas and learnings from from the entire population and how do we prevent things like the petrol or or just deal with them or or what do you make of the petrol that was the question from Twitter that I wanted to to mention somebody from Venezuela was asking you know what you guys think of them I think one really cool thing is I think that a lot of people don't fully appreciate is that you can take the you know when you move these currencies to a blockchain system they're now part of this too centralized database that can be just forked you know someone can copy the database create a new version and then they can change anything about it that means that governments could of course you know take money away from individual citizens at the same time the citizens could collectively take money away from the government you could actually imagine that if the citizens have the ability to coordinate together they can just delete the balance of the government and now the government can't pay the military and now the government can't actually enforce anything so the military just leaves and then they're like they turn on the dictator so I think there are actually now that's obviously very difficult but it changes money into an idea and if everyone can agree upon the same idea that everyone can change the reality I think you have to look at the you know like the Gunpowder you have to look at the balance of things you know anything you do can be used by anyone if you are if you can find a way to increase crop yields and all of a sudden you know some dictatorships has lower costs for feeding their army you know that's this type of things happen and so yeah it's possible that sequela might decide to issue their cryptocurrencies but you have to look on the balance you know our cryptocurrency is something that our army that is making the dictatorship in in Venezuela better off or worse off and I think the balance is clearly worse off because it prevents their ability well I think not not maybe not enough today because these technologies are fairly new but in a long run this is the type of technology that will prevent them from just basically stealing their entire populations money by debasing the currency so you know on the on the balance it makes them far less powerful and I also wanted to ask you I know that your grandfather has an interesting story from Nazi Germany and and I feel like that story if you can tell it but then also related to your thoughts about you I mean so it's an interesting story I mean it's many people story my my my grandfather in France was sent to to to the camps in in Germany and fortunately survived and at same time the rest of my family was flying so your friends but you know just a more general lesson is you know a very popular instrument in jewel in Jewish culture is a violin as opposed to the piano because it's much easier to take a violin with you in the program than a grand piano and likewise you see a lot of lawyers and doctors among the Jews my grandfather was a doctor and one of the reason you become a doctor or lawyer is because you were billion capital that you can keep in your head right because if you're trying to build up capital by being a land owner and you get expropriated that doesn't work so well and criminal currency is the first time that you can actually hold value in your head that's more liquid than just a doctor's training or law degree so I think that's that's something that you really really knew when and fairly interesting and again you know when my family fled to to avoid the camps they were breaking the law so I also actually wanted to discuss Stephens project because when I talked with Stephen before this panel he mentioned that he is an ethicist on some staff and i wanted to ask you kind of what are the questions that you guys pose and then when you make decisions about how to design your protocol how do you make those decisions carefully yes it's um which is very we're very conscious of the that choice I was talking about sort of existential choice between full control [Music] essentially anonymity and you know when you build a system that has the capability to give people you know a complete shield from censorship and surveillance you have to carefully think through issues that are involved in that and so it's definitely all mind a lot of the time and you know my personal perspective is that's my car I was saying you know people do bad things and and I don't think that I also believe that you know increased access information and real information is gonna create a better society but there are clearly challenges when you create technologies that allow people to be completely invisible to observation and do you think there is any way to design it to either discourage or prevent people like terrorists or like a nefarious day doctor like you at North Korea from using your technology well I guess my question back will be what's the middle ground like who do we trust you know 2008 showed that we can't really trust banks and we've not been able to trust corporations we've seen that recently and weird you know most of us believe we can't trust the government so so who is the trusted third party that we anoint with the right to own our keys and our data so that it's hard to find a middle ground so do any of you have any thoughts around that I mean is it just sort of like oh well like we're gonna design this as we feel like and if they lose that they use it or I think I think about what you said it's the crux of the matter right trust the whole technology is basically about trust and how do you create trust at scale a with people we don't know billions of people we don't know and be given what we do know about human nature and like the prisoner's dilemma and all the other things we know about human nature and things we don't yet know about human nature which is you know how do we behave in situations of scarcity how do we behave in situations of uncertainty how do we behave in situations of perceived threat real threat perceived threat and so often you'll hear that blockchain is called the truth machine and the reason that it's called the truth machine one of the reasons is that all of the data let's say transactions that are stored on it cannot be tampered with you can't go back to the email and change the text in the forwarded history in the bottom of the email it's it's locked into what's called a block and in order to make a change in a block you would need over half of the network to agree with you collude with you on making that change and so I think the the idea behind trust is again a human and an ethical idea it's a it's a question also a faith and then it's a question of design and engineering and math and how much kind of systemic thinking can we put into aligning ourselves with the best possible outcomes the most times and it doesn't mean there won't be abuses right but when when folks ask me about terrorists using crypto currencies I think of terrorists using cash and terrorists using all the other things that terrorists use and I think how do we prevent terror from wanting to be enacted on others right what's the underlying what's the root cause maybe we can't solve those causes maybe we can try but that choking off the crypto supply chain or the cash supply chain hasn't really prevented terrorism to date and there's no reason to think that it will prevent it moving forward I also point out that there's a big difference between dragnet mass surveillance and endpoints you know endpoint surveillance so for hundreds of years we've had you know ways to for like law enforcement to get a warrant or to be able to collect information on individuals and to enforce the law and we have those many tools available to us today a lot of these a lot of these tools that help him increased privacy they are looking to you know really change the landscape so that you don't have a situation where billions of people can be spied on at the same time but they're very you know it's it's important that we like focus more on like enforcing law and preventing bad actors from being able to harm people through the use of the you know very useful and traditional law enforcement tools that we've used for a long time so we've kind of talked about the pitfalls of this technology but I just want to paint a picture because we sort of got a piecemeal a little bit through your speeches but if kind of all of our ideals about how this technology might become developed come to fruition then what could our world look like someday you know what what happened to the weed shots of the world or to the Facebook Cambridge analytic a type situations or the Equifax hack what would what would a person's everyday life look like if you ask me and what bank our focuses on is allowing anyone to create a viable currency we don't design the currencies we designed our own currency but we designed the tools that will let others create currencies in their vision so we threw out a few examples but a burningman currency might reward the huggers or the gatekeepers or the garbage collectors and a teacher's currency might reward in different ways so our vision is that the people themselves can gather around networks of value as they see value in their vision and so to me what that says in a very practical sense is in terms of the labor force folks will be able to live and make a living doing what they're passionate about doing doing what they're called to do I think we all know so many people whether directly or indirectly that work for money don't like their jobs maybe even hate their jobs maybe even don't believe in the thing that their company or their organization is doing but they do it because we need the money I think that we can flip this entire system on its and have the money flow to the things we are actually called to do and if that thing doesn't exist out there already as a job that you can get then it's a job that you can make and if it's creating value for people it will create value for you so to me what it looks like is more poets more artists more joy in our work more people over profits and finding ourselves less in this existential dilemma that I think we're all in and especially in a lot of the work that that folks here do which is choosing between what is right and what is profitable what is right and what is practical I think the world where value creation can come from anywhere in society is a world where the thing that you're passionate about is also practical and it's practical to be human theaters before um before we started or at least now there's sort of dinner party conversation with people and say hey you know you know that you've had these issues of surveillance you know you have this issues of you know you're using the wrong app using the wrong messaging out there watching you and even today when I light up my phone or turn on my computer I'm sitting I gonna care and use this VPN app or and use this thing and I made sure that you know I'm not being surveilled I just assume I am at this point so I think you know people would say well I can't do all these really complicated steps you're something to do why can't I just press a button just works and so I look to your future where you just press a button or you didn't think about pressing about you just know that you're not being watched you're not being censored that's you know large past the world where that is a reality for people we're very lucky in most parts the world that we do we visit and live in that yeah sure there's some companies monitoring things and we have some intense government surveillance but we were not like directly under threat every single day for the things that we do online because most of us just you know on doing anything that's illegal or sketchy or whatever but it just changes one law in the country it changes one move from pollard political landscape from one extreme to another for that to change and then the things that you like to do or you know imagine you know the legislation around marijuana in the u.s. right now the certain areas where it's okay sometimes it's not so you're going online and searching for that maybe you break in a lot maybe you're not maybe the they go back in time and say oh hey you know we just changed the rules and you're breaking a lot back then so I think that you know being able to express yourself to express freedom to search for information to communicate freely that's the kind of world I'd like to see us move to and you just sort of glossed over you said in the beginning that you assume that you're being surveilled at this point why did you say that it's just a good assumption to have I mean I've been blockchain for five years you know I run a anti-surveillance technology company and so do you worry about the US government and I mean here I think the way that the panel was posed black chamber cells and surveillance ain't most people are not thinking of the US but what is your take on that it's one of the reasons are we based our company in the u.s. is in in order to not be scared of the US government because I believe that despite the criticisms as one of the places that actually upholds the idea in the Constitution of freedom expression and privacy so we have sin extremes of politics happening there right now but I like I said unlike my home country which has no bill of rights so we don't even know what quantum obey is in the UK because people just disappear so you know there's there's a strong differentiation there and I think that you know we need to encode more of these ideas into you into code as you've been saying not just law so that we can enforce them in different ways but I think that I'm less scared about the US government and I am about other governments so I think you know one really big trend for the future that we can that we should aspire towards is one where we can move from a world where we don't really have a choice a you know good choice profile you know right now we either use Facebook and all these other applications that have these massive drawbacks you know or we don't and I i think through the a lot of these d centralizing technologies through competition and we can get to a world where we can choose exactly the software that we want to use and this results in all of these other derivative benefits we can be very conscious about how our data is used we can be very conscious about the exact features of the applications you know you're talking about the cambridge analytic situation and you know i gave a talk last year March of last year about came original and Aloka at a time when everyone's like what are you talking about that sounds crazy but you know it's it's been something that we've kind of has been flying under the radar for a while I think in the Canberra general etiquette situation specifically I would attribute the you know perhaps the biggest risk there due to the fact that there was a monoculture in terms of the software that we use there was you know one single social network with billions of people that had a single algorithm that was governing the feeds of these billions of people and it was something that was able to be exploited whenever you have rules those rules are going to be exploited by those who are the most sophisticated and if however we had a decentralized social network with many different clients and many different pieces of software that the extent of that wouldn't have been able to happen and you would have had different developers and different teams making different decisions so I think we need to move to a world like that as opposed to a world where a blight could spread across all of the crops in in a country and just devastate the population the same thing can't happen in the digital world okay so we've literally got one minute left for this panel and I just want to frame this question because at the beginning of the internet everybody thought that oh here we have this technology enable people to communicate peer-to-peer and then said now we've got you know Facebook Twitter Google all managing our communications so as we move forward into this world of blockchain and crypto crypto assets developing what do you hope is kind of the the key design principle I guess you could say that the different projects used to ensure that we don't end up in listening situation where 20 years down the line we have the crypto version of Cambridge analytic or WeChat I'd say that it's actually it's kind of incumbent upon the entrepreneurs and the investors so you think about how to build a decentralized set of companies so often people ask me what's the Facebook of blockchain and I'm like you're asking the wrong question so we actually have the capability to build an ecosystem of lots of companies none of which is trying to take over the other one but actually wants to cooperate and you know have innovation happening in different places and I think that's a much more vibrant ecosystem and I believe that's part of the part of the mission of people who are you know in this industry so the core principles decentralization exactly treatable I think if we can build systems or that the outcome is that we're all doing well that is collaboration right when you have a zero-sum game the way we have in our finance today and so the way we have in our corporations any other company's success is a threat to you right this is why Facebook buys whatsapp buys Instagram anything that is doing well you need to either own or crush or copy in the blockchain industry at least so far we have a very different kind of ethos and the technology also lends itself to a very different manifestation because of open source because of forking you can take anything you see copy paste it make a change and if people want to run with you they can and so everything we know about IP about patents about you know private property personal property in the realm of corporate products is changing and I'll just give a quick example bank or and Tasos as well we are foundations we are not-for-profit foundations that minted currencies collected currency and now are growing our ecosystems the mandate on our foundation is foundations is not profit it's not to make a profit it's not to charge the users I get asked all the time oh do you take a fee on every transaction no absolutely not it's a not-for-profit foundation it doesn't exist to create profit that said if it grows and if the network is adopted and if people use it the value of this currency increases so there still is profit to be made and profit centers to be built on the infrastructure and in the ecosystem but profit is not the Mandate of the foundation it's adoption and growth ok we have ten seconds to be a pessimist I think this is really really hard and we don't and no one today knows exactly how to to do this really well because it's fairly new the main difficulty is that centralization is generally more efficient and there's a tendency in society to to push towards the middle of the of the distribution towards efficiency in the common case at the cost of having very high cost failure in the tails and it's really really hard to push against that trend once you have something that works you'll have centralized version of it and they work slightly better and so unless the people using it actually directly explicitly care about the centralization it can make it it can make it very very difficult it doesn't have any self worth trying one of the things we're doing in antennas for instance is that instead of having this model where well you know there's a network that people are using and then there's like a development team that works in the network that curates it and do all these tasks one of the ambition of tells us is to have self governance which means that the people who are participating in a network and using it all right directly making the decisions that impacts the future of the network and so I think the way that you make people care about the centralization is you have to appeal to something other than just efficiency you have to have peel to some saying a little more like you know a little bit like a sense of belonging a sense of community I think that let's see that that's possibly the key that is going to make people care about decentralization you know they'll use this because they're part of this community as opposed to these a corporation for example or centralized products that don't gives them the same sense of belonging okay I think that's a great point to wrap up on um it's not just in the hands of the designers but also the users you can choose to use kind of like a
