attractive and persuasive branding websites and marketing materials spark interest in your project generate buzz check out think on-ramp calm so today we're recording from beautiful Portland Oregon where I've come to see the Eclipse but that also gave me the perfect opportunity to talk with IC o---- site Smith and Crown because they are based here soup today on the show I've got CEO Brian Leo and head of research match to route Brian and nut welcome to the show thank you great to be here so let's talk first about what it is that you guys do sure I'm happy to happy to give an overview there and just to be clear this is Brian who's talking yes this is Brian so submitted crown version foremost is a researcher we've been around for over 4 years at this point and we study the breadth of the block chain space right now a lot of our research is focused on new assets that are coming online and part of that is understanding how they issue tokens and wading deep into the world of tokens sales and icos as it were I had no idea you'd been around for four years yes we've actually been around for quite some time so this was one of those things where I have another company that is a design and strategy group out of New York and one day came across Bitcoin as as many of us had and realized that this was something that was going to be what I worked on for the foreseeable future and got so excited about it started to put together a team slowly over the last few years and we spent a lot of time looking at where it was that we could really make an impact in the space you know we were super passionate about it and we wanted to figure out where you know our unique set of experiences and talents could do the the most good and make the largest impact so over time we built a team we refined our vision and then we started to publicly publish research just over two years ago or so okay and that how did you get involved it with Smith and crowd Brian and I have known each other since eighth grade and this is our second startup together second company so at some point Brian pitched me on joining to help with their research efforts and a lot of the content development applying new analytical methodologies to the crypto financial space and it was a little skeptical first he was earlier to the to the crypto and Bitcoin scene than I was but the more and more I started reading about it the more and more I got really excited about it and so I started shifting more and more of my attention to working on this to learning and to understanding with Smith and Chrome's role in this emerging industry would be I know see this was your second starting to get out what was your first so we actually worked on a documentary travel series together a number of years ago called Jet Set zero Oh interesting he really days of web TV did you travel around where did you guys go we went all around the world we actually started in Seattle and then we traveled to Vietnam Japan South Korea and Turkey oh yeah it was it was quite an experience it was accessible I was laughing for his own right he's like giggling and snickering what so funny I just apologize to Brian for bringing that up no no it's quite quite a quite an adventure not our most Loren was profitable endeavor but but certainly one rich with experiences yes I'm very familiar without having once been a travel writer so I so and then what we said what were you guys doing but you said that you had been have you at a design firm sure yeah and still do so the that was you know it's it's been quite a successful firm it continues on we brought on new partners that are handling a lot of the day-to-day operations it's called the bread iron group so yeah it was great it he gave us a real insight into user experience design interface design digital strategy and products and so forth and it kind of helped us understand role that we might play in the space we kept looking across you know we were very excited about Bitcoin in the larger industry and we were trying to figure out where you know where can we play an important role to make an impact here but I don't see the connection design and then now you're kind of doing research right so so the two things are so well one is that when we were first in the space I was still very much in the days where there were a lot of people who thought it is bitcoin is the one and only a Bitcoin forever and ever and that is the end and we really saw this as a space that we were just scratching the surface of and it was going to be far more complex far more dynamic and far more strange than anyone expected and so what we really saw as one of the critical pieces of that we didn't see being addressed and a place where we could really help is you know how do you even wrap your head around it even in the early days of it so we saw the idea of high quality intelligence and that a platform with which to interact with that intelligence as the place where we could really play that role and we worked for a lot of different companies of hairiest sizes and even in the traditional financial markets we were really dissatisfied with the quality of interfaces and work that was out there how people interact with intelligence reports analysis information so it was a problem that we had wanted to tackle for a while just in terms of the interface and design side and then we saw this need not Jeff for really compelling research but also for accessible interfaces so that everyone could interact with it and so that what was your background when you said you thought you want to do the content and research do more of that analytical background yeah a lot of my background has been research into emerging technologies so I spent a number of years in the valley in Silicon Valley with a group called Institute for the future they do yeah it features research into emerging technologies did that for a while I did some grad school work and focused a lot on smart cities and how cities are adapting emerging technologies and those are two big areas at a couple years doing economics consulting ended up helping quite a bit and that was when I made the pivot to made the pivot to this space what did you join it's a good question it was a a gradual transition into the team and then went full-time really last year okay and how many employees do you guys have now there are ten of us now and we're hiring as fast as we can yeah well I want to talk about that um let's dive into the details on how you guys do your work so how do you get your information sure it's every possible source this is when we first came into space again there's I mean in still to this day is that if you want to provide information in the space there just aren't consistent and reliable sources for the most part so a lot of the research and sourcing we do has been through a very hands-on process so one of the things that we've done is take pretty extended research trips you know across the US and internationally as well we'll actually head out to a region and do 3-4 weeks plus and everyday is meeting new organizations and individuals in the space go to building relationships and connections and learning what we can just on the ground so we've done some pretty extended trips and Israel and the surrounding areas all over Europe extensively in the US and we have some upcoming ones planned to Asia as well but essentially is that it's a combination of every possible channel and news site and information source and form combined with a couple hundred people that we know around the world that help us fed information that feed us information that we can talk to about trends so it's it's really kind of every possible channel that we can access we combine ok no I'll expand on that a little bit because a it is very important how we arrive at what we're doing and like really on when we started researching ideas and token sales we knew that this was like we saw the long-term potential this method of distributing a token raising money advertising onboarding new users for a protocol but at the time if you wanted to learn about them you were crawling through Bitcoin talk and read it and reading through white papers of varying levels of sophistication and objectivity and the barrier to information to access any of these opportunities was so so high and we saw that as a place where we could start to stitch together information from all these different sources talking to the teams talking to other teams that were doing something similar to try to create a coherent story about what these opportunities of these companies and what these protocols actually are that would make sense to a third party what percentage of the things that you write about do you actually talk to the team in person for almost 100% oh yeah for the stuff that we do that's a little bit longer form there's a couple projects where we will just write a very small amount and sometimes we don't speak to the teams but those are just summaries of existing information for stuff that's a little longer form or if we're looking at cross markets at a number of different types of applications or a number of different industries we'll talk to most of the teams ok wait you know for ones where you're just kind of grabbing info from like their website or whatever what percentage of the site is that we write on a pretty small percentage of the token sales that that contact us the inbound at this point is just is truly overwhelming there's so there's so many so it's really just a small subset of them that we go into depth and correct analysis yeah so anything that we write about typically it's a group that we speak to but the ones that we list that's just to make that information so that's what I'm asking what's the breakdown between what you write about what you list oh the percentage that we write about this point I don't know it's relatively small percentage it's changed remarkably over time we think of a number of different areas and the nicey of history and the beginning when it was started master coin is usually seen as the first official ICO 2013 there was an explosion of icos that included master coin aetherium NXT number of protocols are still around today and then the long winter in the whole industry after the Bitcoin price crash and after mal Cox I see is also I Susan token sales also really fell out of favor no one was really doing them and then we saw pick up really last year you saw a couple more protocols and the emergence of more applications the more apt tokens at the application layer and it started to become more and more popular and then about four months ago this space absolutely exploded right so now I would say five to ten percent if I were to fall per code the entire market if you define the market as a project that announces some intend to raise funds through a token sale when we write about we try to list everything our philosophy there is that there's not really a good place online where you can find a list that isn't a promotional or advertising platform and so we don't charge projects to list on our spending crown dashboard we want it to be an open public information source that anyone can comment do their own research and then we select a couple of those to go a little more in-depth on write about it illustrate what they're doing their token with industry right you when you do that are you intending it to be sort of like a quality marker that you know this is something people are aiming for to be written about on smithing found not necessarily sometimes we pick projects because they're doing something very novel or very ambitious even if the you know chances for success seem slimmer than many other projects and will sometimes pick projects that not other people not a lot of other people or sites or places are writing about because we think what they're doing is actually very valuable so we don't want it to just be we don't think about it it's just a proxy for all the topsails so how do you decide if some of them are just kind of more novel and then there are certain ones I'm sure you just have to write about because they're highly anticipated what are the factors that go into deciding sure yeah it's a variety of factors I mean it's relatively subjective is that it's ones that there's you know as you mentioned if there's a lot of community interest around a project that increases the chances that will write about it because we think providing additional information in context will be particularly useful there sometimes it's a project where it happens to correspond with research we're doing internally we're doing a bunch of research on a particular methodology or mechanism or attribute and this project happens to incorporate those so it's just an area of interest for us at the time so yeah it's certainly it's not intended to be an endorsement or recommendation largely it's we figured the more research thoughtful research that we can put out there that's accessible to people the more good it does and the more people can take that and then build from it um so we interview people and then not do a longer write-up about them if you're sort of feeling like maybe this team isn't gonna pull it off for sure and yeah occasionally but it's rare yeah and then in terms of the formality the interviews too I mean we're at a place where you know there are days where we could end up talking to three or four teams you know so in terms of we get exposed to a lot a lot of projects and we talk with a lot of teams and different levels of formality so yeah and we talk to far more teams than then we end up writing about and actually to go back to the travel piece what why don't you just do those interviews my phone why why do you go to these regions to talk to them sure a lot of the interviews we do now are by phone but sometimes in order to expand our network and actually be people you have to be on the ground you know even in this highly effective virtual era we live in it doesn't replace face-to-face conversations and a lot of this too is to to really understand what's happening at the edges of the space what's coming next you have to sit down with people you have to have a coffee or beer whatever and win their trust and you know get their real thoughts on what's happening and get their introductions to other people that are not known in the community or not active players that don't have Twitter accounts so we found in each one of these exercises that we've done and we've met incredible people we've gotten a lot of really amazing insights and the only ways that that would have happened is to be on the ground meeting people one day at a time yes so in that sense in your job and my job is very similar but yeah you choose to live in Portland where I really don't think there are a lot of you know there's a lot of activity going on here so like for me I moved to the Bay Area a little bit over a year ago and one of the factors was there's a lot of activity there and I'm not gonna lie I actually wanted to move to Portland just because the ton of friends here I love the city and yeah I mean I like the Bay Area as well but there was something about like my heart was telling me go to Portland but then I was like this just makes no sense any rational level so I made that choice but so why do you guys choose to be based here sure a lot of it was the lot how long districts worked out at a time I've mostly been based out of New York for the last eight years but Matt and a few other members of our team actually ended up being based in Portland and so it made sense the majority of the team was here you know what's been something up but also we found in terms of looking forward and building up the company is we're working on some of the most complicated interesting problems that exists in the world today and we're when we were talking to new analysts or team members remember that maybe they're from every corner of the world and when we're saying you know come come move here we like Portland because very high quality of life very low comparable cost of living so we see it as a really good place to build build and expand our research practice and then in terms of location of projects and this is such geographically dispersed place so we've really hard for us to find the location that was centered at the at the heart of it so to speak you don't Lee do I think there are a lot of projects in the Bay Area but I think that there are just as many interesting projects so many other places in the world but not Portland yeah Portland's at Portland's a great place to do research from and when you're traveling 80% of the time but it's a very nice place to return to oh oh you're travelling that much yes Wow okay well kudos to you I can't eat that let's talk a little bit about your work has changed over time you guys were talking a little bit about that about how you know there were very few ICO is kind of even less than a year ago and then all of a sudden it's just like sped up to you know thousand percent really quickly um so in the beginning how were you finding these projects really like seeking them out and did they not know about you guys and how are you or how are they coming to your attention in the very early days a lot of it was discovery on Bitcoin talk it was the platform of choice for announcing these and that's we'd usually discover them sometimes they'd reach out to us sometimes we'd spend time on the forums understand we could encounter them in Twitter conversations but there weren't enough in any given month for us to feel like we're missing a really big piece of the action what was going on the teams are usually very accessible and open and they still are but then there's very willing and excited that someone that had a little bit of a platform and a portal to the broader world and the broader industry wanted to talk to them and so that ended up being a really big piece and then as we put our nose to the grindstone and kept doing a lot of this work because we were really really passionate about it over time we grew as terms of a following in terms of popularity in terms of people referencing us and now it is much more people common ask to be yeah listed as to be researched or interviewed do you want to put in an estimate how many emails and Twitter messages and everything as you get in a day or a week or am i it's hard to say it's really increased I mean some days it can be a dozen to three dozen inbound just on gonna project listings and so when did you kind of notice that things we're changing and sure I think we started to see the signs of it I may be doing six and eight months ago is when it first started to pick up and then really it's been the last we have four months or so where things have really continued up on that trajectory but um but yeah I think you know as early as eight months ago we really started to see that things were diverging from where they would where the trend line was originally was there like any moment when you weren't just like whoa this is gonna be huge what's its kind of interesting precedence that we always this was we planned on we always expected there to be this level of growth I think it just it just happens sooner than we thought it was going to you know that if you look at the space there's still a lot of challenges in terms of onboarding accessibility and usability across a number of key areas and so we expected that to be a slightly larger barrier over the long term but in terms of the excitement it just grew really fast and when we notice it in a few different formats you know we so we don't just study token sales we really study the entire breadth of the blockchain space all all assets all projects and so that's kind of what the token sale practices came came out of but you know in the work that we're doing you know we started noticing these trends where we would start to get a lot of calls from hedge funds or institutional investors or big financial organizations and so pretty early on we started to notice hey there's some key groups here and we're getting a lot of calls from a lot of high-level people looking for information being very interested in the space so we started to adjust some of our estimates of how fast this was going to grow because a lot a lot bigger a lot bigger players and we're publicly revealing themselves we're getting a lot we're being very interested in the space and that sort of clues you in that there was a lot more money coming into the space like not even just people who've made big gains on their earlier crypto but new money fiat money convenient yeah it's interesting I mean it's one of the reasons why we go and travel and spend as much time as we do on the road meeting people is that were you know we're in a very interesting position where we got to have a lot of conversations with everyone from institutional investors and people who owned investment banks all the way through to crypto anarchists and you know everyone's got a different interesting view on this and by combining all those conversations together you can start to piece together up the puzzle of who's interested what are the levels of engagement what are the things that hold people back what are people really excited about and kind of stitch that together into a picture of where things are going and so this institutional investors money we're calling you what is it that they wanted they want to kind of like more information than we were putting on the site or yeah it's one of those things where I think it was pretty interesting you have you have a lot of people who we were talking to a lot of people who are used to being being able to understand what it renew industry they weighed in to here's the new sector this is the the next one that we're going to put venture behind or incorporating or Hegeman whatever that happens to be people with decades of experience we're used to being able to figure things out very quickly so it's not you know blockchain this is the this is the next hot space we're gonna get involved and then they spend a couple weeks on it and they say whoa whoa still don't get this and then they they start looking at them and do it do we hire an analyst we build a team of analysts you know what how do we even begin to wrap our heads around this and then we get those calls around how do I start you know what is this space help me get get me a handle on what's even going on here how we participate how we move forward so a variety of level of questions but people understanding that this is an important thing to be aware of to be involved in and then this realization that you can't just get up on it in a week or two oh yeah oh yeah I definitely agree with you there okay so we're gonna take a break now for an important word from our sponsor on ramp with so many companies vying for people's attention now it's important to stand out from the pack if you're starting up a new decentralized project and want to help spread the word about it check out on-ramp a full-service creative agency that helps projects maximize awareness gain traction and accelerate growth on-ramp has helped numerous organizations do everything from create their branding of identity to redesign their existing website plus they've helped watching startups and projects whether you're launching a new project repositioning an existing organization or just when afresh in your company's look an app can come up with a tailored design project or a strategic marketing plan that ensures your lead in the market learn more and see examples of its work at think on-ramp com so how do you guys make money that's a great question when we get off it so we've when we first started this and we said you know we're a research group we're gonna study the breadth of the ball chain space we're gonna build a platform and tools around intelligence and people thought we were nuts people in the industry thought we were nuts because why do you need intelligence platform when it's just Bitcoin and then people outside of the industry thought we were nuts because I said what that's nonsense so we've this is something that you know we've bootstrapped ourselves for years at this point and with the idea of being able to very independently pursue the specific vision that we had so our vision for how we make money is largely centered around the idea of launching an intelligence platform so like a Bloomberg for teller so the idea is really is to make a platform that's as accessible as possible to to people is that we when you look at today and other tools are out there today in traditional markets they tend to be very very expensive and tailored for this kind of financial elite what's really one of the things that's really exciting about the whole block can space is accessibility and inclusion is that there everyone all around the world will be able to access the assets and tools and utilities that the blockchain space provides and so our vision really is for an intelligence platform that everyone can use that that provides information analysis analytics in a way that's accessible and can act as an on-ramp and then you know on top of that we will build access to increasingly sophisticated features for people's needs it a freemium model yeah exactly exactly I mean it's one of the reasons why we publish so many of these reports online and so much information just to make it accessible right you know there's been no shortage of people that have come to us and said your model should be publishing nothing and charging banks a lot of money for these reports and except you have listened to nothing that we've said that it's an ethical to kind of our vision for this so we want to make information accessible exactly and have provide some days level of utility much like we do on the site to everyone and then for people who need more sophistication to allow them to pay a subscription fee for that so what are some of the different premium things that you're gonna offer in charge for well you started doing that so this is something that we'll have a private beta for later this year and we'll roll out publicly early next year okay yeah do you want to talk a little bit about where you're planning we'll get to that okay okay oh you'll give back to me as a as an exclusive or something else that's a great deal so it's a linen to that kind of in the meantime is you know what so we we largely see our efforts right now in concentrated in three three big areas so one is continuing to build out the platform you know we've we've spent years building out tools and processes and analytics beyond what we're publishing and the goal is to use a platform to open those up and make them accessible to people so that that's we're spending a lot of time and effort the second area that we spend a lot of time is on general advocacy and education you know again we got into space because we're really passionate idealists about the positive transformative power of the blockchain you know we think this is something that you know we can't even begin to imagine its potential for changing the state of the world reshaping industries and so forth but for how excited we are about its positive potential with the growth that we're seeing right now this is a delicate time things are happening very fast things can break mistakes can be made when things happen so fast and there's so much capital involved and so right now we see this as an area where education is so critical um so we're spending a lot of time trying to go speak at conferences trying to go give private talks have dinners with people that are looking at the space who are going to bring in the significant resources or attention we're going out to DC and trying to wave our hands around and provide education to regulators yeah that's it we're doing some work with the chamber of digital commerce and trying to help provide education so we're putting a lot of effort just into general industry education where we can because we feel is with you all the attention on the space right now people getting reliable call it information that's free of hype or a sales pitch or fear is just so important for new established players that are getting in to understand it and to make good decisions and to go back to earlier when you weren't saying that you go run and you give talks and stuff as well what exactly are you educating people on in those talks so the idea is to just generally provide an overview of this is the industry this is its potential you know these are the concerns of the industry this is where we see it's going it's very hard a lot of the stuff that gets written about the industry tends to capitalize on one sensational point or another and there's a a lot of nuance there's a lot of complexity there so even if you're just trying to fall along with a lot of the headlines it can be hard to get a sense for what's what's really going on so it is a really wide variety of topics but having time what we can sit down with people and give them that overview and then really answer more in-depth questions around how things work and earlier when you were talking about kind of like the mistakes and risks and stuff like that do you also do what we were talking about before the podcast about how people are throwing silly money in and they probably shouldn't and stuff like that do you give any advice like that I mean we just a lot of what we say is like there's a lot of lessons that have already been learned we don't need to learn every lesson the hard way you know there's a there's a lot of common sense there's a lot of best practices that can be applied to this space that it that exists elsewhere and so we think that education is enormous ly important part of that giving people access to resources and then following up and you know working closely with people who are going to come in and make an impact a third area of our activity is actually renovate advisory services as well so we do so we have we're in a unique position in that we have spent an enormous amount of time and resources studying how digital assets and tokens are designed what their utilities and properties are how their economies work or should work and doing that modeling and thought across literally hundreds of projects like the field of crypto economics exactly yeah so we spend an enormous amount of time on that and so it's something that realize we started to see a lot of kind of mistakes or missteps being made by projects that were designing tokens or economies or perhaps more established companies that are looking to get into the space and have a lot of questions about how you do this you know really you know I think that there is there's a lot of confidence out there but the reality is were at the very earliest stages of understanding how token economies work how token rights and properties interact with each other what makes for successful systems and not so what we started to do you know on a fairly limited basis as we only have so many people is to work work with projects and organizations to help them better understand crypto economics to help them to act as a thinking partner specifically around these ideas of crypto economic design how do you structure token how do you structure distribution what makes sense and really you know I think there's been an unfortunate short focus on the short term of issuing a token I think it gets positioned in a lot of ways as a capital raise when really this is a very long term decision where even small decisions can have large consequences and so what we try and do is help teams think through the Krivda economic design as something that's fundamental to their team or project or organization and all the long-term consequences and thoughts and modeling that goes into that so well so you're helping some of these teams we are yeah and so it's it really runs the gamut is right now we're really focused on areas that we find where there's some complexity or a particular interest you know one area where we're seeing you know a lot of organizations reach out to it's actually much larger established organizations that have been looking at the space they think you know they perhaps have a business that could benefit from tokenization in some way sort of like kick exactly yeah so so these large players are coming in and what they're looking for is you know where where can they get expert advice on this I mean where can they get someone to help think through what that hybrid model looks like how did someone that can help them understand their existing business and lines of business and say but here's an opportunity to extend one or to introduce a token into this and what is that what does that look like what are the pitfalls what are the opportunities I mean really helping them think through the complexities of those decisions this termination is in terms of the process of a company integrating and token into their business model and one way shape or form is more than just doing the math on the crypto economics that's a really big piece of it that token design we also have to think through use your experience and is it plausible to assume that people are going to use this token is this going to be funds this makes sense in terms of your product and your brand and then long-term tokenizing is a huge is just it's a huge investment because it has a huge impact on your business model and having a token or some kind of a tokenization strategy marries you to the decisions that you made in ways are very difficult to go back on without breaking some kind of a promise with token holders right all right big governance in or something exactly yeah exactly was changes um well I saw do you feel like if you're giving an advice or advisory services to some of these teams but you're also then serving as this resource like it is there's some kind of separation between the people you do the two different things yeah it's a great question and I honestly think a really important one so are kind of art art these designs when we take pretty religiously is disclosure I mean we think that's that's one of the the big things that the space is going to go through is the really the importance of disclosing relationships here so luckily we work with thee the smallest fraction of the projects that come across our dashboard and that we list and we have a very strict policy anything that we do any writing on where we have a relationship with them any kind of financial or token based relationship very clearly described that you know we want to make sure front and center that you know the the writing should stand on its own but that people understand there's no relationship there it's clear you know we're on as advisors or providing advice tour whatever that happens to be so we something we take very seriously we think is an important part not just for us but for many other players in industry different people yeah we do separate people so the people who end up doing the research and writing are different than the people who end up working on the project yeah so what are some of your maybe high working hypotheses around crypto economics like what do you think works what doesn't work sure yeah it's a great question so there are a number of different areas that tokens and tokenization have proven very powerful and we think for in a way what we're gonna see in tokens in five years we couldn't even imagine today it's really the frontier of creativity I feel like every week I come across something and I haven't thought about before I do think that there are a class of tokens that are a little bit more like equities and stocks and companies and there's a lot of regulatory issues around that those are going to get worked out and a lot of really smart lawyers and regulators actively thinking about this today around the world but in many ways tokenizing owners over a protocol or ownership over the company behind it they are very very creative and that equity as a share in a company is something that's been around for over a hundred years really interesting novel financial innovation but it's not the only way you can imagine ownership over some kind of a joint endeavor and so this has been a really interesting area of experimentation and I think that as the regulatory issues get worked out people will they'll be a little bit more creativity and experimentation it's one a second one is in tokens that will resemble digital products that are usable by consumers particularly crowds and crowds of people so very good at incentivizing crowds to take good actions on a platform to avoid bad action so with an example so a good example and this actually isn't a token that went through a crowd sale but numr I and they have a totally the numeraire and the purpose of the token is I guess it was worth saying a couple words about them what they did we don't have a relationship with them or anything I just think what they do is really interesting but they have a community of data scientists around the world that are constantly crunching can it de-identified data from stock markets and prices and whether economic data to do predictive models on the performance of different socks or industries and the data scientists submit outcomes of their models every week to new Mirai which takes those and use it to improve their model in the invest using this yes yeah exactly and then they compensate the data scientists who are the top performers across the platform in numeraire which is their token correct and it's a historically it's been in BTC but they're also distributing numeraire and the role that the numerator plays on their platform is that the data scientists stake it as some kind of an indication of confidence in their model and that individual week and that's really interesting because if they're wrong it's not like new Mirai the company pockets the proceeds they don't it gets burned yeah exactly exactly and so from the standpoint of data scientists they know that that numeraire is not being extracted by the company and that the outcome of what happens that numeraire is is determined by the algorithm and by the purpose by the the performance at their individual good their model is yeah well so but just to go back to what you think the better ways to structure tokens are is there anything else well I think that it's in terms of we get this question a lot what is what's the best way to structure a token what's the best way to do token distribution and one of the things that you know were that we're trying to we're trying to get out there is that there is no there's no one right way there is no one killer methodology or framework or whatever happens to be there's really this question of what is right for the organization and this comes back to this focus on whether that you're using some kind of distribution event to distribute something because that has utility for people or whether you're just using it as a capital race because using capital rays then you're looking at a set of strategies to maximize that capital race but if you're looking at this in terms of distribution then you really have to take that step back and think through what you know what is this organization what is the intention who will use it who are all the different members of the people who are use it what will they use it for and with that then you can say well here's a set of different attributes or utilities or properties that the token can has these are the ways the economy can function in order to incentivize and support these type of actions but those could be radically different depending on the type of problem you're solving and the same thing with distribution is that there's different distribution models out there that could be very different depending on whether you care whether one person comes in and snatches up everything or whether there's a specific group of people that you want to immediately be using this or be holding it or whatever that happens to be well that's really interesting because then it sort of just in my mind I start thinking about like spectrums or quadrants and then kind of like different you know depending on what your goal is different strategies matching with that so in terms of distribution what do you feel is like a good way to structure to a good sale to get a large number of people to buy yeah I think we're still at the early stages of what good models for that look like but it's interesting we've seen some some kind of novelty in this an experimentation there was a curve it did something interesting where they had a mailing list and they distributed it these can I here drop these codes to their mailing lists and there were two codes per email and then they could be used to purchased a fixed amount of their tokens in their in their ecosystem when there's and each what do you mean by two codes every single person got the same number they got they got two codes each person got two unique codes that they could use so they could you know use one code to purchase a unit and then they could go and sell the other code or share it with a friend or whatever they wanted but you plus what I see yeah exactly so it or they could just give away both whatever that happened to be but it was it was an interesting model in that they they're here's a group of people that were interested enough to follow along with them and they wanted to give them the first chance to have this kind of capped participation in it which with it you know it's certainly a novel thing but you know some of these clever things only work so many times that becomes the expectation then you have people it's you know signing up with multiple addresses and so forth so we think a part of this is going to be evolving there's going we're gonna see a set of different popular versions of the submerged some of them are gonna be tied to provable identities some of these are going to be distributed to internal users of an existing product or system or someone else's existing product or system so part of this is going to be on the challenges of identifying who you want to be participants and what's the best way to give them access and in what quantities and sometimes just open open participation will make sense and sometimes it'll be something specific or nuanced that's one of the things about this space that I think can be very terrifying and overwhelming but it's also the very exciting part of it is that the tools that people have in order to build projects in order to get initial participation they're they're essentially limitless there's so many different combinations and we're just starting down the path so it's a lot of the thinking that we do is saying look here's a bunch of models we've already seen but you know what are the next steps on this looking like how can these be improved what are new ways to do this and so it's very fun for us to get it work with teams that I'm gonna share that vision and share that excitement for figuring out what are the new ways to do it and I think we're going to continue to be surprised by some of the methodologies that get implemented by teams yeah well so what you said about how once something kind of becomes a trend and like people try to game it is it just forever gonna be this like kind of cat-and-mouse thing I think yes I know one of the biggest things that is more and more becoming part of the industry and part of the token sale space is some kind of kyc identification registration which historically hasn't been a major piece of it and that not doing that poses a lot of dilemmas for projects because if you can contribute anonymously from any individual address then you can essentially civil attack or try to get the get a larger share of any individual sale is try to have multiple addresses correct correct so the telecommuter and frame that's really really well that you kind of are either you limit the amount of money that you raise or you uncap the number of people that can actually participate because you don't have a cap raised then anyone can contribute anything and you can maximize participation but if you cap the raise then you can end up in situations like what happen with a basic attention token where a very small number of people got a very very large portions and so then i dilemma is cannot really be solved without really really clever mechanisms they just framed that really really well but one of the pieces of that puzzle is kyc in some way shape or form so if you're an individual and they try to cap it and maybe there's a strategy like every individual address can only contribute this many dollars or this many ether then you could just have a thousand addresses to still get a huge portion of the system but if there's some kind of registration that prevents someone from creating a thousand addresses then you have a little bit more flexibility in determining who can get involved how at what levels they can get involved in why sort of like coin lists for the non-accredited - exactly yeah exactly and we think we'll see more and more of that in a space because it's a really interesting toolkit for projects to experiment with distribution because the distribution the distribution strategy is just as important as every other piece and a really various project a project yeah I actually wanted to ask you before you were saying you know sometimes people want to release talk into a big network and other times maybe they just want to maximize the amount of money they can raise but is there anybody who doesn't want to release their tokens to a large number of people I can't think of any scenario in which that would be a goal well hey I mean if you're just seeing this as a capital reason you don't care where the money comes from you know that it doesn't matter if a hundred people give you a dollar or one person gives you a hundred dollars yeah so aimer yeah and which is a different scenario and you know and we what excites us about the space and what we're looking at is you know using using a distribution event for distribution as opposed to a capital race but you know there are certainly people who use this as a capital i mechanism solely for capital raising and we'll see I think we'll see that you know emerged and kind of carve out its own space the kinds of tokens that morph it that that mold are for lack of a better word like fee sharing and revenue sharing tokens so the holder the token is entitled to a portion and fees or revenues generated on some kind of a platform and many people call it like rent seeking tokens because they took it mold it really plays no role in a success that there are a number of big samples but they're often paired with other token functions or token properties but an example might be the digits down token where token holders get a portion of fees generated through the sale of digitized gold now digital also has a governance function which makes it really important to distribute so a lot of the tokens end up having or embodying a number of different rights and a number of the different properties so one thing that I'm so curious about is how much traffic does your psychic no matter how has that changed yeah or I don't know the numbers handy we honestly we were not tracking the numbers so closely we had for us it was really about the who who were talking to and who's on the site and we had some even we had some modest and ambitious goals for ourselves in terms of traffic and at some point we realized that traffic was like Forex our most ambitious goals and when we really stopped tracking it we were so far beyond our estimates or projections for what we wanted in terms of traffic and at this point we're so completely inundated with inbound so I were growing in some crazy week on weak growth percentage at this point I don't know the exact numbers but yeah we stopped tracking it it's it's kink so wild yeah well I've seen it also in my podcast elements so one other thing I was curious about is your Smith & crown index what is it and how did you you know decide what goes into it and all that sure you know y'all talk about this at a high level and I can jump in all the details so yeah this is something that that we've had action for a really long time it was I mean it was one of one of the first things that we worked on it and literally years ago and it's kind of evolved over time but we were really looking for you know when you when you pull up and say like coin market cap and there's a thousand things on there there's so much noise we think it's very intimidating for newcomers to the space and then even if you're looking at it how is the market doing do you really want a lot of you know a lot of short-term volatility for tokens that really don't have any value and are essentially going nowhere you know do you want that being part of your overall market measure so what we what we're doing that the index is trying to find a set of constituents that we think represent overall the overall market as a whole and use those to track to have a more accurate proxy for how are things doing right now how is as a benchmark that you can use in this is something we're gonna continue to be working on moving forward and have some cool announcements about coming up but the idea is it provides it yet an accurate benchmark across the industry and so what metrics are you using to decide which tokens are included and also then how do you the waiting's and stuff we look at a couple different factors one of them is that we only look at fundamental watch chains we don't include meta tokens so that's it how do you define a meta token oh one that's built on top of another blockchain so okay a token on top no a or C 20 tokens or the their correlates in other on other watch hands so that that's a big one so we're only looking at fundamental block chains I'm secondly looking at another some other people might call that a protocol token is that is that correct yeah yeah that's fair do you think there's there's still a lot of semantics that are still being worked out exactly across the industry I don't but that's the totally hare way to put it okay the other factors that we look at in terms of inclusion would be performance and activity on the blockchain itself so is the blockchain gaining traction is it actually being used is so really stage that no one's really building on it so projects that and block chains that do have some moderate level attraction in existence and activity as part of it and by traction team you develop activity or a trading volume or what a lot of it could just be the transaction level so yes so they it could be developers it's like what what is being developed on the platform its how many wallets there are how much transaction activity like is actually going over the blockchain itself and we have to adjust that a little bit for trade volumes and for proof-of-work coins since they're distributing coins across the network quite a bit but it's really who's using the network transaction and volume is one of them developer activity community following is another really big thing that we look good just from the way you're describing this it sounds like are you trying to meet Lee subtract some of the speculative activity is that what you're doing or or is that included the who do you mean we're speculative activity you know people sometimes are not really interested in the token itself but they're like hey I expect this to go up and so a lot of trading volume or oh sure so market activity is definitely something we look at so I said we will do like blockchain level analysis of what's going on over the chain itself and we also look at markets so we'd look at factors like how many different markets and trade pairs does this individual crypto asset have across Fiat and across crypto so kind of how strong is it as part of that entire interconnected market we look at trade volume over a pretty meaningful amount of time so things that have short term spikes in price network value or trade volume you know look past a lot of the short term stuff okay yeah well I guess what I was going at is sometimes the tokens are trading a lot but then the actual utility and it is maybe a lot less I know Brian was a token summit and Chris furnace TV of a great time where he talked about like subtracting out the speculative valuations or utility value yeah how do you decide the waiting's for the index yes the weighting is currently or done based on network value so we call it market capitalization we generally don't like that term because market capitalization is the sum value of company shares and token as we've said tokens are not shares they're very very different they're very different even from each other I think you actually Chris is the one who had exactly a and with brilliant we use it a lot and also for podcast listeners you should go back and listen to the episode I did with Chris and Adam why you it's more than a year ago but even then Chris was an Adam of course both we're just really far thinking in this area what problems do you still see that need to be solved in this space you know what concerns you have you know on one hand I think you have right now one of the big things that need to be solved is just onboarding and when we look at when we look at the research and projects that we want to roll out and we think of it as a series of bridges so you have people that hear about this entire industry in space and they want to get involved and what does that first bridge look like you have to introduce them to it you want to provide in a curated set of information that's intelligent that exposes them to projects and endeavors and sources Merritt and then once people start to get familiar with it then you know the next step is perhaps to acquire some assets in the space and that's where something like a coin base comes in and then once you have those maybe you want to go beyond what is the most mainstream and then you know again providing that that research and that inside and then tools for that but then you know where do you where do you hold where do you hold those tokens how do you secure them how do you make people feel comfortable with that and then go and deal on that you know how do people get more advanced than just holding you know a basket of assets and so forth so each one of those points we see that as a bridge to look at new level of capability and understanding and I think now for people that are dedicated enough and savvy enough you can navigate all of those pathways but it's you know that it's narrow you can afford in the river on a lot of these it's possible but the more I think that's a series each one of those kind of bridges is an area where there's a lot of opportunity for people to come in and solve the problems of adoption and onboarding you know as you know they're all we kind of see it as this way where there's a lot of people who want a password reset button you know they want insurance they want the security and custody you know and the idea is that there will be this kind of the city that's built with with laws and rules and custody and so forth that will help bring on enormous numbers of people and amounts of capital but there is always a chance to kind of step outside the city walls and go down directly do it Network level and transact in whatever way is possible but the idea now is that there's so many talented people out there there's so many organizations I want to get involved that are simply missing robust tools and on-ramps to come in and participate in the industry so I think anything that helps solve those problems is pretty meaningful right now and I do think there are a lot of problems on onboarding right now so I think that's one big area and then the other one is around is around clarity - is that this is very much the frontier in a lot of ways and you know we're seeing with the sec discussion and so forth is that it's not entirely clear where all the lines are for this and you you know we know for for sure that there are a lot of players of all shapes and sizes waiting on the sidelines very excited about this but are looking for more clarity so I think that's that's another big issue at the space and a potential for problems when you have people that are moving very fast a very large scale and a lack of clarity you know that can certainly cause issues where do you think all this activity is going what do you think the future looks like for developers for PCs for investors and for all of us like what will our lives look like but you're so now pick your you know time you're gonna pick your timeframe sure sure no I I think in five years around we can't I don't think anyone with a with a prediction for five years out other than unless the prediction is we don't know what's gonna happen is it's likely wrong that's one of the things that we love about this space is that for as much time as we spend with a dedicated team researching this every day there's still stuff that's new and novel and surprises us and we spend a lot of time mapping out these technologies and projects and where they're gonna go and deeply do you think people will own like 20 different totally okay yeah absolutely I think we're gonna see there's I think that we're gonna see a pretty rapid maturity in a lot of spaces there are just so many people smart people in every corner of the globe building tools and projects so I think I think we'll see an integration into everyday life in a much larger way than we see now right and not everyone will know that they're using tokens of the blockchain for all these activities I think right a lot of these onboarding tools will use this behind the scenes to power an experience or an application or a financial transaction or whatever that happens to be people don't need to directly interact with the idea of tokens so these can be the block chatted in these concepts can be behind-the-scenes powering all sorts of experiences and infrastructure but yeah I think we'll see a much more integration of them into daily life in the a producer well but is there anything in particular that you think you'll be doing with these tokens yeah one thing that I've gotten really really excited about is tokens have been increasingly used in things like social networks or areas where content to you is user-generated and so you think in an average day an Internet user that is contributing to a number of these different platforms is contributing without any way of really recording that kind of contribution in a way that leaves the platform so it's gonna constantly giving to all these different platforms you post on ready you contribute to a poppy dia you answer questions on Stack Exchange you share photos or information or answers across the number of different platforms and currently there's not a great way to accumulate or to measure the social capital that you are building in doing that and tokens are one way where that could start to happen we've seen a number of different models again I think we're gonna see stuff that will just totally blow us away in five years but it might even truly to our identity so if I like have good tweets plus good Facebook posts plus like interesting reddit comments like all of that well correct and people are talking about this in web 2.0 like it's not a totally new concept just blockchain is the technology that's around that allows that to be totally audible it makes it independent of the platform provider is it previously a company that just stores all this information on the central database can corrupt it can lose it can manipulate it so this is a time when the tools for recording and tracking and trading that or independent of the platform and independent of any individual company that's running a website and so we're starting to see the foundations for what that could look like that the value that you are constantly generating creating on the Internet so that's one thing that excites me and I see we see a number of different projects that are starting to explore this idea and starting to to create those foundations for other ways of transferring those between different doors yeah and I even saw like a tweet from Navarro back on the AngelList founder the other day saying something like oh you know I will pay some prize or something to a team that comes up with a good decentralized Twitter okay so as all right so in terms of a more specific prediction I think in one of the longer-term trends we're tracking that we think is pretty interesting is right now you see a lot of the activity of governments in this largely as being that of exploring regulatory practices but what I you know what I think we'll see is with five years of adoption based on the path we have now is the blockchain based networks will be an important part of the global financial ecosystem and you will see you know much like different countries right now very vested interest in their own economic policy and global economic policy having to move from the stance of just regulation to active involvement in these global economic networks I think we're going to see a pretty big shift in that over the next five years a realization that this is now a strategic economic activity as opposed to something that can just be done by individuals has to be carefully regulated yes well I guess we'll see how it all plays out so thank you both so much for coming on the show where can people learn more about your work and get in touch with you absolutely Smith and Crown Kampf okay
