not a dividend it's a tale of two quons now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet generally speaking airdrops are kind of pointless anyways um my name's trading firms who are very involved I like to have the ultimate D5 Protocols are the antidote to this problem hello everybody Welcome to The Chopping Block every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry Insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day so first up we've got Tom the D5 Maven and master of memes next up we've got Robert the crypto connoisseur and captain of compound today we have a special guest special legal guest joining us Mark Boyer who is the blockchain Barrister and the chief legal officer at polygon and then finally we've got myself I've received the head hype man at dragonfly the three of us are early stage investors in crypto but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice legal advice or even life advice please see choppingblock.xyz for more disclosures uh Mark great to have you on the show uh it's been a while it's been a crazy six months I can imagine in the crypto legal profession how how are you doing how are you feeling given all the craziness going on yeah um first thanks for having me it's uh exciting to be here you know I don't know I get I kind of get pumped by this to be honest like you know you look at this and you're like okay this is why crypto exists right you've got the government coming at you and you basically have to respond right and like that response needs to be like strong both on the tech side and on the legal side and I don't know that's kind of that's like why we're here it's fun it's fun okay so it's kind of like a personal injury lawyer seeing like a pile up in the middle of the city you're like oh this is this is what I got in the game for baby also says the lawyer who works for you know an l1l2 that the government never attacks the L1 and the elsewhere okay they're attacking another one now with BNB well okay okay well okay let's let's get into it there's a lot of meat to get through today and we're gonna have several different uh big topics that we're going to chew on so the three typically topics of the day the first is the SEC versus busd the second big topic is going to be the Kraken uh staking settlement uh and the third is going to be the unit swap governance drama that we alluded to very briefly on the last show but that finally reached its you know sort of nominal conclusion uh in the last few days so first we're going to start with the busd shutdown so I'm going to give some backdrop there's a little bit of setup for those who are not familiar with what's going on here and then we'll jump into a discussion so binance obviously largest change in the world they issue a stable coin called binance USD it's the third largest stable coin in existence 16 billion dollars in issuance and it's used primarily on the binance exchange uh and it's they've Consolidated as being their major stablecoin trading pair so paxos is a company based in the US they work with a bunch of big you know fintechs like PayPal and so on to run their crypto for them as a backend but their largest business by far was that they issued stable coins on behalf of other people and the major person on behalf of whom the issue a stable coin who has Finance so paxos they're regulated by the nydfs the New York Department of Financial Services and they are the issuer of busd so they take in dollar deposits they hold it in a bank account by treasuries do whatever uh and then they issue busd as their liabilities um and so paxos had partnered with binance to issue busd binance does a bunch of other stuff uh with busd right they do all the stuff on BNB chain and also their fanciness but busd itself is issued on ethereum it's important to understand that paxos the issue of eosd was issued a Wells notice by the SEC meaning that the SEC told paxos we are planning to sue you for your issuance of busd which supposedly is because busd is an unregistered security so paxos gave a statement that they categorically disagreed with this claim uh then the nydfs ordered paxos to stop issuing dosd and Pax was immediately complied so they announced over the weekend that they were going to stop issuing any Noob USD the USD Supply was only going to contract from here on out as people redeemed us busd either for dollars or for usdp which is paxos other unbranded uh stablecoin product it used to be called Pax now it's called usdp now this simple coin is much smaller uh usdp is like less than a billion dollars in circulation and interestingly so the SEC now the SEC nor the nydfs supposedly asked them to stop doing anything with usdp uscp still exists and and paxos claimed that they're going to continue operating usdp their own stable coin uh the nydfs gave a statement to Reuters saying that paxos violated its obligation to conduct tailored periodic risk assessments and due diligence refreshes of binance and paxos issued us busd customers to prevent Bad actors from using the platform quote unquote the token wasn't administered in a safe and sound Manner and there was other news that supposedly circled tipped off the nydfs about busd not always being backed so there's a story that broke about a month ago that was reported by Bloomberg that claimed that binance is okay again we talked about usd's issued on ethereum when when you use busd in binance you're not actually using BSD on ethereum usually you're actually using busd that's wrapped by binance on BNB chain and this wrapped busd it's this should be pretty simple right usually when you wrap something you just think okay I get one of these on this chain and I Mint one of these on this chain and this one's acclaimed on this one to one uh but that's apparently not what binance was doing binance was doing all sorts of shenanigans such that the amount of wrapped busd That was supposed to be backed one to one by busd on ethereum was sometimes insufficiently backed uh sometimes up to the tune of one billion meaning there was a billion more rapid USC than there was actual busd um so all of this has turned out to be kind of a kind of a mess and now we're at the point of trying to figure out okay is in fact the SEC going to claim that BNB oh sorry the boc is a security um if so why uh what is the legal Theory under which it would potentially be a security and what do we think this means for other stable coins in the market besides busd so mark first of all did I get the the high level of that correct and any details you'd like to flesh out for why you think this is happening yeah no I think that's I think that's a perfect summary of it I think the the interesting thing is like the nydfs stuff is probably the most interesting in my opinion right the SEC thinking stable coin security all the SEC thinks everything's a security right so that's not like a huge surprise there but I think on on nydfs they're basically saying look paxos you're issuing this stuff and they pretty much implied like you're not doing anything wrong when it comes to the way that you are issuing it or the way that you're back in but you're doing this with a third party right which is binance and what they're doing is a problem and you have a relationship with them and by the way this touches the product that you are issuing which is um you know busd and so you are going to be on the hook for actually looking out that this product actually works the way it's supposed to right and the problem is when you've got you know busd on BSC you basically have a product that now paxos has no control over and DFS is looking at that and saying yeah we don't feel so good about that why don't you wind this down so that can't happen anymore I think that's like super interesting given the kind of collateral effect that a third party can have on a stable coin right because like if you actually think about this B I mean the USB could be wrapped on any Chain by anybody um this is actually not something that paxis actually has direct like control over but I think it's the fact that binance was doing it in such huge quantity and that they have a relationship with binance that makes it super interesting yeah so do you do you think this nydfs and SEC thing were coordinated or do you think it was all a response to this article that came out a month ago and they just happened to get publicized at the same time I mean it's really hard to think that this isn't coordinated right the agencies talk to each other even like state and federal agencies and when you see something like that there's no reason to think that when you know that a product is regulated that the SEC would not reach out to nydfs about this I would assume that that's actually the way it worked rather than DFS reaching out to the SEC otherwise they'd be reaching out to the SEC about like a lot of things all the time um and so I assume it's the SEC that ended up reaching out to nydfs but I don't have it like any evidence that sure okay so the nydfs part is that okay you guys are allowing your business partner slash affiliate to engage in these Shenanigans you're on the hook for the way in which a product is primarily used which is through this binance bridging mechanism and if the bridging mechanism is not sound and they're doing all sorts of weirdness then okay that's you know you're responsible for how your customers use your product if you know if it's in direct affiliation like you were like your partnership with binance especially given that binance gets a cut of the of the revenue right um so okay the nydfs part you're irresponsible I get that so the more interesting part I think is the SEC part uh that's I think the one that kind of rings out across the industry so the SEC presumably is claiming that busd is an unregistered security how what like how how can a stable coin be a security I I I don't want to go through the highway test because everybody in crypto has heard it so many times that we're not gonna subject them to any further brain damage but clearly one of the problems of the Howie test which is one of the the uh the determinations of an investment contract which is not the only type of security but an investment contract requires an expectation of profit and generally speaking Securities require some expectation of profit uh on behalf of the buyer a stable coin by definition you should not expect it to go up maybe it can go down but it's not supposed to go up so under what theory do you think this lawsuit is being brought against paxos I mean I think you need to look behind Beyond like an investment contract right and we've got these other prongs of like or whatever other parts of the definition of a security right including a note you know and we've been introduced to the concept of reads more heavily recently you also have Concepts like a certificate of deposit for example you know I tend to lean towards you know them looking at this similar to a note or maybe a certificate deposit which often have like this similar test right and even in that context I still struggle to understand it because when you're looking at Reeves which you know I'll walk through just real quick people don't know it as well as Howie you're basically generally looking at like is there an investment purpose or is there a commercial purpose behind like what you're doing is this broadly distributed or is it distributed to like a narrow group of people and then most importantly the fourth prong of this test is like is there an alternative regulatory regime or people often figure forget or collateral um hence the power of defy um or um some kind of insurance right and so there's a couple things that you can follow on there right and first like are people really looking at this for investment purposes and like yeah maybe they use it in connection with investment activity but the stable coin itself is not something that people are looking for investment purposes it is broadly distributed right so that hurts and then you look at alternative regulatory regime and that's actually one of the more interesting ones which is people who often state to like point to state laws for hey there's an alternative regulatory regime but basically a lot of case law and SEC guidance has already said you know that's on your right alternative regulatory regime needs to be something that like really replaces what the Securities laws are intended to replace so they've said that like State money transmitter laws which are consumer protection laws aren't good enough right and so you look at that and you're like well that license is a little bit more than that there's more disclosure involved is that enough I tend to lean like probably like not but regardless when you look at the entire part of like the entire reads analysis you reach the conclusion like yeah sure this is broadly distributed but nobody's really looking at it for investment purposes and ultimately you do have this regulatory regime which is pretty robust and there's really no reason to be treating this thing as as a security so like I I like really struggle to comprehend like why it is this is treated as a security with the one exception being what you do see is that these stable coins are not fully backed by the dollar right and we've we know this right it's over time that's changed but right when you go to like the heydays of tether you know you you really had like you're blindfully like trusting tether on that one um even usdc was pretty aggressive at a certain point in time right but now you look at them and you're like okay very little commercial paper in usdc's case no commercial paper I believe you've got treasuries backing it like that's pretty darn safe should you really treat that thing as a security like what do they need to disclose to you so that you can determine whether you want to hold this right and the answer is like there's nothing that I want to know other than this is one to one fact right and so then you go like okay well what about other laws right that's actually where it's more interesting but it's not with the SEC told taxes right is well what about like the investment companies lost what about like money market funds like maybe the money market fund is the argument that looks a little bit better but you don't get any return on usdc like whatsoever in any way which is kind of different from money market funds as I believe they work most of the time and so I like really struggle to understand this one and I think that's why coinbase frankly is ready to go back bed and I'm guessing so impactful certainly made noises as though they're ready to go to bat the one of the one of the statements that I saw floating around on Twitter was something that genzler said in September is he said stable coins have features similar to and potentially competing with money market funds other Securities and Bank deposits and raise important policy issues depending on their attributes such as whether these instruments pay interest directly or indirectly through Affiliates or otherwise What mechanisms are used to maintain value or how the tokens are often sold and used in the crypto ecosystem maybe shares of a money market fund or another kind of security and so one of the speculations that I saw was that people were suggesting that maybe I mean one maybe he's looking at these things as money market funds that for whatever reason don't pay interest which is maybe even a worse form of a money market fund because you're taking the risk and you're not getting any upside or alternatively that you you could look at busd because binance does have a sort of earned product right that only takes busd and so if you're looking at as as genza put it here through Affiliates it pays interest directly or indirectly through affiliate it or otherwise meaning that if you put your your BSD with binance into the binance earned program and circle of course has something similar with circle earn if you take your uscc or your busd and you put it into the affiliate that is the issuer or effectively an affiliate of the issuer and they are earning you interest then that's basically just like a transmutation of a money market fund where basically you know when you have just the the you have the the raw stable coin with no interest it's almost like you've basically withdrawn but your money's not there yet but you're not actually earning the yield that you would that you were entitled to if you want to opt into getting the yield this could be a very I think somewhat tortured argument for how it's basically a sort of money market uh just with some you know slight bells and whistles I don't know that that seems like one plausible way to to read what the argument might be here but of course we don't know yet right now it's all speculation yeah I think you need to rely a lot on like how these things are marketed right and and how they're actually used and then like how you actually combine like like just from a product perspective like how do you actually like offer this product right and I think there is a very big difference when you offer a product or on a page you're like hey mint this stable coin and then by the way hey here you can deposit it right here it's like very different from somewhere that says like Memphis stable coin and there's no world in which you see anything that has to do with the return on that stable coin and they need to go find that return I think those are like two very different worlds because of exactly what like the risk is which is like how it is marketed and what people's expectations are not even talking about the Howie test just talking about Securities in general in terms of like what people would expect when they're minting this product I think um I I agree with sort of this or I can see this sort of angle I think the thing that feels very weird to me about this particular um story is singling out busd and Finance in particular as we sort of said they're not going after usdp and everything that you guys have said has been true of usdc and coinbase for you know what two years now you can you know uscc and coinbase you can earn interest on your usdc and coinbase and like yeah coinbase earn or land didn't get to launch but like you know this other product has been live for quite a while so it's it's weird to me that like I'm trying to sort of Imagine like what are the specifics of Finance such that you know they would be targeted by these other products would not be and um I think you know one angle as you sort of said is well hey maybe it's a sort of uh bridging issue where you have you know binance sort of basically transmuting dusd on ethereum which is like the core regulated product into this other thing and we sort of seen issues when exchanges do that right this is what happened with sullet and um FTX where they were taking BTC and issuing you know solid BTC and then obviously that sort of totally evaporated or and then so maybe there's a consumer protection angle there you know there's also sort of been this this broader um initiative in this product broader wave around crypto debanking going on for the past you know two months or so and so there's maybe another story you know that this is sort of like another you know operation choke point type of thing where it's let's just go after you know the things that these exchanges touch in the sort of regulated system that we can access as a way to sort of get them um given that we don't really have a strong uh you know president for going after that in whatever you know jurisdiction they're operating in it did seem strangely quiet after FTX that you know we weren't seeing a whole lot of guns blazing doors getting kicked down and it seems like this is maybe the the response it sort of took a few months of latency I think it's been a little bit over three months now since FTX went under and now we're starting to see some of the after effects which is mostly kind of Regulation by enforcement once again we you know obviously the stable Clinic stores don't know what the rules are they don't know what they're supposed to or not supposed to do except you know what they might hear from nydfs which is you know a little bit more explicit than what the SEC guard rails are supposed to be ultimately you know we still don't know why they're going after we're not going to know for a while why exactly they're going out to them is it because I mean uh you know Tom you sort of vaguely alluded to this is it just because of the affiliation with binance is it that you know basically okay well exchange big exchange big overseas exchange is bad we can't directly go after binance so we can go after their Affiliates and make it very very clear if you're going to work with binance you're going to pay a price is it is it the bridging issue I don't I don't see how that could make it a security but I guess you know I can understand what the nydfs would get on them for the you know binance kind of doing all this weirdness but it seems it seems like a stretch to say that will be USC is security because binance did all this bad Bridge accounting I don't know it it does feel one thing is very clear we're entering into a new regime now and we're probably going to see a lot more things over the next two to three months from the U.S regulatory side I sort of assumed honestly in January that like hey actually the response seems pretty muted in the US it seems actually pretty reasonable that hey we're thinking about legislation we're trying to think a more holistic way to kind of govern the industry and I thought like wow we're actually really getting set up for a pretty positive and forward-looking year and like more thoughtfulness about how the space should be legislated and regulated um and it seems like okay maybe I spoke too soon and it's you know kind of kicked down doors and take names time I I think there's two things that we shouldn't underestimate first is how slow governments really move including the SEC and then second of all is their desire to go after like the weakest actor right if you look at stable coins like they're they're pretty well defended like paxos probably actually is the weakest defense Defender because it isn't Pat's it paxos that's defending it not buying and we've seen from CZ that CZ is basically like I'm backing away from this like you figure it out kind of thing um but then on the point of like how slow they move right you think about against or took over I can't remember exactly when now but he kind of laid out what was a pretty obvious strategy I'm going to tax table coins I'm gonna attack lending and then I'm going to attack like uh any kind of exchange and those things like take out to play out right like so you see them go after D5 first and he's like hey you know I want to go after try to go after D5 you see him go after some like non-d5 protocol really and then you hear news you know that he's like sent a subpoena or some voluntary request to uniswap and like nothing really comes from it and basically what I think he realizes probably more decentralized than I actually thought these centralized actors have a boatload of money in terms of exchanges let's leave that aside kind of let's take a look at lending well lending took care of itself like he didn't need to do anything um those centralized lenders uh took you know made it made it really easy for them um and then you look at t-size lenders and they're like it's pretty darn tough as well like you know uh probably probably not the best thing to go after and then they look at the stable coin and they say okay a lot of money here but that really is another choke point that we can attack you know let's put something together and you know work on it work on it and you know here we are I really just wouldn't underestimate that this is like him having this three-pronged strategy having kind of walk through this and now he's at the point where kind of stable coins and everything else right is like culminating yeah I mean look ironically the the net effect of this is that it consolidates tether tether becomes even stronger now that basically paxos has had their legs kicked out and you know it's it's kind of the same story as uh you know what happened with the big Tech regulation and like you know going after Google and going after Facebook and trying to say oh you guys are monopolies is that it really it weakens the you it weakens U.S the like right now the US has a monopoly on social media and that's going to get uh torn away if these if these big companies become less competitive the same thing is happening now with us stable coins right now paxis like you said is the weakest obviously coinbase and circle are going to fight much harder than paxos is and paxos if you shut off busd that is the vast majority of their revenue is their issuance with USD right this thing is you know over 10 billion dollars of issues 16 billion dollars that they're currently collecting fees on the vast majority of their business is is this so if you shut this off uh they're gonna have to fight for their lives and they're not going to have much revenue with which to continue fighting the SEC on this um and binance like you said binance basically left them for dead and they're like ah it's fine you know whatever we we didn't we didn't care that much about the stable coin to begin with and you know we we don't want to step into the line of fire at this point when we've got much bigger things to protect so it's really unfortunate that the taxes which is a great business at this point vast majority of their revenue is now under direct threat I know Robert what do you think happens from here with like the rest of the stable coins that are in the line of fire well I think the worst case scenario that plays out is that you know paxos is a smaller issuer than someone like Center Consortium that creates USD coin and that this creates some sort of precedent that gets used to attack other stable coin insurers 14 billion dollars busd is a lot but it's you know the third largest stable coin I think the bigger risk comes if there's precedent that gets used and established against other stable coins USD coin and tether and I think that's the sort of Doomsday scenario in my mind which is stable coins are like the primary on and off ramp and bridge between traditional markets and crypto and however effective you know this you know attack on crypto is Right Now by targeting Banks and getting them to you know debank large you know crypto players there's a lot of articles about this recently I think by taking out stable coins they're going to take out you know an even bigger on and offering for the majority of consumers and investors and you know I I think if it's successful it draws into question you know how are people supposed to use this stuff um and you know fundamentally I think this will take a long time to play out especially if paxos is going to you know take this through the legal system and defend themselves I think it might be years but it has the potential to put a shadow over stable coins for the two years that this takes to play out potentially and you know I think you know to the average user I think this will be generally invisible but I think the larger ramification is going to be the people that are saying like hey I'm a traditional financial institution should I interact with stable points or ham a bank or hey I'm uh you know hedge fund should I interact with stable coins and they're going to say you know what the last headline I saw on this was you know there's active litigation about the security nature of a stable coin and they're going to shy away from it it just it creates a chilling effect for what I perceive to be the most important asset class in crypto you know I think going after stable coins is impactful in a way that going after any individual company is not right if Celsius you know shuttered or you know if Kraken is you know has a piece of its business shuttered it doesn't really have a permanent effect on the rest of the ecosystem but I think stable coins have have an outsized impact on the rest of the ecosystem when they come under attack and so you know I'm I'm quite nervous frankly about you know this action against paxos because of the ramifications and the knock-on effects it'll have elsewhere well I'm hoping that once we learn more about the nature of this lawsuit that that we see that there's some more explicit rationale that's not okay stablecoin equals security and it's something more idiosyncratic to what USD was doing or what binance was doing or something like that that I think is our best hope at the moment if in fact genzler is going to say stable coins are securities bar none unless Congress tells me otherwise like that's the way it is then I mean the the other the other counter counter side to that is that of course there is there does seem to be a lot of legislative energy behind having some kind of stablecoin uh legislative framework and and maybe that will be accelerated if in fact there is a you know uh some some regulatory action in public outcry and more attention on this question because the net effect of this like I said is going to be pushing stable coins overseas right if if ultimately Circle can't issue it and Paxil can't issue it well Tyler's not going to stop and Tyler it's much harder to go after tether obviously than it is to go after you know domestic U.S companies that being said you know busd I like are any Americans using busd right like one obviously Americans by and large don't need stable coins because they already have dollars and then second of course binance USD binance is a small player in the US they have very small market share with with uh binance us uh and then of course in the US you know uscc is by far the most well-known stablecoin um behind Tyler so it it does feel like a a weird Target to choose um and I have to assume by the nature of that that it's really a backdoor way of getting at binance than it is something more specific to stable coins in general or even about paxos you know it's actually really unfortunate on the stable coin uh legislation because that's just such a good point that nothing's happened on that front and unfortunately right in like the current Congress it's just hard to see anything happening but it is like the lowest hanging fruit possible it's really easy legislation honestly when you think about like what would we want to know we want to know that you're holding assets that aren't just going to disappear and we want to know that you're actually holding them basically period um it's not that hard um and so it's just unfortunate that we're likely not going to see that anytime anytime soon only because of like the makeup of Congress even though I think we've got like a lot of folks in the House and Senate who frankly are really thoughtful on this issue and could deal with it quite easily yeah it's a big hit to be in b as well because it it I think I mean again speculation at the moment but I think it seems to cast a bit of a specter that Gensler is going to be coming after binance and especially with the affiliation with FTX I mean again I think this is kind of but the narrative that that propagated in the U.S by by some parties that the downfall of FTX was caused by binance or caused by CZ in some way makes him an easy target and certainly you know now that he's Consolidated market share and he's you know the guy on the big guy on the Block and the biggest overseas unregulated exchange or sort of under regulated let's say exchange I think it's it's very clear that uh there's a lot of he's he's the biggest game that there is to hunt in this industry um and I think Ganzo is going to be going after him however he can even if it causes some collateral damage along the way were there uh when when this news came out was there any celebrating at polygon that that BNB was taking a hit we like never celebrate the failures of others okay like more seriously like honestly it's not good for anyone in the industry I mean you know all l1's all l2s do well with this industry growing this is like it's it it sounds so like typical but it's just true like there's so much more to grow and like as you guys already know like pull it under focused on like a way bigger market so like a desire for like anyone to go down is like not big at all it's really we just want to see like the market Crow and this does not help that at all right right well the the second big headline this week for the SEC was uh going after Kraken for their staking program so there was a 30 million settlement with Kraken where the SEC uh basically got cracking to shut down their staking program so the staking program involved a number of tokens uh I believe it was not ether but a bunch of other stuff that they were that they've been a long running staking program with like you know Adam and other traditional staking tokens and in their complaint they listed some of the features of Kraken staking program that they believed made cracking staking program a security or unregistered security specifically so some of the features of kraken's program that they pointed out the first was that Kraken so normally you would think okay staking how is that a security right because staking you're just taking somebody's tokens you're delegating them or whatever like it's just kind of a software service and a software service traditionally should not be a security but Kraken had actually a lot of a lot of kind of managerial efforts that they imposed in and a lot of kind of strategic pricing that they did in this staking program so the first is that the staking program did not actually pay the underlying yields it didn't even pay a percentage of the underlying yields in fact they promised a fixed percentage return to their customers which was uh potentially irrespective of what the underlying blockchain paid and they paid that on a Cadence that was not that had no bearing on how often the blockchain was actually paying out those rewards they co-mingled their own tokens as well as customer tokens they determined when and how many of the tokens to stake so they have the liquidity Reserve they sort of capped for uh instant withdrawals and they kind of managed like okay we need to make sure that there's this much buffer so that people withdraw at this time whatever they did not disclose how much their take rate was in the actual staking they did not impose bonding and unbonding periods and they Market it as an investment opportunity they use words like returns and yield in their advertisements for this product so the SEC claimed that all these features made crack and staking program a unregistered security and that it had to be registered or only offered to accredited investors so Kraken decided they were going to shut down the product within the us obviously International customers are totally fine to continue using the product it continues uh unabated so now immediately after this was announced uh the settlement uh coinbase piped up and said hey well we're different that that doesn't apply to us because we don't do any of that stuff we are you know don't come Eagle funds uh we are not investment of money because users retain claim to their assets uh we have this taking rewards tied to the blockchain rewards we don't set the staking rewards and we just provide I.T Services blah blah blah this is totally different if the SEC wants to come after us we are happy to go to court and we'll fight them on this so coinbase made very very clear that unlike Kraken uh coinbase was willing to go to the mat if they went after their staking services and this is important for coinbase in particular uh because coinbase a lot of coinbase's story uh for Wall Street has been the diversification of Revenue and staking of course is you know very high margin business it's pretty cheap to run a validator node but obviously it scales with the amount of uh ether or other stakeable assets that you own I think today there was there's an estimate that I saw from an analyst that said about 13 of their net revenues were expected to come from staking uh majority driven by retail of course retail pays much higher margins than institutions so losing retail staking um although it's a relatively small part of your deposit base it's a huge slice of your margin so retail pays much higher margins on or much higher fees basically on staking they pay something like 25 whereas institutional clients generally play you know five to ten percent of fees on staking even though institutions are majority of the AUM retail pays a very large share of the overall fees that would go to a company like coinbase for their staking efforts in the aftermath of Kraken shutting down their staking program we saw Jesse uh the CEO or the former CEO of Kraken founder of Kraken basically complaining like look we we don't have the resources to fight this but I hope somebody does because this is bad for Innovation and ultimately it makes it harder for us to actually provide this a valuable service to U.S customers um and of course we saw liquid staking providers immediately rally after this uh after the settlement under the expectation that now retail is going to have to be forced to use Alternatives that may not be through centralized providers um so what were you guys thoughts on this crack and settlement and what do you think it means for staking going forward particularly in the US I should say in case it wasn't clear this is a U.S story it doesn't apply to anything outside the US let's start with Mark the lead the legal expert on the call yeah so I think I think first that I want to distinguish personally partially out of self-interest but partially because I actually think it's important is that this literally has nothing to do with like staking itself and the reason I say this because like fight on on crypto Twitter is like amazing right and everyone's talking about like staking is going to be illegal staking is a security and like that's not at all what this is and frankly that would be like an absolutely I I know there's been discussions about it but it would be absolutely absurd outcome that would not be logical and all and I can't understand like the legal basis for it like at all um and so it's really focused on like custodial stank staking and I think most importantly and I think coinbase was frankly smart to make this distinction which is like how this is actually done is really important you know when you and frankly how it's marketed as well right so you've got like the marketing that coinbase does that is kind of focused on hey first of all we're moving towards like a really D5 friendly company and hey you can come stake here you can secure networks it's fantastic right and then you had Kraken that was more focused on hey come earn this return and the second that you start saying hey come on during this return I think I heard somewhere some like a double digit but like even like over 20 Returns on some stuff like you're gonna you're gonna raise our eyebrows and honestly that starts looking like uh the staking that you um see in defy rather than the staking that you see on uh an L1 or L2 and so when you're when you kind of get to that point you start saying okay well let's analyze this under some kind of a test right and you get to the Howie test and I mean really simply you have to look at whether kraken's efforts were actually significant in this and you know I there's a lot in the sec's complaint that basically made it sound like Kraken was just giving some random percentage that they chose I'm not sure that that's actually accurate based on I think Jesse might have said it as well that like they weren't actually promising like a fixed return like you were actually getting what you would get on chain minus some fee that Kraken took and that is like very different from what they marketed which I think hurt them a lot which was come get this fixed percentage so I think that's like the first thing that like really hurt them but like when you ultimately look at like custodial staking you have to basically ask yourself like how meaningful of a role are they playing and ultimately like what are you doing you're custodying funds okay well you're doing that for purposes that have nothing to do with that staking in the first place so let's just disqualify that and then you basically say okay I'm already running this node you could run a note Yourself by the way we could provide instructions yeah it's complicated but you could do it yourself if you wanted to and so really what are we doing for you we're gonna go ahead and stake your funds as well and give you a percentage of what we're earning there it's not that much work most of the yields where is it coming from it's coming on chain right and so if you think of like whose predominant efforts are these it's really not Krakens it's really the yield that's being driven like on chain and so to me this is really one that is very fact specific that is focused on like how Kraken actually marketed this I'm not saying there isn't like an opening here for the SEC um but I definitely think that like the gap on like how easy a custodial staking service is to take down from a Securities Law perspective is way smaller than what you would think at first blush when you look at the Kraken facts yeah that that tracks I I did feel like uh this story freaked a lot of people out on crypto Twitter who didn't actually read the SEC complaint and the more I read the complaint the more I was like oh okay actually this the more I read the the more I actually kind of by the argument that this was basically I mean it was one of the very first staking programs that was implemented and you know kudos to Kraken for being very early to this market and the settlement I think was like uh it was something like 70 of all the profit that they made for U.S customers from so I should say from us customers over the course of the staking program so it's unfortunate it's quite you know it's a lot of money of course to have to have to give up um and to give up the U.S retail staking business but ultimately they still have a big international business so obviously big in Europe they still are continuing to stake there um so it's not the end of the line for even custodial staking and of course institutional clients can still stay custodially it's not a big deal it's it's really just the kind of retail marketing and the structure of this particular staking program was such that it you were trusting Kraken to do the right thing and they were not disclosing enough for you know the SEC to busy make it kind of kind of have a field day with the way that this program is structured yeah I I think this is a case of you know you have a C5 platform that does sort of what it wants Secret Sauce managing assets to pay a return and like the users don't have that much visibility into exactly how it works and what's happening under the hood and it seems reminiscent of all the things that brought down Celsius and block fi and you know like all of these other platforms and so I can see why you know there's an interest in you know trying to regulate Krakens you know staking and staking is a broad term you know program here um because it it's reminiscent of all the other things that failed horrifically I think what differentiates it is that it runs a lot lower risk of causing a Calamity for its users then all of the other black box you know CFI oh we're gonna make money for you you know give us your assets um because it's not fundamentally lending everything to three hours capital and hoping for the best it's participating in blockchain validation but you know I think the argument that's being made I guess it is relatively sound you know you're trusting them with your money you have no idea really what's under the hood and you just hope for the best you're funny enough this was actually what anchor was originally right the anchor the terror anchor from like the original idea of her anchor was that they were going to generate the yield that they paid out to uh Luna depositors um by staking by taking the assets that were held in anchor and staking them generating the yield and paying it out to customers and so I think I I agree with you Robert I think there's a version of of custodial staking that basically is just a pass-through I.T service and they can collect a fee and and that's totally fair and this is not a managerial effort kind of thing but just the way that this cracking program happened to be structured and to be clear I totally understand why you would structured that way in lieu of any guidance because you're like hey you know we're the first to do this hey it's actually better for customers if we offer fixed rate we a b tested it and they like the fixed rate more than the floating rate and it's easier to understand it's easier to Market they're like oh actually they like it when we give them instant redemptions right like instant withdrawals that's a thing that they appreciate even if it's a lower a lower fee so I understand as a startup founder uh as a as an Entre or naturally you're going to try to iterate your product to make it more attractive more palpable and of course the SEC keeps claiming like well why didn't you come in and talk to us and register and if you just registered then you know why why do you people keep launching these products without registering with us because the reality is that almost none of these businesses have ever gotten any indication that there is a real serious path to registration besides just shutting this thing down or sitting around and waiting in limbo forever in which case I totally understand why Kraken went in this direction um it seems like it was a great product obviously that's why it got a lot of retail adoption but ultimately to your point Robert enough iterations of product Improvement make it basically look like it's a it's a it's a basically a fund that earns its yield through staking and it pays out some of that yield to customers and customers don't really care how much of it they're getting they just like they love the fixed reels they love the answer with redemptions it's it's a good product they liked it but ultimately it is very reminiscent of many other kinds of investment products that would require registration I do think that it's worth looking at like the source of the risk and how that source of risk is actually really different though right is like when you look at C5 lending the source of the risk is making bad investment decisions as a heat C5 entity in terms of like what you lend you know what kind of risk you know programs you had in place things of that nature and then you bring that back over to you know staking and you're like okay well those risks actually don't exist like what are the risks that exists and the risks that exist that are the same are basically more like fraud like risks like you'd have to commit some kind of fraud to not provide the returns that you promised you're returning based off of some on-chain evidence of that right and like making that transparent is like super easy right it's not that hard to say like it's yours are node um take a look at what our returns are like so like I I just think the source of that risk is so different that you can't really compare like lending and staking think where it gets a little bit more interesting is with eth slightly because you actually have to do more things and if you are an individual user and you're like hey I don't have 32e's like what am I going to do I think at that point it's like maybe arguably slightly different I don't think that it's generally the case and so I I just think the difference you don't think that the fact that the fact that they were managing like a liquidity reserve and they were trying to keep enough that they were staking in order to actually pay the yield but they were keeping enough aside to like forecast how much redemptions they were like that's the kind of stuff that a headphone manager does oh yeah no there's no doubt sorry Kraken to be clear I think there's like several things about that the promised yield um the way they handled like the the unbonding but really like not correlated on bonding with when they paid things out there was a lot there that they actually had to like actively manage so like I agree on on Kraken like that's why I think this was like yeah yeah because I don't think we believe that this is true for all staking custodial staking Services yeah okay I I totally agree with you that if you take away those Elements which coinbase claims that they I haven't actually looked into the details but coinbase claims that look we don't have any of those elements you say you do the unbonding you do the bonding you get paid out when the blockchain pays out uh that kind of stuff looks like a pure I.T pass-through that does not look like a an investment product to me but obviously I'm you know I'm not the SEC so maybe my opinion doesn't matter yeah I think a few other staking providers like figment came out saying it's sort of the same thing like hey it's it's sort of straight pass through you know we don't have the sort of liquidity pool we're not sort of you know proprietary tokens we're sort of blending into there's something that Rewards or whatever so Arby's it's sort of categorically different but I mean I agree with sort of the first point which is like hey if I were in you know Jesse's position three years ago and I was launching this like of course these are features that I would want because they're actually great for you know customers and like Lido and their V2 right they will have a Redemption pool so you get you know faster redemptions you have to go through the unbonding period like they're great to have and it was it was funny when uh you know this settlement came out and Gensler went on like CNBC or something saying hey you know if you're an entrepreneur we have a form on our website you have to fill that out and then that's all you need to do and then you're good to go and and Jesse was you know sort of quote tweeting him and saying uh you know that's it's not literally that simple you can fill that out and you can wait three years and not get any Clarity and you know not get a green light and like that's you're three years is death if you're a startup founder and so this is really unfortunate conflict I think where crypto entrepreneurs want sort of clear brightline disclosure rules uh uh you know some guidance on how they can be compliant and the SEC is just not giving it to them and they're going to this you know regulation by an enforcement path um which which sucks it's you know you don't sort of see the alternate universe and sort of the cost of this approach of all the teams that are not starting because they're too afraid because they don't know what's going to happen or they don't have hundreds of thousands of dollars or millions of dollars in uh funds that they can spend for legal fees to get off the ground so I I can kind of see both sides of this argument but I overall I agree this is like I think very emblematic such a clean clear product that should be about should be able have been launched in the US in a compliant way and there's just no real guidance or Clarity around it the thing that sucks is that like this right here is also Sam this is FTX right this is this this is the consequences of what happened in November is they go after Kraken they shut down the staking program and somebody had a great uh tweet that uh a little bit of a dunk on the SEC it's like wow the SEC after everything that happened last year the best thing they think to do is to go after Pax nose and Kraken which ironically are two of the most kind of buttoned up most compliant firms in the industry which look I look if you're if you're genzler and you're probably getting pressure from the executive to start you know making moves taking doors doing stuff in crypto to show that like hey you are the cop on the beat and we have this industry under control I can understand that you know he has to do something and it's much easier to go after legible businesses like apaxos and a kraken than to go after you know it's like like you were saying Mark like go after these Dows that kind of unclear where the regulatory jurisdiction is and there's some there's some overseas Foundation or something or do I go after the like what do I what do I even do in these cases and yeah they are really strong and very well guarded doors to try to be attacking um whereas you know paxos and and and uh and Kraken paxus will be interesting to see if they do fight and if they do end up taking this thing to court um that'll be I'd love to see that of course that'll take years to play out and in the meantime there will be a chilling effect from the from the impending lawsuit but in the case of Kraken you know it it just wasn't worth fighting because you know they have bigger fish to fry and ultimately U.S retail staking is nice to have for coinbase it's a much bigger business uh coinbase if coinbase feels that the SEC is going to come after them they absolutely will fight because it's worth it to them to protect that line of business uh but for Kraken I can understand why they would say hey fine you know have it so well there is there is speaking of defy and different kinds of targets of of uh of attack there is there was a big drama around uniswap governance uh and it's it's brought up a lot of conversations related to governance legitimacy proof of stake uh and how some of these decisions and online governance are made so I want to rewind back a little bit because we talked about it a bit at the end of the last episode um so to recap you know swap wanted to launch on BNB chain and uh you know the the unisot V3 licenses coming up soon so there's a little bit more pressure and urgency to try to get this thing launched on multiple chains before the license expires and potentially unisoft V3 competitors are just getting forked everywhere um so we need we need to launch on on BNB chain and we needed some bridge to be able to pass messages from uniswap governance over into the new bridge I'm sorry over into the new chain so the two candidate interoperability Solutions were Wormhole and layer zero enter a16z a16z of course early back of unit swap they led the series a they own a shitload of uniswap tokens they delegated much of their tokens to third parties uh including a lot of these blockchain University groups so like you know the Harvard Michigan Cornell blockchain groups as well as they had their own tokens that they just kind of voted themselves uh previously they had I believe they'd never voted uh their tokens directly they'd only use these sort of student groups to whom they had delegated tokens but in this decision between Wormhole and layer 0 A6 and Z was also a backord of Larry zero and they claim they did not like Wormhole because Wormhole obviously had gotten hacked last year for 300 million with jump made whole and they've had you know whatever issues uh people then pointed out well layer zero also had issues and this whole press switch thing happened that we discussed in the last show um and ultimately Wormhole just has you know more whatever it is I don't know whatever the arguments are for Wormhole and so there was an informal poll that was done that was sort of a community sentiment poll and in that poll uh a6c had not voted but they sort of said like well our setup or custody something something something we can't actually vote but we were we are against this um so please know that as you are taking the kind of General temperature check uh is that we would prefer layer zero over Wormhole or to reconsider the the notion entirely but mostly Community was Pro wormhole and so they say okay well it seems like the community's pro Wormhole A6 and Z is kind of making noises but whatever let's go ahead and put into an Unchained vote on-chain vote takes place and a16z by far the largest single voting Bloc in uniswap governance boom 15 million votes or 50 million uni voting for no screw Wormhole take it back to committee and basically over the upcoming five days for voting almost every other large party in uniswap governance votes yes let's go through with Wormhole including Robert leschner who's uh one of the big uni delegates uh including basically a bunch of the student groups that also were delegated their stake by a16z and a6z8 sort of ended up getting a lot of public Flack for the way in which they participated in this uh entire governance drama so there are a few questions I think that are worth discussing in this whole thing so the votes over Wormhole won you know it's going to be it's going to be taking a wormhole whatever okay so that's over a few questions the first uh Chris black was on Unchained earlier this week basically saying that this proves that proof of stake is and that proof of sake is not really decentralized and kind of attacks the legitimacy of anching governance second is you know do we think okay take that aside do we think that a16z was right to vote the way that they did or that they deserve the Flack that they got for the way in which they voted on chain uh and then third I'd like to hear from you Robert why you voted the way that you did I know that you're you're close to the a16z guys and you know you I don't know if they delegated you any of their tokens maybe they did I have no idea but um how did you see this whole debacle playing out it's probably the highest profile governance situation in D5 in recent history well it was definitely the most interesting and you know my first point is that you know a highly contentious governance votes are healthy and build a stronger system you know I you know despise systems that are just like a rubber stamp and I think you know if uniswap government governance gets in the habit of just rubber stamping you know whatever proposals come along it will be less healthy and less strong than if it has highly contentious widely debated governance votes that test the community so you know first off I think this is actually really strong for uniswap you know I voted for deploying you know you to swap on binance chain for a very simple reason the license is expiring and either there's an official deployment that has an opportunity to gain traction or there's not and by the time uniswap deploys on binance chain 20 other projects have Fork the code base pancake swap is Fork the code base you know it's a free-for-all and so this is the uniswap community's moment and opportunity to deploy and time is not on its side the sooner it happens the better and so you know given that context I think then it's worth analyzing the trade-offs between you know one brick provider and another and whether the process was fair or unfair so looking at that I'll preface by saying robot Ventures is an investor in layer zero as well as a 16c as well as you know many other folks in the community we're not investors in Wormhole but the way I saw this playing out was I think actually really positive for uniswap governance which is it doesn't matter if a16z bangs on the table and says change the rules the unit swap Foundation laid out a process for governance to go through the life cycle it doesn't matter if one stakeholder or four stakeholders say like I don't like that process right that process was established it doesn't matter that a16z didn't set up their wallet correctly whatever that's not you know swap governance is a problem right it's like that's their problem right like you shouldn't deviate from the established governance process because like one person complains it doesn't matter how important or well known they are right I actually think it's positive that the process wasn't modified to somehow include e16z's off-chain votes that never occurred right so I think the process was followed correctly and that's actually incredibly strong I think you know when you look at okay given that there was a process and you know maybe layers Arrow would have won if a16z got their wallet in shape they didn't in the established process led to Wormhole being what was proposed for a formal on-chain vote and in that context you know for me I think it was a simple no-brainer of do we ship uniswap as a community on finance or do we wait and go back to the drawing board and spend another six weeks you know or eight weeks or whatever you know going in circles again and relitigating things and rehashing it et cetera I think to be honest later zero is probably the stronger technology but which technology is stronger doesn't really matter one because of timing and two Because the actual content of what's being passed over a bridge matters so much less than people think it does so when people hear Bridges they think oh I have to lock my Assets in a bridge and poured an asset over to another blockchain you know there's a huge amount of risk you know which one is riskier oh Wormhole was hacked oh layer zero is you know security holes in it oh my goodness none of that matters and the reason is the only thing that this bridge is being used for is to pass governance messages from ethereum voters to the contracts on binance chain and there's such a small surface area of risk in that compared to a bridging process that you are trusting your assets to uniswap is famously not really a governance heavy smart contract there's really very little for governance to actually do it's establishing new fee tiers which might happen once right and it's setting the fees on specific pools even if that goes horribly wrong through the governance process users can't have their money stolen funds can't disappear there's really negligible to zero risk on the users for which provider is selected and this can evolve and change over time so personally I think the importance of the bridge provider is massively overstated and I think the importance of timing was understated and all of that being said I thought this was a very straightforward and obvious vote to deploy on the binance chain and I think the correct outcome one and you know I think everybody should actually be pretty happy with the outcome of this oh I was gonna say I totally agree this feels extremely bike Shady for the reason that Robert mentioned which is it's literally just passing messages to you know BNB chain and even the vote itself rate is like a approval of the Dow to like Grant a like legal license to deploy on this chain so it's like all very sort of high level um and even beyond that there's now a proposal basically use multiple Bridges so use multiple Bridges you send all the messages new chain and then the governance process takes place and chooses amongst those those messages so it's like you know the actual importance of any individual Bridge provider is so so so so low um and yet you know this is an extremely contentious governance debate for some reason well it's a bit like Academia and that the um the arguments are so intense because the stakes are so low I don't think that's actually true though because of course uh you know for you to swap the stakes are low for the vendors the stakes are enormous because uniswap of course is the biggest application on ethereum um or you know maybe openc on certain days but you know generally speaking at xenoswap and you know being the preferred vendor for uniswap is just a big stamp of approval right so it's like fighting for a government contract it's going to be aggressive on behalf of the people who are competing and they're going to find different ways to compete such as you know our connected trigger daddy is going to go in and you know make a big appeal to see if they can get us on uh on the fast track that being said the the predominant way in which this was covered and which I've seen people talk about this is that A6 and Z is like they're perverting the process or they're doing something wrong by you know taking blah blah which I think is is just clearly complete nonsense I mean well maybe I'm I'm obviously I'm not as privy to process violations that they may have incurred I have no idea so Robert maybe uh if I'm wrong about that let me know but it feels to me like asyncz has a lot of money because they own a lot of uni and the way the proof of stake works is that if you own a lot of something you get a voice and 860 gets a voice and their voice is that like hey we want it to use layer zero instead of Wormhole and now you could say like well but is that in the interest of uni holders or is that in the interest of only yourself well if you own uni token you're not a fiduciary to the other people who own uni you are responsible for speaking for your own interests and the point of proof of sake is to aggregate the interests of everyone as opposed to have everybody try to aggregate everyone else's interests by guessing what they would value or what they would want right and so it's a little bit like um you know Matt Levine talks about this when it comes to uh um indexes right or indexes or the rise of of passive uh uh passive indexes which is that when people own more and more of the market when own lots of different names it actually makes it so that it is in the interest of the sort of stakeholders in a protocol or in a company for the entire Port the average portfolio of somebody to go up in value as opposed to for that particular stock to go up in value so for example for Pfizer Pfizer is the kind of company that actually incredibly uh produced an enormous amount of value for the world for everybody's portfolio everything else you own was benefited by the by what Pfizer did in rapidly Distributing the vaccine and not you know basically price gouging everybody on Earth for the the covet vaccines right that was good for us maybe bad for for Pfizer's bottom line but very very good for the rest of your portfolio and therefore it is rational for shareholders to say hey do the thing that's better for my overall portfolio and better for the world quote unquote as opposed to do the thing that's best for your stock price I don't give a about your stock price I own a lot of other stuff e16c is basically doing the same thing they're saying look I have a bigger portfolio than just uniswap and yes it may be at some of my lost unit swap but it's better for my overall portfolio if you use layer 0 I think that's perfectly legitimate now look the overall people who hold unique clearly did not feel the same way they did not also hold their zero and so they voted against it boom proof of sake works it aggregated the interests of people who own uniswap um I think it works exactly as intended I totally understand why it's easy to make A6 and z a fill in in all of this but I don't see this in any way as being an indictment of proof of stake I see it as yeah it is totally okay for people to have concentrated interests in your token base that's why these tokens are sellable if you don't like that don't allow tokens to be sold and second if you don't like you know proof of stake then I I don't know I don't know what else to sell you like there's nothing else in town really so I think by the way that Robert's like very right that like the uniswap governance is the number one winner here I actually think a16z is the second winner in this and and here's like the the reason why why do you say that here's the reason that's a surprise answer let's hear it yeah is that these these take like a lot of risk being involved in governance and people like really go after VCS for doing that they don't realize how much of a benefit it is to portfolio companies a lot of the times like a lot of investors are saving Porto's asses Honestly by actually participating in governance sometimes it's not through the best process sometimes it doesn't look good sometimes they're self-interested sometimes they're not they are really helping their port codes and so if you look at it from a16z perspective they often hold like more tokens than anyone else if there's anyone who's going to be on a hot seat from like a legal perspective or the number of tokens that they they hold and their participation in governance it is a16v so what's a16z's defense against us well they could say we're going to hold fewer tokens okay they have no interest in doing that so what they're going to do instead is they're going to say let's delegate some votes why are we going to delegate it because we're going to have a contract that we open sourced so that everyone can see that specifically says that when we delegate tokens to you we have no right to tell you what to do with those tokens whatsoever but the thing is historically people vote the same way and so you really don't see that playing out and so now you actually have a situation for a16z or from a legal perspective the best thing possible happened um they voted in the way that they thought was good for who knows who it is whether it's itself you know whoever it is and then they have a ton of folks to whom they delegated token to vote it against them I'll go on and bet to say that a16z will not stop delegating those tokens to those who voted against them and now what you have is a16z sitting there saying we can own a lot of tokens we can't one win every governance vote and by the way our method of decentralizing votes is actually effective because here you go you can actually see that people are not going to vote in the way that we want them to they're going to vote in the way that they want them to and to me that's like frankly like a massive win for a16z it is a great precedent I'm sure they're going to bring this up forever now as like here's the proof that you know when we own 10 of a token Supply we are actually a you know an honest participant in governance we don't control governance uh if people don't like what we want to do they're going to vote against us so I agree with you as a precedent it's great I I don't believe that's what they intended with this uh because of course they they lost a lot of brand value but they did gain some sort of legal precedent value that is going to you know be a useful defense in the future but ultimately like the reason like I mean one question you might ask is like how did we end up here like why first of all why is AC and Z delegating to all these student groups right which are like you know I was I was chatting with uh I was chatting with somebody at Jump who's telling me you know when they were when they were like trying to get a feel for what was going on in this governance vote and they were talking to all these student groups that that of course have been delegated a bunch of tokens not just from a6c but from all sorts of different funds um and you know these These are these are basically kids right they're like they're like you know 20 21 like 22. have they they just joined blockchains because they thought nfts were cool and now they're managing you know uh tens of millions of dollars worth of stake to manage one of the most important protocols in crypto why did this like why is this happening correct and the reason why this is happening is that basically there have been lawsuits against uh VCS that owned a bunch of tokens claiming that they are engaged in a common Enterprise with the founders of a protocol and so seeing these lawsuits you know whether or not these losses were successful just seeing this civil litigation uh saying like Okay well we need to lower our risk and make it look like we're not Affiliates or we're not involved directly in the day-to-day running of the protocol we own quite a bit of tokens it could sway a vote so let's instead delegate okay who are going to delegate to well who are the most unobjectionable people that we can get a bunch of them they are very you know they have great brand names they look really great we can have this wonderful educational story ah the student groups and we can delegate to Stanford and to Harvard into Princeton it looks so great everybody looks everybody looks wonderful we also create a bit of a hiring pipeline for ourselves and and we end up here where basically a bunch of kids are deciding you know one of the most important uh governance questions of the day and and this is going to be looked at by everybody as like wow this is a great precedent to follow you should do what a6z did and also delegate to student groups and and at the end of the day where you end up is it it feels a little bit to me like the ukidao situation which is that individually these all these decisions looked very rational at the time but they end up in this completely irrational place that basically uniswap is governed by like 20 year olds and that that feels like not you know if you had a holistic legislative approach to how do you think launching governance should be done you would not say like oh you are liable for decisions that a dow makes you know if you vote once ever which is the ukidao uh suggestion right like if the Dow vote once ever to do something illegal everybody who ever voted in governance on anything no matter how mundane is also jointly liable right that ends you up in a very strange place in the same way like this civil litigation that's been brought against VCS has resulted in this weird thing that we're now all doing and every VC you know ourselves included is pushed in this direction because all the legal precedent every single lawyer we talked to is going to tell us yeah don't don't vote your own tokens it's a crazy thing to do you should do what accz did and delegate look look at this kid look at this uni swap thing everyone's gonna remember this if you delegate to student groups they will vote against you sometimes that is a a fig Leaf of true decentralization but it ends you in a place that doesn't actually end up I think in good governance which is not to say that that you know anything against you know Michigan blockchain club or whatever I'm sure they're great but it it does feel like hey shouldn't it be the people who have the the most obvious interest in protecting the interest in this protocol uh or who know the most about it who should be governing it as opposed to a bunch of student groups but you know this is where the equilibrium has landed I'll make two points to seeb first you know I feel like you're being a little bit ageist um you know okay I've never read Ender's Game okay it's possible these quote-unquote kids as you speak are really the best Pilots of decentralized protocols you know the student groups and second I'll just throw out there that you know uniswap and almost every other token that does governance is actually a fork of the compound governance token and voting system um at some degree and when you know I was involved in you know helping to design the compound governance token the concept of Delegation was actually really core um for anyone who's like a solidity you know buff you know the compound governance code base you know has delegation built into the token itself not you know some layer on top but like the actual token itself allows you to specify who you want to vote on your behalf and this was actually incredibly important to the original design thinking of this being that you know individual token holders you know won't want to pay attention to every single vote they won't want to participate themselves directly they'll likely serve the protocol best by delegating to someone who considers themselves a specialist in paying attention to governance and even if student groups aren't like the perfect governance participants I still think they're far better than token holders that don't want to pay attention at all and don't want to vote at all I think it's a significant Improvement to at least create an ecosystem where people can just say oh you know I want to delegate to that student group because at least they're like talking about this in a classroom you know on a Saturday night and paying attention to it so I don't have to pay attention to it um and I actually think it's like a really powerful concept that yeah maybe one day it's not student groups maybe one day it's like the crypto equivalent of like ISS who like you know has analysts who like really dig into every single possible photo and like publishes an opinion piece and recommends you know some sort of outcome for it so I I think it's only going to get better I agree with that I think maker Dow delegation like the maker down delegates I think are a good example of a very mature set of delegates that have very strong opinions and you know that's not I I think that's where all these protocols as they mature are going to move towards is having more and more sophisticated people to delegate to and kind of more well-defined conversations taking place um that are not behind closed doors but going back to the original thing uh and and sort of Chris black and a lot of other folks who look at this whole kind of circus and say isn't this all a sham uh and isn't proof of stake just you know a cabal of rich people who actually own what's really going on Tom what's your what's your take on this on this attack well I think it's also it goes back to like what's really at stake here like this is not a layer one and I think like the security of proof of stake and layer ones has sort of been you know discussed Ad nauseam here it's really more you know hey at some point there will be something actually extremely valuable to govern here you know there will be sort of this look at this large group of different stakeholders maybe professional delegates and so it's like yeah maybe we're role-playing a little bit right now but that's kind of how you actually get to the end stage is you know it's like a start if you you role play a big boy company and then eventually you become a big boy company and that's kind of where we're at [Laughter] okay so uniswap almost a big boy uh just a little just a little a little more and maybe one day we'll get there yeah okay well Mark um we're we're a little bit over time so let's go ahead and wrap things um any final thoughts it's been a pretty fraught week of regulatory and legal action where do you think this is all going and what should we uh keep an eye out on the near-term horizon yeah um good question uh I think the answer is like a pretty obvious one right it's like we've got a lot of battles ahead of us I think that there's like a couple things that I'm particularly paying attention to because I think they're really really important um I think the centralized players are things that I'll note that while they feel really important and they are for like adoption like in terms of on-ramps and things like that they're not really the key things that like I focus on defy to me is like literally the thing that I focus on and like really care about in terms of like winning and why is that and simply because like most C5 players if you end up having some regulatory regime that isn't great for them it's gonna cost them more it's gonna slow down growth a little bit but it's like manageable but when you look at defy it's like so core to what blockchains enable frankly other than like Bitcoin which you could argue with defile itself that if those don't hold up and those become subject to regulatory regimes that just don't work for them we're gonna end up in like a really really bad spot and so from my perspective what I'm really looking forward to is seeing like how it is that D5 holds up here is both from like a technical perspective um again in terms of like focusing on things like government governance minimization um and just the technical design that actually makes it more and more fun for shape resistance um in addition to differently I think like other governance um regimes that kind of work a little bit better than what we have now just because they frankly just aren't perfect and basically what's happened is you know content created something that was great three years ago and everybody's gotten lazy since then and basically said let's not evolve too much let's rely on and like that actually hasn't been the best thing for the space not because of where compound started right it's just because of what raw picks have actually done but for me it's like this big focus on on defy and really seeing um you know how it is that we can have pulled off you know governments frankly against D5 uh and then the last thing I'll say is just I still hold up a little Hope on legislation I think it's just like it's so important if we look at what's happening in Europe we actually see that there is reasonable regulation that can actually be applied to a lot of crypto and we really need something like that in the US now I'm not hopeful for that your question was like short term and short term I want to see if I win um but if we look a little bit longer I just have like hope for legislation that I think is like vital um to actually kind of keep the momentum that we have in the space yeah and Mark I know you've been a champion of of D5 you were a chief legal officer at dydx back in the day and and now of course that polygon you're continuing the fight on the on a sort of higher level of abstraction than a single D5 protocol but the one thing I will say before we sign off is that you know I'm spending a lot of my time in Asia these days and Asia is actually quite a different story than what you're seeing in the US I think for a lot of the folks I know back in the US they sort of see this kind of curtain descending over crypto um that's not the way that every country is approaching crypto actually a bunch of countries around the world I sort of thought that there would be this coordinated kind of you know Blitzkrieg from every single regulator and every single lawmaker to after FTX to say okay this industry is done shut it all off let's let's try to choke it but if you look at you know Hong Kong uh which you know obviously you know China banned crypto two years ago and all of a sudden Hong Kong is starting to open themselves up back to digital assets try to establish themselves as a new digital assets Hub and lure some of the companies that went over to Singapore back to Hong Kong Singapore is continuing to compete for for that Talent uh you've got Japan actually opening up to crypto South Korea and has never gone anywhere um a huge part of where crypto is happening is outside the U.S and as you mentioned in Europe they have you know relatively sane approaches toward crypto legislation and so I think you know Sam SBF FTX all that stuff really hit home in the US and of course Sam being an American despite the fact that most of the FTX customers were non-us um and most of the money loss obviously was non-us um the story really hit home in America and I think that we're going to see a strong backlash not necessarily a legislative one but particularly you know Gensler it seems like he's going to be leading that that Warpath for as long as he's continuing to maintain that seat but globally the picture is not quite as as dark and I think that's an important note for me to share just given that I've been spending a lot of time here in Asia and I expected to see that people would have the same attitude as they seem to have in the US but but they really don't there's a lot of positivity here so um there's there's you know Crypt is a global story it's not just about what's happening in the U.S although it's a lot of what we talk about on the show so anyway uh with that we gotta sign off thank you Mark hopefully uh we don't have to have you back on anytime soon because there won't be as much legal troubles but if there is we will give you a ring uh but thanks for coming on awesome awesome all right take care everybody [Music]
