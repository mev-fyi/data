hi it's it's me laura at the end of 2021 we here at unchained introduced a new show called the chopping block where insiders chop it up about the latest in crypto and this show features four crypto investors who are haseem koreshi managing partner at dragonfly capital tom schmidt partner at dragonfly robert lesner founder and ceo of compound labs and managing partner of robot ventures and taroon chitra co-founder of gauntlet and managing partner robot ventures in each episode haseeb tom robert and tyrone will discuss recent events in crypto they will be live streaming their conversations every other tuesday at 6 p.m eastern and 3 p.m pacific on the unchanged youtube channel and we will then later release these conversations on the podcast but the live stream is where you can participate in the chat perhaps affect the conversation and also catch all the visuals so you've already had a chance to watch the first two or listen and both of them are super fun and insightful conversations i am now here to introduce this third episode and just generally explain to anyone who happens to be on the channel why i have these four people here discussing crypto events without me but in the future i will just leave them to dish about the latest in crypto on their own so thanks to all of you for tuning in and i hope that you enjoy listening to their discussion as part of your regular crypto news intake on unchained and now i will turn things over to hashibe all right thanks laura okay so hey everybody welcome back to the chopping block every couple weeks the four of us get together and give an industry insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day so quick intros uh tom is the d5 maven and master of memes then we've got robert crypto connoisseur and captain of compound uh then we have taroun the gigabrain and gran puba at gauntlet and then we have myself haseeb chief hypeman at dragonfly the four of us are early stage investors in crypto but i want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice legal advice or even life advice so robert this is uh we failed a couple times in trying to get this show started but you were telling us in the pre-roll uh about your new uh nft profile pic let's kick it off so yeah last night i got peer pressured into buying a new nft by kane of synthetics it turns out that all the other d5 founders were purchasing crypto coven nfts and making them their twitter avatars and i love rotating twitter avatars um you know it's something i do frequently and so i left at the opportunity to buy the least attractive crypto coven which i could find out of the entire collection the most demonic um least traditionally appealing can you throw it up on the screen yeah yeah let's uh let's take a peek at this this bad girl bad boy yeah that bad girl uh bad girl that's covered it's a covenant yeah it's a comic i actually looked up i didn't know what a coven was i just sort of knew it was kind of a dark evil thing but apparently it covers it for witches yeah exactly it's a plural of which which i did not know yeah there we go yeah yeah this is nice she's a beaut yeah but the thing that makes this interesting is this is not a hexagon and oh i what i find interesting is that you know i am um somebody who recently paid twitter three dollars to get twitter blue so that i could hexagon my photos but i actually have multiple ethereum wallets and you can only link one wallet easily to twitter so highly experimental feature there's been a lot of people on twitter complaining about the ability to link wallets there's people because they have to link it on their phone who are taking you know a qr code and like moving it to their desktop and like importing it into their ledger live app it's just a mess um so multiple addresses some of the profiles i use have the hexagon some of them don't have the hexagon um obviously this feature created a lot of controversy this week a lot of non-crypto folks were really dunking on it pretty strong but um i'm proud to rock hexagon nfts as profile pics and brand new ones that don't yet have the hacks i think take a minute and just appreciate how crazy it is that like twitter actually added nft like verified nfc profile pictures independent of the quality of the implementation which i also have issues with like it's insane that this actually um exists in in you know in in this year it's awesome i mean the minute that jack left you know and he's a bitcoin max as soon as as soon as he was gone i mean like weeks later they're rolling out ethereum integrations with the most popular ethereum wallet providers so that should say a lot about the sort of internal direction of the organization where they want to go i don't know if that's true i mean they teased this while he was still there so it must have been think about how long it would take to depose a public company ceo you think that that's like a this is not this is this is not a guillotine french revolution like throw the throw them into the you know the guilty this is like you know the board has to like publish enough evidence and like they have to have 20 billion meetings and then you have to go insult all your detractors on twitter who uh probably convince your board to fire you dot dot dot don't don't forget about the body politic involved here i understood yes i i i think it's likely that this was happening for a while but i don't think i mean jack remember jack bought the uh twitter nfts on uh what was that what was that site that was written right uh you know jackpot something on send like i don't think he's a die hard like you know screw the nfts have you read have you read the description of the really shitty decks that square put out i mean that thing is like a worse rfq than 0x v1 to 2017. like it's actually like a horribly designed system i at like i i can't believe it backwards 0x so the support background anyway i'm saying worse than 0x v1 zero that means they didn't even do any prior art they didn't even like read the xerox paper they were just like oh we had to reinvent science and actually we're back in the stone age forget about electricity describe what squares decks does looks like and how it works yeah so it's a request for quote type decks so basically people who want to sell place orders and they place sort of like a thing that says like hey i want to buy 10 bitcoin and i wanted to be filled within like a certain amount of time and then basically they have a sort of simple matching algorithm that happens off-chain with trusted uh sort of like uh federated trusted uh network of people who handle the fiat on-ramp and then also do the matching uh it's not a dex in any sense of decentralized disk is more decentralized than this thing because it effectively requires kycing all of the people who are doing matching as well as all the people doing fiat on-ramps i thought it was a lot more hype and bluster than anything realistic like the paper just reads like someone just ignored all of the advances in automated market making and on-chain lending and derivatives that have taken place since 2017. it felt a little bit like when visa or mastercard put out like white papers about crypto uh it's just like the the story is that look they did something and they felt it was worth publishing like that can square do something is that the meme yeah i mean yeah well so i mean look long story short it to tom's point it is certainly a big milestone for the industry that nfts have been legitimized to this extent but now you know once twitter integrates with open and by the way it's also a huge boon for openc to be the place where it's not even that twitter's going themselves it links directly to openc so you look at someone's twitter profile and it is basically an advertisement to go you know sort of buy now on openc which is to my mind pretty incredible uh so i i think it you know to tom's point one it's a it's a it's a real moment of legitimization for the industry that it's gonna be hard to look back on all this and say like oh you know nfts were just a flash in the pan i think it's it's fairly clear that nfts are not going away even if sort of the v0 of pfps end up becoming less popular over time which uh you know there was there was a thought actually i mean one of the interesting things that um uh kind of bring into the kind of big news of the week was the market drawdown and uh there's a there's gonna be a lot to talk through about all the different elements of what happened but one of the interesting things coming in from nfts is that nfcs actually did pretty well during the market drawdown which was the most surprising thing because you would think you know generally speaking this market drawdown was uh incited largely by fears of uh the interest rates uh set by the fed increasing faster than otherwise expected and naturally we talked about this last time is that when interest rates grow up that generally means that demand for risk assets goes down because the opportunity cost safer assets are now you know they pay more because there's a there's a higher interest rate on them so you would think that like okay nfts are the farthest out the risk curve you could possibly be they're the riskiest things in crypto and therefore they should they should have gotten totally hit but instead what we saw was that nft's held up really well uh what do you i mean robert you're probably the biggest nft connoisseur of anybody at this uh uh on this show what are your thoughts about why this happened yeah so they didn't necessarily go up in dollar terms they went up in ether and crypto terms right they outperformed other crypto assets and i think the psychology of this is actually really simple when ether got smoked i mean we watched it go from 4 700 to 200 you know in a relatively short amount of time you didn't see nft prices and ether terms dropped by that much right and suddenly there's a lot of people who you know are holding assets who said wow like nfts got a little bit cheaper in some cases and if you in ether terms are a little bit more expensive but like they feel a lot cheaper right you know all else equal the price of an nft just dropped by half and so you know psychologically you know the ether you're holding you may as well put it to work once it goes down in price right i think there's a component of that to it but like open c is also posting all-time high volumes this week which is generally not true of like the crypto market right like if bitcoin yeah falls in price by half like generally you're gonna see you know volumes could go down as well just as a result of sort of the unit of account yeah falling in value whereas mt's like these things are going down in u.s dollar terms but the the exchange volumes are going up in us dollar terms so it's a really weird dynamic but i do generally agree with you that like we're seeing every pricing in east terms but not in dollar terms yeah in terms of open seas volume you know someone's gonna have to double click on this but i i read an interesting thread online recently where someone was saying that um a lot of the uh dune queries that were being used to like generate these reports became inaccurate as someone so that was me break it down for us break it down all right all right here's here's the play by play so you know disclosure dragonfly recently invested in in gem which is a uh nft aggregator nfd marketplace aggregator so go to gem you'll see nfts across every different you know nft exchange that that exists including things like nftx and they'll help you bulk buy so if you want to buy you know five crypto coven you can do it one transaction and you actually save a bunch of gas sweep the floor um and so i was digging through some of their data trying to see who's using this thing what are their volumes blah blah blah and i kept noticing weird discrepancies between the gem volume that was seen on on dune and the opencv volume that was on i believe richard chen has like the main openc dune dashboard um and so was diving into it and it turns out that the openc dash that was initially made didn't really account for the idea of there being multiple fills per transaction um so that's what's happening right now normally right you see an nftn open c you buy that's one fill that's one transaction it's done but with something like gem uh you can buy five or ten different nfts in a single transaction and normally okay maybe this creates some double counting in this case just because of the way the transact the dune query was written it generated a squared number of transactions so five buys would turn into 25 buys and 10 buys returned to 100 buys and so i basically put in a small patch there's like a one line fixed to the to the query but it sort of caused the estimated you know open c volumes to fall by like 30 or 40 percent depending on the day so sort of a weird little quirk you gotta you gotta look in the data you know you gotta you gotta do your own research um but i don't know i think it's a testament to like the rise of these these aggregators they're doing you know i don't know four or five percent of open sea volume every day and i expect that to keep going up because they just provide a really great experience for you know buying and selling nfts yeah there was a really good uh thought piece as well by i think it was scott lewis who said you know the rise of more marketplaces from open seat it looks rare to whatever is going to necessitate the rise of aggregators right the rise of aggregators is going to then enable the rise of more amm liquidity pools for nfts that wouldn't otherwise get any flow right because no one's going to go to let's say nftx or whatever directly but if you have aggregators that become more popular in the primary use cases as you know how you interact and purchase nfts you'll be able to more easily interact with small niche or passive pools of liquidity as well so i think in terms of the evolution of this you know there's a lot of design space for you know nft amms and either niche or strategy specific like ways to create nft liquidity that will start getting a lot of volume when they might not have any retail go to a website you know click a button direct flow so i'm excited to see where this leads i think aggregator is going to change nft markets radically um and i think it's starting to it makes it more fun i mean just sweeping the floor with one click makes nfts more like erc20s in a lot of ways it used to be incredibly difficult to do these floor sweeps right there was a lot of fancy um you know kind of smart contract level stuff that you had to do in order to effectively complete a floor sweep in a single transaction and now that stuff is all getting commoditized like anybody can now do a floor suite so that it it is a market transformation that i think we're very we're starting to see the very beginning of it feels to me like you know one of the things that we were expecting for a very long time so and you know another disclosure we're investors into one inch uh one inch is the leading d5 aggregator of uh you know trading rc20 tokens and for a long time we thought that uh d5 and for the trading of normal tokens especially at spot markets that almost certainly it's going to transition to becoming majority driven by by aggregators as opposed to people going directly to the most popular front end like something like uniswap um and interestingly that hasn't really happened it's it's you know the aggregator market share has been stuck for most of d5 somewhere between like 10 to 20 percent market share it kind of floats around depending on what's going on at a given day and you know our our belief is that probably that will trend upwards over time as the market gets more sophisticated but right now it doesn't really seem like that that uh that that's happening and the question is like for nfts do we expect that to change certainly it's been the case that openc has just run away with it they've just been so completely dominant in nft volumes and the two-sided marketplace nature of openc makes that work really well but do you guys think that the market structure of nfts is going to evolve such that it's going to be a winner take all where there's one open c and nobody else can really stand up to them or that they're going to be other challengers to open seas dominance i think every every founder working on an nft marketplace needs to read the cold start problem by andrew chen from andreessen like i think i see a lot of founders who are building new energy marketplaces thinking they'll win on like tech and really that's not how you how you break through like you know uh a liquidity mode right like a two sided marketplace mode do you need to get really aggressive going after one vertical and starting the liquidity there early if you look at where do you actually see volumes that aren't on openc um you know maybe outside of some of these amm platforms it's it's it's exchanges that are vertically integrated right like the punx marketplace or like um katana on ronin for like axi things like that where it's sort of specially designed for these assets and they sort of um go after these assets alone um i think that's where you can kind of start to see liquidity fragmentation but i think for the most part you know teams just try to compete on having a nicer ui but if there's nothing to buy you know it's it's not really uh compelling enough to sort of overcome that that activation energy um to sort of break out the moat maybe this is actually a good segue to talk about about looks rare um i don't know what you guys have been uh if you guys have been looking at them this week yeah so maybe i can uh briefly summarize the looks for a story actually uh tom maybe maybe you should given how close you've been to it sure um so looks rare is a i think now that openc is recently raised at around at 13 billion dollars it has a huge bullseye on this back and and all these founders are looking for ways to go after this this sort of giant and one of the more popular things we've seen recently is the idea of vampire attacking open seat or basically making a competitor and trying to suck up all of its liquidity and then eventually sort of overtake it and looks rare is sort of the latest and arguably most successful in this category um where they're starting out giving a big airdrop to everybody who's traded on openc with their own proprietary token and trying to get people excited and build a long tail token distribution um and then um what looks very implemented is basically uh trade mining so they're compensating people um with fees for uh trading on looks rare with the idea of basically generating enough volume over time to slowly sort of wean off of open c and sort of wean down on the on the rewards and i think you know for the most part they've been successful in generating volume if you look at you know day or day they're doing several times more um volume per day than than open seat which is pretty impressive on the face of it i think the maybe flip side of this if you look at it is that a lot of people are accusing them of of wash trading or basically people washing on looks rare to get their rewards because the rewards are basically much higher than the fees that you pay to actually trade um which is kind of the peril that you need to avoid when you're designing like a trade mining program very briefly for those who are not aware wash trading is basically when you when you essentially trade with yourself to give the impression of trading in order to re you know get some kind of auxiliary benefit right so wash rating is generally illegal in normal regulated exchanges because you're sort of pumping up volumes with illegitimate trading activity in the case of something like looks rare the reason why people might be wash rating is because by trading on looks rare you can earn some of the looks rare token and so it turns out that the looks for our token uh is is priced such that uh if you just list an nft yourself and you trade with yourself to buy the nft um even if you pay the two percent fee or what is it two and a half percent two percent something like that i think two percent yeah exactly exactly once you pay the two percent fee um you actually come out ahead with the looks where air drop and so that's why you're seeing so much incentive for there to be all this wash training um and so to be clear the accusation is not that the looks for our team is wash rating but that random people who are trying to make money off of the looks of our token are wash trading and one of the strongest indications of this wash rating that tom you were pointing out to me earlier is that the collections that are seeing the most volume of trading on looks right are not the same collections that are being traded on openc so if you expect it to be organic volume what you would see is that people are trading on looks rare the kinds of things they're trading on other platforms right it's the same kind of popular things but instead what they're doing is they're only trading collections that have uh zero percent creator fees so a creator fee what does it call the creator tax or what's what's the name for royalty yeah current royalty royalty royalty is your creative royalty uh i guess the term is important uh people definitely get offended if you say creator fee and not royalty ex please excuse me so the the creator royalty basically the idea is that if you transfer or you effect a sale of an nft the the original uh creator of that nft will get a percent of every single transfer that happens hence and uh you know this famously we talked about last week what happened with pudgy penguins when they were wrapped to avoid this greater royalty so what's happening is that the only collections getting traded in volume on looks rare are these that don't have a greater royalty uh which is a dead sign that okay the reason why they're trading these things that don't ever create a royalty is because they don't actually care about trading the collections they're just trying to mine the airdrop so uh what are you looking oh i was just showing off sort of exactly what we were talking about looking at looks rare versus opencv volume segmented by royalty versus royalty-free volume and it just like night and day like looks very like 99 royalty free and open openc is like one percent royalty free um i actually heard a crazy story recently which is uh loot has the as a switch that could be flipped to to basically add a royalty to to loot trades and it's historically been traded turned off um but i think the loot community got kind of pissed about people watched trading loot on looks rare that they basically very sneakily flipped it on before people could notice and they earned like 500 in fees into the looks into the loot treasury so yeah they they have like a few mil in uh in the in the loot treasury to spend on whatever they want to spend on so you got to be careful when you're when you're watch trading is uh maybe the lesson how dastardly how desperate yeah well it turns out this is the uh the chopping block the number one place for wash traders to get their tips on yeah which assets to choose yeah look for luxury i think is is probably not the the primary example of how to take on the open c monopoly right now um although it's getting a lot of attention it doesn't time will tell time i feel like it's not even clear that their monopoly status can be we can't we can't really say that until the coinbase thing launches right because i feel like the coinbase nft like if that if coinbase is unsuccessful with launching their nft platform then i think it's like crown openc monopoly but i i feel like we have this kind of looming big event that we haven't really figured out how to factor in and it does seem like coinbase is trying to get a lot more like celebrity involvement and sort of more mass-market appeal i think than like a lot of what's on openc and so we'll see if that like has like an nba top shots like effect or not i do think like one thing that's interesting is like the towards the aggregator market is one of the benefits of being non-fungible right is like you can you buy portfolios of things right so it's like a real estate investment trust i bought a portfolio of houses in this case it's like i bought this portfolio of nfts the problem is most like pricing mechanisms are hard to have a lot of liquidity in if you have too many different types of bundles right like oh i want like an arbitrary subset of board apes like i want all the apes with this quality but not this quality and this quality and as you add more of those you kind of blow up the state space in a way that makes it like much harder to source liquidity for every single bundle but i think the interesting thing that's to to the point of to robert's point with the aggregators is sweeping the floor is sort of like a bundle that's random to some extent right it's a bundle of subsets of the nfts that's like somewhat random somewhat signal and like somehow that's yeah and somehow that's like the market has cohered on that bundle as being like worth buying one unit of roughly and so i think the the nft markets will probably standardize to some extent a little bit like the way the real estate market or commodities markets do where there's just certain types of bundles that get bought as like a unit like a floor price type of thing it's like i bought like you know if you think about oil there's like three different types of oil futures you can trade one that's like the really shitty oil one that's like the medium grade and one that's a high grade but like what does it mean to be the shitty grade there could be some good batches and the shitty grade ones just they all came from the same place and i kind of think we're going to see a lot more market structure in fts that looks like commodities and real estate and is that what nftx was doing i mean nftx was doing exactly this and it it kind of i think they were a little early designed very well they were different early they were early and like i i think this idea of like the floor being the right portfolio was just like not really totally known at that time like like everyone was just like oh you want like a equally balanced portfolio of punks but when you have punks the max my max over min price ratio being like a hundred or something it's like that not really right like that is definitely yeah that's definitely true that's definitely true they got a lot of things wrong um but i do recall nftx having like tiered uh rarity indexes for some of the different nft collections it's just like it's hard to figure out what bundle people want right openc memed the floor into a bundle and like that that was actually the sticking point in my mind for them and why everyone is instead trying to copy by by like these vampire attacks that incentivize floor trading on aggregators yeah i agree with you that the the one potential savior here is coinbase is nft marketplace but i worry that we've just seen such bad execution so far from everybody like all the traditional companies trying to get into nft marketplaces i mean i was i was worried for a while about the is nft marketplace and i haven't heard a peep about it since it went live and the news newsflash if you're trying to make solana nfts this hallmark of your nft platform spam issues will make it very hard to be usable yes indeed uh well okay that takes us back so let's rewind a bit move away from the nft conversation and go back to the carnage that we that we saw this week because it brings us actually in quite quite nicely into some of the stuff that you were talking about so a lot of stuff during the market downturn we saw a lot of stuff break um we actually saw maker dao which is the largest lending protocol on ethereum by tvl we saw maker doubt get very dangerously close to basically having a massive liquidation that would have totally you know caused the entire market to buckle i think it was something like 600 million dollars of ether that was extremely close to getting auctioned off uh we saw ohm olympus dow which we've discussed a few times before on the podcast uh we saw olympus dow draw down to something like 60 up from a high of near what a thousand something like that uh so yeah the market cap and so the market cap is down from 4 billion to 5 600 ml right now so um yeah quite a drawdown for for ohm yeah and so basically what you've seen is that every instance of on-chain leverage which you know olympus now is a good example of sort of implicit on chain leverage but then of course you know maker dow and many other lending protocols on chain are the same thing we saw lots and lots of both massive drawdowns and some near-death experiences uh in other parts of the market what were some of the things that you guys were paying attention to during the market drawdown that you thought were interesting well makerdale was fascinating mostly because you had to see roon the founder of makerdale get on twitter and start saying we have to contact one specific borrower like that was absurd solend had major issues on solana solana had uptime issues during you know a disastrous market environment which you know if your blockchain's not live d5 doesn't work right and that's fine if you're a dex okay you can't trade boohoo like wait 12 hours and trade but if it's a protocol that relies on risk and collateralization and like leverage and borrowing if your blockchain is not up bad things happen right if you can't be liquidated where liquidations aren't orderly or the price fees are off or delayed or whatever you know you're going to get events that ruin traders and users um so you know we're in our infancy of seeing the interactions of d5 on unstable platforms it could have been a lot worse you know there's not a plug but you know a couple years in protocol like compound was like the most boring and uneventful participant you know had like 15 billion dollars of liquidity and like you wouldn't have even noticed anything like during the market sell off like massive liquidations but like everything was just like completely humming right i i think that areas of the market that are newer are going to see the most craziness you know it was a little surprising you know to see maker sort of running around but the system and maker performed correctly it was just the size of a position that was at risk um so i think we'll continue to see people talking about defy like is it working during massive market sell-offs in the newer corners of the market next time it might be you know is defy on avalanche working you know now that it's large enough you know there's the risk of it not working um so that's what impressed me was that in general the ethereum ecosystem performed pretty well um albeit one massive massive borrower at risk in maker now but like aside from that like it was uneventful you know yeah i i think in some respects this kind of reminds me of like march 2020 for ethereum when it's like the maker oracle broke and then you know baker had to issue a bunch of more mkr and so sort of like that was sort of like a little bit of a growing up moment for like ethereum d5 and i think maybe this is sort of the equivalent for like solana d5 like i think in you know solon's case again disclosure were an investor it wasn't like you know their fault it was like the pith oracle which everybody in solana uses like couldn't get through because there's so much transaction spam and so it's like digging through you know how do you make but the blockchain more robust but also you know adding more more backup mechanisms um in the past because i think like you know luckily in this case it wasn't too bad and they refunded people who got liquidated because of the oracle but like you know in the future it might not be so lucky maybe it's gonna be even you know too large to sort of fix as we saw with like ethereum this this time around you know if uh this this maker liquidation happened that's 600 ml in cell pressure on the market i don't know if there's actually like uh enough to sort of you know mend that back up if some of that is is liquidated incorrectly i i i do want to correct you guys a little bit on the 600 million liquidation i feel like it i actually almost feel like roon over hyped it because uh you know i we spend a lot of time monitoring liquidity on different markets and how much slippage you can actually tolerate when there are liquidations in this world and it's a it was roughly about 60 million dollars every 30 minutes that was like the max that the auction was actually doing so it actually auctioned off over six hours and at that that sort of time uh there was roughly like close to a billion dollars of open liquidity for eth so doing 60 million every 30 minutes was not so it's not so crazy it actually would have been fine i think roone maybe in order to wake up mr seven siblings uh decided to over hype it as 600 million dollars in three seconds but if anyone has ever bothered reading the maker auction documents or read the code it can't do that so i just want to point out that everyone very good factory didn't check the chain it's true it's interesting so i i agree um with what's been said prior i didn't i didn't know that about the the maker auction so i'm glad that we got the reality check there the on the solana side i thought i thought it's a very good point that look ethereal has been through this every major protocol ethereum went through march 2020 which was much more violent and much more sudden than what happened uh this week or or you know earlier over the weekend i think for solana what it showed us is that look solana is not done like it's not a finished protocol and one of the most obvious failures of solana that contributed to so much of the of the turmoil that happened over the weekend was that solana doesn't have a fee market and if you don't have a fee market this is just going to keep happening so for those who are not aware right now on solana solana does not have a gas model there is no metering that happens the way that it happens on ethereum oh if you do this much transaction and then you have to pay this much gas solana has a fixed fee for every single transaction and if you are consuming a lot of gas or a little bit of gas it doesn't matter you pay the same fee even if you want to pay more you're like hey my vault is about to get liquidated and the entire market is going to get screwed if i don't top up this vault like you know let's say you were the maker guy who was just like look everyone is yelling on twitter for me to top back up everyone wants me to talk like i'm around pith and i'm like everyone wants me to submit this oracle update i'm willing to pay 100 bucks to get this thing on chain but you can't because it just so happens that there is no way to tell the blockchain that hey my transaction is really important compared to everybody who's like trying to snipe cheap nfts because the nft markets are not getting repriced and so as a result people are spamming you know the transactions that are getting through are not the most important transactions that's why fee markets are so important basically when you don't have a market what you get is you get bread lines you get people sitting and waiting because there are because there's no marketplace so people who have the most willingness to pay cannot actually get their transactions done that is why solana failed solana did not fail because it's not fast enough or it's not whatever it failed because it doesn't have a fee market and that's what caused this over congestion of spam transactions because the spam transactions don't cost anything more than they normally cost during uh during an outage so all the people who are running solana bots trying to snipe amms are still running those bots while everyone else is running for their dear life and that just can't you know that's just a sign that look your blockchain isn't finished so we haven't yet we had a ton of news here oh sorry go ahead go ahead yeah i just wanted to add one thing to this which is like you know the interesting thing is that in a lot of ways the no fee market or like i mean they do have a sort of fee market but it's like it's not like a mempool right there's not actual like congestion at that level you do still have to pay a transaction fee and it does float somewhat it's not perfectly constant but it's it's kept artificially low so you might as well treat it as a really low constant fee and the the interesting thing is like a it looks like normal finance right like this is exactly when i worked in hft this is like what happens on the days everything goes down which is like five routers at the cme are down oh except for like three people who found this one extra route through the data center and they're over everyone because they're causing everyone to get take a huge liquidation this actually looks very similar to like traditional i mean maybe not totally surprising but this actually really does look like what the cme looks like this looks like what your ex looks like this looks like you know like traditional trading less less like crypto trading and the other thing that's interesting to note i think about the d5 protocols on solana is that a lot of the people who are who've built them you know i don't think they they they they're a lot of them are coming from from high frequency trading a lot of them are coming from sort of like fang manga whatever it's called now uh places you know i think they didn't spend time understanding why ethereum d5 kind of evolved the way it did they didn't maybe do the anthropological and like historical survey of like why did this unifop thing come in they just kind of were like oh yeah we're gonna make something better that looks like what our systems look like in our old jobs and in the process what happened is people made a lot of d5 protocols that have a ton of transactions needed to do a single action right so in ethereum one of the reasons uniswap really beat out everything else at that time in late 2018 early 2019 partially was it only took one transaction to do an arbitrary size trade right in an order book you can't do that you you you may have to send like tens 20 30s or transactions to clear out the order book to make a huge trade that might be like a liquidation and something like pith another another which is i think a really nice protocol it's like a very clean protocol mathematically it has infinitely more transaction volume generated on chain than a chain link or a traditional kind of simple spot price oracle because it does this confidence interval calculation on chain and so there's a sense in which a lot of the d5 protocols on solana were built with this idea that hey transactions are really cheap who cares do as many transactions as you need regardless of scenario and that kind of ignores a lot of what people learned in east defy right like the ether delta you know the a lot of the pith failure does resemble a little bit like a lot of the ether delta failures in january 2018 and so i i think like this is a learning lesson for that ecosystem in terms of hey like there's a reason that some of these inefficient things are done in east defy it's not because like the developers are dumb necessarily right like it is actually because there are there are these extremes i'm just i'm just i'm just saying like it's it's like there's a lot of like hubris in that ecosystem sometimes of like people like ah like yeah these people are all dumb they don't they made this like kind of inefficient thing and i think like sometimes it does it does help to make sure you understand the history and anthropology of why we you know like why those mechanisms evolved i think the solana ethos has done a lot to convince people that solana's not even a blockchain that it's basically just a computer and you can just run an ordinary program on it and expect perfect uptime you can expect availability you can expect oh you know the idea is like well everything's you know 400 millisecond or 500 millisecond blocks so you don't even need to think about the kind of trade-offs that someone on ethereum would normally think about about liveness and availability and that leads to things like today or not today but you know this weekend during the market drawdown like if if you're building a financial system it the first rule the first principal rule is that it's got to be robust in the times when it most matters which is of high volatility and everything in ethereum is built with that in mind because everyone remembers march uh 2020. and solana wasn't even around in march 2020. this is kind of the first time that they've actually gotten punched in the gut of hey when when goes really haywire you're just another blockchain and you behave exactly like one and that oh crap the market's going nuts and there's downtime and like nobody get their transactions through and suddenly the things that we thought were buttery smooth are exactly the things we we are not working and the things that we most need that being said i do want to give them a lot of credit for actually you know i think i i was you know in the in the discord throughout the kind of like their resolution of things and i i you got to give them a lot of credit for actually getting the hard fork through like in eos times like eos the eos developers never showed up and like no one cared enough to actually go like fix things and like try to make these updates and i don't think it's like mal-intentioned that's true i want to give them a lot of credit for like taking a really shitty situation and you know actually like kind of pulling through and like i i think they understand these problems right like at the end of the day they just wanted to build the fastest thing ever and unfortunately the fastest thing ever does look a little bit like equinix ny5 right it doesn't really look like geo-distributed blockchain as much and you're you're making this trade-off that's fine but i i do think like they there there is a sense in which the developer community in solano is actually extremely strong and i i think like i i'm i certainly think there there it doesn't feel like the eo stays we're like anything bad would happen on eos everyone would just point fingers at each other and like no one would push an upgrade and no one would fix their protocols so i i i want to give a lot of like you know to all of the doctors who are up 24 hours a night like look at that absolutely nothing but respect for the solano core team what they've done in terms of building performance and building a great community has been amazing right and it's early days and it's very very clear like look ethereum has gone through so many face plants in its history that like look every blockchain is going to go through that especially when you're rebuilding the stack um piece by piece so i i i think you you make a great point to ruin and i don't want to belittle the work that any of these uh developers or entrepreneurs are doing in trying to build robust systems so with that being said my hope is that the salon ecosystem is going to learn from this and realize that like look uh you guys are a blockchain too and the problems that every blockchain worries about about you know sort of uptime and scalability and decentralization and blah blah blah but you got to worry about that too because no matter how high your tps is and no matter where you sort of sit on that trade-off spectrum at the end of the day when markets are going down 25 in a single day like every blockchain basically looks the same and they all suffer from the same problems yeah for sure and i think that like i said there's some times in history in this industry where we've seen like chains that was their disappearing event effectively and i don't feel that way i really do feel like the community the community really came in here it's definitely not the case i mean we're still seeing you know there was a lot of press coverage around that time there were some uh there were some like traders who were going and talking to all the press outlets they're like oh i i can't believe that solana is not being performed at the time when it most matters um and that felt a little um it felt a little bs to me um because like okay look you know yeah like everything is doing terribly right now like what what why would salona be any different and all this stuff is obviously very new and look the salon team has been relatively clear and saying look this is beta software this you know the blockchain is not done yet so you know chill out like you know use it at your own peril it does make very clear that look the the solana story people are now i think coming to appreciate that like this so a lot of story is not quite as it's not quite as magical as was originally portrayed to to try to get a system with this kind of performance is going to come with downsides and you're going to you're going to see some of that come up especially when you build an entire stack from scratch and then try to put billions of dollars of tvl into it yeah one thing that is kind of interesting that like i i'm kind of hoping the next we see in the next crash when there's like more bridges the next crash and there's always you're the only one who's looking forward to the next crash at this point i'm just saying there's always you can't you can't like assume there's not going to be one there will be one in some finite time right but true the the i guess the the the interesting thing is like once we're in this more interconnected inter-web looking set of blockchains like they're all there's like way more volume in the bridges higher throughput it'll be interesting to see if like these the the networks that are less spam resistant somehow have all their flow so they're sort of like pushed off into the ones that are more spam resistant and you have this sort of like in very calm times you can like use these kind of solana style things and then the moment things are bad like everything just crosses and goes to like the higher fee networks um i mean wouldn't that happen with like bitcoin and uh lightning or bitcoin and dsv maybe or if if we saw enough if you actually saw real usage there sure but like the usage there is just exchanges dumping their coins or moving between wallets like there's not many real real like bitcoin users other than exchanges now and custodian sound days tom robert any thoughts on the solana drama well it won't be the last time there's solana drama um just like any time there was ethereum drama wasn't the last time there was aetherium drama you know i think there's going to be some growing pains for solano for ethereum as it migrates to f2 you know and l2s i mean you know blockchains are fragile right no more no one needs two by the way you're not allowed to say that yeah isn't it consensus layer or something now yeah exactly exactly i don't know you got the memo rubber don't make me change my ways um but like the magic of bitcoin is that it's not fragile right but you know smart contract platforms are exponentially more complex and they are still fragile right and so you know i think it'll be a decade before like these systems really harden to the degree that we look at bitcoin as so more drama ahead i i think of it a little bit in in sort of like the in traditional software you know i feel like there's always this sort of tension between doing things sort of the like native way and then people saying well like that like it's really hard and complicated let's build an abstraction that allows any developer to come on right this is like electron or like the um adobe thing like in the early mobile days we're like oh we just write it in like you know uh flashscript and then you can deploy it on like ios and android and it turns out like actually that's really hacky and inefficient and bad and then after a certain point you end up just like rewriting it natively and i feel like salon is in a similar point where they're like yeah just like you know it's just like you know your normal hp job just bring the same exact architecture people are discovering hey maybe this isn't super efficient and then sort of finding ways to actually like you know busy speak um to to the way the system's actually designed and so maybe that's kind of we're going through a similar path right now with with crypto fair enough well i think the one thing we can all agree on is that uh it's still early days and there's a lot more that we're going to learn about all of these platforms uh over the coming years um you know solana hasn't been out for that long and so if anything it's a testament to how amazingly that team has done to get as far as they have and to get the attention and um usually the history of technology tells you if there's one thing that people get mad keep getting mad at uh it's probably going to win at something important so one last market comment cosmos ecosystem really killed it during all of the turmoil and and also transaction rights osmosis had like almost 10x it's ever volume it ever had and and was like totally fine like is there is there a broader story beyond just like nothing in cosmos broke i mean i also just think it's actually hard to short things in cosmos other than that there's a market structure issue there okay but but but i do think the interesting thing is like the validator set stood up it was this was like probably the biggest test because cosmos never really had that many apps that were using ibc um well luna got out pretty hard right but adam and and um some of the other things in the college zika system did well yeah luna got hit but that's more for economic reasons for luna not for not that like the luna validator set had issues processing things but i think this is the first time we saw ibc like cross chain bridges really get like 100x the volume of their normal thing and see if they can actually survive and so i think that that was actually we should give a shout out i want to give a shout out to the cosmos ecosystem for for having a good good time well done to cosmos and so as we as we close out this episode obviously markets are still pretty choppy out there in the spirit of not offering investment advice not being investment advice where do you guys think the market is going from here uh we'll just go around real briefly in one sentence tom uh i i am definitely not uh the person to be asking about this i mean i suspect we are close to bottoming out i think there's probably still more room to go but you know overall i was saying in our team meeting this week like it's very feels very different from 2017 in my mind in that you actually have you know real usage of these of these protocols there's like actual you know real traction i mean even just like the twitter anything thing this week so it's not like we're going to xero um i certainly think we're seeing secular repricing um with it within the crypto as well as sort of you know macro issue that we've been talking about robert you know crypto's an asset class just like equities and fixed income and all the macro macro things right now across the board i mean for every asset price is down volatility up implied volatility way up right so you know i i don't think that crypto is unique i don't think a lot of the sell-off is even because of you know specific properties of crypto i think it's just because risk assets in general have just gotten smoked and liquidity whether it's in equities or crypto is the same thing right and more and more there's interconnectedness and shared ownership between equities and crypto right whereas five years ago that really wasn't the case so i think in general you know what equities do crypto will do more than people expect i think that correlation is probably higher than most people expect going forward i think you know it's probably going to rebound because risk assets generally always do rebound you know i don't think if there is a bear market that it's a you know bear market that's unique to crypto i think it would probably be shared and coupled more closely with other asset classes especially now especially with you know inflation and the fed is like the primary drivers of everything so crypto's less unique okay well i did just see that danielle of wonderland got liquidated for 18 million dollars so uh that seems like an interesting observation to note uh in this chat since we mentioned ohm earlier i i i think uh this is the year of uh the next all l1 right like there's this really good i thought there's like quite good podcast with hasu and and suzu on you know this like the mercenary all l1 rotation of like people who have big thighs like sue kind of like keep moving to whichever new l1 um has like new stuff and i i think like this does seem to be like at least from the d5 standpoint the the year of nir and cosmo so i think they're gonna i think the selunavax 2021 becomes cosmos near 2022 and you know you're seeing a lot of um stuff on aurora like starting to actually exist and i i i overall market structure i don't know i i i'm not totally i don't think i have like some great prediction but i do think in those two ecosystems i i you know it seems like there's a lot more you know growth happening so my very briefly i think that um probably we'll see crypto give a little bit more away as interest rates creep up but i don't think it's going to be too much worse than where we are today um but yeah my view similar to roberts i think that you're going to see crypto kind of stapled to you know growth tech stocks for a while um until i think eventually you're going to see a decoupling but i don't think we're there yet and um but overall i think like tom said fundamentals look good and so although i think you're going to still see private valuations really high i think the public markets will be relatively cheap for a while um and at the end of the day i don't think rates are going to be elevated forever especially you know kind of going into midterms there's going to be demand for the s p to bounce back and i think uh political positioning being what it is i don't think that uh either party is gonna be accepted is gonna be happy with rates being super low and the s p not doing great you know over the next few years so yeah actually do you think rates will go up at all just quick binary question yes rates we'll definitely go up from where we are right now i don't know i think so i i i i'm pricing in a k fade from from uncle powell i would get you any amount of money that rates get hiked at least once this year maybe marginally but like i don't i i kind of feel like the mortgage right now i'm very proud of this the market is trying to manipulate powell by crashing a pretty bad way to manipulate him i just like have been getting a lot more of a sense that like inflation does seems to be very heterogeneous right now or like the crash has caused people to measure inflation very differently and it seems to not be like this like the the transitory narrative thing has clearly like there's some truth to it it's not totally a lie and and i'm i'm not convinced it's gonna be like this like big interest rate increase because like some sectors of the economy are like really crashing okay well in the interest of time and also the interest of subject matter i think we'll have to revisit this as the year goes on but uh this this expect this to continue to develop in future episodes so for now thank you everybody and we'll be back again in a couple weeks
