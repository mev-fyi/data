out at playgu.co unchained pod today's guest is matthew lysing reporter at bloomberg and author of out of the ether the amazing story of ethereum and the 55 million dollar heist that almost destroyed it all welcome matt hey laura thank you very much congrats on the publication of your book out of the ether which comes out the week after this podcast drops tell us what it's about thank you yeah um so it's an early history of ethereum um starting you know with vitalik and going on through his life and how he came to invent ethereum and the co-founders that he gathered around him and the ups and downs of launching the network um it's also a bit of a deep dive into the dow hack in 2016 uh where i wrote a magazine story about it a couple years ago in 2017 and i just always in the back of my mind wanted to do a little more reporting and i thought a book would be a great format to try to find out as much as i could about who was behind the hack and just i knew that there was a lot of great stuff that i hadn't used in the magazine story so that was a big um part of it and then it's also just um about how uh main street and wall street are really coming to ethereum and how it's starting to sort of uh work its way uh not just into finance but into things like reddit and all sorts of other parts of the economy as you mentioned one of the main catalysts for you to write the book was that earlier article on the dow attack how did that article come about well um so i remember that friday in 2016 when the dow was hacked i i was home sick um on my couch and i looked at my phone and was like oh that this i i was aware of the doubt i had paid a little bit of attention to it and i'm like oh my god everything was blowing up and it's like being you know robbed as i was sitting there on my couch and i thought it was fascinating but um it was it wasn't the right time at bloomberg to really be talking about the dow or ethereum for that matter uh it was still really early in the in the project um the dao was kind of like the only thing going really at that point and it didn't have much to do with finance or the wall street sort of audience that bloomberg news you know writes to so i just sort of paid attention but then forgot about it until um later that year i think it was the end of the year the editor of the magazine came to me and said hey we're doing a heist issue uh we do this every year do you have any good heist stories and so the dow just popped into my mind immediately because i watched what had happened and i knew that the fork was there and all this crazy stuff and ether classic and so and i again like i said it really it's not something you can really capture and i think in a news story you need a longer format and so i thought a magazine story would be great for that and it turned out to be like the most fun i've ever had i really enjoyed getting to know everybody that the story is just absolutely bonkers um and so i was just really happy with that and the way it turned out and so i was able to take that magazine story and use it to write a book proposal and here we are i highly recommend that readers check out that article i remember when it came out because there were so many cool interactive elements as well where you could learn the technology they were sort of like in these um like in a magazine we would call them sidebars i i actually didn't look at the physical copy but on the online you guys literally did them almost like sidebars like they would like pop up on the side and then you could kind of go down like little mini rabbit holes right um so like as like we would mention a tweet it would show up on the side and you'd see like abs's tweet you know about the dao is being drained and then what i like too is on the left side the actual dow code was like there and as you scroll down the story it sort of follows along the code um because the famous line in there is line 666 it's where the bug um was and so you know truth is stranger than fiction so we just sort of like had a really fun time playing with that stuff before writing that article how familiar were you with ethereum and crypto and what in general was your history covering the blockchain space yeah so i had gotten into it um in 2015 the year before um so my beat for people who don't know is like market structure as a general term it's how markets work or don't work how they're like being updated manipulation um like i covered dodd-frank really closely because that was you know a real-time regulation of the swaps market and so i had heard about bitcoin but dismissed it because i just didn't get it to be honest and i didn't i didn't believe in the ones and zeros kind of thing of like having value but that was you know me in 2014 or so once in 2015 um i got sort of i read something about blockchain and and what it could do in terms of like a back end and um and how it might apply to all these financial markets that i covered so um i said to my editor i'm like hey i want to i want to cover blockchain and he's like great what's blockchain so i was one of the first at bloomberg to sort of start digging into it um we did a story pretty early on when blythe masters was appointed to be the ceo of digital asset holdings that made it on the cover of the markets magazine and as i've heard in the years since you know that was sort of a big deal for people on on the street that you know blockchain was something to take seriously but that wasn't really ethereum i didn't get into that until the next year early in 2016 i remember going out to see joe lubin at consensus in their bushwick headquarters and he made the light bulb go off over my head you know after repeating the phrase world computer enough times i just like it just really kind of took it from this sort of abstract thing that i've been writing about and made it a lot more concrete to me and after that you know we still say it's early days and this was 2016 and and it was really early days like there was really little very little to point to um uh as in terms of like a real project or something you could do besides you know buying and selling ether so that's what you know then the dow happened and that was obviously a huge deal i think it was it was what put him through the map it was wildly ambitious and it just you know ended up going down in flames in front of everyone and that that's so that that's kind of my arc to um to the dow and so since 2015 i've been writing about crypto in all sorts of ways but mostly the sweet spot for me is where it where the two meet in terms of finance and you know improving efficiency for for corporations and supply chains and stuff like that and you mentioned that after you had written the ether article you use the ether thief article you used some of that to um write your book proposal and get this book deal but at what point did you realize that you wanted to write a book or that this could be a book i knew um once the magazine story was done i was like this this is a great tale and it's got tension in it and there's all these like funny mishaps and it would be i thought it would just be amazing an amazing device to string throughout a book where you could keep the reader's attention on this heist part and then in other parts of the book say this is why this is cool here's here's ethereum and here's vitalik and here's gavin wood and so it was really just like when i realized that this is a wonderful storytelling device to to try to bait the reader along you know like there's this crazy heist going on and i'm going to lead you through it and i think you know especially i was hoping i'd find somebody who was behind it which is nobody's done that you know they're still out there and so once that sort of cemented in my mind i knew that that was a great structure and so i put the book proposal together the funny thing is i couldn't get an agent to save my life i tried everybody and i got nothing and i'd given up and out of the blue i think in january of 2018 some an agent just got in touch with me and asked if this was still available and uh he became my agent and so uh it was it was it was tough it was a tough sell i think for people because it's a technical issue and so he had heard through the grapevine that you were shopping that book proposal or like because that doesn't normally happen no no i had sent it to him and he just didn't respond you know i don't think he responded for months and and all the other responses i got were like this is a pretty cool but we're not sure we could sell this you know that's really what an agent cares about so that that's and then so i'd gone through that with dozens of agents and and just so anyway i i had given up i didn't think i could sell it and then this guy came out of the blue and we were able to to whip up the you know get the proposal in shape and and sell it to wiley huh yeah like i know normally journalists don't do this but you could have come to me and i would have tried to help you get an agent literally the woman who connected me with my agent just randomly emailed me right before this um podcast recording which is kind of i hadn't talked to her in a really long time but i'm like ever so grateful to her um anyway so um i did see at the end of your book that you thanked uh your sources and you said that there were more stuff more than 70 sources for the book how did you go about reporting this book through the ethereum or the ether thief story i've gotten to know the a lot of the guys in the rob robin hood group those are the good guy hackers um i've known joe lubin for a long time i've known vitalik and interviewed him a couple times over the years uh so i i and i think um you know luckily that story in 2017 was well received and i think people thought that i did a good job so i think i had a bit of trust built up among people in the community so when i started going out um and asking if i could talk to people i got pretty much everyone said yes i got a lot of access and it was it was great um so i just interviewed people um over and over again over um 2018 uh i think i'm you know i'm 2019 i'm sorry and just you know had dozens of notebooks that were filled and a huge file of you know research and like with vitalik i think i interviewed him for about 10 hours total over several different times i tend to just want to get in there and interview somebody for about an hour you know i record it on the record and because after about an hour i just kind of lose focus so then i go back and do it again with them you know like a few days later as to follow up on things and just to continue the conversation and that's that's sort of how i've been doing it for a long time it's just the the method that works for me so i know the audience will want to know if you found out who the dow attacker is but before we dive into that whole part of your book why don't we just discuss the earlier part of ethereum's history and then we can get to that so um what are some of the things that you learned about ethereum that you didn't previously know or that you think a lot of people don't know i knew that the original group of people that vitalik gathered around him were you know problematic i guess you could say they a lot of different personalities it was very random how that group came together there was really no rhyme or reason it was just the people who reached out to him after he sent his white paper around and said hey i want to help and so you know there were people who did that um for wanting to help code there were people who wanted to maybe get in on this and you know get rich uh there were people who did it for a lot of different reasons and it made for a very strange um group uh as you know you know within six months people were fired and there was a reorganization and there was a lot of infighting and just clashing of egos i think is the way to say it um so i had sort of known that generally but what i didn't know is that like that first sort of bloodletting in zeug as i call it in the book where charles uh was fired in a mere chat yes charles hoskinson yeah i've gone on to found cardano correct um after that it didn't get any better the uh the ethereum foundation was just a mess um sort of from the get-go and throughout the period of when i'm writing this book um you know the infighting continued after that um through 2016 there was a big part where they tried to uh they brought in a professional board of directors and hired an executive director that whole process was really um kind of loosey-goosey and there was one of my favorite stories in the book is was right as ming was hired she was complaining on a text string about the board and how they were already being um difficult and she wanted to fire them she thought she was texting her sister and she was actually texting one of the board members so they had a thing coming up in a few days and uh it was already just you know the knives were out and so i think what's fascinating is that ethereum survived despite all of this it's such a good idea and um there were people around who were driving it and knew that the idea here was solid and that the coding you know could be done and they just sort of put their noses down and did the work um you know even though all this leadership and political stuff was going on the whole time uh so so that was kind of it that was fascinating when vitalik started telling me these stories i just was kind of like my jaw was kind of dropping and you said that most people spoke to you but i do remember there were some points in the book where you said so and so declined to talk to me or did not respond so how did you deal with those parts of the story where that person was a central character but you did not have their perspective the one that really applies there is ming chan um i tried for months um to get her to talk to me but she just didn't and you know she's a divisive figure in the industry and a lot of people have you know a range of opinions on her and i i told her that and i you know i so i really wanted to get her thoughts on it and unfortunately i wasn't able to um so that had an effect where i think the book would have been much stronger with her voice in it but you know as a reporter you can only ask people to talk to you um and people sometimes don't for lots of good reasons so there was that and then the other only one was jeff wilkie he didn't respond um and i guess i should say emir and chetrit didn't didn't respond to me either uh as as you probably know and your reader or your listeners might know you know they're sort of out of ethereum and have been for a long time so i think they're i i just i think some people like just didn't want to revisit the past um and so i would say though that you know the majority of the book i had uh on the record people in the room like almost like 95 percent of the time you know so i i was uh as a writer that's what you hoped for and i was really happy that i did get that access and that people did trust me to tell the story and and and to get it you know hopefully right and just to clarify for people jeff wilkie was the lead on the go ethereum client for a long time and amir chetrit was a co-founder who was removed from the project at the same time as charles hoskinson and um i i think we already said ming chan was the executive director of the foundation um so now let's talk about your quest to find the dao attacker i i could see it just from the way the book was written um that that was like a real driving force for you so how did you go about doing that um well yeah it was it always bugged me that uh you know people just sort of got away with that and i know it's a twisty and tourney story and then the money was returned and all of that but wait what do you mean the money was returned not from the hacker from the you know ether was returned to people for you know everybody got their money back um who had money in the dow and then the the hacker you know made some money with the ether classic oh right right right so but but the big haul there was the ether that was stolen from the dow in the first place and it was you know put it was put back by the the hard fork so you know i don't know it just i it was such a compelling story on the the good guy hacker side like what absa and griff green and you know left terrace and jordi beilina all those guys were doing was so fascinating i really wanted to match that up with like who is this attacker because the hack is brilliant it's really it's a beautiful um piece of code um it's actually longer than the dow itself like the the contract to attack uh it's a two-step thing and so i i just really want as a storyteller i just wanted to try to find that side of the story and i knew uh i heard a name or not a name but i'd heard of people in switzerland who were rumored to be involved and i thought if i had a book you know in front of me and a lot of times as you know as a reporter lord people will open up to you about a book in ways that they might not if you're gonna have a story out in a day based on what they said so and that did turn out to be true um people because previously in 2017 i had only heard oh there's these people in switzerland and nobody would tell me a name because it was pretty much a rumor there wasn't a lot of hard proof so i started there and i got names and i started doing some work and i found somebody who was very good at forensics on the blockchain and just started really digging in and asking asking for help and and doing you know homework and talking to people and what was interesting was it turned out that you know in 2016 the the forensics that was available to a lot of people were not very just you know sophisticated in 2019 when i was doing the reporting uh for the book it was a lot better and people things were integrated more you can see a lot more and so uh the one big tip i got was that there was this encrypted message sent um from one of the attackers to the robin hood group and what i should say here is that there wasn't just one dow attack there were several there was the big one on friday when 55 million dollars was stolen over the course of that day i think everybody knows that the second biggest one was on tuesday four days later and that was that was the second largest it was about three and a half million worth of ether and that's that's actually the attack that made the robin hood group push the button and like drain the dow themselves um they had been set up to do that but we're worried about you know is this illegal are we gonna go to jail is everybody gonna believe us that we're gonna give it back and so they were sort of on the fence then the second attack happens on tuesday and they said okay we gotta we gotta go because otherwise it's everything's going to get stolen because there was still you know a lot of ether left in the dow so once they did that the attacker on tuesday who i believe is a different person than the friday attack they sent an encrypted message to the the robin hood group they also sent the same message to the um the child dao the friday attacker and so somebody sent me the unencrypted form of that and it was it was this really weird message about the dal wars are a waste of time and don't do this um don't you want to give the money back and if you do i'll give my money back and so it was you know as a writer you're like wow an encrypted message on the blockchain that's awesome um and now i knew an address that was linked to that account and i could see that that address that sent the message it also launched the attack contract on tuesday and so now i so i started sharing that with people who are helping me on the forensic side and that attack there was only a few short hops from that funding of that attack back to shape shift um and then the real breakthrough i had was a source um had helped me by naming the person who had the poloniex account where the withdrawals of bitcoin were made that were sent to shape shift that then went over a few hops and jumps to that attack address and so now because i had the source who was inside and you know exchanges are one of the only places that really know people's identities and and then even then of course some crypto exchanges don't but this one is poloniex they knew identities and so the source was able to link that withdrawal to shapeshift and then i knew that it went to this attack address and so now i had a chain and i had a person and so i got in touch with him and and went to tokyo to interview him so before we get to that i know everybody wants to know what happened then but i just need to ask because exchanges are pretty well known for wanting to keep their customers private information secure and and not just close that and because obviously employees can get in trouble for revealing that how did you find somebody at poloniex to reveal customer identifying information to you i was asking around and i knew somebody i knew names of people who were good at this and who had been involved with it from the beginning from the 2016 hack and so uh you know sources have lots of different reasons for talking to reporters i think this person who helped me wanted to i think they felt like this was a malicious thing that happened and um the fact that i was willing to go talk to these people um i think was something that made this source want to help me because you know um these people who know this information are not going to do that but i'm it's my job to go talk to them and ask what's what's your side of the story and and once i started doing that you know with these first i went to switzerland and talked to some people there and then that was a dead end um you know i think just the my willingness to kind of like do the work to try to figure this out i think helped them want to help me if that makes sense and one other thing i was curious about and maybe this is more of like a writer question but um why did you even reveal that like it was somebody at polo who helped you um do you know what i mean like like why would you say oh um this information that i got for my book came from this place well um i want to be as transparent as possible so for you know i want to always have as many details to back up the story and to tell peop to you know give you a sense of this is this is why i think this is worth reporting so i thought that you know using the name of the exchange wasn't going to give anyone away uh in my opinion and and it lent more weight to what i was saying and reporting so you know there's always a balance when you're using unnamed sources you want to give as much information to the reader as possible so that it seems credible while still protecting the person's identity who's helping you and it sounds like that source kind of had already made up his or her mind to help you but i wondered you know did it take any convincing because i would imagine the threat of them losing their job would be a deterrent so i just was curious to know if you like had an argument that you used or if this person you know if it wasn't necessary i think the other thing that happened was you know we i got put on this wrong trail and went to zurich to talk to somebody who didn't have anything to do with the attack and that was because i got you know the bad information from the source and that that happens from time to time so um and that was a strange conversation i had with the person in switzerland and it's all recounted in the book it ended up being kind of lucky for me i think in a way that this person i think they felt bad because they'd sent me on to to the wrong person and and but then they also saw that i was willing to you know travel to europe and do do the work to go try to figure this out and then on top of that like i said before they there was more information to work with in 2019 and when i knew that address that sent the encrypted message i sent that to the person and said hey can you help me trace this and and it was a lot easier to trace that back to the source than anything having to do with the friday attacker that's one big reason i think they're different the friday hack where 55 million was stolen those tracks were covered really really well it's it's pretty much impossible from the blockchain evidence to to piece that to to say where it came from they used mixers some that don't even exist anymore hops all over the place and if you see the stuff that i have on that on that transaction it's it's crazy it's like one of those things where they've got the boards and the strings and things are going all over the place and it's like if i'm not the fbi forget it right then on the tuesday attack they were a lot less careful and it was i i mean i figured it out i back traced it and and you know i was able to do it just looking at ether scan and so you know sorry that that's not very good in my opinion and and so that you know we're talking about two different things here so let's i just want your readers like i i don't know who did the big friday hack i'm not sure anybody will know that uh unless it's the euro poll or the fbi or something like that this tuesday attack was a lot less sloppy uh excuse me was more sloppy and easier to track yeah so we're going to talk a little bit more about these two people that might potentially fingered as um jaw attackers but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible this episode is sponsored by gods unchained the digital

winter was that you had tweeted that you'd met the dow attacker above a foot locker in zurich and i remember this tweet because i forwarded it to somebody and said oh matt found the dow attacker this means i should be able to but i uh went back to search for it and you've since deleted it so i'm going to give a spoiler which is that that person that you seem to have tweeted about you know you've mentioned here in the show that you didn't they were not the dow attacker so then why did you ended up including why did you end up including that person in your book i wanted to tell this part of the story chronologically and and so as i went through it and reported on it i i thought that person was that that's who i thought it was and i had the best information i had at that time so that's why i went to zurich and spoke to him um it then it turned out that it was wrong and so then i go through that in the story as well it's like that was a real hard thing for me to hear i was off there but now i it made me sort of like rethink what i had and what i knew to be true and that was this attack address and so i started digging into that to try to figure out what can i know about this from like ether scan records and that's where i realized that oh i can trace how these accounts were made and that led to the breakthrough of this person in tokyo um so you know i i would say it at the end of the book i i have qualms about using a term like the ether thief because i don't know that these people actually did it i i do i do believe this person i interviewed in japan is associated with with it um but i don't have a smoking gun and i lay it out for the reader as straight as i can with a lot of quotes directly from our conversation and i want to leave it up to readers to make the determination for themselves again it was kind of a narrative device on my part and at that time i you know i was excited about that part of the book i don't think i knew at that moment that it was wrong and so i think once i realized it was wrong i went back and deleted that tweet and so but it's all it's just a string it's a string of the it's like my journey in trying to find the hacker and so that i i and in a book format it's it's really nice to be able to do that because it this was over about a year's worth of work so it was an awesome now i got it okay so when you tweeted that at that time you thought that the person was the dow attacker okay now and then you delete it oh now i understand and then you um kept that part of the narrative sort of to make it like the quest part of the book right okay right and that's why i don't name the person in switzerland because there's no need to do that um they you know but i wanted to tell that story and he he was a character in my quest in my journey on that for that part of the story i see okay so now let's talk about the person that you do name which i saw you also excerpted this part of the book for bloomberg online so i'm sure by the time this comes out people will be chattering about this person but um this person that you named as a possible copycat dow attacker is a man named why am i why am i doing air quotes his real name is tomawaki sato and you can feel free to correct that if i pronounce that wrong who is he so he um is uh he's been involved with ethereum in japan for many years uh he uh he started um it was called smart contract japan uh he had gone to dev con one in london i think in 2015 and had met you know the uh all the co-founders there and then went back to japan and um blockchain wasn't really a big deal there at that point but it started to grow and he he was like one of the people who would help developers learn how to write smart contracts and do he did consulting for um corporations um as well who are interested in ethereum or smart contracts and then uh later he started um a company called starbase which was a way to help startups go through the ico process to raise funds so initial coin offerings um and so he also made changes to uh the go ether client according to his github he helped people recover their bitcoin passwords so you know these are tough things like he he has some chops um as far as i'm aware uh and so my source was able to say okay there were two two withdrawals from a poloniex account one bitcoin sorry both of bitcoin that went to shape shift one was changed into ether one was changed into dow tokens both of those um withdrawals came from polo went to shapeshift and landed in the same ethereum address uh i'll just call it 4fae for short and that's so that's the main link and i was told but that it was tomahawkey's poloniex account that those withdrawals were made from so now i had a link from him at poloniex through shapeshift to the ethereum blockchain and the attack contract that was used in the tuesday hack and so why don't you now describe um the conversation that you had with him and actually before you do that i just wanted to ask one thing because you said it so fast but i was like what um you said he helped people recover their bitcoin passwords do you mean that he helped them crack their their private keys like if they'd lost them or what do you what does that mean i'm sorry yeah uh private keys oh my gosh okay i i think that's yeah extremely which is very very difficult wow okay i okay i did i didn't i'm not even sure if i knew that was possible but um all right so yeah so tell me um you know how you what your conversation was like and and how you approached it like before you went kind of you know what were you thinking about how you should conduct this interview to extract a confession yeah yeah that would have been the best um what i did here is what the same thing i did with the man in zurich i i talked to the person beforehand while i was still in the united states i set up a phone call said how i'm writing a book about ethereum i'd love to talk to you about it and so you know kind of like get the ball rolling and say oh you know and then i'm going to be in tokyo you know i'd love to meet you um so that's how we met uh he didn't know at that point what i wanted to ask about but i knew that i had to have an in-person meeting with him otherwise you know you start asking questions like this over the phone and they're going to hang up on you so it's just a way of getting in front of people and showing them what you have and getting their side of the story so that's how i did that and then i so i arrived in tokyo and uh i was nervous i wasn't as nervous as when i interviewed the man in zurich because you know that was the first time and i didn't know how it was going to go so i'd kind of been through it already a little bit um and and i felt like this time in tokyo i had better evidence and i was a little more confident so we we sat down and spoke for over an hour on the record um he allowed me to record it and i so i started you know going through it and i said i want to show you something about the dow and so i started with the encrypted message and i showed it to him and i said did you send this and he looked at it and laughed and he said no i don't think i sent that and i said okay and i had like ether scan records up on the computer i said i want to show you what i think happened here and i showed him this is where the encrypted message is and here's how i link this back to shapeshift and went through the whole thing with him and said you know and i was told that this account at poloniex belongs to you and is that is that true and we he said you know he couldn't remember the addresses which is fine i you know who can remember an ethereum wallet you know four years later it's like i you know it's just a string of random characters and numbers so that didn't surprise me but so when when we got to the poloniex part you know he said eventually i asked him if other people had access to his account and he said yes that they did that and that was because he was acting as a broker for people who weren't able um to buy and invest in crypto for themselves so tomoaki would do it for them and he used poloniex to do that and he told me that he had given them access to that poloniex account because it was their money so i you know it's like in the book i say if you had a charles schwab account and didn't have access to your money you know you wouldn't do that you want to have access you want to be able to withdraw it shut it down do whatever you want so that made sense to me and and so we went back and forth and and i said well you know eventually i said could could somebody else have made these withdrawals and sent the money to shapeshift and he said yeah that's that's possible and i said well do you think you know that did you know that they were doing this and he said maybe and we went on and i said okay well so i just want to make really clear here it's what you're saying to me is it's possible that somebody made these withdrawals from your paloniks account to shape shift without your knowledge and then they could have taken you know transferred that money over on the blockchain and launched this attack and he said yeah it's possible and i said well how how can somebody who doesn't even know how to buy crypto launch a dow attack it's very complicated right it's an obvious question and he said well the person i was brokering for didn't know how to do this but they had a friend who did and i said okay so it's possible that this friend of the person you were doing this for could have done this and he said yeah it's possible and then at the very end he said you know this attack it's actually not that difficult and that was almost where we left the conversation um which you know as you know probably and this attack is very difficult it's it's a very elegant um hard thing to know how to do at this point i guess i would say i think it was a copycat so the attack contract was out there anybody who knew what they were doing could grab it cut and paste it and launch it again but you know i think it's it's interesting that he said that this attack is not that difficult so then i left tokyo and came back to the us and i wasn't really sure what i had um it sort of felt it felt odd to me that he never denied you know being involved he didn't deny it was his poloniex account i was you know kind of linking him to a pretty major hack and um it never he never pushed back he never got angry and then so when i came back to the states i emailed and i said hey just to back up your story can you show me you know like login records that like maybe this other person would have a different ip address and your your polo account should show that and can you show me your withdrawal you know uh history at that time of that you know that sunday and monday right up before the attack to to sort of like you know i want to believe you but just show me show me what you you know can you back it up with some other evidence and he uh checked and he had closed his polo account in 2018 so he couldn't couldn't send anything like that to me uh shape-shift at the time didn't keep records um on anybody's identity uh only the transaction records so that was a dead end and you know i emailed him many times and said this is you know this is what i'm planning to report and to say i want to make sure you're aware of it and you know now is your chance to say you know i misspoke uh no that's not what happened you know i i gave him several opportunities to do that as i always do um when i'm doing this kind of thing and he didn't respond to any of those so i as i said i laid it out as straight as i could in the book and i really want to leave it up to readers to make up their own mind um i think it's i'm happy with it that i'm pushing the ball forward here as much as i can um and you know it was it was a fun exciting thing to do um and i think i hope people think it makes the book more interesting yeah one thing i realized um is maybe important context for people who are newer to the space and less familiar with some of these exchanges is that that sequence of events going from polo to shapeshift and then after that doing the attack the shape-shift stop is a way of um doing an exchange of tokens crypto crypto to crypto exchange without having that being attached to your identity because as you mentioned shape-shift didn't take identifying information so um and that was a behavior that the original demo attacker had also used where they had taken um you know i think it was bitcoin from an exchange converted it to ether via shape shift and then after that um commence the attack so yeah yeah lots of mixers were used and yeah definitely very common thing and one other thing i wanted to say about his comment about how it wasn't that difficult is that because it was a copycat attack you're right that um like one way to interpret his comment is that it was known i mean in fact the vulnerability was known even before the attack it's just that the way that this one was conducted used like combining basically the vulnerability across two different contracts to to exploit it um so that was maybe the tricky part but regardless it was something that had been discussed before and then you know by that point it was known how it was it was being done so i mean did you think that that was what he was saying like it wasn't that hard because everybody knew how how the attack was um how to create such an attack um no i i took it as you know he was saying like that i just i took it at face value that this wasn't that big a deal and that's that's how i read it and that's what i still think um to this day and i think another point is there were a lot of vulnerabilities um that had been identified in the dow but the actual exact spot where you needed to attack it had not been made public by anybody until the friday hack exploited it um eamon gunsire and phil dyan at cornell they had they had found it but they didn't tell anybody about it um and then it was too late so it's also this didn't get in the book but i thought you know this is really interesting to me when i was like triple checking this um i had some people help me and we looked at the attack contract on friday uh and and that that attack and it's it's clean it's like really well done it's it's you know and then we looked at the tuesday attack and it's like all over the place it's got all these line breaks and it's like sloppy and it was that's another reason why i think you know this was a copy cat and uh so i i just thought that that's really cool that you know that the even the code looks different you know it's like the person you showed like when i first we were doing this they're like oh god look at this code is terrible you know aesthetically it was just like really like it really bothered this person that you know the lines are going over and it's just like it looked like if a writer didn't know how to use a tab function and the page was just all over the place so i thought that you know that was just fascinating to me and it's also just another point that is so fascinating is all of this is still out there it's all in the public record and you know the things that you can find in the blockchain space like it never forgets anything so i i find that one of the more amazing parts of this new um this new field and did you look into any of to milwaukee's business associates to see if there were any people who seemed plausible as the person who he could have been dealing with who had access to the account who could have perpetrated the attack no um i did a little bit of research but um you know it it it wasn't very fruitful um and the way i understood it from him it's like this wasn't necessarily a business contact it was just somebody he was you know doing this for um in one one point uh i think one of the quotes he gave you know he said to me was that uh this person who he was brokering for couldn't do it in the in their local area and and i so afterwards i i thought about that and reading between the lines maybe they were in a part of asia where crypto was being you know suppressed or you know total wild speculation north korea is a tough place to do crypto right so if i'm i'm just making that up but i think parts of china you know yeah there were more likely yeah yeah there are places where you know you can't really get online to do that so i i feel like it maybe wasn't necessarily that this person didn't know how to do it it's that they were excluded because of where they lived from doing it and if that's the case then it could be somebody who's very good at this but you know is hindered because of that issue yeah and that's how i read that part of your book that it was uh it had to do with some kind of jurisdictional issue um so one other thing is that at the end of your book as ethereum classic emerges you write quote some of the etc ethereum classic supporters were bad people but i never planned to write about this part of the story anyway from the outset i wanted to stop after the hard fork why was that your intended stopping point um i think i've because that is a whole new era in my opinion in ether in ethereum excuse me the ico craze had already started and it obviously got going really um in 2017 and so i knew that i was going to be you know picking up the story from vitalik you know in 2013 and and i went even back further in his life and wrote about his upbringing and his high school and you know so i knew i was going to have a lot of years to cover and i wanted to cover them in detail and so i i felt like that was a natural stopping point because i feel like that's the next point where somebody could write a whole new book on that chapter that started with the ethereum classic and then went on to the ico craze and bitcoin hitting 20 000 and you know ether going to 1200 um and then here we are you know with the three years later like the d5 you know stuff is a direct you can draw a direct line from that to now so i and i also like getting into the ethereum classic and stuff it's it's complicated yeah you know i i like complicated things but that it gets really complicated and then you're also you don't have an ether scan for ether classic you know you don't have the tools that are are there like the ethereum community has created all these amazing tools to to to keep track of things and to investigate and so uh i just knew it would be even harder to do any work um you know on that chain and and so for those reasons i felt like that's that's where i wanted to stop and you did also say that you felt that was a whole other story to tell and a whole other book and um you said you know you're not going to include that story but i was curious do you want to hint as to what happened there uh with you know ether classic coming on the scene you mean why i said there were bad people involved yeah yeah i'm i'm i'm now paraphrasing the rest of that quotation but you were talking about the early months of either classic and you were saying that's like almost a whole other book yeah um well so many different people who i knew on the dev side uh are still like seriously traumatized by that at like that period um i i think there were uh like one person i know like i think you know was battling with suicidal thoughts and and people were coming after the so the robin hood group you know had helped fix like take care of the dao issue that group changed into the white hat group um that went forward and and was some of the members were different and the white hat group was sort of involved with when ether classic came on the scene because you know they had all they now suddenly they had all this ether classic um on their hands and they didn't know what to do with it and and i you know i think there were threats being made i think that there might have been some major criminal elements involved um throughout the world and you know when i talk to some of the guys about this they they get really upset and um so it just struck me that you know these guys have been doing this for free for months and they were exhausted and then they had this whole new problem on their hands and people were like coming after them coming after their families legally threatening them and doing other things you know that you'd probably just nobody would want to go through and so so that that's what's sort of informing me on that point and what would you say overall the significance of the dow and the hard fork has been for ethereum i think um a big lesson was that there should have been a cap on the dow it shouldn't been have been allowed to just you know to pull in 150 million and then go to 250 million when ether went up in price i think that was a mistake i think there should have been a sort of emergency break or some sort of you know way of stopping what was going on um when a pro this you know a problem was you know came came out uh they certainly knew that there were a lot of bugs many different people had gone through and found different problems with it but nobody was you know willing to say well we should we should not do this we should take a break there were calls for that but i mean what i mean is that the community wasn't willing to go along with it i think that that comes down to everybody had money in the dow you know it like everybody uh it was the only thing really going at that point for ethereum and so i think that those those are the lessons unfortunately i don't think they're being heated very well uh you could see in the d5 moment we're in right now um projects like yam are collecting over 100 million dollars in mere hours and that had no audit you know and so it's it's crazy space you know your people are going to do what they want to do and the thing of the reason why is because that's what vitalik wanted you know his original idea was i want to give people a platform for creating whatever they want to create and on you know using this system of distributed global computers and so when that's the the goal of the you know and the reason for it you know you're gonna get everybody on the spectrum from doing really well audited and you know security wise uh projects um to people just throwing stuff you know cutting and pasting basically forking uniswap um you know to all these things and so that's just people in this space have to make peace with that because i think that's that's that's just what it is you also talk a little bit in your book about corporate adoption of ethereum and here now you've been talking about how d5 is also taking off on ethereum in general where do you expect ethereum's next chapter to go and what are you looking for as this plays out i think if if we're following the 2017 script um there's going to be a big boom and bust here with d5 projects we've already seen a few people are going to get hurt people are going to lose a lot of money but what's going to come out of that is a whole new sort of lego piece to this environment that is is now going to work and even though like there were bad actors and people you know got greedy it's like it's going to be i think the lending and the um collateralization part of this ecosystem is gonna is gonna be battle tested and be ready to to go forward kind of like the fundraising piece was battle tested and and shown to work in the ico boom even though you know the vast majority of those projects were scams but it showed that now for the first time people can raise money directly from their users that's an amazing advance in how people can can raise capital here we're seeing really interesting um developments with lending and and you know earning interest and and incentives to you know lend people your crypto of course nobody should think that a thousand percent api is ever sustainable but you know for maybe two hours it is um so good luck getting in and out of that but what i find fascinating is i think that these you know people are building and you know it's it's a kind of a cliche but people kept building through the long bear market after the ico craze and then here we are and we have a whole new chapter in in eth so i i feel like it seems like that's how really important pieces of this ecosystem are are getting created for your coverage going forward do you expect to stay focused on ethereum in particular or will you branch out because obviously ethereum has these scaling issues although i mean it is transitioning to 2.0 so it's unclear how you know how dominant it will remain but do you expect that you'll stay focused on this one blockchain or cover all of crypto generally well i i think um i think i'll stay focused on ethereum but also if there's an ethic killer as people always say you know that that will get my attention as well i think it's fair to say that so far there isn't really a competitor that doesn't mean there won't be and of course seeing how 2.0 plays out will be really interesting and whether you know that does solve some of the scaling issues and and i think uh you know i'll also be covering like the things like metamask going mobile and and now having a browser so people can you know start interacting web 3.0 stuff is fascinating and i think has the potential to really start driving some crazy disruption and innovation um when all like that's another piece of the puzzle here and something i wrote about for bloomberg a couple weeks ago was you know the uh another promise of ethereum was that and we didn't get into this but i think it's really important it's to help people get their privacy back online and to have control over their data and to you know be in charge of what they do and who sees what that's been completely lost in web 2.0 and it's pretty much by design because there wasn't um a payment method involve embedded in the web so data now became the currency and your data about where you're clicking and shopping and all that became really valuable and is why you know the web experience is so terrible and so i i'm hopeful that a lot of really good youth devs are working on this stuff all the time too to make that new sort of web where uh users have much more choice and and privacy uh becomes a reality and you gave a few hints about this in your book and so i just wanted to ask um you know crypto journalistic crypto journalists but in general how would you say covering crypto is different from covering other industries it it's very different from wall street um it's uh you know i think it's very it's much more idealistic in a lot of ways much more naive in in some ways and i think those go together uh in a lot of cases uh i think people in crypto tend to be much nicer um and and kind of like have them usually have a more interesting background than some of the people i've known on wall street over the years um there are definitely some great people on wall street but uh and i who i know and have known but they're in the minority and i would say in crypto it's the flip side of that there are a lot of great people and then there are some terrible people but you know i'd say not 80 to 90 of the people i've gotten to know um in crypto are great people and they're they're very helpful and you know uh especially to a reporter who you know i need to ask a lot of dumb questions to try to figure stuff out uh you know it's nice and and and they're they're open and you don't have to jump through the hoops of you know going trying to go you know try to go get a quote out of jpmorgan you know it's going to take you a week of pr emails and stuff and so it's uh that's very refreshing to me um the pace of it is also just off the charts as you know i mean it puts wall street to shame um they have like a an annual year about every three weeks i would agree with that um so i saw you tweeted we're also doing a blockchain linked special edition of the book that'll prove the rarity of 1000 copies with an amazing new startup can you tell us about that yeah yeah this is really cool um so luxo is the the blockchain it's uh started by marjorie hernandez and fabian vogelsetter fabian was one of the core devs um on ethereum and they've they've created a new blockchain that's it's basically based on ethereum smart contract and what they are doing is um their one of their first appeals is to the fashion industry where you want to be able to prove that your gucci handbag is real and not a fake right so you can register it on a blockchain and you can then point you know if you want to sell it or you just want to show somebody that no i didn't buy this you know on hudson street um it's actually a twenty thousand dollar handbag you know it it's it's that's the price you know okay and and sometimes they even they're using chips um you know to do that but the blockchain you know is great for that because it has an immutable record um and so what we thought with the book is um you know i played around with like an nft kind of idea but that doesn't seem to really work with a book um but we're going to be making a special edition uh it's going to have a new cover and then there's going to be a qr code on the back and that's going to be the public key and then inside the book if people who order this they'll be a note card with your private key so that you can now register your book online or on the sorry on the luxo blockchain and you know it'll probably have a number and then you know it's it's yours and it's kind of cool or you know you can go and sell it if you want and so we just i was really there's so many great things in this industry to to you like to to get involved with and to to kind of you know prove that this is interesting to with a book so that that we messed around with a lot of ideas but this is where we landed and um so i'm hoping to have that you know in a couple of months so it's going to be i'm really excited about that and will you sign that or is the special edition part of it the key on the back yeah so you're going to sign it with the private key that's in the book itself so everyone is i think they're gonna and we're still working this out so i apologize if i screw it up but the qr code is going to have to be the same for every thousand but that's like the that'll take you to the block alexa blockchain and then you'll have a private key that i'm gonna make and an ad you know put into the book for you to then link up and say okay now i'm signing you know this transaction proving that this is my special edition number 55 or whatever oh i see yeah and then and then if they want to trade it then they have to physically mail the copy like an ebay type thing yeah i guess so yeah um and we're hoping to get some of the co-founders to sign a few of these and auction them off for charity you know and have like do stuff like that just just have fun with it so the i'm hoping that's uh going to be ready in a couple of months like i said cool i'm filing this away for my book i'm like hmm i i should think of something fun blockchain related guinea pig okay great thank you for for signing on um and is there anything i didn't ask you about the book that you wanted to say before we go well i i you know i don't want to leave the impression that it's just about the dao i think there's way more than that in the book and um one thing that i liked um that i didn't necessarily set out to do but that i think came across well is i i think i got a really nice picture of italic uh and and his life and where he came from and uh you know i think obviously people know a lot about him but i think there's a lot that they don't know and so um there's that aspect to it um that i was really happy with and um you know it's there's a like the dow if you buy this thinking it's just about the dow you're going to be disappointed it's it's in there but it's definitely not the majority of the book and when you say um you know his backstory what how would you say he changes over the course of the book well i think i was what i liked is that i thought i was able to um or it seemed to me that i was able to show him from a lot of different sides i was able to show him when he was vulnerable when he was cocky when he was um you know being whimsical um you know he shared emails with me that he was riding home as as he was going um on his journeys through europe in 2013 when he was coming up with the idea for ethereum uh i got it i got some of he wrote this amazing thing when he was seven called the encyclopedia of bunnies uh i've got several entries in there and they're just hilarious and i think enough like that really opened him up to me as a person that you knew you know he's brilliant but then you see this whimsical funny side to him and that you know a seven-year-old is writing this 20-page document all about bunnies and all these different entries on like you know how many men and women bunnies are there and you know there's these jokes and you know i don't want to give them away but you know i just i found that um really great and you know as a writer you want to try to get people and make them into rounded real people and i think over the course of the book uh i i was happy with how that came out yeah i have to make one comment here because um one thing about reading your book for me was like oh oh since matt revealed all these things now people will think i got them from his book even though i had them for my book but it's okay it's okay people it's all right sorry sorry about that all right well where can people learn more about you and out of the ether i'm on twitter it's just at matt lysing um i'm on bloomberg you know you can find me on the web and out of the ether is you can pre-order it now it's uh it's gonna be out i think next week or the week after and so
