with the code Laura Link in the description today's guests are Jake bruckman founder and CEO of coin fund and Chris Perkins president of coin fund welcome Chris and Jake hi Laura thank you for having us you recently closed your 158 million dollar seed for round given the year we had in 2022 and being in this sort of post FTX post gazillion crypto bankruptcy's world what was it like trying to raise during this period and how did it compare to previous races I definitely think that throughout um 22 and into 23 the fundraising environment for institutional investors who are looking at crypto managers has been extremely challenging right so in the beginning of the year you had the crash of Luna and blockify and 3ac um you had kind of a bear Market um throughout the year with public market prices dropping and eventually toward the end of the year private market prices catching up and dropping as well and then of course in November you had this catastrophic FTX scenario that we all you know live through as an industry and what Chris and I are so proud of on behalf of our team is that throughout that period we managed to raise about 550 million bucks um this is really a testament to first of all the professionalization that coin fund has been uh going through over the last couple years a testament to our IR team who has built institutional relationships over the last number of years that led up to being able to engage larger institutions this way and close them uh and also a little bit of the strategy of what products we're kind of offering and how uh what we're offering them so we're extremely proud to be well capitalized and really bullish on crypto even though the market right now is somewhat uncertain somewhat sideways a lot of the regulation Lawrence as you know very well is being figured out in real time but we are more aligned than ever to support and Champion our portfolio companies what do you think Chris yeah we're going on our ninth year as a crypto native firm and I think that's a pretty cool accomplishment and we also wanted to again thank our team if you look at our previous vintage uh C3 that was 83 million dollars and and with this raise we actually approached our caps uh you don't want to have a humongous uh pre-seed seed fund where your asset Gathering so you know we like to stay precise in our investments and and yeah we we calibrated right to the cap so very very proud of the team and again people like Jake the team is this is not our first rodeo been through many many cycles and um it's not a bad time when you're hitting a cyclical bottom um to do what we're doing and did investors seem more skittish at all because of the bankruptcies and you know um Jake I think you called the FTX thing a scenario and I was like well that's one way to put it but obviously you know I sort of made off level alleged fraud is um a huge black eye for the industry so how did that come up in conversations if at all yeah I mean I would say it absolutely had an impact um you know in the beginning of 22 I think a lot of institutional investors took a step back first of all because of Luna in particular and more broadly because of the uh kind of broader macro environment that was impacting not just crypto Investments but really Investments across the board into Venture funds and and technology and so forth and when FTX happened that was really that really took the cake I think I think a lot of institutional investors just stopped writing checks at this point you know we've definitely had some relationships that were uh you know tracking but then upon that event happening you know took a took a significant step back and Laura FTX was a was a debacle but even something as simple as this coinbase lawsuit between them and the SEC this year which actually I see is is almost like a bullish thing for the industry that event alone also uh has tempered some investment in you know at the present time wait I'm sorry you said that you view the lawsuit by the SEC against coinbase as bullish for the industry well yeah I think in the wake of the Ripple decision what has happened is um the coinbase sort of win has become a little bit more probable uh and hopeful and I think that the coinbase lawsuit goes to you know exactly the core issue that I I'm guessing uh you know the judicial system will help us decide in the case of crypto assets which is whether tokens are securities so let me just chime in Jake I think it's pretty clear that the industry is maturing and the companies that are able to navigate the stress that we've experienced they've built really strong foundations and they're emerging out of this much stronger you know I I do agree with Jake that the coinbase case is ultimately going to be resulting in a net positive for the industry because we're marching on a road path to Clarity no matter what and people like coin funds we've always been supportive of Regulation we've been supportive of principles-based Regulation and what we're seeing now is that look massive amount of things happening in Congress right now there are some major questions there are some major questions and how this should be regulated coinbase makes that case very clear um and either way whether we go through the courts whether we go through what we'd prefer frankly which is the legislative outcome we're going to get some clarity we're hopeful that his principles principled and nuanced but all we want to do is to take this black cloud away from our entrepreneurs and allow them to do what they do best which is build and so whether it takes a couple of years and we get that Clarity in the court or if our Congress jumps into action by the way great episode with uh uh Congressman Torres yesterday I thought he he articulated it very thoughtfully uh we literally released that like four hours ago so I'm so impressed that you already listened to that well Laura Chris is is often modest but he does a tremendous job on on behalf of coin fund keeping up to date you know with the latest in in Washington with all of these interviews like the Torres one we just alluded to um and also testifying at the cftc and sitting in some of their committees thanks Jake so one thing is I I think both of you kind of said that you felt um coinbase having a decision in coinbase would be positive um and I feel like Chris you might have said even if it's you know even if it goes against coinbase simply because it will bring Clarity is that so like even if it's a decision against coinbase you feel like that will still be helpful I think there's a lot of nuance and and we're going to go on a really interesting Winding Road and frankly we do have a generational divide amongst many of our policy makers we still believe that Embrace of crypto is and can be and will be bipartisan it's more generational and so you know we're we feel good about the direction of travel with coinbase we also also feel good about the direction of travel with legislation I think the point is is that time is on our side and we do feel comfortable that we're going to end up in a decent place ah you mean time is on our is on your side simply because it's taken so long that finally something has to happen well when you're dealing with a generational divide the generation that understands the nuance and the opportunity of web3 you know is will eventually be in power by the laws of nature and and uh again we're pretty confident we're going to be in a good place yeah yeah that's what Congressman Torres said basically so as you know we've been discussing like obviously you did this raise and it's kind of a historic time in crypto like this post-22 post post yeah 22 post ftx's definitely a sort of unusual time in crypto um so just when you look at the long Arc of crypto development where would you say um the industry and the technology are right now in terms of adoption and then when you think about that how does that influence how you'll be deploying these funds you've just raised yeah thanks Laura um I mean I think I remember mining ethereum in 2015 and thinking like oh man well you know we're just starting the network now but in 2016 we're gonna have so many apps uh go and go into market and now our estimate is more like 2026 right so there's like a 10-year delay there between truly going to Market but I think what we've seen is definitely that there's become a lot more consumer technology that Founders are building and more sophisticated Founders that have come in especially over the last two two and a half years from web to to build some of these go to markets and examples of that in our portfolio and I would say we probably invest in like 10 to 20 of our portfolios is looking at kind of consumer but mostly that's been gaming related to nfts it's been sort of SAS software such as kind of analytics platforms that surface blockchain data and probably also a couple of go to markets that are trying to bring D5 or nfts those kind of core value propositions to the market in a way that like normal people uh can use them and of course onboarding tools as well so I would say there's definitely been an increase in sort of consumer um focus in the space but have we seen this incredible killer app that everybody wants to use I don't think we've seen that and I invite us to think about like I tweeted this the other day like think about chat GPT this is an application that has some very interesting properties number one you can use it in a second number two you could explain the value proposition uh in a second and number three everybody wants to try it right like it's AI it's like the new cool thing and so I would I would offer that like we don't have any web3 app that has those three properties at the same time we've made apps that are easy to onboard onto and we might have even made apps that people want to try uh but like you know we really need kind of all three of those things you know to create to create that kind of growth so what do I think those apps might be in the future well I think Laura honestly it's probably the things that we always suspected all along I think we can create and Brian Armstrong tweeted about this the other day it's very very cheap payments globally you know using blockchains and that should be something that everybody wants to use because moving money these days is is not uh exactly cheap it's expensive uh relative to the state of our technology um and the other big use case that I've been thinking about especially this week as one of our portfolio companies worldcoin has launched officially and globally on Monday is this idea of just Global uh decentralized identity of which World coin I think could be a really interesting foundation and so there's a lot of initiatives on on that side uh of the space and there's a lot of applications uh like Global Ubi that could be incredibly impactful uh for the world so I I think um both of those areas are kind of what we've always talked about in in crypto as uh as being very disruptive and it they're actually starting to come to market now and I do want to ask you of course a ton about world coin but I do want to um just quickly ask you also I mean the ability to do cheap blockchain payments has been around since you know 2009 um so why is it that you think that use case still hasn't taken off well I was going to just jump on what you said Jake and I think I love the way you talked about foundational infrastructure building now next phase is going to be applications but and this is related to your question Laura institutional adoption is another major theme that I think we're going to see in the next cycle and you know people have been debating it oh the institutions are here oh they're coming or they're never coming but what's happening now is during the bear cycle the institutions have their teams their their blockchain sometimes it's a DLT team and during bull markets they would kind of the light bulb would go on and they'd jump over to the crypto space because you know that they realized it was happening I think during the bear the institutions were building as well and now these teams have stayed together so we're starting to see more outputs from there uh I sit on the cftc's global markets advisory committee and we met a couple weeks ago half the day was focused on tokenization and this whole influx of tokenization that we're going to see stable coins in my mind are the first you know real use case that's a cheap product Market fit for payments right and you know what we think is going to happen is that you're going to see additional focus on on stable quiz and look we just had a bill that's that came out of committee yesterday as you get more regulatory Clarity then you'll see greater institutional adoption which I think will then facilitate you know more adoption the tokenized FX markets are fascinating FX trades 7.5 trillion dollars a day and to date we only really have USD stable coins I think 99.5 percent of stable coins or dollars and so that's another theme that I think will also allow for payments as as additional regulation crystallizes and this tokenization um theme really takes hold yeah yeah which totally makes sense because you know Everyday People in non-us dollar economies um if they want to transact even if it is an American sending them money they will want to receive it in Euros or whatever their local currency is so all right so let's chat about world coin obviously this is what everybody's been talking about this week and I'm sure you're well aware real queen has faced quite a bit of criticism from the community um before we dive into all that um you started to talk a little bit about this but why don't you fill in more about what it was about world coin or this problem that you saw you know with proof of personhood um that made you decide that this was the project you were going to invest in absolutely so you know in I believe it was in 2020 that we were really attracted to World coins large global vision and really web free focused technology and kind intuitively values at the end of the day Laura I think worldcoin solves just an absolutely key problem in decentralization technology that problem is of course civil resistance or in plain language being able to assign you know to one address the certification that that address belongs to a single human and just to take us through you know a few use cases of of what that implies well first of all yeah it has profound implications for decentralized governance and voting systems most voting systems in in blockchain have been um token weighted systems um they've been plutocratic they've not always been Fair they've been um kind of compromised by whales at times and having a proof of humanity uh will guarantee a one person one vote uh voting system so you'll enable systems that are like very very democratic you could create one of the central ideas of worldcoin is that if you can create a distribution of a digital asset that's extremely wide you know you can basically build a cryptocurrency that's bigger and more valuable than Bitcoin because you know we believe at the end of the day Bitcoin holds its value because of global consensus around the fact that it is a you know kind of digital gold commodity kind of asset with World coin we think we can um and we wrote you know our analyst Austin Barrack wrote about this in our thesis that we published on our blog you know at some point we can get to a billion users we think in World coin um and and that would probably make it more more widely distributed at Bitcoin using this platform you could create things like Fair token distributions Fair air drops um I think it's a very interesting basis for you know reputation systems and identity in general identity can't really be one thing it's got to be uh segmented across you know many different areas um but it's really interesting to have one digital basis in those segmented identities that is a public good that is a this you know lives on a decentralized uh Network one kind of pet use case that I love to think about is guys it's actually not that hard to solve the bot problem on Twitter or x.com as it's called these days all you got to do is you you have to verify that the users are humans and and that's the technology that worldcoin offers and finally there's a reason why Sam Altman is actually kind of the originator of the world coin idea coming from you know his work at open Ai and in the AI world and he hasn't said exactly you know specifically what he what he sees the intersection there to be but but I can tell you what I think which is that I believe Sam is thinking about world coin IDs as a way to govern AI in a democratic manner over the long term and that's a incredibly futuristic and interesting use case so for all of those reasons we just thought and the fact that the team is absolutely first class and fantastic and has built a technological device that is an absolutely new uh technology in the world these are all the reasons why we think this is going to be a huge you know a huge success and just to um draw what you were saying there you you were referring to how um when you talked about using worldcoin to govern an AI you were talking about this concept people have been discussing a lot which is like using endowed to govern uh the development of these AIS is that what you're saying absolutely yeah and that could mean um governance over the data sets that are being used to train the AIS like giving people the ability to opt in or opt out with their content or whether it's being used it could mean trust and safety issues around AI like what kind of like what are the limitations of a of a public AI that that want to be observed in a particular situation maybe it's in a kindergarten maybe it's in a in a government building maybe it's a public one maybe it's a private one but all those things need you know cut custom governance depending turning on the context that they're in um and and the thing that really excites me about uh kind of decentralized governance in general Laura is just that um we're going to have a new class of public goods that we're going to be able to democratically govern and that's those goods will be provided by blockchains not by governments that's the really disruptive thing here this is a team that's solving a real problem right and and Jake articulated perfectly it's the Civil resistance challenge that we face and we need it to be solved to move this industry forward and as I think about my web 2 life I think about people that use clear or use their apple face ID as you start really unpacking and understanding how the team the culture of the team uh the focus on privacy uh and and what they're trying to solve it makes a ton of sense so I'm sure you know that French and Bavarian data protection Regulators are probing World coin for quote questionable practices there's a UK regulator that's issued a warning you know when you say they have a focus on privacy like a lot of people really are concerned about the fact that you know worldcoin is getting not only just certain people but like kind of vulnerable populations you know these people in developing countries where um you know they're not from even like a wealthy part of the developing country they're from a place where a financial incentive could get them to do something that and I'm not saying that this is World coin but just like generally a financial incentive could get them to do things that maybe are not in their best interest otherwise and so I wondered what your response is to these uh critics who you know are questioning why it is that world coin yeah has been getting people to give them their biometric data for money well listen Laura this is I'm so glad you asked this this is obviously like a huge um issue that a lot of people have brought up and it's a big topic and so I want to try to address you know as much of this as I can one thing to say is like one of the best articles to read on this is actually vitalik buteran's most recent article which is called what do I really think about biometric proof of personhood and in that article he he does this incredibly scientific and thoughtful and dispassionate analysis of all the different proof of personhood systems that exist and if you read the article the conclusion that he actually comes to is that among the different solutions biometric based proof of personhood is actually the most privacy preserving Solutions assuming that it's architected that way right and um like to me while we should be asking those questions and having those concerns there's also a reality around how worldcoin is actually implemented actually architected and I can tell you that if you if you look at those facts it is going to be one of the most privacy preserving and web 3 values compatible proof of personhood systems that are out there now vitalik is also Eyes Wide Open that there are centralization risks here there's for example proprietary hardware and that's currently being manufactured by kind of a more centralized organization um but the one of the minigants to that is that the world coin team have committed um you know essentially to open sourcing everything that they're doing they're going through a process of progressive decentralization of the network of the protocol and eventually of the hardware as well which is a huge Challenge and we're very eyes wide open that like almost nobody has has done that before and there's a variety of issues to solve there um but you know on a practical level when you use this device your biometric data is not stored and is not sent somewhere it you know does not leave the device it gets erased the only thing that leaves the device is a hash um you know the iris code now what's so interesting is that the you know when you actually go to pay you know with your world world coin uh wallet and you want to provide a proof of unique personhood you're not even actually sending the public Key Of Your World ID the one that's generated from your iris code you're sending a zero knowledge proof of the fact that you have a world ID and it's you know in that set of unique humans but you're not even saying like which one and so you know if you start to look at the actual reality of privacy and worldcoin you start to realize this is the most web three compatible uh proof of personhood that's really out there because the next thing of similar strength is kind of like AML kyc that you do with a proof of authority and then on kind of the go to market to maybe yeah I know that worldcoin spent a few years kind of going out to developing countries as as a go to market and some people have raised issues with that I mean my position on that is of course like we deeply care about the fact that we don't want those types of strategies to be abused then there's always going to be people attacking the system so um world point is constantly evaluating those strategies I think and you know on this particular Point Laura of having um someone predatory kind of take someone's world ID I think there's actually technological solutions to them and again vitalik writes about this in his post and the basic solution is I think in the future world coin Hardware will be very widely available and if I sell you my world ID let's say I will be able to then go to a world coin device rescan create and create a new world ID invalidating the first one right and so the credibility of being able to sell for a profit uh to third parties these IDs I think we'll we'll go to zero right I don't think people will will buy them but okay I'm maybe uh the way this was translated was uh maybe I you know miscommunicated it but I think for for scanning their irises with the orb they then could receive tokens later or even actually money in their local currency so I'm not talking about them selling their ID I'm talking about them like literally just making money from getting their eyeball scanned right okay why is that a problem oh because these are populations that they have a hard time getting money and so they might just do something for the money without really knowing you know how it could affect them or like thinking carefully about you know what is this that I'm doing that you know I'm giving away my personal biometric information or or you know not giving away I guess as you're describing but still they're they're having their personal personal biometric data scanned in a way that you know they don't know much about world coin like what if it gets hacked what if their biometric data gets out there like they're they're doing something risky that isn't like something that's been battle tested so I I think I understand your question but I but again I disagree that kind of the risky with the risky part perhaps right because again as as we've described the the device takes incredible precaution to preserve privacy so I don't think biometric data like could be stolen in maps and I don't think that that risk is actually that high if you go back to web three first principles I think that's one of the beautiful things of what we're trying to enable here and that's access to financial services for the unbanked um so again I guess I would push back as well Jake on saying you know paying people uh for something that they voluntarily do I think it's important that we provide the right disclosures across the board um but again you know based on the Privacy that that we expect to be achieved here you know I don't think it's a terrible thing I just want to clarify is your question are you saying that like there's like a third party that goes to a person and says you know I'm gonna pay you thirty dollars you're going to give me an eye scan and then subsequently like takes their airdrop which might be worth more than thirty dollars no no I'm just saying like like did you read that MIT technology review article and then it starts with yeah like the Indonesian guy you know he shows up and there's like a line of people that have been there since like early in the morning I highly doubt that they like really understood what was going on I think it was like oh we can get money for doing this thing you know I like I used to live in Indonesia too you know there it's definitely a super different place they're probably richer and happiness in Americans but you know it's not like New York city so I just feel like when you throw in that kind of incentive people I don't know if they're necessarily fully educated about what's going on I think they're just like oh like this company is going to give us money I think that's a really valid point and I and I and to be honest I think like most of crypto is still unknown to like most of the world right there's a huge education challenge not just with you know World coin systems but with how blockchains and cryptocurrencies work in general um and you know I do think that digital assets are volatile and we're gonna you know we're gonna see how um some of these air drops and Ubi performs and like other visual assets are likely to be volatile so we'll have to find ways of mitigating those problems too right but if we if we're not able to deploy the infrastructure for this and like run those experiments make those learnings and create better systems then I don't know how else we can you know we can make these impactful changes yeah I know I I think you get where I'm going though it's like okay experimenting on these people who may not really fully understand that they're the guinea pigs of this experiment but anyway so in a moment we're gonna uh go through a few more tough questions around worldcoin but first quick word from

today back to my conversation with Chris and Jake so the other thing that I'm sure you guys have heard about is the Sam coin aspect of the distribution of the world coin token which is as far as I understand I think I did the math right on this there's about five percent that was issued and if you look at kind of the amount issued versus the fully diluted value it's just really uh insanely skewed how or why you know did the world coin team and I I don't know how much you guys were involved but I wondered how you guys came up with that model and why you felt that that was the right way to Launch well yeah this is you know this is really a question best directed to the world coin team Laura and you know like we weren't directly involved in in those designs but I mean as investors that hold the coin you guys didn't have any input or I mean we had General input but we didn't design design the thing so I would say there's a few things to say here this the the intention of worldcoin is to become as I said previously one of the widest distribute distributed digital assets right so what you're kind of referring to um you know is the issue of a smaller flow that I think starts to become resolved as more and more people kind of enter the system there are some people who have argued that I think there was a someone who argued that a 20 hold back was you know incredibly large I actually disagree with that I have over a hundred and five uh you know Venture portfolio companies and I know what the averages are in terms of holding back uh digital assets for investors and I could tell you that 20 is very very average um they're definitely companies that have had less I think um live peer had a 10 or so team holdback there are companies that had significantly more like over 50 hold back I don't think 20 is you know it is kind of as tough as as some people are are saying yeah I don't think people are just feeding that so much as the uh the current circulating Supply as I said I think the current circulating Supply is you know that shoot becomes mitigated as the as the currency becomes more widely distributed um and Laura remember there's also kind of this periodic payment or Ubi aspect to the currency and so that actually continuously gets mitigated over time uh you know as multiple uh payments kind of make it out of the market where in the first week of the launch okay okay but yeah I still um think it probably inflates the price of the coin from the get-go um all right switching topics I know you know as you said you guys weren't directly involved in that um so you are um about to launch uh what you're calling cesr the composite ether staking rate and you're doing this in conjunction with coindesk indices explain what that uh staking rate is why having a benchmark staking right is important and what you think uh will be built using that thank you so much for the question so cesr uh we call it Caesar if you think about Finance Global Finance um interest rates form the backbone they form the Cornerstone of of global Finance right and you think about Legacy rates things like Libor uh now sofa or fed funds there are trillions and trillions of dollars of financial products that are built on top of these these Cornerstone rates if you look at Libor there were some problems with it right it was very much like web 2 it was centrally controlled it was manipulated and it was designed you know rather poorly but what happened was when we looked at ethereum and this goes back to last year August as it transitioned from proof of work to proof of stake uh we start like we had this Epiphany and we're like oh my gosh the risk-free rate for ethereum was just born and so how do you think about that you look at the 700 and you know 700 plus thousand validators and if you look at the returns that they receive every single day and you annualize it that's your risk for like we don't like to say risk-free rate but that's your benchmark rate for ethereum right um and there's two components to it there is uh the emissions the inflationary emissions that come out and then all of those transaction fees and so we came up with this concept and then we started watching it and it was fascinating why because when FTX happened people freaked out we have this issue with counterparty risk they moved all their many of their assets on chain and we saw Caesar Spike because those transaction fees went up we saw another instance of it spiking with svb with Silicon Valley Bank again counterparty risk concerns people are you know like oh my gosh I gotta I gotta protect my assets I got to move them on chain Caesar spiked but the the largest observation that we've had was during Pepe when there was so much trading activity transaction fees went up and it spiked now like what do you do with this thing why is it so important they're really two different applications and and and and ways that you can utilize it and utility is always something that we think about first as a benchmark think about how many loans in traditional Finance reference Libor over time we're going to think we expect for a forward curve to be created and that will allow us to to calculate future value present value on a discount curve that allows us to inform valuations of of things denominated in ethereum things like nfts right so you have all these different Benchmark capabilities if you're a professional Staker and I spoke to many of them they're excited like wouldn't it be great to have a benchmark upon what you perform and that's kind of cool is all the benchmarking that you can use it for but what gets us really exciting excited is around um risk transfer right and I come from the derivative space I come from the future space markets are born when you have hedgers and speculators and we think and we're already working with a number of different industry participants on helping them launch a swap product there are very few fixed rates in crypto and what we're able to do now if you're a Staker and you swap the floating rate then I talked about some of the volatility of the rate if you're able to swap that for a fixed rate you can run a much more stable business because you know your income and again like in traditional Finance that's a 500 trillion dollar industry the other thing about it is that it's Global right we don't have different rates for different countries I think over time it's going to compete with traditional rates and you're going to see it being able to form like things we have these things called basis swaps in traditional Finance which is a floating for floating so it'll also be an onboarding capability but bottom line is that this we hope unlocks Next Generation Financial products across ethereum and Beyond it's a huge unlock if if we build social consensus and people use it as a benchmark because like anytime you stand something it can explode I mean look at containerized shipping is something I often talk about I'm an old Naval guy so super excited last thing I'll tell you is that it's very very interesting and accessible to traditional Finance um why they really struggle with crypto and we can talk about all the regulatory Capital things putting crypto on balance sheet is like impossible for them but they know rates they love rates and we think that this is very accessible they're very interested in ethereum yield when you have a synthetic rate like this again as that forward curve evolves super super interesting so we're really excited about uh coindesk indices our partner um and uh yeah I hope hopefully you're going to hear a lot more from this in the future and just to be clear when you were talking about the different types of products that could be developed you're talking about both the entrat fight and in defy I imagine 100 percent we expect for listed products uh to be released on Futures exchanges they're already talking to us um and and so yeah you can use it in it's a convergence product and ultimately like that's part of our core thesis at coins lines we don't think we're gonna have like crypto and Trad five eventually it's just going to come together and this could be a really nice building block that's very acceptable and accessible and to both sides so uh I think from a D5 perspective super interesting I think from a try to find perspective again very accessible all right so now let's also talk about Ai and crypto which is um another one of the hot topics and we started to encroach on that earlier and when we were chatting before this uh someone on your team said ai's everywhere but we believe AI needs crypto crypto doesn't need AI talk a little bit about that well I think I think I mostly agree with that I actually I actually do think we can go in either direction but I one of the reasons I think crypto's most applicable to AI is because AI Laura has a huge trust problem these days I think crypto approaches to me I weren't very popular you know a year a year and a half ago in fact AI people would look at things doing like decentralized AI model training and say this is crazy why would we ever want to do this we actually need all the compute we can get to get the model as large as we can if we decentralize this this is slowing us down but what has happened since then is I think AI has made a huge Splash in the public Consciousness gpt3 came out gpt4 came out Chad GPT came out stability AI launch stable diffusion to compete with uh you know for generative uh image AIS with with Dolly 2 and people have gotten their hands on AI and are starting to really acquiesce the fact that um companies that are centralized and have proprietary models are really in a position to suck up a lot of data from users maybe even more data than than Google has on us at the end of the day and I think this privacy and Trust problem is starting to enter more into the public Consciousness that's one issue and then the other issue is look at where all of the innovation in AI uh is actually happening there's a broader view not just in web 3 and crypto but in the AI space as a whole that most of the Innovation is actually going to happen in open source and we've seen um you know again upon stable diffusion coming out just the explosion of different people experimenting uh with these things creating new models training uh you know fine-tuning models um the the progress has been absolutely astounding Laura like the time you know if you rewind like four four years like the time from when you had a proprietary model to an equivalent open source model was probably years the time between Dolly 2 and stable diffusion 1.4 was like six seven months and now that that is compressing even um you know even further and so when I think about web3 and AI what I think web3 can do for AI is open up the pipeline that creates these models and that pipeline starts with data with Talent a lot of compute in order to train the models a lot of compute in order to serve the models as apis and then eventually commercialization and productization um now what we've seen as a you know wearing our investor hat is that most of the really foundational web3 AI intersection is currently happening in this compute area compute is the bottleneck for just about everything in AI if you look at the open AI roadmap um you know almost like every roadmap item is bottlenecked by the availability of gpus and commercialization is extremely extremely bottlenecked by the availability of models which is why we're seeing this insane proliferation of open models open large language models like GPT for all even Facebook recently released an open source model called llama2 that's gotten everybody very excited and so you know where we're we have been investing is in this idea of like decentralized training where people can come together and create models that are you know maybe as big as a GPT by crowdfunding them and making them open and available and then also inference for smart contracts we we let around in a company called Giza uh recently Giza tech.xyz and what Giza does is it makes the outputs of AI models available to Smart contracts and so that really opens up the design space of what smart contracts can do so you know you can do things like facial recognition um or text recognition in a smart contract and automate a lot of those aspects I mean what an exciting time right we have these two fundamental technologies that are I guess life-changing in their own rights and when you bring them together um amazing things are happening and Jake's been at the Forefront of this I think we published a paper audit last year a lot you know and uh the amount of talent and the amount of excitement and Innovation that we're seeing is like it's so exciting and I just can't underscore how exciting it is to be in this space right now at that really crucial intersection all right so now regulatory issues when we have touched on here and there in the episode they're sort of hard to avoid nowadays in crypto um but let's uh talk about the market structure bill which again we briefly touched on but that's probably the one that maybe I I think Chris you could probably tell me better I think it has the most likes at the moment where do you think it's going why do you think it's important how do you think it could affect things in crypto if it gets adopted I had breakfast yesterday with a very senior government official from the UK and when I run around the world I have regulators and Senior government officials banging their hand on the table saying please come to my country build we're going to differentiate with like very thoughtful Nuance principles-based regulation and that was the exact message out of the UK what we've been lacking in the U.S is just that we haven't been looking forward right we haven't been coming up with policies that focus on the technology and and actually enable it and Empower it and keep us in the lead right and so look this bill it's not perfect um but something pretty amazing happened yesterday and we had the first time that we had legislation unique to crypto advancing out of a committee there's a long way to go right but like I said the fact that a number of of Congress people on both sides of the aisle supported it uh is a really important data point and again as you start unpacking what makes those folks unique you start really looking at that generational divide that's happening it really makes you encouraged for the longer term and so what will this bill do it will give us Clarity and you know I think it feeds really in really nicely into some of the work we're doing right now with the cftc but at the end of the day you know what is a what what it what should be regulated by the cftc and what should be regulated by the SEC uh it helps provide some clarity and it also opens up the concept of a digital asset or cryptocurrency moving between those agencies as its level of decentralization changes and so I would love love to get to a point where we had empirical measures around those measures of decentralization so that it can be obvious like like it shouldn't be a it shouldn't be a surprise like we need to give our entrepreneurs predictable transparent ways to operate and that allows us to to when we invest in companies you know we don't want them to spend a good portion of that investment on legal counsel that's going to come back and tell them well we're not really sure um we wanted to take that those those dollars and invest in people invest in technology and invest in their business and so long way of saying I'm hopeful that this Bill and again like it's an iterative process xrp gave us some clarity xrp gave us I think it's galvanizing Congress to take a little bit more action because some of the results of what I guess we're calling the Torres Doctrine counter-intuitive right and so now Congress is saying wait a second we need to do something and and we're very pleased that they're doing something uh and we're looking forward to these elections to see how you know that further progresses us and when you say that you don't think the bill is perfect I know it has to go to the house for full vote so I'm assuming there is some kind of opportunity to make tweaks if you could see any revisions be made to it what would you want to see uh I I think it's a little bit early on in the process to go into like various specifics of the bill but what we're really focused on and by the way I don't think the house is going to be um yeah I think we'll have some success at the house but then you know there's some there's a pretty big hill to climb as you go into the Senate as well and then ultimately the administration and and the administration seems to have some very strong thoughts on things like stable coins as well so right now I think what we want to do is is work with policy makers just just on that Clarity point you know how can we make sure that our entrepreneurs understand how an individual asset is regulated what are the rules and and we'll continue to work with a number of different folks uh to make sure that our voice is heard and for the stable coin bill I guess they're you know was an attempt to get Patrick ranking member Patrick McHenry and sorry I did it the opposite way I guess he's the a chairman exactly of the house Financial Services committee um and then the ranking member Maxine Waters to be on the same page about the stable coin bill so that didn't happen um what does that mean for the stable coin Bill like you know will where how far do you think it'll go at this point um what do you think is good about it what's not give us your take so they've been working on it for 15 months it's been really hard for me to watch um how slow we've been progressing like to me stable coins are the most incredible opportunity for our country to get right uh when you look at the ways it's an obvious use case in utility we can deliver efficiency to our companies we can save costs you know the the way that you know you can reduce remits is by 80 percent um according to the unit swap the fact is is like there are incredible National Security opportunities for the United States to get stable coins right so when you look at all of those things it's like astounding that we haven't been on the front foot and we haven't really tried to create the conditions so that the US dollar retains and maybe even increases its Reserve status like that that's probably what the US government wants but we have not been on our front foot I think it was um disappointing that after 15 months that you know we were we weren't able to I guess generate more bipartisan support but again when you look at how people voted it was more along generational lines rather than partisan lines in many cases and so does this bill have legs um are there some open questions about it like you know for example should states have the opportunity to license stable coins um well gosh you know that's probably a much bigger subject around states rights I personally believe that we'll probably end up in a good place look there's going to be a lot more sausage making that happens the process is not a it's not a clean one it was designed that way by purpose by our founders at the end of the day we're going to get stable coin legislation I can't tell you when it's going to happen but it's going to happen and when it does hopefully it'll be in a principled place but I I I I really hope that that that our our Congress people get their act together and and frankly we in the crypto industry should be voicing that I I wrote my congressman and asked for him to to take action on it and so like we really need to stay focused and engaged um if you look at coins fund that's been our thesis is like we want to engage we want to engage with Regulators we want to engage with policy makers um and and that's that'll continue to be our approach uh until we get to a good place earlier you brought up the xrp ruling and you did say so I forget the phrasing you use but you essentially said that parts of it maybe were confusing or something like that and there has been Talk of the SEC appealing and I just wondered you know what are your um what would be your bet on whether or not this would be overturned and just generally what's your take on the rolling personally I was um I was not expecting the ruling I think most folks were not expecting the ruling in its current form but it was it was thoughtful nuanced and reasoned and I think it is a great starting point look I think the SEC has every right to appeal but as they appeal further and so does xrp by the way um you know not everything was was uh went in in its favor but the stakes get higher when you appeal and you know if this ends up at the Supreme Court uh again that's not how you want to go about Clarity but as we sit today gosh I think xrp looks a lot like oranges and and we'll continue to um to move forward accordingly and coinbase took appropriate action and other exchanges um but gosh wouldn't it be better if we had like very thoughtful Nuance policies we put out a paper a while back that talked about how we think about the world and Jake and I know you've got some strong feelings here as well about like what are the principles that we're trying to solve for like some of my thoughts around that are principles-based regulation right like maybe we can take a simple example like you know we see a lot of smart contracts come out there for fundraising purposes and a lot of people end up getting rugs right so what is the what is the most impactful regulation we can have to prevent that well I would argue like you know we should use some of the ask aspects of the technology you know in our favor and one of the uh one of the aspects of blockchain technology is that smart contracts are incredibly transparent they're formally verifiable you can audit them and and see if um they have a back door you can create a formal verification system which checks which checks the same and so like one simple thing you could do is require that any smart contract that is raising money from uh you know Market participants passes a basic principle it doesn't steal your money right and you can do that in an incredibly technical way and it seems like very obvious I often think about in the future that we can Trend toward those like very productive principles-based approaches uh that solve some of these problems and um it actually unburden some of the Regulators in a way and makes the enforcement a lot more effective all right well just last regulatory question because there are so many directions we could go um if you could just kind of dream up your own little regulatory wish list right now like what are some specific things you'd really like to see and I'm especially talking about in the US gosh um starts with all principles right and again we put forth a paper on this um what would a good policy have well we would need to have good disclosures um to make sure that people understand what they're doing if you look at Legacy um Legacy Traditional markets you can't understand the disclosures you have to pay a lawyer a lot of money to explain what you're getting into so how do you put forth like very thoughtful disclosures I think client asset protections are very very important and yes there's like technology plays a core role in that and we should recognize that technology and allow it not say hey MPC technology it doesn't fit certain qualified rules so let's get rid of it no how do we use technology to solve for those principles and that principles something like client protection right there are a number of other principles that were we we believe in and that the other thing that I like to talk about is like the technology that we're applying here that solves for those principles well traditional Finance should should do it too because you know principles are the same and we should use the best technology at our fingertips to be able to use it so it should go across the board and they should be held to a higher standard as well and we and I'm sorry when you say that like what what kind of blockchain based type thing would you apply to transfer well for example I used to run a fairly sizable FX business and one of the businesses that I I ran ran something called her stat risk and it's called it's settlement risk and so like for example if I was doing a trade uh on two sides like if I was receiving dollars they may come in or if I was paying dollars they may go out but I'd have to wait two days for yen to come in right why is that acceptable from the risk perspective and how do we leverage blockchain technology to close that risk because it's really not acceptable um and so I I think again if you start with the principles we should use the best technology at our disposal to do it and that's another reason why Regulators should really be encouraging things like like blockchain technology and this was a question or some variation of it that I proposed to Congressman Torres but defy and um regulating it to protect against this sort of risks we've seen with for instance North Korean hackers you know going after money in defy smart contracts how do you think that should be regulated in a way that you know preserves people's privacy but also it doesn't you know enrich these thieves and dictatorships yeah I mean I'm sure Jake will have some views here as well but you know we don't believe that you like how do you regulate the the internet how do you regulate technology itself like we we should be regulating people and and entities right and making sure that they're compliant because it's very hard and I think this is something that people just struggle to understand is this bifurcation of technology and then you know entities and people wait but are you saying that you would then regularly you know for instance like front ends and defy or yeah I think to the extent that there was a front-end entity that needs to be compliant but if there's a if there's technology in the back like how do you how do you regulate Technologies it's just technology and so entities and people in my mind should be regulated look I I was in the Marine Corps I don't want to give money to terrorists I've been shot at by them before um it's not fun trust me um and so the one thing that I I love that I'm seeing right now is that technology is coming online that allows us to be much more thoughtful around things like certified credentials uh and I think that's going to take hold personally you know the government has very little tolerance for issues of AML and kyc and so I I do think that technology will will solve for many of those challenges um Jake do you have thoughts I mean I'll just say I I think technology is a is a tool and I think regulation is a tool and regulation would have been really applicable in the case of something like FTX what right which is a human-run organization that should have been held you know to a higher standard um I think when you try to apply kind of traditional paper regulation to more Advanced Technologies like smart contracts and blockchains you have a bit of an impotence mismatch there right like there's uh much more effective ways that you can affect kind of the principles-based outcomes that you're looking for using smart contracts and I don't think like as a you know broadly like as a we all collectively as as Regulators right are yet at a place where we're fully appreciating The Innovation that has happened in blockchains and and in smart contracts and it will take some time you know for those kinds of principles based approaches to you know to make it through um Laura you asked like what would be on my wish list for for this I I think one thing is definitely just a sensible framework where Innovative Americans can try some of these Technologies and surface the benefits and and make the world into a better place we do not have that in the United States today we have an environment of uncertainty um unclarity and it is extremely dangerous you know in the in the explicit straightforward sense of that word um to be a Founder in in blockchain and that really should change if the U.S wants to maintain a lead as an innovator one thing one thing I'll add Jake is that we are working right now with some regulators and we do believe that the best policy will come from legislation Bar None right elected officials but I was really pleased that the cftc um put forth this GMAC the global markets advisory committee it's one of five committees that they have that advise them we were named to help participate uh and like I said we met a couple weeks ago and half the day was focused on tokenization uh which was great um but what's more exciting is that they did form a digital asset subcommittee and one thing that they they reached out to me very recently and they said you know would you look at nfts and utility tokens um so like what's what's the point that I'm trying to make is that they're engaging and I think that's really good we need to do more of it on the nfts and utility token side of things I'm super excited because you know I don't know all the details of what they're looking for but if they're looking for ideas on how to thoughtfully regulate it I know our Approach at coin fund is to reach out to the community find the best experts subject matter experts in the world and really you know put forth our best foot to engage them and so I guess that's how we're going to try to move this this neat this thing forward and uh it's it's an exciting time with that kind of Engagement all right well it has been a pleasure talking to you both um we had a conversation that went over quite the wide range of topics but it was good where can people learn more about each of you and your work thanks Laura uh we just launched our new website at coinfund.io so please check that out and we talk a little bit about our team and kind of how we think about the space and then of course follow us on Twitter I am j b r u k h on Twitter and I'm Perkins cr97 thanks again Laura perfect it's been a pleasure having you both on Unchained thanks Laura thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about Chris and Jake and coin fund check out
