the recent bank closures and how they impact crypto here to discuss are Milton to mirrors head of strategy at coin shares and Caitlin Long founder and CEO of custodia Bank welcome Melton and Caitlin great to be here hi Laura so we're recording after a dramatic few weeks first silvergate banked closed down and then Silicon Valley Bank failed and had to be taken over by the FDIC and then signature bank was closed by regulators and other banks have had their stocks pummeled and depositors and some of them have been withdrawing funds and I think the causes of each of these incidents are a little bit different and also the significance of each of these events for the crypto Community is also different but before we get into like all these recent events I just want to set a certain backdrop because there's a huge history around banking crypto companies and I actually thought Milton you could start us off with that I think you're quite familiar with what the problems are that crypto startups have traditionally faced when it comes to banking so why don't you just give us your perspective on that yeah absolutely so first of all when you said it's been a dramatic few weeks Laura it's been a week one week which is insane to me that we could have three bank failures in the span of basically four days it shows you how quickly um our federal government can move when when incentivized or when motivated but I'll let Caitlyn talk about that okay so just going back to the landscape for banking crypto um when I started in the industry professionally in 2015 uh no one would Bank our portfolio company is a digital currency group and in fact this is how we met Alan Lane the then CEO of silvergate Bank which was a little known Bank in La Jolla California and Alan and his team had learned about Bitcoin gotten interested in it and they kind of took a a step forward and said okay we're gonna try to bank crypto companies now the issue is um if you Bank a crypto company what starts happening nobody has explicitly forbidden from banking crypto companies but will start to happen to use a bank is your Auditors will start visiting you more often and the way that the risk at your bank is monitored right it starts to change because crypto is viewed as this big scary strange sort of industry and so banks have always been really reticent really hesitant to engage with crypto companies now it's also important to distinguish between the two different types of bank accounts that crypto companies will have of the first type of account is an operational account which typically is if you raise money or you have cash to fund operations that typically goes into an operating account so there's not a ton of flows usually in these accounts and typically the flows are with well-defined counterparties so you're paying payroll you're paying your vendors you're paying your service providers the other type of account a transactional account is much more challenging it's accounts that engage with transactions with the actual day-to-day of your business and particularly if you're in the business of interchange or exchange right which many crypto companies are this is magical internet money after all then you have something called a transactional account and as you can imagine they're the requirements are much more cumbersome particularly in light of all of these fun acronyms we have kyc amlofac all of these things that have to do with the risk of where your money is coming from who your customer is where their money comes from and so just to delineate in the history of crypto banking operational bank accounts have historically been fairly easy to open not super easy but there are dozens of banks last year and maybe Caitlyn will disagree with me but there were dozens of banks that would willingly open an operational account for you including some of the larger banks in the world and some of what we call these These siffies are systemically important financial institutions and Silicon Valley Bank svb to be very clear did not engage in any transactional crypto banking they were heavily engaged in operational banking focused more on startups who'd raised Venture and we're using these bank accounts to help fund operations then Along came silvergate right in 2015 Alan and Co our friendly Bankers in La Jolla and they really started to get into the nuts and bolts of transactional banking Metropolitan Bank notably started banking coinbase in 2016 offering a similar service signature Banks started to get involved but most importantly with signature and silvergate did for crypto banks that are so important is they enabled dollars to settle 24 7 365 in near real time in the same way that crypto settles and so if we look at the way liquidity and Market depth in crypto has grown and what has made it possible for this Market to grow and and gather so much momentum is the fact that you now have connectivity to the traditional dollar banking system not just via stable coins like tether and usdc but you could actually move cash between accounts in real time on weekends on nights on holidays using silvergate Exchange Network and Cygnet right and so the fact that these two core pillars of crypto banking are now gone yes we can send wires yes we can send ACH but the real issue the real Crux of the challenge with crypto has always been how do we reconcile the fact that crypto settles with near instant finality right 24 7 365 and dollars don't wires settle from nine to five Monday through Friday except for bank holidays and that's not adding in the t plus one to t plus three days of settlement it might take particularly if you're moving money across banks that are not on the same network and so crypto banking has always been chaotic has always been messy the one silver lining is many firms in our industry as a result would maintain one two three multiple bank accounts in a form of redundancy but what I think is so interesting and what is going to be really challenging to resolve is this ultimate incompatibility between the dollar and the way a dollar settles and the way that that crypto settles and that really here is the fundamental Challenge and as we've seen the FED took some drastic actions the ftic DraStic actions that is now gone there is no way to replace that easily this will be very interesting to see particularly with the FED launching its own fed now payment system in July um how that landscape shakes out so a lot of words that I just said right there but crypto banking has always been a mess as an industry we have learned to become very creative when it comes to banking we've created stable coins with hundreds of billions of dollars of market cap as a result so innovation has certainly been at the Forefront here but the fundamental issue we need to reconcile is how do we allow dollars to settle the same way crypto settles and be available in liquid in real time and and within the banking system so their wires could settle in real time so that's really the Crux of the issue that's where that challenging intersection is and as we've seen our government can move very quickly if they don't like what's happening yeah so one quick question actually probably Caitlyn could also answer this but I've always wondered so you know you talked about silvergate exchange Network or sen and then Cygnet which is basically the same thing it's the 24 7 real-time settlement on the banking side I always wondered were those blockchain based networks because otherwise how do you get dollars to settle so fast I don't I never understood that yeah so um my understanding is it's more like ious on their internal Ledger it's like an internal database I don't believe they were using a ledger on the back end I mean again if we talk about tokens or using a blockchain right like the Visa Network which is the world's largest payment Network it's just a network of tokenized ious it's just little pieces of data it happens to be a private Ledger that's owned and maintained by Visa um that I think these functioned in a similar way and again to participate in sen and Cygnet you had to have a certain amount of assets at the bank there were obviously limits to what you could do based on your bank balances but in my understanding was really just internal data entries right and then eventually those wires would settle so it's hilarious because when you say that I'm like oh basically it's like venmo but for crypto companies yeah okay okay which is hilarious um and actually just one other comment I want to make on what you said is that like I know people like to kind of make fun of coinbase or say it's like not crypto native anymore whatever but that was actually what was so revolutionary about it was that this was such an intractable problem and then even though it's so simple like it seems simple or it sounds simple but actually yeah like taking a side that moves as fast as crypto and then matching it so it actually works well even with all the volatility and prices on the other side where the money moves slowly like managing that and also doing in a way where like fraudsters won't completely eat away like any of your margin and all that like that is actually a really hard thing for companies to do or it was back in 2012 when they got started so I mean and even now I think just for context also fraud and payments is huge right payments companies lose an insane amount of money to fraud and that number is only going up every year so I think it makes it even more challenging for companies who want to offer their customers great service and the ability to engage with crypto in real time because there's a huge issue with fraud on the other side with counterparties so I'll just add that data point because there are Trends outside of crypto that I think are also impacting the risk environment when it comes to real-time payments okay so Caitlin let's turn to you because the other bit of backdrop that I think listeners need to understand is the rumors about this operation choke point 2.0 which was directed at crypto and that became public in a post by Nick Carter that was published on February 8th so can you kind of summarize what that is and I feel like you're going to have a very particular Viewpoint into this well operation choke point was an Obama era program uh started by the FDIC and the Department of Justice and one of the people who started it is Marty Gruenberg who is now the head of the FDIC so the people are the same uh in in that particular case um and what it was was it started with payday lenders and the FDIC essentially pressured the banks through as Melton said the Auditors will just start visiting you you're deemed to be a higher risk Bank your management score goes down which means your FDIC insurance rate goes up or with something called your cap rate at the FED goes down so you can't be overdrawn as much or you're limited to your M A opportunities or new business expansion opportunities if you're not deemed to be a a well managed Bank okay so those are the sort of qualitative things that The Regulators can use to turn to turn up the pressure on the the management team of a bank if they're banking industries that are not politically favored now operation choke point started in around 2011 and It ultimately expanded beyond the payday lenders to 30 different Industries and our industry is one of them now it it was stopped during the officially during the Trump Administration but what's so interesting is that the political leanings of the Federal Bank agencies have have always been more left and now with the the with the one of the people who had started operation choke point in charge at the FDIC uh they they understood what their powers were because there are so much subjectivity that goes into this and it is crystal clear that we are in operation choke point 2.0 uh and uh I'll I'll share I don't know by the time this episode comes out if we will have revealed some of the details about what happened to custodia but there were there were leaks by the fed and the White House two days before custodia his application was voted down that the FED vote was preordained and that we were going to be voted down and we have that in email and I will be releasing that email not not doxing the reporter who sent it but the reporter actually asked us by email said we have been told that the fed and OCC applicants have been all asked to simultaneously to withdraw your applications and that's indeed what happened uh you've seen paxos and portigo who had applications at the OCC and then custodia who had an application at the FED all basically being shoved to the side the applications clearly were not being reviewed on their merits individually they were there was a political decision and I will reveal a lot of information about the politicization of what happened there is no question and I've known since January 27th because custodia was the tip of the spear here uh that that that operation 0.2.0 was in full swing and again we we were having those conversations with the reporters that were being leaked to by the White House and the FED a few days before our application was voted down by the FED on January 27th it's also very interesting uh because if you go back and look at what January 27th was it was fed blackout week before the fomc meeting which was the next week the FED Governors are told by fed staff nothing that's not related to the fomc happens during fed blackout week so it's interesting that the application that the vote on our application took place on the Friday of fed blackout week for an application that had been pending for two and a half years so what was the rush well the White House wanted to do that Blitz on January 27th where both the White House and the FED simultaneously put out anti-crypto policy statements and that essentially killed killed the stable coin we'll come back and talk about that and simultaneously announced the denial of custodia's application and then that afternoon the Kansas City fed came over the top and announced the denial of our of our membership application and uh and filed to dismiss our pending lawsuit which subsequently the judge denied however uh the point is there was what was the rush on January 27th during fomc blackout week that there was a big coordinated Blitz with the White House that had to happen now I'm revealing a lot that I couldn't reveal back then because back then it wasn't clear what was happening to us right we were in the fog of War we were the tip of the spear it is now crystal clear in retrospect that there's been a massive attempt to debank this industry there are some credible allegations that at both silvergate and signature that interesting things happen there uh interesting in air quotes uh in in the case of silvergate having its Federal Home Loan Bank Advance is called early and in the case of signature it's still breaking but there are two things uh representative Barney Frank was on the board of signature and he gave a New York Magazine interview he actually gave a few interviews this week but in particular the New York Magazine art interview where he said that signature was an a solvent bank and it may have been the first bank in the United States history that was put into receivership despite being solvent and last night it was leaked by two different sources in a Reuters article that the auctioneers for Signature have specifically told the buyers that they will not be allowed to restart the Cygnet Network that Melton talked about earlier and that they will not be banking crypto so it's Crystal Clear that there has been a massive coordinated debanking effort and we do have a Smoking Gun in the form of that email to prove that so all of that is correct except one little correction was um coindesk reported that silvergate actually voluntarily repaid its um Federal Home Loan Bank which so this is interesting okay being because in the bank world right again I told you that the bank supervisors can just turn the dials on the management team why would they voluntarily do something like that that puts them into an illiquidity situation politically the fact that that you have all these Banks all three of the bank that that failed silvergate then Silicon Valley bank then signature had huge borrowings at the federal home loan Banks those are supposed to be there to support mortgage lending and in fact what happened is the banks used them as backup liquidity facilities for any type of bank run and that created a political Firestorm because what was happening was the Federal home loan Banks were being used to provide cash advances to banks that were banking crypto banks that were banking Tech startups right this isn't mortgages it was beyond the remit of the federal home loan Banks and it created a political Firestorm so don't be surprised if I I'm just speculating here based on what I you know but based on but you know informed speculation that they got pressure from their Regulators to do just that they would not voluntarily have been suicided so to speak interesting okay I guess yeah I guess I just wonder why they wouldn't either come out and say that or hint at it in some way but uh lots of policies you know what's so interesting Laura is that with bank Regulators don't sue their Regulators Bank Regulators have a lot of power over the management teams or sorry but Bank managements rather don't sue their Regulators right the things that really happen never come out and this is one of the reasons why Bank Regulators are so rarely sued so rarely challenged when they overstep their regulatory Authority because the the regulates almost never Sue The Regulators and that is what is so interesting about custodia's situation because the FED shoved us to the side essentially left our board with no choice but to continue to pursue our remedies for the the wrongs that the FED did to us and there there were many we have a list of a couple of dozen procedural irregularities big big important procedural irregularities that took place in the custodial situation and so because we're not a regular T but that's what it takes by the way to get standing to sue the regulator you've got to be a harmed party you've got to be the regulate T but operate operating regulates rarely sue their Regulators so I'm not surprised actually given all the litigation pressure on the management teams of these banks that have failed I'm not surprised that they're not telling you what really happened it will come out though eventually okay okay wow the bank Regulators have extraordinary power and it's not that they were granted that extraordinary power they just took it and nobody challenged them okay yeah it feels like there's a whole rabbit hole we could go down there um which we might later if we have time but let's now actually just go to the incidents themselves let's start with silvergate and we've talked about this a little bit but I want to um just go into like each one because like I said the causes of the demise of each of these were a little bit different so let's start with silvergate um for I was just curious for each of your opinions what do you each think took silvergate down I mean in in my view the silvergate situation is um duration mismatch on assets and liabilities they um had and and silvergate had been in trouble quote unquote or it had issues for some some time the issue was silvergate um at the peak of the market assets and took on a bunch of debt at rates that were not sustainable in the current environment by the way this is the same issue Our Own federal government has like our own federal government is very much insolvent at a five percent one-year treasury rate right like banking does not work when you own a bunch of long-dated uh debt that you are holding at one percent right or two percent but the one-year rate or the risk-free rate quote unquote is now five percent like that doesn't work so silvergate to me and frankly all of these things just a classic case of risk management not being fine-tuned they owned a bunch because when you take in deposits right that's a liability you get cash on the asset side of your balance sheet and you take on the deposit as a liability on the liabilities and Equity side of the balance sheet you then take that cash asset which doesn't yield any income and you turn it into an income generating asset by buying debt by buying Securities by investing whatever it is and as the CFO at a bank as the risk manager at a bank is the portfolio manager at a bank it is sort of your job to make sure that balance of assets that you're diversifying that deposit cash into meets all of your regulatory ratios right you're required to have a certain amount of short data Securities for slog data Securities meets their risk requirements but also fits the nature of your operating model the issue with silvergate is crypto is a hot ball of money right crypto deposits are very volatile they move a lot and particularly over the last six months people who may have historically held really large cash balances on deposit are now looking to draw down those deposits move though to those deposits you know during December and January when we saw a lot of lows and different assets people may have been wanting to deploy and so they call the deposits the bank depletes its short-term assets but has a ton of long-term assets that are now rated below uh par or price below par where they bought them and so they're forced to sell these assets at a loss in fact silvergate had to sell a bunch of debt it had on its balance sheet at a loss in December of last year which became clear in their filings right which is why again publicly listed companies so important to the health of the crypto ecosystem read financial statement looking at the silvergate financial statements I think it became very clear in late January when those were published right when they published their full year results for 2022 that there were fundamental issues with their balance sheet so the issue is just when you have something like crypto or Tech hot ball of money assets moving around particularly in the market climate we're in people need that cash people want to spend that cash if you don't have it on hand and you can't rely on as Caitlyn said the FDIC and you can't draw more loans to meet that backstop right you're going to have a fundamental issue with your liquidity that's what the regulator steps in because as a bank I don't know if it's everyday Caitlyn I believe it's every day like close a business you're required to file your liquidity report right is it end of day every day no well it depends the the big banks have a very different regulatory regime than the than the regional and small Banks and that's one of the big issues that's being discussed right now yeah yeah because I'm familiar with the Basel III regime right where it's it doesn't apply to Regional and Community Banks yeah sorry go ahead Bank nerding out sorry I don't know so that that's all I have to say about silvergate and frankly it's the same for all three but I think at silvergate the issue really was like people wanted their money the money wasn't there they had to sell assets that were now worth much less than when they bought them and they just looked at the situation I actually think silvergate management did make a good decision because their wind down was very orderly right the story of silvergate was hey we're winding down the bank this is going to happen in orderly process we have enough assets to cover all depositors so I think the communication there was exceptionally well managed so kudos to that team for just there was no Panic there was no bank run it was just we're insolvent I don't know Caitlyn maybe you have a different read on silvergate they were solvent but they were illiquid um so I mean they did they definitely did have a bank run but in the end they had enough cash to pay off the depositors uh it's their shareholders who who took it on the chin and the stock I I noticed uh very recently is still trading at two dollars so it's not at zero and uh that does tell you that there's some expectation again it gets back to the the allegation from Barney Frank that um that signature was put into receivership because The Regulators wanted to force the debanking of crypto and actually when it all shakes out what you might find is that both at silvergate and signature there was positive Equity value in other words the banks were solvent it's just that they had the liquidity problem which caused them to have to run to the federal home loan bank to get the advances and that caused the the political issue one of the interesting things about silvergate I had been warning Regulators that there was Bank Run risk all over this industry because I noticed that the that as their deposits grew and one thing at all three of those Banks is that their deposits just exploded in size um and it was of course the crypto bull market in 2021 but it was also in Silicon Valley bank's case just the tech bull market and so it's in Silicon Valley Bank's case that that their deposits quadrupled in the span of a couple of years to a 200 billion dollar bank they were clearly getting to be systemically important it's the 16th it was the 16th largest bank in the United States at the time when it failed and so the impact of that is all this cash was coming in but here's the punch line in in March of 2022 right before the crypto crash started and all the bankruptcies came in in May 2022 or started silver Gates had a had 13.3 billion of demand deposits that could be withdrawn in the span of seconds and 1.4 billion of cash to meet the 13.3 billion of demand deposits that could be withdrawn it is not rocket science what happened there um what is the the real question is why did the management team sit with that kind of liquidity exposure and why did the Regulators not force them to sit on a lot more cash one of the interesting questions that keeps being asked is why aren't Banks just money warehouses we all think that our deposits in our bank accounts are ours they're not they're technically loans to a leveraged institution however we all want those deposits to just be ours and we want our money to be there when we want it back and so the whole concept of in a in a world in which information moves at the speed of social media and technology has sped up settlement Cycles right we now have apis you can actually just write software to move money around from your bank that didn't used to be the case you used to have to go line up at a bank branch and fill out a paper form and then at best hours later more likely Days Later you'd get your money it doesn't work that way anymore everything is a lot faster and so what that means is the banks are going to have to sit on a lot more cash I am very curious why Regulators have not told the regional and Community Banks that in the face of fed now coming online as you pointed out melt on this summer which is a 24 7 365 settlement system why are the banks not sitting on a lot more cash money's just going to start moving around a lot faster now fed now is initially going to be limited to a hundred thousand dollars but right now the most you can get out of your bank account in real time is ten thousand dollars of cash now you're going to be able to electronically move a hundred thousand dollars at a time in fed now beginning this summer it's obvious that the banking industry has liquidity problems yeah one other thing that I wanted to ask about because I keep seeing this when I look up what happened with silvergate especially on social media is that a lot of people will either tweet at Elizabeth Warren or you know whatever they'll comment that she kind of fomented the liquidity crisis at silvergate and well her and short sellers or generally the Senators who sent the letter to silvergate um scolding them after the FTX situation so I was curious what you thought of that theory which I've seen floating around everywhere she definitely had an impact and it's her acolytes who started this whole thing it's so interesting because in both the current presidency and the previous presidency there were anti and pro crypto camps within the administrations and they were warring with each other and that was absolutely happening here and that anti-crypto anti-tech crowd because they want to break up big Tech and are just generally a lot more suspicious of tech uh and and it is the same crowd and they're the ones who got this whole thing started and they own the outcome here and one of the interesting questions is when will the more moderate faction of the Biden Administration rear its head because it's been that more Progressive anti-crypto anti-tech crowd that did get this started and and Laura you're absolutely right I noticed a couple of those Progressive Senators including Senator Warren within a minute of the Silver Gate announcement that it was liquidating the progressive Senators had statements prepared that they released so obviously they've been tipped off by the bank regulators and again the the top brass that the bank Regulators are all part of that same anti-crypto faction and they're using their power to try to pressure the banks to stop banking this lawful industry okay interesting all right so in a moment we're going to talk about the other big collapses um but first a quick word from

Valley Bank to fail uh it seems to me maybe it's multiple factors I was curious to hear how both of you see it I mean I don't have anything new quote unquote to add um same story 42 billion dollars of deposits in one day that's close to 25 of their deposit base in one day trying to raise money via a stock sale um really poor financials I think or the canary in the coal mine there was some analysis that was done there was a newsletter that was published a sub stack like we are in the age of Citizen journalism by the way which is so fascinating to me because it was literally a sub stack article that someone wrote that I think the guys who do the all-in podcast saw they didn't talked about it then a bunch of VCS on Twitter started getting concerned I started getting calls everyone started talking to their portfolio big hot ball of money law Laura the theme of this show is the big hot ball of money Tech crypto anything where the velocity of money is high anything that's digitized right a hot ball of money it's just inevitable that deposits are going to move very quickly and at the end of the day you know there were some investors that were like oh leave your money at SCP leave your deposits there support an institution that support has Game Theory this is Game Theory right um if you are wrong the worst thing is your money is another bank account and you go through a couple weeks of headaches just to move your money back and deal with that operational sort of mess but if you're right oh who's gonna risk losing millions of dollars of cop billions of dollars of capital that makes you an incredibly poor fiduciary so I think what people forget is we live in this age where anytime you're in an industry where you have this incredible velocity and money and by the way this is happening in every industry with the digitization of everything and crypto to kind of the theme of what Caitlyn and I have both been touching on just amplifies this to a degree that is really incomprehensible I think fundamentally challenges the business model of banks right because of this tremendous demand for liquidity in times of duress this velocity and The Sensational demand for dollars when I want them through the click of a button via API in real time um just to exacerbates this problem so that's Silicon Valley Bank and there have been a lot of bad takes on Silicon Valley Bank a lot of good takes on Silicon Valley Bank I'm not a banking expert I spent a year on Basel three regs which made me you know really depressed and frankly I know way more than I want to about thin cap rules but Caitlyn is a banking expert so I'll let her apply more on a CD but to me like the big Takeaway on SCB was holy crap news moves fast it's citizen journalism it doesn't take much to look at financials and figure out and this is Game Theory right at the end of the day like the risk of being right better to be wrong and safe than to be right and to put your livelihood your assets at risk and again big hot ball of money just never forget that the big hot ball of money when it's on the move if you're a bank and you're on the wrong side of that move it's it's not it's not going to work so Caitlin you're the actual banking expert so what's your take on it no meltam's absolutely right you nailed it this is the way the the banking industry used to work it was designed for people all not showing up at the same time and getting their deposits out at the same time and fundamentally the business model cannot work in an information age where information flows literally at the speed of light across social media no Traditional Bank can do the traditional borrow short term and lend long-term maturity transformation game in that environment you either have to explicitly lock up your deposits so that they can't be withdrawn on demand and pay higher interest to your depositors if you're a bank or you literally back all your demand deposits in cash and I saw an analysis from one of the Regional Bank analysts at one of the big brokerage firms virtually no bank has 100 cash to back its demand deposits the ones that are that that are the best that have the highest liquidity has melting implied are those that comply with Basel III but a political decision was made years ago in the United States not to apply Basel III to the community and Regional Banks whereas in the the rest of the world there are really only one or two banks in each country whereas the U.S has 4236 of which by the way only 13 are women owned I happen to know that I know those numbers off the top of my head it's a it's a it's really shy and only five are African-American owned by the way these are really staggering numbers but the point is we do have a lot of banks in the United States and that's the reason they chose not to apply Basel III to those Banks because they didn't want to put them out of business and so they let the run in a in a inherently risky way borrowing short-term and lending long-term and in this information era where Bank Run rumors can be sparked and and can happen very quickly you can quickly see how that maturity transformation turns into a problem for for the bank yeah I also wanted to call out what Milton talked about earlier the game theory because it totally makes sense like if the only way this is gonna work is if everybody agrees to not pull their money out of the bank then every single person is going to be like oh but what if not everybody does it then I'm gonna be screwed if I like try to be the good citizen here and so yeah there's just no incentive so that's what isn't this but I did want to ask because like so much has been made about the role of social media and VCS and like some people kind of like quote unquote blame them and so I was curious like you guys feel they were just doing their fiduciary duty right yeah I wanted to hear your thoughts on that a little bit more well I mean the the fundamental instability of the banking system is the issue so to your point I mean everybody is incentivized to do what's best for them and in that case in the VC's case it was fiduciaries or the companies themselves who were trying to protect their their operating cash so that they could make payroll they were fiduciaries they had to get their money out so so this notion that they're that they're somehow at fault is upside down yeah and I also wanted to just call out what you were saying about how they had to make payroll because I I just was seeing like random comments on you know different articles online of by people who maybe aren't super familiar with this industry and it's very clear and they think it's just like everyday people who are super wealthy and it's like no no no no these are companies that have to pay their employees it's right which so it's just like a totally different mindset um it's like you know people are relying on that it's not just like wealthy fat cats who have nothing to do you know um nothing better to do than buy like a private jet or something so correct um another thing that I have seen a lot of discussion about is the rolling back of some of the aspects of the Dodd-Frank law in 2018 and some people are saying that that is another cause of this crisis so can you explain what was rolled back and how much you think that that had to do with this situation yeah I I saw an analysis from the bank policy Institute which essentially said that if a stress test that applied to the systemically important Banks had been applied to Silicon Valley Bank it would have passed and yet until the bank still failed right so that so that that's the point and basically what they're saying is that the rollback in 2018 of the and what that did was essentially said that that again this political deal that got cut is we got to save the Community Banks in the United States because that's where so much credit goes into the manufacturing industry the agricultural industry the mining industry is really sort of the the hardcore operating Industries non-financial Industries that's where a lot of debt including real estate lending comes is out of these Community Banks and so to preserve the credit impulse the the deal that got cut was that they wouldn't have to be subject to the same requirements as these systemically important Banks and so they they reduce the threshold well it turns out that that threshold wouldn't have mattered so it's a it's a Canard it's a red herring argument oh interesting oh my gosh okay because yeah you know um you're right that their assets did um or rather their liabilities did increase to 200 million or billion sorry but that would be still under that threshold because the uh the rollback like raised the the limit under which you know these Banks would have to undergo those stress tests from 50 billion to 250 billion so yeah and if I might I just want to add in one thing here Laura that's the very conversation we're having right is eliminating the fact that most people do not understand anything about Banking and that is not it's not a criticism right I did not understand it and I would never have understood it if I wasn't tasked with when you're like working on Basel III compliance for a European captive Bank Caitlyn would not understand it this intimately if she wasn't trying to to build a bank and so I think one of the challenges is is that again in this this also goes back to like broader Finance a lot of people just don't understand or really get what's going on and then um you have reporters you have people on Twitter who are like looking for you know likes or whatever you have bloggers you have all these really really bad takes out there and the issue is is nobody can really give you a straight story but it's very simple they're like very simple ratios and Banking and as Caitlyn has highlighted what's so interesting about uh so oh my God they need different bank names why do all of these things it's so confusing why it's a conspiracy against the letters s and I okay so um Silver Gate Silicon Valley Bank signature I think one of the things they all had in common is if you look at Traditional Bank metrics and if you look at some of these things under Dodd-Frank thin cap liquidity rules right these other ratios that matter for banks they would have all passed and that's absolutely freaking insane um and says Caitlin alluded to I think what's so interesting to me is like what happens next because this is going to keep happening right First Republic is happening right now credit Swiss happening in real time right this is not going to go away and the reality is I'm going to keep saying it big hot ball of money it's only picking up velocities only picking up Mass right it is only a matter of time until the majority of the world's banking is fully digitized accessible at the touch of a button and wants to move 24 7 365 like that is just the reality and so it's really fascinating to me because banking is one of those things that so few people really understand it's easy to say a few words and sound smart I still don't really understand it all that well and arguably like I know a little bit but it is really interesting because there's a lot of bad takes out there so I'll just say like this conversation in and of itself I think is highlighting some of the really interesting nuances and like really granular detail that I think makes what's happening here in the U.S so much more interesting and you wouldn't really be able to get that Nuance unless you really have spent time like deep in the bowels of this really frankly sometimes dry and boring subject matter but very very financially it's foundationally important yeah yeah but also so I I like as a Storyteller I actually view it as quite juicy um so a couple of things I want to call it so first of all like and again like you I I know even less about banking so thank you both for Illuminating me but what I'm hearing and you tell me if I'm wrong is that essentially two kind of really long-term trends um have come together to foment these crises so one would be um you know the uh the change in the interest rates which especially after a period of low rates which now has completely um yeah upended the way Banks typically invest in order to keep their business model uh you know in the black so that's one and then the other is um you know the fact that yeah like our traditional banking rails move very slow uh you know they were built in the 70s or whatever and then now with like social media and with like our digital apps where we yeah don't go into Bank branches anymore but we can just move money on our banking apps seemingly like on demand those two things and have come together to create sort of this unsustainable so essentially what we're saying is that business models the business model for banks is kind of coming to a place where it's probably not sustainable yeah correct okay which is just kind of crazy and then to the point of signature which I don't want to skip over I think the reason I point out it's so challenging to understand and untangle what's going on is I think that um the fed the FDIC and other people who were appointed Not Elected they were appointed and have declared themselves right Supreme Emperors of the underlying liquidity in our financial system just anointed themselves with these Powers right if we look at what's going on at the SEC same thing like Gary Gensler has just decided to anoint himself with these powers and everyone's like whoa nobody voted for you hello um what I think is so interesting is the fact that the general public and even experts in Tech and other parts of finance and and crypto in particular do not understand some of these very complex like tiki-tacky very detailed aspects of Bank rules Bank regulation and and these processes and these these important Capital ratios and these business models are what makes it possible for things like signature to happen because when someone from the FDIC comes in and says oh yeah signature uh signature yeah because when someone from the FDIC comes in and says oh yeah rules for violated this happened and you're like oh yeah yeah they're the regulator I'm gonna go along with it but they have publicly like stated financials there is data there is information and as Caitlyn alluded to when you look at the facts and you look at the rules one plus one does not equal two so I think the fact this is so difficult to understand is what is allowing Regulators to get away with it right because to the outside Observer it seems normal and you can obviously skip a lot of this with complexity and terminology and people will say oh yeah yeah but they're the FDIC they're the experts they're the FED they're the experts I'm sorry what experts do we see the absolute show state of banking in the United States of America right now so that's why I think the signature case is so interesting because here you have silvergate svb all of this backlash against Banks all of this like hot money moving around this is the best time possible to execute a strategic kill shot against signature and so there's this perfect setup almost and Caitlyn I'll let you lead this one because I find it fascinating I still don't know what happened but it's wild to me yeah so I I'm I'm glad that we moved upstairs because this was my next question because this to me is definitely the outlier and we need to unpack and this is the one I think has the most um significance for the crypto industry going forward so one thing and you know uh Caitlyn you alluded to this but I just want to pull out these quotes from that New York mag uh interview that Jen Vietnam did with Barney Frank he said um because so he basically uh he's the uh the Frank in Don Frank Dodd-Frank exactly and he also however was a board member at signature so you know some people might say he um is biased toward them but you know given his background I think he probably is somebody who understands all of this stuff super well and um what he said to her was that the bank was solvent and then he said now the question is why did The Regulators react so harshly to what they said oh and sorry he said that um The Regulators had blamed the fact that they couldn't get the data they wanted from the bank as the reason why they decided to close it down so he said now the question is why do they react so harshly to what they said was our inability to give them the sufficient data I believe it was probably to send the message that even though the even though we were doing crypto stuff responsibly they don't want Banks doing crypto they denied that in their statement but I don't fully believe that I think Sloppy data is not a reason to close a bank that you have not decided was insolvent correct so yeah so just I just wanted listeners to hear that but go ahead uh give us your theories on what happened with signature Scandal outright Scandal this is Theft Auto private property by Regulators who did not have the authority is to take a solvent bank and put it into receivership and I do suspect that there will be litigation over that did The Regulators have the right again finally you're having some of the regulates be in a position where they can Sue The Regulators for overreaching but that's what it takes and the fact that these Regulators have not had anyone sue them for decades they've just grabbed power that they didn't actually have they've way overstepped their bounds and if this is correct and I don't have any reason to doubt Barney Frank because he did have inside information he was a director of the company and he himself admitted that he was a bit of a crypto skeptic so for him then to say that The Regulators put a solvent Bank into receivership I think the stock was trading at uh something like forty dollars before it was put into receivership this was not a stock that went to zero or close to zero so it that that is theft of private property and it's going to be challenged and Milton did you want to add anything else on on this is definitely the most irregular situation to me what's what's interesting so I started hearing rumors about signature um on Friday afternoon people were saying oh they're not processing outbound wires um I happen to know a few people who work at signature I shot a quick text to one of them and he said oh must must be like a tech glitch we're operating just just fine but my understanding is they did get hit with some deposits uh requests deposit withdrawals on on Friday but again as Caitlyn alluded to like these Regional Banks aren't are not required to report liquidity in in real time so it was so kind of interesting and then Friday I just went to bed feeling fine Saturday I was like what a week I'm gonna take a breath go for a nice hike uh and then Sunday you know going through emails doing some some ketchup all of a sudden signature is seized by the FDIC and I'm like what in that on a Sunday on a Sunday night at 6 p.m that doesn't happen in the history of the FDIC the FDIC usually receives banks on Friday at 5 PM how irregular right so irregular and then on top of that it was bundled into it didn't even get its own press release right which is also like bananas because signature is a really important Bank in New York it's not a crypto Bank signatures business is like 15 crypto the majority of their business is New York real estate and Commercial Banking so it's absolutely bananas right they don't even get their own press release it's bundled into a press release about Silicon Valley Bank and it's two lines in a very small paragraph zero detail zero context it is now Thursday it is five days later there is still not much more clarity other than General allegations against management right so allegations of mismanagement allegations of misconduct it's crazy like in what Universe do we live where a regulator can walk into a business seize that business give no reason as to why that is being seized and not 24 hours later take over operations of that business and then put it for sale but demand that in that sale it wind down a core component of it it's like it's Banana Republic stuff it's absolutely it's Banana Republic level Shenanigans and what's Wild to me is when you tell people there is something foul happening here this is not due process this is not what happens in a democratic country that respects private property and the right to form private Enterprise when you tell people that they're like oh conspiracy theory you're biased because you're in crypto like what are you smoking if you think they're just coming for crypto you're on something because it's crypto first and everything else is next again Banana Republic level moves I just I am I'm appalled at what's even worse Caitlin as you pointed out is nobody's holding these people accountable nobody there is zero due process zero accountability zero appeal so like the question is what do you do in this situation well people are voting with their feet half the people that I work with are contemplating moving to a different jurisdiction we Bank in seven different jurisdictions right we're like effectively looking around and we're saying okay we gotta de-risk from a regulatory exposure perspective but if the us is going to do this like this is Banana Republic level Shenanigans I'm just gonna go ahead and say it I think it's insane and I would say that whether I worked in crypto or not because there is zero due process there is zero Clarity there is zero transparency there's zero legitimate reason given there's zero data or evidence that anyone can point me to that would necessitate drastic actions being taken at 6 pm on a Sunday evening I don't know Caitlyn like you've been dealing with this with custodia like it boggles the mind because for so long people have believed U.S is like the Bastion for Capital formation Innovation forming free enterprise where private companies can enjoy property rights like this is seizure of property it's it's correct absolutely yeah I'll just stop there but it boggles my mind yeah so I think it's great that you brought up custody video so why don't we have Caitlyn um why don't you describe the business model that you would propose for custodia yeah custodia was the business that a lot of people have come forward and said why can't Banks just be money warehouses that's exactly the business that custodia proposed extremely simple you deposit money into a bank the bank holds cash to cash you out whenever you want it back period very simple how does the bank make money fees the way custodia's business model was set up is U.S dollar accounts all fee based no interest because it's a non-lending bank therefore can't earn any spread between the interest yield on the loans versus what it's paying to depositors therefore not paying cash to depositors therefore if the traditional Banks were so afraid of a bank like that just do a better job attracting deposits and paying interest to your depositors this isn't rocket science this should not have been a threat to the traditional banking industry but of course they all thought it was and then the other piece of the business is digil asset custody so it's a it's a business model that essentially was going to be a miniature version of the Bank of New Yorks and state streets that make most of their money off custody fees and then charge fees for accounts and we have been deluged with desperate startups in the digital asset industry who have lost their bank accounts and are at risk of going out of business because because they can't get bank accounts and people are that desperate right now this is a lawful industry that has been unlawfully debanked wow and so given what you revealed at the beginning you know you've been denied but you have this evidence so essentially it sounds like you kind of hinted are you suing the government or what's happening or the fed or yeah I'll I'll keep this to factual information only because of course I can't comment on the lawsuit but custodia filed suit against the FED in June for unlawful delay on the decisions related to the applications then of course the decisions came in this coordinated fashion with the White House on this rushed basis on January 27th and so custodia has has filed an amended complaint the original complaint the Federal Reserve moved to dismiss then after it made the decision it moved to dismiss the complaint as Moot and the judge has denied both of those motions to dismiss so we the lawsuit is still ongoing with the revised complaint okay all right well we're gonna have to see what happens with this because it's almost like all these events are sort of proving that maybe that was a good business model and it should have been approved yeah um because I saw that you retweeted I think it was Matt Iglesias yeah the journalist who exactly but why isn't there just a thing that charges you know fees for restoring your money and you're like that was my business idea and I got rejected at the beginning of this whole wave in a in a really heavy-handed and nasty way yes yeah which it's mind-blowing um okay so let's talk about usdc because obviously that got caught up in this turmoil Circle had 3.3 billion dollars of its 40 billion dollars in usdc reserves at Silicon Valley Bank and so over the weekend it depeged down to as low as 88 cents um there were some news articles saying that vitalik buterin and others bought the dip Which smart for them um but I was curious like what you thought all of this meant um in terms of the general outlook for reserve-backed stable coins uh given the general unfriendliness we're seeing of banking to the crypto sector and and also just the general instability of Banks and general what a saga so I try to enjoy my Saturday Saturday night I have my laptop out I'm laying in bed I'm looking at usdc 93 cents 90 cents 88 cents what's really interesting is die which is supposed to be crypto collateralized stable coin is now over 40 um percent backed by usdc and it traded exactly in line with usdc um tether right the Widowmaker trade continues somebody needs to check on off on fur tree or whatever the firm is that like is always shorting tether make sure those guys are okay because tether went to 101 that's like the Widowmaker it's just it's on it's unbeatable there's all every cycle someone wants to short tether in every cycle they get carried out on a stretcher it's fascinating to me um but look with circle I think the really interesting thing is um again big hot ball of money usdc is part of this big hot ball of money that's running around crypto and is very soon I think going to be running around many other Industries right I think the more people interact with usdc whether it's you know firms like Visa engaging with it and realizing oh my gosh for real-time settlement with vendors or people in our Network we can actually use permission or potential even a permissionless version of usdc to settle these tokenized ious on our Network in real time like wouldn't that be fascinating exciting as stable coins become more and more integrated into the financial system it only accelerates this big hot ball of money but I think to Caitlyn's point it only accelerates the need for new thinking around how deposit taking institutions should function but again the big issue with usdc why did usdc depeg number one Friday afternoon 3 45 PM is not a great time like 15 minutes before the bank choir window closes is not a great time to communicate that you have three billion dollars of exposure to an insolvent Bank like that's just not great timing so kudos to Circle for trying to communicate with Clarity but like doing that 15 minutes before being closed on a Friday I think perpetuated some of the the run over the weekend I think Circle dialed in their comms and again Communications by the way crisis comms really important I think SVD situation and circle situation could have unfolded much differently if both had paid more attention to crisis comms SP maybe kind of pooped the bed Circle I think Friday not so great for comms but over the weekend really dialed it in and Saturday Sunday restored confidence but the big issue is Laura when people are redeeming Bank choirs can't be sent so people are like oh why don't they repeg why don't they repeg i'm like there's no money to move dollars can't be wired on the weekend like you gotta wait till Bank open 9 A.M and so what's really interesting though is again um a bankron basically happened on usdc because of this crisis of confidence tons of people in my DM Saturday night selling you a state C at 88 cents I'm like what are we what are we doing guys just like look at the facts right Max exposure with DPAC usdc to maybe 98 97 cents but they're going to use their operating Capital they're going to use their access to equity Capital to backstop that right there's no way usdc is gonna just leave a hole on their balance sheet but again it's this game theory right you don't want to be the last man left holding the bag or last woman left holding the bag what I think is interesting though is now I do think we're going to see um the battle around stable coins heating up usdc has sort of long had the lead and maintained this sort of narrative around the most regulated stable coin I think true USD if they're still around is also trying to go for that narrative um we're seeing you know crypto collateralized stable coins uh like liquidy USD LUSD which is fully collateralized by Ether and has an automated Redemption mechanism that's all out of action over the weekend die I think at this point unfortunately is too backed by Legacy Finance assets to really be deemed like a non-dollar collateralized stable coin um but there are all these Alternatives emerging and again I do think Sable coins which is so important to this big hop all of money that is crypto markets but yeah the usdc situation I mean I I will be very interested to see the regulatory pressure that gets applied to usdc to me usdc is the next choke point they're going to go after um as the on and off ramp into dollar dollars and I would not be surprised if Circle usdc there was a joke tweet from Brian Armstrong over the weekend or like a fake Tweet someone posted that was a Brian Armstrong coinbase CEO tweet that said oh yeah the IRS has asked us to implement full kyc AML and on-chained forensics on every usdc deposit that gets sent in and out of coinbase something like that happening I think in my view is not very far from the reality of how like the next sort of choke point could come to us onshore crypto and so um yeah just really fascinating uh crisis of confidence transparency and communication can hurt you if not managed carefully and yeah big hot ball of money when it wants to move it's gonna move it's gonna move in whatever way it can whether that's Bitcoin whether that's tether whether that's  coins whether that's Starbucks gift cards when the money wants to move it will move human Ingenuity and the pace of technology and Innovation are unstoppable to think otherwise I think is completely insane and like the fact that this country is run by geriatric Turtles is just absolutely mind-boggling I'm sorry but it's like they're sticking their head in the sand and like withdrawing into their shell and pretending that we live in the 1930s like we we do not live in the world that we lived in even five years ago like let's just wake up to the reality that there's this big hot ball of money and when it wants to move it's gonna move it's gonna move anyway it can usdc perfect illustration of that yeah completely illogical but in hindsight also so logical I just I find it fascinating but definitely concerned about the ability for Regulators to choke usdc maybe I'm overly pessimistic but if they did that to silvergate and signature they're looking at usdc real carefully or it becomes the de facto fed coin there's only one of two ways it could go yeah Caitlin what do you think oh I completely agree there are wells notices that have been sent out just um you know every exchange got Wells notices got Wells notices for what for being unregistered Securities exchanges yes no there hasn't been much did I miss that news or well it was never publicly disclosed and when did that happen uh early February absolutely right and look look at the coordinated action that was taken against paxos which was the issuer is still the issuer of busd I just looked it up there's still eight billion of that it but right but it's obviously crashed in in um due to redemptions uh but but there was a you know a coordinated bazooka shot at paxos they got multiple agency actions all at the same time same thing with Kraken cracking out IRS and SEC at the same time I mean and and there's again a lot that hasn't been announced that I happen to know about behind the scenes that that people have confirmed so absolutely there is no question that it is going to that they're going after it absolutely and and the bank relationships ultimately are are a big a big problem I will uh I will defend uh circle from a comms perspective you're absolutely right Malcolm that there there were issues on on Friday but they didn't know and it's precisely because the banking industry industry is so screwed up when you send your money in a wire you don't know if the money actually settled or not until you get the confirmation from the bank this is ultimately part of the problem that these Technologies are here to solve and they got caught because of course there were massive wires that were sent in in the Silicon Valley Bank final day uh last Friday and uh and no one if you set your Wire by a particular time time you didn't know if it settled and then if you you didn't know when the wires were sent when the ultimate cutoff time was going to be the FDIC hadn't told anyone that yet so if you set the wires at 321 and the cutoff time was 325 then your wires should go through but if you set your wire 326 and the cutoff time was 325 then uh-oh right so they didn't know and this is ultimately a pro just a function of how screwed up the banking system is because it does use 1970s technology yeah okay so let's leave um the audience with a few top-line takeaways because I feel like people need to understand like now that all this has happened what do you guys think is the Outlook generally for crypto companies going forward and I want to included in that why don't we just also talk about because the macro environment had something to do with this in terms of what the Fed was doing with interest rates so if you could just bake in a little bit about about that as well they're all going offshore wow yeah I mean I think diversifying your operations and getting coverage across multiple jurisdictions is going to be really important I do think one really important message and I know you have a lot of viewers who who've been in the crypto space for a while Laura as well as newcomers the biggest issue we have is an industry that also the tech industry has as we saw from The Fallout of svb and just the the Silicon Valley Bank in response to that we have a huge image problem as an industry massive image problem right after the excesses of 2021 and 2022 and just the insane behavior of our industry which like is funny in some ways and I've I'm also guilty of contributing to this um we have a massive reputation issue and at the end of the day this matter is partially going to be won in the court of public opinion because at the end of the day governments right particularly the US government we're coming up to an election year governments are legitimized right by these elections that we have whether or not they mean anything anymore TBD right but the court of public opinion does matter and unfortunately for us the court of public opinion hates Tech and hates crypto why because we come off as arrogant out of touch and so I do think and and again that's that's not casting criticism at anyone or anything but I do think it's very important if we want to win this battle if we want to win in the court of public perception we need to make it popular for both Democrats and Republicans to fight for our industry we need to make it popular for people who are good looking to get elected to run on pro-crypton Pro-Tech platforms and right now unfortunately for most people for most constituents right who remember like who goes out to vote Twitter is not real life who goes out to vote it's typically retirees who have free time who can go to primaries who can spend time in in the polling Booth who can go to voting booth it's people who have something to lose as well and so I think we just really need to think carefully about who we Ally with how we present The Narrative and it needs to have mass populist appeal how we do that to be determined um and I do think there are people in our industry who are telling that story of why crypto matters but if all we're doing is like farming food coins to make crazy yields and talking about crazy exploits like that doesn't really make the case for why we should have popular support but the court of public opinion matters public sentiment matters and so it's just to me that's a big part here is like how do we get other people in the country how do we align with other Industries how do we align with other sectors that are politically influential and Caitlyn by the way like kudos to you for being in Wyoming I think Wyoming has done such a great job as a state right aligning itself with crypto and there there is support for the industry but we need that like across the heartland of America we need that in the rust spell we need that in the midwest like populist support is really important so that's something I'm really interested in number one and crypto has a bad look right now people don't like it people don't like Tech so we we got to think about that number one number two the other really big thing is like it's all about the money and at the end of the day crypto is a massive industry and there is a lot of money big hot ball of money and again if we all move with our money like capital is power in our world so we need to use that Financial Capital as an industry to push for the things we want we're already starting to see some larger Banks looking at banking crypto businesses they maybe wouldn't have touched in the bass because there's there's money to be made that I think as an industry we just need to remember that collectively we do have a lot of financial Capital at our disposal and we can use that in in really new and novel ways and we're starting to see that and again you see firms like coinbase and circle and uniswap and others picking up the mantle and really funding a lot of the efforts particularly here in United States to lobby and otherwise but I think we need to see a lot more of that and the coin shares we're certainly trying to do our part where where we can but those are just my two takeaways that are completely non-tech related but they're they're big problems yeah just to wrap it up um there are huge swaths of this industry that need to burn on a raging funeral prior and uh you know huge amounts of criminals and fraudsters but what has happened is the policy makers have thrown the baby out with the bathwater those of us who were actively trying to get regulated look at how we got treated virtually every company that came to The Regulators to ask for permission to do something got skewered and capital goes to where it's treated best and it's not going to be in the United States for this technology unfortunately yeah I sometimes I look at this and I feel like we're in maybe a historical moment because we have this like rise of Silicon Valley and you know crypto is all about decentralization and I didn't quite think that also meant that it would uh decentralize out like Tech Innovation would decentralized out of the US but it sort of feels like that's what we're seeing which is mind-boggling but anyway um this has been an amazing conversation where can people learn more about each of you and your work custodiabank.com and we're still by the way it's far from over for us even though the the FED didn't didn't let us in we are still a Wyoming special purpose depository institution with a certificate of authority to operate so stay tuned oh obviously we've had to Pivot uh but stay tuned we will have some news and then uh at Caitlyn long underscore on Twitter yep I'm I'm a child of the internet at melts underscore Dem on Twitter um coinshares.com coin shares is not in the business of stable coins or banking we're in the business of asset management but you can learn more about us um yeah but Twitter I've public citizen journalism very excited about it I think um Caitlyn and others in our industry are doing a great job so shout out to them and shout out to all the firms I mean we've been in this for almost a decade now and the fight is just starting and it's um it's gonna be really interesting but big hot ball of money yes Unstoppable all right thank you so much for joining
