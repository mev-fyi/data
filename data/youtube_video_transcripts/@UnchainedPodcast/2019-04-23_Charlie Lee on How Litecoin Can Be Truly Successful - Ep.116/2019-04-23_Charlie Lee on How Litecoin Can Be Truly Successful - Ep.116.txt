hi everyone laura here before we get started a couple quick notes first upon listening to this episode there were two points for I wanted to ask Charlie some follow-up questions that I didn't think of during the recording he agreed to answer those by email so check out the show notes for his responses to those questions you can also find them on Unchained podcast calm in the newsletter section second note if you're like me maybe you think about crypto all day but have no one to talk about it with in your real life yes this describes my situation my friends are at best marginally interested or maybe you're lucky enough to have some real life friends you find crypto fascinating and like to talk about it either way bring yourself or your like-minded buddies to a crypto workshop that I'm teaching with melt and mirrors of coin shares and geology open Putra of future perfect ventures from september 20th to 22nd we'll be at the 250 acre Omega Institute in Rhinebeck New York doing yoga eating healthy food hiking getting spa treatments and join the outdoors and of course talking crypto it's great to see some of you have already signed up if you haven't yet check out the show notes

trace is helping you grow the crypto economy by keeping it safe and secure my guest today is Charlie Lee the creator of litecoin welcome Charlie hey thanks Laura thanks for having me you found out about Bitcoin when it was $2 how did you hear about it and what were your initial thoughts well actually I found out about Bitcoin it was 30 and then it dropped it - / - oh dear okay well I got it I got in at a day high well you learned very early how this this type of money operates I guess yeah it's extremely volatile so yeah how did you hear about it and would like to do immediately grasp it or were you skeptical at first or or what yeah I heard about it from reading an article on Silk Road I believe it was a wired article and was talking about like how the Silk Road drug marketplace only accepted Bitcoin and I I pretty much immediately understood the value of Bitcoin and what it's all about because I've previously been quite into gold and I saw like the the need of sound money and how fiat currency is is just broken and when I saw Bitcoin I saw that this is like go a bit better right it's like go to where you can instantly send it to someone on the other side of the country for very low fees it's so interesting I feel like you're you know maybe the like 10% of people that say that they immediately grasped it because I feel like then I need the other 90% are just like oh I first at first dismissed it but it sounds like you were sort of primed yeah I think I had I just had the background also with the background in computer science I can actually dig into the code and see what it's doing right right and I know it's so previously you worked at Google is that where you were working at that time yeah I worked at Google for six years and what were you doing there let's say I worked on YouTube mobile Chrome OS and also Google Play games all right and so you found out about Bitcoin and it was I guess 2011 yeah April of 2011 I believe so how did you buy your bitcoins at that time the first Bitcoin I bought I actually bought from Mike Hearn so at Google Mike herd was one of the kind of well known guys who was into Bitcoin at that time and he was talking out back on all the time and I reach out to him and I guess learn a bit about Bitcoin from him and bought my first Bitcoin at $30.00 from them oh I see okay so you read about it but then through your work you realized oh there are other people here who are into this yeah there were only like a few right my curtain was one of the bigger ones okay and for people who don't know he's a former Bitcoin core developer who famously left the project with this blog post that was also written about in the New York Times and he talked about how Bitcoin was broken and and sold all of his bitcoins and then he went to work at r3 right is he still working there do you know I don't know I haven't kept in touch with him it was funny because he he famously rage quit from Bitcoin right he was so upset that Bitcoin he thought Bitcoin needed to scale on chain and it wasn't the community wasn't like didn't think the same way and he kind of just raged quit yeah yeah we'll talk about that a little bit more in a bit because I actually don't think he's he was maybe the first like big one but there have been others so at that time like you got your Bitcoin and then what what did you do like what was the early Bitcoin scene like and you know did you just I think I'll just hold on to this for a little while or you know what were your thoughts mmm my thoughts pretty early on was that this is something gonna be something big so I was thinking like if as an investment I think it was it would be like a very good investment of course you just don't know because it's like so new and it's kind of like investing in a start-up right like if you if you had a chance to invest in Google pre-ipo you have been a huge like one of the best investments ever but it's hardly really hard to know that Google would become the Google of today like way back in 1999 or 2000 right so same thing with Bitcoin right I saw it like it had huge potential I really saw the potential in it and I kind of really want to get involved I mean they're back in 2011 like everyone was everyone in this space was thought like chatting on Bitcoin talk forums right and that was like one of the main sites where people talk about Bitcoin all the time and talk about different projects so you were just like troll of forums or not Nina but you would I mean you know you would browse the forums and just converse with people about like what would you do on the forums talk about different like I mean I also like started mining right just la people talking about how like different kind of set of Sachi mine which opposed to use different pool algorithms yeah just everything right including like collecting physical bitcoins for example causations came out I think around that time and that was a very cool collectible you could get at the time also I remember the first Bitcoin conference happened in June of 2011 in New York and basically who's who in Bitcoin I mean pretty much like everyone in that space just gathered in New York and just had a good time really who were some of the people who showed up at that the first day like the morning before the conference I went to kind of an event and I met Roger Vere Jesse Powell Michael Kiwanuka yeah just basically people who are actually really well known today the who is poor probably like nobody back then so Roger Vere was known early on as Bitcoin Jesus now it's affiliated with Bitcoin cash and Jesse palace the CEO of Kraken and who's Michael Conover he is now the CEO of chalasis oh right that's right I did know that I knew the name but I couldn't remember yeah he's not very out there yeah hmm all right so oh I also want to ask about the mining what did you use them to mine the Bitcoin like a CPU or GPU or what when I found out about Bitcoin it was already GPU so I built a couple computers each with like four GPUs in them so large ASIC not certain I see large GPU cards like sticking out of the computer it's pretty crazy setup and it was jet generates like so much heat and noise yeah I actually when your brother was on the show your brother Bobby who people should know it's kind of just a funny detail that Bobby and I were in the same freshman dorm at Stanford but we didn't really know each other that well a bit like the main thing I remembered about him was just he lived in the same Hall as my friend so it was like a big dorm with like 250 kids in it or something yeah um but anyway um I was gonna but no I was gonna say that he also said that he was mining and early and that it was like generating a ton of heat too so I think I sewed my mining computer to him when I was done with it okay yeah yeah he did yeah he did say in the show that you were the one who introduced him and then also when when it dropped from $30 to $2 what was your sense then like were you still so convinced it would succeed yeah I was cuz from my point of view the fundamentals didn't change right so the price drop was just because it was overhyped in the beginning and went up to 30 I think when it like broke dollar parity after it became more than a dollar and went like pretty much straight to 30 and then it crashed down back to two I realized that the fundamentals of Bitcoin hasn't changed so it still has huge potential so definitely wasn't worried but I was kind of enjoying myself just like minding and just playing around with it huh I feel like you need to I don't know being like one of those investment advisors or something and like you just seem so calm and to have such a level head and I wish other people would have the same reaction it's kind of nice to hear yeah I mean the key is to not put everything in write don't invest morning you can afford to lose that's like the the tagline exactly exactly for something you know super risky all right so before you start a lake one you also tried to at least as far as I could tell from what I read online you try to revive a coin called fair bricks or maybe that was something you launched I saw like different one post said that you try to revive and one said you launched it so what's what's the story about fair bricks so the story about fair bricks is there was a coin called tena bricks that used the script mining algorithm and its CPU my noble coin when it launched right so the problem of tenant bricks is it was launched by an anonymous person and he pre mined 7 million coins for himself so what that means is he's just before it like for the in the first block he basically assigned 7 million coins to himself to an address he'll and from that point onwards people everyone's mining like I don't know 10 or 20 coins a block so if the if the coin became successful he would become like extremely rich right and people like the coin because it was one of the like it was the first coin that was CPU my noble so it brought back the CPU mining in the space but then people weren't happy with the pre mines so someone had an idea of creating a coin called fair bricks and the basically a fourth of tenant bricks and the only difference is that it won't have the pre mind so he needed technical help and I offered to all of them technically so wrote the code and helped locks the coin the problem was that the code for tender bricks was really buggy and during the launch of fair bricks just lots of issues came up some of the blocks were mine without any coins and I think the coin was also a 51% attack from the beginning so just lots of problems and kind of decided to give up on that on that project okay yeah it sounds like that's another way in which you sort of like learned the lessons of this face very early actually do you know what I mean yeah yes definitely I mean I was pretty pretty intuitive spaced from there from the beginning right yeah yeah well all right so then tell us why did you create like coin so after after the fair brakes failed right well I didn't didn't really fail just the launch was it was a mess I decided to kind of step back in and create a different quite right start from instead of forking from tenant bricks is code for from Bitcoin and modify a few things so like for CPU mining also a faster blocks and launch something that is like as fair as possible I realize people don't want to invest and put effort into a coin that is unfairly benefiting the creators for example and did you ever consider launching it anonymously the way that Satoshi did actually when I when I launched it I wasn't really I wasn't a public figure right I wasn't publicly no it wasn't publicly known who was behind the username on Bitcoin talk form all right so I went by the user idea yeah Copley CEO plae and I didn't come out until like few years later that with my real identity when I started going to like Bitcoin conferences and kind of revealing myself that's when I came up oh well so and was that like a decision that you were like okay I'm I'm not gonna be anonymous anymore or um kind of there was a New York Times article the author reached out to me to kind of write a little bit about litecoin and at that point in time I decided yeah that's fine I'm okay with that and to come out publicly I think that was a point when I became publicly though and why did you decide that rather than staying anonymous um I don't know I just I didn't think too much about it I wasn't really trying to be anonymous it's just that there was no need to be kind of public about who I was I love my Riyadh nd I mean in hindsight might have been better if I stayed anonymous there's definitely but there's definitely benefits of being anonymous and so yeah why do you say that like what would the benefits have been just more privacy right I'm well I'm definitely concerned about like privacy insecurity and people being upset about me or just people who think I have a lot of money and want to you yeah just just concerned about that yeah yeah it's not the first time this week I'm having this conversation I think it's on the minds of kind of all the prominent people in this face and and I'm sorry that you have to deal with that I really think it's terrible that people would target you know other people for their money but it's the world we live in yeah and it's also not just the fact that it's also it's also the fear of being targeted right maybe no one will ever target me and that's that's awesome if that if that's the case but then always living in kind of fear that you might be a target is just not that finite yeah no I got it I I got it even in my own small way you know I'm not like the actual people in the space but yeah like I wrote that big article about the phone hijackings that were going on and um you know before I released that everybody I interviewed was like Oh before you publish that publish this you should make sure all your security is is you know buttoned up and so I did that and you know I don't know what they would have gotten it might have just been like something to just annoy me because they were irritated that I had exposed what they were doing maybe something like that but but yeah like I I totally get how you feel so actually let's keep talking about the fair launch concept because so when you launched litecoin you only launched it with 150 coins pre mind so how did you you know decide oh so it's like a tiny amount but how did you decide on that like and how did in general like how did you make it what you deemed fair yeah so there's a funny story behind that so the idea was to launch it with I originally only mined two blocks one is the first block is a Genesis block right and then I was from mind up block on top of that to make sure that everything's working fine and the way I I launched litecoin to try to make it as fair as possible is to release the source code in binaries so applications where you can actually start mining I did that a week before the actual launch but the catch is that with the with the source code and the binary you can't mind the main net like when you go any mind test net like coin because I withheld the Genesis block right so the the hash of the Genesis block is is hard-coded in the code but we felt the details of the Genesis block like two constants that you need to know in order for you to actually mine on the main net and what I did was that at launch time I just posted those two constants and all people had to do was update their config file restart the client and would start mining on main that right away right so that was one way that I did to try to make it as as fair as possible because some of the coins were launched where I did the binaries won't aren't released like quickly enough or where the source code wasn't released so there was no way for people to actually verify the source code or compiled binaries from zip for themselves so it's hard for people unless they want to take the risk to actually start running code that you don't trust all right so I tried to make this as fair as possible to make it easy and for anyone to actually start mining the second it was lodged oh that's interesting so let me make sure that I understood this you you did you mind if the Genesis block in one additional block just to make sure everything was working correctly you found that yes you indeed it is working correctly and you were able to get 150 coins so at that point then you release the source code in the binary so people could kind of run their little mining machines I guessed on test net and then once they had had an opportunity to make sure that that was working then what you did was release the details they would note in order to be able to immediately switch to maintenance and that yeah that's that's right and one of the the reason why I might actually mind two blocks instead of just one was because I accidentally connected my mind node to the internet for like a like an hour or so and if someone connected to me they would have downloaded the Genesis block and this is like some technical things so I basically mind another block and lock that in to make sure that no one could actually like secretly mine before the actual launch so that was the idea right so no one could secretly mind before the launch so when I launched it I released the constants the two constants to everyone and people can update their software and start mining right away and it was extremely successful because that also helped protect from 51% attacks so because no one first of all no one could mine before the launch and second while there would be like thousands of people mining at the same time it would be hard to override that network for any one individual over an hour oh well and is that how many people you had mining from the start from from the looks of it yes from like the hash rate that we were solving the beginning there were I would say like a couple thousand people and I thought it's a lot but it's four for the start of a coin it's pretty good it's very yeah and at that time too when nobody really even knew what all this was yeah the community it was small but there was definitely a healthy community play around with with all coins yeah the the interesting thing is a lot of coins forked off from like coin and copied like like quite right but very few coins actually copied the way I launched like coin like people just didn't copy that and they launched it with without binaries or there's a lot of coins that were launched with they call like ninja mining where I've yeah like sometimes they're launched to friends and family only for like the first week so the creator's friends and families are like mining before everyone else get a chance to mind that's interesting well I guess you would think that they would have learned from the ton of bricks situation that like if you do that people are less interested in the coin but I think people in general are greedy right just they yeah I mean if you look back on it one of the reasons why I like coin was successful is I believe it's because of the fair at lunch right but it's hard to kind of figure out that that's truly the case right Oh like meaning you can't know if that developers no no you can't know that you can't know that that's one of the reasons why I like corn was successful oh oh right right so yeah well yeah well so how do you define success like would you say that so far that we're at this moment that it is successful like what what's your goal what's I coin what really successful right so when when I launched like when it was more just like a fun side project right just something I did on a side for fun I didn't expect it to become anything big right they put it in perspective when I first found out about Bitcoin bitcoins market cap was two hundred million dollars when I launched like coin bitcoins market was around like a hundred million dollars so my coin today is five billion dollars right so it's 50 times as large as what Bitcoin was going to launch my bike went lodged so I mean that's extremely I have to say I mean that's I totally didn't expect that to be the case did it to happen and at that time when you say that you launched it as a fun side project like what did you imagine people would use it for it like did you just think oh this is gonna be nothing or did you have some kind of goal for it or what yeah well when I launched like when Bitcoin was still like an unknown quantity right like no one expected no one knew where Bitcoin was heading right it's a decentralized currency that no one's really using for anything except for so Silk Road right so no one really expected much from Bitcoin and I didn't expect much from litecoin right so when I launched it one of the things like I kind of saw it being was what I set out initially being like silver to bitcoins gold or if I saw I saw Bitcoin as digital gold and I've seen through a history of people using more than one currency and in a case of gold and silver and I saw like like Oran compliment a Bitcoin right being kind of a cheaper version of Bitcoin where fees will be less and people potentially could use it for more things okay and when you say silver - bitcoins gold so in the real world silver has like particular uses and so when it comes to the digital world like what would those what were those uses that you were imagining I was thinking more along the lines of both gold and silver being used as money and not necessarily the industrial use of silver which came much later right so being just metals that are rare and sought-after and has value made gold and silver useful for for money okay and and so then like what would be the different ways that Bitcoin would have that you were imagining Bitcoin would be used versus like coin yeah so Bitcoin would be used for for larger purchases right so fees will be higher on Bitcoin so would it wouldn't make sense to buy coffee for example on Bitcoin but you would do so on my coin because the fees will be lower in a smaller percentage of the of the actual purchase the thing with with cryptocurrency is that the fees for transactions are based on the size of the transaction not the amount of the transaction so if you're sending like a million dollars with a Bitcoin it will cost you the same among fees in general as if you're sending like five dollars worth for bitcoins alright so when Bitcoin become becomes really popular and people see the value in paying in using it the fees will would inherently go up and we see that right when the blocks are are full then people are fighting for the block space which is a valuable commodity and people are willing to pay more because you're comparing that to like for example a wired transfer something that takes like few hours and has all the problems with with wire transfer and also cost like $30 to do a wire transfer but if you can send Bitcoin which is you can send like 10 million dollars for Bitcoin and only pay $10 and it's it will confirm in like 10 minutes that's a very good use case compared to you wire so people are willing to pay the ten dollars for for fees so that's why when that's why you'll see like become physical because people actually value spending bitcoin and litecoin having like a larger block size can kind of work alongside that right can compliment Bitcoin for a smaller purchase purchases all right and so actually like after you created litecoin you ended up leaving Google to work at coinbase what did you do there yeah so in 2013 I decided to kind of go all in on crypto and actually work on crypto currency so I joined coinbase because I I realized in order for Bitcoin to succeed it has to be easy to use there has to be easy on ramps and off ramps and corn base was really making it a lot easy for a US citizen suit or people in the u.s. to buy and sell Bitcoin so yeah so I decided to join them in in quick Google all right we're gonna discuss how Charlie famously sold all his like coins after the break but first a quick word from our fabulous sponsors did you know that if money laundering were an economy its GDP would be the size of Canada's large volumes of tainted crypto assets move through financial networks often below the radar of banks cyber criminals use unregulated crypto exchanges to avoid detection no wonder governments around the world are rolling out tough new anti

coinbase I think there was kind of a little stretch where you didn't really work on litecoin so what means you get more involved again and when when did you get more involved yeah there's there's got quite a stretch where I wasn't working that much on my coin I was focused on Bitcoin with coin base and I would say like early 2016 I decided to kind of shift my focus a bit I saw kind of a need for me to kind of set back into to start working on like when again this was because I saw the the Bitcoin having problems with activating Segway there was a lot of just misinformation out there about how Segway is not a good upgrade for Bitcoin and I figured that there's something I can do about that right being the creator of like coin I can help try to get like coin or segwayed activated on litecoin to kind of prove to the world that this is actually a good upgrade that it leads to awesome things like lightning Network and there's nothing to be afraid of right there is a lot of just fake news around separate people for whatever reason don't want to see segments on Bitcoin and they were just talking about the fact that if you use segwayed addresses miners can just steal money from it and it's unsafe to use segue stuff like that that's just from if you understand like Bitcoin and segue from the technical side of things you realize immediately that's just like Fudd right that's people just lying about it trying to scare people away from it yeah and for listeners hopefully my listeners know what seg what is but in case you don't and flood sequitas segregated witness which was like basically a scaling solution for Bitcoin and flood is fear uncertainty and doubt which definitely you should know that term if you're interested in crypto so at that point you decided to basically what leave coinbase and then start working more on like coin in order to bring a Segway to like going to show that you know all the the the misinformation about Sega what was not true is that what your goal was pretty much and also I wanted to it also it's good for litecoin right so this upgrade allows makes it possible for for Lightning Network to happen and I realize that scaling on chain is not a solution because it just hurts decentralization so the solution to scale bitcoin and litecoin is the scale on second layers and lightning Network is a was an up-and-coming solution that really I thought was awesome for for helping scaling scale Bitcoin in like quick so and Segway it was needed for that to happen yeah so in 2016 I told coin based I wanted to start working more on like coin and I took flavor it took three months off to kind of totally work on like point and then when I came back to corn base in like late 2016 I told him I was I wanted to kind of leave coin base and focus 100% on my coin all right so that I guess must have been yeah late 2016 so then a year later is when the curve to markets hit what we now realize was their all-time high and you famously sold all your like coins why did you do that over the over date like over twenties 2017 I became a lot more or 2016 to 2017 I became a lot more influential in the space because of my work on my coin and Segway in helping Bitcoin with Segway and my Twitter follower account like grew exponentially kind of tracking the price of everything but I also I yeah there at that time I realized that what I say had potentially had quite a bit big influence on on prices especially like corn price and some of the informations like some of the tweets I posted people were questioning my motives right am i saying this because I'm trying to pump the like rum price or am I saying this because it's actually good for like quinton people were questioning my motives and also kind of felt conflicted because I don't I don't want I don't want people do you think that I'm doing this for for the price or for my own benefit right my my goal for for everything is to for litecoin to succeed is for for adoption right price doesn't matter in the price doesn't matter right adoption yet price would follow adoption but I shouldn't be focused on price so after thinking about it for a while I decided that I kind of don't want the distraction of both people thinking I'm doing stuff because I I'm pumping the price for my own benefit and also because I don't want the kind of the distraction and questioning myself that I'm not doing this for the best for litecoin but only because I wanted to to make more money so at that point I decided to just sell everything and focus on on the project and not the price well so the day that you announced that you had sold or donated all your like coins that was the day after a light coin hit its all-time high I actually checked it on on chain effects and the day it hit its all time high was three hundred and fifty six dollars and now it's like about 69 so how do you feel about that idea that it looks as though you sold at the top and left others holding the bag mmm that's I don't think that's exactly true because I remember after I sold the price kept going up so that so the day you announced and the day you sold are probably because so but he may did you and nobody the day after you salt didn't didn't it hit like 400 okay I think I sold ya depend on which exchange you look at but it down it definitely hit like 400 but I sold my last sale was that is it like 350 or something okay but for sure the timing is suspect right and that's why people are hating like kept trolling me about selling at all-time high because some people actually thought I caused the whole market to crash which is sweet the was good or it's just the like coin mark what do you mean the whole market well crypto market or just like close yeah but I mean like when they didn't crash more than Bitcoin right it's very close if you look at it today compared to you all the time compared to the day I sewed it hasn't really crash maybe crash a bit more right but not much more right so if I if I caused the hole if I caused like went to Christ and I kinda had to blame me for causing everything to crash and okay but basically like they're saying like your announcement right because like in your announcement you kind of implied that you had sold it all on G docks and it didn't really move the market so it doesn't sound like it was like a ton of like coin no it's not right so one thing about litecoin that people don't don't realize is I didn't pre mine anything right so all the like coins I own were either mined by myself or but on an exchange so I know plenty of people that had a lot more like coins and I did so it's not that unlike people like Vitalik who has a lot of a theorem or like creators of other coins or I seals that just hold on to a lot of their own coins I for ya I didn't have a lot so it my selling coins didn't really affect the market and that's also one of the reasons why I wanted to sell it before I announce it all right so if I if I announce it I think the fear of people fear and how many coins I had would have caused the price to would have heard the price a lot more but by announcing that I already sewed and they didn't affect the price there's no fear that I'm gonna sell more later so I think that helped but I think one thing I didn't kind of account for is people are talking about how not that I don't have like coin anymore I don't have skin in the game right and people said that they don't believe in like me anymore because I don't want any which is so stupid in my opinion right if you're not holding on to like coin because I don't have any then you kind of kind of do your reason your reason for holding and using light coin is just silly to begin with right and I have and the project is already a failure if that's the case right this is supposed to be a decentralized currency so just because the crater doesn't hold it anymore shouldn't affect how useful the currency is so so okay I mean I guess like you know to my mind they're just sort of saying hey incentives exist and a traditional way we motivate people to work on things is to incentivize them you know which is why people get stock options or you know equity or whatever so but you're saying oh that's the old model that's like the startup model in its centralized in a decentralized world that doesn't matter or I mean like what's your take on incentives like don't you agree that kind of to eat your certain degree to a certain degree I agree but unlike other things like I am still extremely incentivized to to work on my coin if like coin succeeds and does well I do well right like just financially I'm already find right I don't I don't like financially I'm not motivated right I'm working harder to date and I then last year or the year before not because I'm financially incentivize kind of I've I'm working on something I'm passionate about so I don't need incentives but people don't realize that and for dumb it matters all right well one other thing I want to ask you about was you've kind of hinted uh you know like you have you have I think strong notions of fairness what's your opinion on coins that allocate a percentage of the block reward to the developers of that coin let me see so I think as long as they're upfront about it it's okay right so people who are invested investing in these coins they know that a certain percentage of block rewards are going out to fund developers and I think that's fine in in some case it's really needed right one thing about litecoin is it's kind of hard to find developers because you we don't have a lot of money to pay for these developers so we're raising like the icon foundation we work on raising money and using money to pay for developers but unlike icos or inner projects we just don't have millions sitting from selling our ICO tokens to fund these developers so yeah I think projects that do that it's kind of lead it but I think for coins like bitcoin and litecoin if you really want to become like decentralized money their hat there can't be any centralizing kind of actions like using mining rewards pay for developers so how does the litecoin Foundation raise funds then we sell merchandises we work off of donations we try to be as efficient as lean as possible so what is the annual budget annual budget is like less than a hundred thousand oh well okay well we'll see yeah when we we have a huge we have a huge network of volunteers and people who are passionate about like coin and sound money and bitcoin that volunteered their time and we don't pay them anything and I'm very grateful to these volunteers that help us out a lot hmm yeah this is really interesting because during that ico phase or the fad protocols phase or not fat protocols but yeah it's it's really uh it's it's even before the word ICO was used in when people are talking about app coins if you like at that time everyone was like oh like the point is you you know do a crowdfunding so conceived eise's those people to grow the network however what we've seen is those were just speculators who frankly aren't really incentivized to grow the network like a lot of these people aren't using these coins they're just holding on to them as soon as they can right yeah and it's fascinating how you guys don't have that mechanism and yet you do have volunteers who I guess passionately believe in like coin and are trying to help promote it so hmm I think basically this means that all the cryptic economics theorists who many of whom I featured on my show because yes I do find these ideas fascinating probably a lot of their theories have been proven incorrect so we will have to see what it actually turns out to work well at least in the case of light coin right litecoin is is much different at least a project the foundation is very different from other other coins and foundations yeah yeah for sure so you talked about you know that early vision for a light coin what is your vision now is it different or is it the same like what do you imagine it will be used for now or you know what are the ways in what you're trying to get it used it's very similar right I still see I've always seen like like coin as a complement to Bitcoin I see big get go I'm still being used like like coin is not out there to replace Bitcoin unlike a lot of other coins that I try to say they're the they're better than Bitcoin I think it's it's trade-off so a lot of people don't talk about the trade-offs people talk about how they have fees are cheaper right pick on cash constantly talks about our people people in support of Bitcoin cash constantly talks about how pick on cash transaction fees are like a hundreth of that of Bitcoin but you get what you pay for right the Bitcoin security is more than hundred times that of Bitcoin cash right maybe the hash rate is not more than hundred but the fact that bitcoins security is like you can't you can't attack Bitcoin whereas you can easily attack the quick cash so that matters a lot right so that's why the fees are less and same for a like coin alright litecoin is cheaper and the security is less than Bitcoin so if I if I'm sending like millions of dollars worth like coin it's not as secure and sending million dollars of Bitcoin so people who actually moving lots of money they would want to use Bitcoin and I think that's fine like Lincoln compliment Bitcoin perfectly fine and with with Lightning Network one of the reasons why I think lightning I agree that were is really good for both Bitcoin litecoin not only does it help a scale it can also add like cross chain atomic swaps where people can easily in a decentralized manner swap between two different coins instantly right I think things like technologies like that we haven't really seen the true potential of debt like I'm excited for what like what was we'll see there yeah I just the concept of it is so cool one thing though is so if the main purpose of like coin is for payments why would someone use light coin over a stable coin it depends right so it depends on how easy it is for you to get that same old coin right and the stable coin in the end is still likely to be controlled right by governments or our companies so you're still at the whim of that central centralized party right whereas like coin is decentralized like Bitcoin yeah well I mean stable that you know there's kind of a spectrum of how stable or how centralized stable coins are yeah but then but the the decentralized theable coins have not proven to work yet right possibly that we'll find one that is that works perfectly but the the kind of the attack surface for that is potentially pretty large and it's unclear if they will actually work long term we've seen many algorithmic stable coins fail over time yeah or if you shut down by the sec well if there's truly decentralized them they can't be shut down right but yeah but there's also a possibility of me getting shut down right so like for example Tedder could be shut down and also they are you have to trust the company that they're not they have enough money to back their reserves yeah you never deserve sit back the coins right so and then also with with most of these stable coins they're still they're not censorship resisted all right that's one thing about cryptocurrency one of the values of cryptocurrency is the censorship resistant part right I would say that's that's what gives cryptocurrency most of its value well what about die I don't think that's sensible however it's not very stable because as we've seen it hasn't been able to keep the dollar pig but that aside I don't think that one is sensible right I'm not too sure about that but I think it's also a bits there's it's centralized right it's not perfectly decentral not I mean I guess nothing is perfectly into centralized but there's centralized aspect of it I looking to die more I honestly don't know too much about it I'm not really that excited about about stable coins okay huh interesting because that was all the rage last year and into this year so we'll see if he were right it is it's funny it's funny you talking about stable coins that it's not actually stable so I know but I have to admit I'm a little bit obsessed with died my listeners will know that from listen to my show yeah I've I did a really really double episode with rune Christensen of maker dowel which is you know for the die stable coin because it's a very complicated system and just kind of endlessly fascinating but anyway so speaking of spending late coins where can people spend their like coins right now a lot of places right so like corn is obviously not as s everywhere as as Bitcoin even then bitcoins not you can't really spend it everywhere either so you can spend like coin on pretty much everything right so like plane tick is meals buying stuff online we have like whole directory of places you can you can spend like coin I think the general idea is just to have more and more places that you can spend any for bitcoin and litecoin right so I think in order for it truly to be successful is you can spend it anywhere right it's kind of like kind of like if you look at Visa MasterCard like credit cards you can pretty much spend it anywhere right we want to get there but it's a it's a chicken-egg problem people for one thing because the volatility of the currency a lot of people don't want to spend it because they they think that it's going to be worth more in the future but that that problem I think will solve itself over time as it becomes less volatile and you need more merchants to accept it before people can spend it anywhere and you need more people to spend it before merchants realize the benefit of accepting it so it's a it's a tough nut to crack yeah I mean I feel like coinbase went down this route with Bitcoin where they tried the merchants thing and it didn't work out so like why you know why do you think that strategy will work for like coin I think when coin base and bitpay did that it's a bit too early I think we need like technologies like lightning Network to make payments make more sense and you need the price to become less volatile for payments to to succeed so when coin base and bitpay were doing it it was in or 2013-2014 I think it was too early yeah I feel like we could make that argument now still and and not only that but this goes back to my question about the stable coins but um but anyway actually let's move on cuz also like coin is looking and adding privacy I saw you mentioned that confidential transactions was one technology technology you were looking at and also the memo level protocol are you planning on making litecoin a privacy coin or will this be optional privacy and and like with you know both of these technologies like are you gonna give users a choice of which type of privacy technology or what's going on sure so the reason why I'm looking to it is I realized that one of the properties of good money that's I think the only property of good sound money that's missing from bitcoin and litecoin is fungibility right the ability to treat every single coin exactly the same as every other coin right we don't have that today if I send you some like coins or if I said like if I send you two different like coin they're they're different because of their history which is public on the blockchain so you can see which point where the coins came from and you can use that to to discriminate against one or the other of the coins whereas like cash for example is fungible if I go to your store and I want to pay something with twenty dollar bills I have to to choose from it doesn't matter which one I give the clerk it's it acts the same right it's money you want for good money for money to be like reformed with money you want it to be fungible and for for cryptocurrency from privacy is required for fungibility all right if there's if you don't have privacy then you can always discriminate between two different coins so in order so I realized that I wanted to kind of add more fungibility like coin in that sense I want to add more privacy and things I was looking at was confidential transaction and also a member when Bo remember when Bo is actually also has confidence transaction so it's like it's pretty much like confidential transaction plus coin joint and it's something that we're exploring right now and the current thought is to add it as a soft fork and also opt in so you can opt into using nimbo Wimble moving your coins to kind of remember when both side of things into the member one more extension block yeah so it we'll see where we go with that but still work-in-progress still a lot of work to be done so will that be like Z cache the way that on the on the Z cache watching you can see some transactions but other ones you can't similar but it's more you can think of it as moving your coins to kind of a side chain that's kind of attached does that make sense so you're you can move into the member window space once you're there everything is is private okay and then you can also move out you can pull the coins out of the number one what's this oh well alright and so are you definitely implementing that or you're just exploring it right now we're exploring it I really want to do it in the end we'll see if the community seems seems like seems it liked the idea so once we have a good grasp of where like when we want to do we'll put together a proposal for the community to review have to keep I'll have to keep tabs on that because I find the member level technology fascinating I just did a couple episodes on grin and beam and yeah super cool stuff so recently I did see some tweets that were critical of you and litecoin and I wanted to get your response to them sure you probably saw them Mike Novogratz of galaxy digital tweeted gold has an eight point five trillion dollar market cap silver is fifteen billion dollars that is 0.17% BTC has a 90 billion dollar market cap and LTC is 5.7 billion dollars which is six point four percent of BTC and then he said silver is at least useful for industrial production LTC is a glorified test net for BTC I don't get this rally cell LTC by BTC so that's one and then the other one was like a shorter one to char chain of multi coin capital said LTC isn't the silver to bitcoins gold but the fool's gold what's your response to tweets like this why I didn't respond kind of to to those tweets basically there's there's more value to LTC than to like when Dan just being a test net right being a glorified test net but I also do and also like the comparison between gold and silver is not like it can't take it to to literally right it's just because silver is a certain percentage of gold doesn't mean that like Quinn has to be that percentage otherwise it's overvalued or undervalued I think that's kind of silly to to go to that extent of saying that because yeah because like coin ratio of Bitcoin is less than R is more than Silver's racially code it must be overvalued I think I can't imagine why anyone would make that comparison well the digital world has to be exactly like the real world yeah yeah it's kind of it's kind of funny but also I do question like the motivation behind some of these tweets for example multi coin capital is has publicly said that they're shorting like coin right so of course they every chance they get they will bash like coin even release an article or like a whole analysis why they think like coin should go to zero right so it's - they're yeah they have skin in the game - if we're like going to to not succeed so I don't really put much weight into their their posts or their tweets and I don't know if my Novogratz has any asteroid like corn or anything like that but you don't know right so I don't put too much value into people hating on my queen so you're the managing director of the like Wayne foundation how does governance work within the foundation and how much weight do you have within it as the creator of litecoin in terms of what I mean for the foundation I am the managing director we have few directors and we we talk about stuff right so we we respect each other and there's no there's really no formal formal process of how decisions are made it's kind of made within this between the directors and I think just being the creator I I definitely have a lot of things that's right because people trust me and they trust my view right of things and that that helps a lot but in terms of like in n like coin is still a a decentralized currency right so the the like one foundation is kind of a centralizing company but we we can't you know Dalek lis make decisions for everything right so in an the community also has a huge voice in how like coin what happens to you like coin for example before the like creme foundation we had something called the like wine Association right it's it's also a centralizing essential company or foundation that was there to help kind of promote and help work on like coin and they weren't doing a very good job and that's why we formed the like wine foundation to take over and do a better job so if if one day the Lincoln foundation is like not doing a good job someone else can can kind of create another foundation do you help out it's similar to how like the Bitcoin foundation a lot of people think the Bitcoin foundation is not really doing anything right but they have the name the Bitcoin foundation yeah I have not heard anything that they're up to for the longest time I sometimes forget they even exist yeah but they were a huge deal when they first formed right right great I wasn't around back then but I can tell from stuff I've read so alright you grasp the concept of cryptocurrency early and kind of the potential there so what do you think the world will look like in the future if crypto does become widely used I think that we won't even know that you're using crypto currency in the backend so yeah so I think if crypto currency really does become successful becomes used by become used by everyone in the world you won't even realize it right so you I think the the point the whole point of this for money is transfer of value right all you care about is your transferring value from your wallet to the merchants wallet and they give you the item that you bought and in the future that could happen with you sending them money and you don't realize that in the back end it's actually Bitcoin or look more like corn or anything right and that's when it really becomes successful so you think it's really just about payments and like machines making those payments happen in a way that's more efficient but you're not aware of it yeah so there will be yeah some people call like Bitcoin the kind of Internet of money or just money that can be API for money right so you can machines AI or you or humans will be using it and you won't it's all about storing the value and spending the value and that's all that matters and then alright well we will see we will see you if this comes to fruition so it's been so great having you on Unchained I did mean to ask a question about magical crypto funds but we basically ran out of time so where can people learn more about you magical crypto friends and also like coin yes a we we I'm doing I'm one of four people on the magical friends podcast it's me Samsung mal fluffy pony or Ricardo Stang me and whale Panda but you can check us out at though friends I think it's magical group of friends calm or you can find us on YouTube and we're also doing a conference magical crypto conference in New York in May 11 and 12 come visit us there I think it's good it's an awesome conference and you can also follow me on Twitter Satoshi light yeah it's I'm pretty easy if you find alright and also can I have a press ticket to magical crypto conference no harsh yeah I actually I actually had to pay for my own like I want to buy a ticket for a friend so I had to pay for myself cuz they're literally press tickets you have to talk to wheel panda how about that I'm not in charge of press tickets but like we yeah we tried to be very as fair as possible and possibly about that okay bird I know guess I'll contact him and find out he of course amongst the Freeview he's the only one I don't know but anyway you want a good word for me yeah I'm sure he knows who you are alright thanks so much for well actually oh also charlie thank you for joining us sure yeah for sure it was a lot of fun thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about Charlie and litecoin check out the show notes inside your podcast player if you are not yet sign up for my weekly newsletter go to unchain podcast calm right now to get my thoughts on the top crypto stories of the week and be sure to check out our new channel on YouTube Unchained is produced by me Laura
