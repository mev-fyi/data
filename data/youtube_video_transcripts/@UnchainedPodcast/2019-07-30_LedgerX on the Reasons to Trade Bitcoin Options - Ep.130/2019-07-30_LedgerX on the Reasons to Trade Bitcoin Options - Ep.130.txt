regulators themselves use cipher trace to comply with regulation and to monitor compliance my guest for today is too thick a Chow co-founder and chief operating officer and chief risk officer for ledger X welcome to theca thanks for having me Laura let your X reached a major milestone recently a first for the crypto space why don't you tell the listener is what that is sure so ledger X we recently received a license that allows us to open up our institutional platform to retail investors and then more exciting we recently actually launched it to retail investors so retail investors can have access to the same derivatives products options that the ledger ex institutional customer base has been trading for almost two years now and why don't you elaborate on that like what is it that ledger ex has been doing for the last few years we are a u.s. federally regulated by the CFTC exchange and Clearing House and what that really means is that we have a platform that allows people to come and trade a wide variety of products from Bitcoin to Bitcoin options and other sorts of swaps and then the Clearing House is the part that guarantees the trade to give the customers the safety and security of of knowing that the trades will settle in a regulated manner and so we had launched that to institutional customers in October of 2017 we were restricted in terms of our license to only allow that to access to institutions but we had worked with the regulators over the last maybe six to nine months to get a new license and really be able to expand that offering so that any customer can have access to this you know highly regulated platform for getting into and out of Bitcoin and I think that's really a key part of our products is that we touch both Fiat and bitcoins so customers can buy a call option and receive actual Bitcoin or buy a swap and receive Bitcoin and so that's an important element that we usually call physically settled derivatives and for so long in the space the rallying cry has been Hodel or huddle so why is it that someone would want to buy a derivative of that coin rather than Bitcoin itself so derivatives and options in particular allow a wide range of exposures and trades that that people can do that can really enhance long positions that they have already so let's say somebody is long Bitcoin and they do want to hold but they're not earning any you know yield or return on their Bitcoin they can use options to to essentially earn some implied yield and and generate some return similarly if people want to get levered exposure on the long side so they can buy call options instead of buying options and and so I think what we see at Ledger X is a wide range of customers and customer base coming in to trade options for a whole bunch of different reasons I mean this is why I think options in particular are not zero-sum because especially if you deal in the physical they touch into the world outside of the of just a single trade and and both sides can really benefit depending on their specific considerations and constraints why don't we walk through some of those examples because they feel like we're just talking about it in the abstract can be kind of hard to wrap your mind around but what's let's just start with a call option first just define what that is and then walk me through why someone would you know would choose to buy a Bitcoin call option so the the standard academic definition of an option is that it is the right but not the obligation to purchase an underlying we'll call it Bitcoin here at a certain price on a certain date in the future and I think the the way that I like to think about options as opposed to just spot or you know Bitcoin is really the the last part of that definition the two components that you do not get if you're just buying or selling Bitcoin and that is a strike price and an expiration date so if we want to just buy or sell Bitcoin right now let's say it's around $10,000 I can buy it at ten thousand or I can sell it at ten thousand but if I want to trade a call option well now there's a much wider range of trades that I can do so for example I can take a call option that expires December of 2019 so December of this year with a $25,000 strike price and this option on ledger X is around five hundred dollars right now so if I am a maybe I'm a long holder or maybe I am somebody new to Bitcoin that wants to get up side exposure but I might be a little bit worried about having as much capital at risk if I buy Bitcoin at ten thousand and I know that it can go down to you know seven 6,000 just because it is a volatile asset I might instead decide to buy a call option for five hundred dollars the most I could lose is that five hundred dollars and if if Bitcoin does rally significantly then I can make you know essentially have that upside exposure and and still make money with the big rally yeah I saw an interview that re Paul did with CNBC when he had purchased call options for 50k Bitcoin by the end of 2018 this was in and he had purchased that my guess in December 2017 and the CNBC anchors were very confused like why would you do this and he was like look I view it as a way of you know because he he runs blocked our capital one of the crypto funds he he was like I view it as a way of being able to capture upside if Bitcoin does you know go go up and yet during this time when maybe there is volatility and maybe the price could could drop you know like 80 percent or whatever that I would be able to hold fewer bitcoins on my balance sheet and keep my the assets of my LPS from you know from dropping that 80 percent or whatever it might be and you know he was just like this is a way - yeah - sort of like limit the downside explosion I think he only paid thirty six hundred for that and so you know it's a nominal amount for the size of his fund and yeah you know at that time when Bitcoin was twenty thousand and he just was like okay is this bubble is it not he didn't know he thought okay if it's higher than a 50k at the end of 2018 you know then I'd like to make sure I I have I have that in my fund alright so now let's do the opposite let's and also let's clarify one other thing which is I think that and correct me if I'm wrong I think that normally people use call options for those kinds of bets where they expect that or not that they expected they want to ride any trends upwards right like all options are generally for prices that are higher than what it's currently trading at is that correct that's correct yes in terms of the in terms of the contracts that people typically trade for call options it's with the higher strike prices okay so now let's talk about a put option what is that again you know define it and then walk me through why someone might prefer to buy a Bitcoin put option over Bitcoin so a put option is to use the academic definition again the right but not the obligation to sell Bitcoin a certain price on a certain date in the future and so put options are very often used for people almost as insurance where they're using them to protect their downside so it could be maybe if it's you know if we're talking about a fund or even an individual that has Bitcoin and they are a little bit worried maybe about some short-term decline or you know or the some of the headline risks that could cause Bitcoin to fall significantly they might buy a you know maybe a eight thousand strike put option and so what they're doing is they're buying insurance so that if something does happen and Bitcoin goes to 6,000 well now they have the right to sell Bitcoin at eight thousand and so they could have protected their position in a way and the benefit of a put option similar to a call option is that you'll never lose more than you pay for the option and now so I gave the example of Ari who's running a crypto fund what are some other examples of the kinds of people who buy these options and you know why well I think the actually the the crypto fund I think is an interesting example that ties in puts and calls because I think the the re example is one that shows how unintuitive lis you know buying call options which is ostensibly a bullish very positive type trade can actually when you tie in the world outside of it can actually be slightly you know bearish in a way if the alternative is essentially sizing down a Bitcoin position and then just having some levered upside calls in case you know you get benchmarks to Bitcoin and you don't want to miss out on the rally so I think funds use both puts and calls for a wide variety of trading around their positions you know I think we've seen in volatile environments we tend to see more hedging particularly if people let's say they're selling options and can capture some of the volatility premium and then in low-volatility environments like last last year maybe july august we see both trading shops as well as companies even using options as a way to find more interesting trading opportunities when they don't think there's enough opportunity in just trading Bitcoin itself but I think one of the really key pieces of the participant base for us our customers like miners and individuals who are long holders you know may have been in Bitcoin for a while or maybe recently and the reason that those are crucial is because they touch the physical you know miners obviously touch the physical they deal in it every day and so they're the reason that we found it so important that we have to deal in the physical in order to provide them with these hedging instruments that actually make sense for them and elaborate on that like why and this is actually something I was wondering - so in contrast the Bitcoin futures contracts that trades on CME is what's called cash settled meaning that at the end of the trade instead of getting Bitcoin back you get like the dollar equivalent of of what the the value was of that trade so for a miner just describe you know why that's a bad thing for them like like why they would prefer something physically settled so miners have you can almost think of them like like similar to gold for example but so Bitcoin miners they invest you know dollars in their infrastructure and then they earn a fixed number of Bitcoin and so that bitcoin is you know it's a obviously same number of Bitcoin that they earn in the the mining reward but the price of it as denominated in dollars fluctuates and so they're exposed to the price risk of US dollar versus Bitcoin and so the cleanest hedge for a miner to hedge that is actually to be able to take the physical Bitcoin that they have to pledge it as collateral or if they're just gonna sell it to sell it and then to earn dollars back as opposed to if they had to essentially take their Bitcoin convert it to dollars and then use that dollar for a hedge and then wait for that hedge to settle for cap to cash so it suits you know it suits both their price risk it's a much cleaner edge because it's exactly the price risks that they face and then it suits their operations because they have Bitcoin and they're very comfortable sending Bitcoin as collateral which is and I really wouldn't under appreciate that point that when you deal in the physical and accepting Bitcoin as a form of collateral is hugely powerful because you know we see that ledger X anyone can send it 24/7 365 outside of any banking windows let's talk a little bit more about this you know physically settled aspect so how does it work exactly I when I decide to buy or sell a Bitcoin call or put option you can pick whichever example it is do I literally send you my Bitcoin to do that and then at that point what happened what do you do with it so you the options that we have are dollar denominated so you can either send US dollars and use those dollars to purchase an option a call option let's say or you can send this Bitcoin and and then sell the Bitcoin on the platform and then use those dollars to to purchase the option and in either case we custody the both the fiat and the Bitcoin as a centralized custodian and then once the trade settles people are returned what the Fiat that they sent if they sent Fiat or and then the Bitcoin they sent if they say Bitcoin or so it so the mechanics are that if you purchase let's say you purchase a call option let's say that twenty five thousand strike call option so you purchase it for five hundred dollars so you pay five hundred dollars today and then when it expires in December if it's in the money so let's say Bitcoin is at thirty thousand then you'll purchase Bitcoin for twenty five thousand dollars so you'll pay twenty five thousand dollars and you'll receive one Bitcoin and then for the person on the other end of that trade like how do you ensure that you'll have the Bitcoin that you can deliver yep so that's exactly what we that's really what we do as a as a central clearinghouse so at the time that the seller does takes the other side of the trade they collect five hundred dollars today and they're posting one Bitcoin with ledger X and ledger X holds that Bitcoin until the maturity so that we can guarantee that if you decide to exercise your your call option that we have the Bitcoin and how do you store all those bitcoins do you put them in some kind of cold storage that only you control that you know at the time the contract ends you're the one who decides where the Bitcoin goes or is it like some kind of multi-sig where like the parties have to sign off or how does that part work we have to have ultimate control over it that's the only way that we can accept it as a form of collateral okay and and I'm assuming it's is it in cold storage we don't go into too much detail publicly about how exactly we do it okay okay yeah well that makes sense so why is it that that letter X decided to focus on derivatives so it's kind of twofold one is that you know I come from an options background and I really do believe that options are a very important piece of the development of a market that you know that is a has elements of being a financial instrument and we saw you know companies that were in the space that we're doing you know real producing real businesses consumer facing merchants facing using bitcoin remittances things like that and in the course of their business what they were doing is they were warehousing Bitcoin on their balance sheet in order to insulate their end customer from the price volatility risk and so you know we kind of thought one example is that if they had better tools to be able to hedge the risk on their balance sheet similar to how you know large like oil producers do then they could scale their businesses and provide you know more of these use cases you for Bitcoin to to other people and so we thought that would be good for the ecosystem in you know and that these could be used in a wide variety of ways but there's another element which is that we knew it was a very deliberate approach from a regulatory point of view because we didn't want to go down the path of the state by state licenses we knew that the federal path was going to be harder but we wanted just one federal regulator that was a regulator that you know most people would be familiar with and that would have preemption over the states and when you say that you wanted to avoid having to go state-by-state that's basically the process that company is like coinbase like some of the exchange the the regular spot exchanges have had to go through his that was a kind of company that has to do that exactly yes and so amongst some of the other exchanges working in crypto derivatives like backed in Eris X they're focused on futures why is your focus a little bit more on options well you know I think the I think ultimately a lot of other people will eventually get to options as well you know for us it's when what we see in particular is the because bitcoin is so volatile options present opportunity that you can't really get from a linear instrument and so some of these cases when we talk about earning yield off of Bitcoin by selling call options that's unique because of bitcoins volatility and options are really I think the only way to both capture the volatility as well as to help dampen the volatility over time yeah and just to explain that a little bit more for listeners when she talks about yield I think or 1 jhooth good when you're talking about yield I think what you're referring to is that example of a miner can kind of put up a bit like they can I think it's purchase a call option I guess it would be and then they earn the price that the the buyer is paying for that call option so let's say they earn like five hundred dollars for putting up that Bitcoin and then and then later on if the contract has purchased at least they've sold the Bitcoin for higher than than what it was at the time that the the call option was made to like so let's say the Bitcoin is ten thousand dollars now and they do that and then they earn the five hundred dollars but then later if you know the the price does go above whatever the strike price is then at least they haven't had to sell the Bitcoin for ten thousand you know they sold it for like fifteen thousand or whatever in the future um is that is that what you mean there was something about this we're like when I learned about it reminded me a little bit of like maker Dow and how people put up a this collateral and get dive which was pegged to u.s. dollars in the meantime I'm not super familiar maker down but in the case of what you were saying for the the call options that's correct so a miner would a miner would sell a call option they would collect five hundred dollars today for that $25,000 strike and then if when at expiration Bitcoin is at above twenty five thousand and they'll sell Bitcoin for twenty five thousand which they might prefer to if they had to sell you know some of their Bitcoin today at ten thousand and then if bitcoins below twenty five thousand then they just get their Bitcoin back and they can you know do that trade again and so they can essentially earn that's you know five hundred dollars over a like five month period one other way that I wanted to ask about so earlier what the futures you know I seem to just with my question it sort of felt like it was to me that it would be preferable to me to receive you know the fit have a physically settled contract where I am receiving Bitcoin back simply because it's so volatile it would be like oh maybe if I did a trade but then later I might realize that like a date later I would have gotten a lot more money for it or something do you not like if it we're settling in dollars as opposed to Bitcoin but then another thing was that just from the purchasers perspective they also have the flexibility of like whether or not to to actually buy on the expiration date right like as far as I understand maybe I'm wrong yeah so yeah so that also gives the purchaser more flexibility so why so it just feels like cash-settled derivatives are always going to be superior sorry an opposite physically settled derivatives will always be superior to cash settles that correct yep I think so I think that's absolutely correct huh okay all right well I mean that's why we're yeah and and I think the you know the reason that I think some people go down the route of cash settled is because it is easier it's much easier to get to launch because it's easier from a regulatory point of view you know because the regulators are already comfortable with holding cash and to some degree settling to cash though arguably settling to cash in this market as you alluded to is not very prudent but but yeah I think especially especially in a market like Bitcoin where the physical is so easy to move you know physical commodities in general or very very important markets and that's coming from markets where it's actually difficult to store and move the physical commodity but Bitcoin has you know has that in spades right I think I was reading one of your blog posts or something and you talked about how it's not like you have to deliver a barrel of crude at the end of the Train um all right so let's dive a little bit more into Omni then so that you know this is the platform where both retail and institutional customers can actually interact in the same marketplace before launching Omni I think customers on your platform needed to have a minimum of 10 million dollars in assets and now there's actually no net worth requirement if I'm if you know if correct me if I'm wrong about any of this um so just one thing that made me wonder is is it desirable from a retail perspective to have the entity that you're training with be an institution like is there some way that they could be at a disadvantage because they don't have the same tools or what does that really not apply here I I think in general you know and I'll extract from this even a little bit because I come from the high frequency trading background which is you know obviously gets a lot of these types of questions and I think in general having institutions is much better for retail liquidity you know institutions are they're out there on multiple platforms I'm hedging very efficiently and so that just provides better and better pricing for retail what price or index are you guys using to determine whether or not the the price actually hits the strike price for any specific contract because as we've seen the crypto space has you know a lot of fake trading and there are flash crashes and we even saw apparently I saw on Twitter at least I did not look into this myself but it's from a fairly credible source that it looks like there might have been people who were manipulating prices on bitstamp in order to profit on bit mechs so how can you guys determine whether or not a price is legitimate and isn't being manipulated for profits on letter X yeah I mean it's a huge it's a huge issue with with spot markets and with overseas exchanges and you know so outside of surveilling our own markets on the beauty of our products is if we go back to that example of you bought a call up for 500 dollars with a $25,000 strike price when expiration comes you get to decide if you want to exercise that options and pay $25,000 to buy Bitcoin so all ledger X does is we just do the delivery of the trade but we don't make any determination as to whether that option is you know in the money or essentially whether Bitcoin is above 25,000 or below we leave that up to whoever the long holder is and so that way they can factor in different you know exchanges different things they see and and make the determination that they think is appropriate oh okay wow that's that's pretty genius and probably a load off your back and ledger X is saying that it will never charge any fees for trades so if that's the case how do you make money so I think Paul went into this a little bit on one of his blog posts so for Omni there are no fees and then for the institutions we charge on the on their side for essentially a maker fee so the Omni has no side and no fees and taking and so that's you know we make the money off the institutions and as Paul alluded to the institutions you know the professional traders they price it in any way and so it's kind of part of our way to just keep the fee schedules very transparent you know the price that you pay is is what you're getting for it and not having and then you know on the institutional side they know exactly what they're paying and they price it in so we make it on that side and you have a wait list of about 3,000 people I believe so why why is there a wait list at all well I mean so for us as we work through adding you know users there's a whole host of operational and regulatory you know additional items that we just want to make sure we get completely right you know I think one of the things that we get really good feedback on for the ledger X institutional platform is that people have had just a really good experience and so we want to make sure that as Omni customers come on everyone all of our stakeholders from the cost all the way down to the regulators and the banks are also continue to be very happy with the Leger ex experience and you launch with 15 institutions in 2017 how many institutions do you have on your platform now it's about 250 now and I thought that Paul said recently in an interview on cheddar that the institutional market has been slower to materialize and that Leger ex thinks the opportunity is in the retail market why do you guys think that and what does the size of that opportunity look like so you know I think for us from it for us to kind of put institutional into context you know as you mentioned our requirements are around 10 million dollars or more in assets and so we would definitely see significant interest in maybe the smaller size institutions but for what people traditionally refer to as you know financial institutions getting to the very very large you know hedge funds and investment banks I think bitcoins market cap is still not large enough for the opportunity to be meaningful to them you know even at 200 billion that's just the size of the stock really and so it's not really feasible for them to devote a whole bunch of resources for a trading desk for something like this when it is still pretty small and opportunity and when they can kind of wait and then throw more recent resources at it later when it's larger so we see the you know the opportunity on the other end of the spectrum but that said you know 200 billion in market cap is still a lot that's really big to a small company like I'm like ledger axon to some of our customers and so we're seeing you know we had a record 2nd quarter we're seeing a ton of demand that is really meaningful to us and when you save records second quarter what was the volume I was about 200 million worth of derivatives traded and cleared in the second quarter great so we're gonna discuss some of the more unique contracts on the platform as well as regulation in a moment but first a quick words from the sponsors who make this show possible will the

on the App Store and Google Play back to my conversation would you think a tower of ledger acts so something I was curious about was what would happen if a Bitcoin heart fork happened during the period of a contract like let's say that you had had these physically settled contracts trading on August 1st 2017 like who would have kept the Bitcoin cash that resulted from the bitcoins that were you in your possession at that time or or like for any era jobs or anything like that how do you guys handle that yeah it's a great question so we have a you know we've posted it's especially around the time when there are a lot of hard Forks are a general approach to our hard fork policy the short answer is that there is no clear answer because it really does depend on each fork it depends on our ability to it depends on the fourth coin it depends on if if that's traded on an exchange it depends if that has regulatory implications as well like if somebody forts Bitcoin into something that resembles a security it depends on the security of the the fourth coin itself so you know it is in general as a centralized custodian the value you know should accrue to our participants but in each case I mean I believe there was a fork a specific fork that we actually gave our specific guidance on it should be somewhere on our website but we really have to take a case by case at this point so let's talk about something else that's kind of unique to this space which is that you guys have a Bitcoin having contract in which people can trade contracts that I guess are like sort of basically bets on what on the one I can't even speak today and when the next having will be and for people who aren't aware of what having is it's when the block rewards which is the number of new bitcoins that are minted by the software every 10 minutes that's when the rewards will be cut in half so right now it's 12.5 bitcoins that are released every ten minutes and at some point next year like in the spring early summer it's going to be 6.25 so describe for for listeners how this Bitcoin having contract works yeah it's a it's so it's a pretty as you kind of mention it's pretty straightforward contract on when the happening will occur so it's it pays off if the happening occurs before a certain date the contract pays off and then if it does and it ends up in zero so it's a binary contract in that way and who is trading that contract and why would that like why would they want a bet on that how does that help them also you know we can always come back to the case of of miners for example who have obvious exposure to the havening and then you know other participants I mean I think some people sort of look at the happening as possibly a catalyst for for Bitcoin price appreciation based on what's happened that happened that previous happenings as well as just you know if there's a view that as the mining reward goes down transaction fees go up a lot of both businesses and individuals and companies have exposure to the happening and so being able to to hedge that exposure you know in in a pretty direct way you know hedging when it'll happen is is important to customers and searches so I understand it from the mindset of a miner it's a little bit like okay if the block reward gets cut earlier than I expected and my revenue goes down earlier than I expected then essentially I can make a little bit of money that you know off this off this contract is that sort of why they're purchasing it yeah exactly and so it would be exactly that so so if the you know let's say it happens like a month or two earlier then the contract pays out which you know hopefully offset some of the loss from the the reward going down sooner than expected and so this having contract is based on the technicals of the network waters other examples of types of contracts you could imagine that are also unique to crypto assets that you know cuz cuz like this contract you couldn't have this in a normal in traditional financial services right like this is something unique to the crypto asset space so are there other examples of kind of contracts you guys could imagine offering that are related to technicals of networks well I think the I think something that settles to the difficulty is I'm a very intriguing contract from my point of view and we've kind of actually already designed the specifications and what's great is when we talked a little bit about the susceptibility to manipulation when it comes to spot exchanges and cash shuttle contracts and I think physically settled are obviously a lot better because as you mentioned you just get the Bitcoin you don't have that exposure but I mean you take a contract that settles the difficulty of a particular block and that's nearly impossible to manipulate so it's um a super-clean settlement and I think it's something that people would both again have exposure to like if you're a miner but also be interested in speculating on so I think difficulty contracts and then I think in the future transaction fee contracts as well Oh sounds so interesting I kind of love this I think this is fascinating and it I don't know at a certain point it gets kind of creative and fun I think so I look forward to seeing what you guys do um so another contract that you guys recently introduced was one for a $100,000 Bitcoin by December 2020 and I saw in the article on this that it was in Bloomberg that there was a demand for such a contract from institutional customers with assets between 10 million and 1 billion so is that how you decide on which contracts to introduce like people sort of make requests and you see kind of what there's demand for or how do you decide yeah we we list the contracts and we usually do it in conjunction with where we see both direct customer requests and demand as well as where customers trade so you know for example one of the things that surprised me a little bit when we launched ledger Exynos we've started scaling the institutions was that people had much longer dated demand than I initially thought I thought it was going to be more that people would want to trade one two three month contracts because Bitcoin was so volatile that nobody really knew where it's gonna be a lot further out but we're actually seeing you know the opposite I think most of not most but a large large portion of our open interest is in December 2020 June 2020 and so we kind of look at some of those patterns and that helps inform listing contracts that you know that people request huh that's interesting I wonder if it's sort of like you know the fact that no that wouldn't me I guess because you just opened a retail investors I was gonna say that maybe this sort of is one way in which kind of this retail market differs from the institutional but that's not entirely true one other thing though that I did want to mention and not that this is investment advice but when I read that I couldn't help but think about how in a recent episode Dan Morehead of Pantera mentioned that I guess his firm had mapped out bitcoins price logarithmically over time and then projected out that by the end of I think it was 2020 yeah that Bitcoin would hit 120 mm sit when I saw that contract is just her reminded me of that contract or of his statement and I thought okay well I guess we'll see alright so one other thing I wanted to ask about this with SIBO stops listing that coin futures contracts in March and I noticed that they had pretty small volume compared to CM e in December their volume was about a quarter million or a little bit less but it had actually once been as high as about two billion at the beginning of 2018 so are there any lessons that you guys are trying to draw or can draw from how popular this or how unpopular this contract eventually became not really I mean we to be honest I didn't follow it too too closely but I think it you know perhaps validated some of the positions that we took in the past about the focus on you know unphysical settlement but no we've just been really focused on on ledger X and our participants and just making sure that we have a great product that that our participants like using so I noticed that ledger X has said before that you guys have intentionally decided not to offer products or services that would require regulation by the SEC EO why not well being regulated is no joke it's you know I think we are we're such an interesting company because we're a start-up but we are the licenses that we have we are held to the exact same standards as you know 40 billion dollar companies and so I think the regulation is necessary for what we want to do and for providing a safe platform to our customers but I don't think we can conceivably run a small business like this having to deal with another set of federal regulations oh but was there a reason why you preferred the CFTC over the SEC it was more that we we went down the path because we were really focused on Bitcoin I think some of the this SEC stuff is more I think for people who are doing I suppose tokens but I think more ETFs in particular but in the early days we just took a bet that Bitcoin would be a commodity and fall into the CFTC's jurisdiction so I know that you guys needed to get two licenses from the CFTC can you describe what those two were and what those enable you to do yeah so we actually have three licenses now so we know okay yeah so brief brief bit of history so we had to in July 2017 we got our first two so we have the swap execution facility which is the institutional exchange license and then we got the derivatives clearing organization which is the Clearing House and so that's the that's the one that allows us to custody dollars to custody Bitcoin that's where that's how we kind of guarantee the trades and hold the collateral to settlement and then but the the swap execution facility is what limited us from not being able to to touch retail so the third license that we applied for and got was a designated contract market which allows us to do futures and retail and so we at this point we're only really operating the the designated contract market and the derivatives clearing organization because everybody can trade on on both of those but we still have the the third license because we haven't gotten rid of it yet I saw that a few years ago you guys submitted a public comment to the New York State Department of Financial Services requesting that it exclude companies subject to the Commodities Exchange Act from the bitlicense but they they did not create that exemption you requested so do you guys need to apply for a bit license and if so do you plan to do so no so this is a conversation we've actually had with with the CTC and with and with DFS so we're this is where having the the federal license really does come in handy because the federal regulators are of the view that they have preemption over state licenses and I also noticed that you're open to Singapore customers in addition to US customers so why is Singapore the other jurisdiction that ledger excess available in well we had you know as we started looking at other areas to expand to we really started with the the regulators that had good relationships with you know the US regulators particularly the CFTC and so we were able to get some introductions there and just the the partnership that they have made it easier for us to do you know what we wanted to do without as compared to you know some of the other countries in Asia where I think we would have needed very significant even changes in law from their side in order to offer our products and I also saw that you commented that from a banking point of view in addition to the regulatory point of view it was easier to start with institutional customers so I was curious to hear more about this banking issue I I mean this is I don't know how well-known it is to listeners maybe I should do a podcast on it but crypto companies typically have a very very difficult time getting banked they often get cut off from their banks people who have been following the the Phoenix and tether sagas probably have some inkling of this um but so was that common it meant to imply that essentially if you have institutional customers that then that kind of makes the banking easier or or at least makes it less likely you'll have your banking cut off I think I mean I think now the environment is a lot better there's you know even in the US I think there's um some banks that are you know public about their involvement in the space but you know we started ledger X in 2014 and no joke I think Paul and I spent the first nine months of the company just solely focused on getting a bank account and not even a custody account all we wanted was just an operating account that we could hold our VC money in and so it was the the banking and that lasted for a couple of years so during that period as we really really struggle to get banking relationships and you find banks that were comfortable with you know with the crypto space the fact that we were focused on institutions was definitely something that we found made them a lot more comfortable but now ledger X is both you know we're proven I think people are more familiar with us and the regula are regulated or the CFTC and then there's banks that are much more comfortable with crypto and so now I think it's not as but not as big a deal provided that you just have the right regulatory oversight all right well let's hope for a lot of these startups out there that I think some of them at least are still struggling with this um one thing they'll say that I was curious about just from a regulatory perspective is how will the trades of Bitcoin futures be taxed do you or do you have any clarity on that yeah so futures do get the well so this is not tax advice but my just from what I've kind of seen in read futures do get 1256 tax treatment and it's this way means so they get 12:56 tax treatment I'm not sure exactly what that is offhand but it is beneficial and preferable to how bitcoin spot gets taxed oh okay well that's good because I am I feel like that is still a major major issue that needs to be resolved in the crypto space so something else I got curious about was you know when you talked about how you guys decided to focus on Bitcoin and that sort of led you to the CFTC as we've seen ether it looks like will be considered a commodity or at least it's been hinted in various ways that at least it's not a security so if that becomes official then could you see ledger X offering derivatives and ether yeah absolutely and we actually when I believe it was last summer when there was a comment from the SEC maybe from one of their commissioners about it not being a security we actually circulated drafts filing with the CFTC for for us to offer a theory 'im and then kind of shortly after that is when it became a much more drawn-out process as they decided to open up for public comment so at this point you know we're I think we're just gonna kind of wait and see and if the CCC gives the guidance that it's a commodity then we'll move on it but otherwise we'll just stay focused on Bitcoin and I'm assuming that would also apply to things like Bitcoin cash the cash or like any of these other digital assets that are somewhat similar to Bitcoin correct yeah so we've made it very very foreign to the episode but now it again hinted your background and you've mentioned this mysterious Paul so why don't you um know kind of Dan and also you know you guys were so early so I kind of just want to hear the story of how you came to found letter X yes we we had been in Bitcoin for you know maybe a couple years before we started ledger X and buy in Bitcoin I don't mean we were like super active but we followed it and traded a here and there and just paid attention to it and before that or not before that but during this period explained like where you were working on how yes I was I was working so it was actually on two things 2011 so I was working at Goldman at the time Paul was at Y Combinator on the west coast this is what is this Paul Chavez cultures yes whose yep also your husband correct yeah and so he got exposed to it first and so this is summer of 2011 when there was that price spike up to 30 and then back down and and so we went through the process of buying our first Bitcoin on Mount GOx at the time which was a very very cumbersome process between getting our funds from Goldman to I think we used to Walla to GOx but once we had Bitcoin we could just send it back and forth you know cross coast easily seamlessly 24/7 and so we played around with it we ultimately ended up not really doing much with it both you know personally and definitely professionally partly because we we both had full-time jobs and we didn't really feel comfortable with just you know holding keys on our laptop so but we we still found it really interesting and I think a couple years later um there were a couple things that happen one was that the market cap had appreciated significantly so you know it was now I mean it was obviously a lot lower than it is here but it was now approaching a scale where you know coinbase was around and companies were moving reasonably reasonable amounts of Bitcoin that could actually start to support a derivatives market and then - was there were these Senate hearings in November of 2013 which were our takeaway was fairly positive on Bitcoin and that we thought the regulators were going to take a constructive approach towards regulating Bitcoin so with those you know we had thought about doing derivatives for a while and I think after after those hearings we we just went all in on on ledger X we were early we were naive I think it was actually watch an interview this morning and a guy said that one of his biggest advantages was his innocence and I think you can say that for us too that we didn't really know how long a process is going to be but but we got through it and you know we're here five six years later and I have heard you also talk about navigating this like blockchain not Bitcoin era in fact actually I want to quote a little bit your husband talking about that period he said in a blog post quote I cannot stand the years of my life wasted and board meetings with morons lecturing me about how private blockchains are going to revolutionize back-office technology and suck the air out of the ecosystem for things like Bitcoin they were right about one thing they did suck the air out of the ecosystem for a few years drawing away valuable investment capital that could have been used for legitimate projects in public blockchains and then toward the end of the post he says quote Wall Street back office technology isn't historically inefficient because they didn't have access to magical blockchains Wall Street technology sucks because they marginalized technologists the ne puts this in quotes business guys rule traders bankers these are the again quotes front office guys everyone else doing the work of record-keeping and coding are called again quotes back office and I imagine these are all air quotes and they are treated and paid horribly I've worked on trading forswear traders will throw footballs at the heads of nerdy programmers who are clueless ly being made fun of so it was curious to know like you know how this period felt for you guys were you were making this bet on Bitcoin and all around you you know you're based in New York you guys have these backgrounds from Goldman it felt like everybody else was focused elsewhere how did you navigate that period uh it was rough it was it was a hard period you know as as his post mentioned you know it sucked the oxygen out a lot and I think it was part of what made it really hard is not just that everybody was focused on unblocked chain which we didn't really believe was a thing without Bitcoin but you know you saw a lot of companies like pivoting towards that because that's where the opportunity was and we were pretty stubborn on sticking to building a product that we believed in and so it was definitely a test of our will and resilience but I guess I'm glad you know it's sort of has died down and I think you know I think ultimately one of the things that really they were there were a couple reasons why we were so set on it one is we were pretty sure that we're right just from a first principles technical point of view but two is I'm a market driven person and if Bitcoin was really nothing then the market would have reflected it but the you know even while all this was going on the price still stayed at some you know it might have only been like five ten billion dollars but that's still a lot of market cap that was still sustained even while everyone was talking about how bitcoin was you know worthless and it was all about blockchain all right so I also want to ask about a few other offerings you have or or plan to roll out I saw in a blog post you mentioned that you'll be offering a subscription-based data service that you described as bloomberg meets WolframAlpha tell tell us more about that and how that fits into your overall strategy yes I mean data is always it's generally been it's generally an important part of markets and what we want to do with that is not just make the data available but we want to make it approachable you know particularly options data I mean if we I can you know say that oh the December 25,000 strike call expiring in let's say 2020 is you know $2,000 bid at $3,000 but that doesn't really mean much to you and so what we're trying to do is how do we you know how can we make take this data that we have that's incredibly rich and make it approachable and meaningful to folks and so we've launched on our website a very very early crude version of this called a ledger X Oracle which is kind of something that you can just talk to you know you can just ask it questions ask it what's the chance that Bitcoin will be above ten thousand a month from now and it takes these probabilities and it pulls them from the options data that we have and so we want to really expand that over time and make it something that people can talk to but that they can get real live options pricing driving behind it and another product you have is called the LX VX what is that indicate and how do you construct that it's a volatility index it's about it's roughly a 30 day volatility index so we construct it from the usually front you know one or two months of options that are listed and that's designed to give people a sense of what bitcoin implied volatility is so realize volatility is looking historically at how much Bitcoin has moved what the lxv X tells us is what is the market pricing for where they think volatility will be over the next 30 days and so that's an important metric even to people who may not trade options per se maybe they are only trading Bitcoin or maybe they just run a business in the Bitcoin space and they want to know how much uncertainty is being priced in and so that's that index is is designed to give the market a sense of what traders are estimating or forecasting for a future volatility and the last thing I wanted to ask about in terms of the products in your site was the ledger X pit what is that and what happens in the pit yeah the pit is emits this is another one that I think I found very interesting so if you hear me I'll just tell a really quick story so when I was at Goldman I started in high frequency trading and so it was electronic it was highly efficient algorithmic and I worked there for five years from 2006 to 2011 and I remember towards the end of my time there I just remember wondering why markets hadn't fully gone electronic because it was so much more efficient and so didn't really understand him when so then I moved to the Goldman franchise desk which is the deaths that's client-facing and I got a completely different perspective of trading which is that it's not necessary just about the just the efficiency and cutting Layton sees and getting you know a fraction of a penny better here and there a lot of it is social and a lot of the experience that people have is better when they know who they're dealing with you know when it's anonymous trading I think people tend to assume the worst intentions not give people the benefit of the doubt not treat people as well but when it's not anonymous it's a much richer experience and we notice that through Ledger X because our we have a block trading mechanism which is done directly between participants and then we clear it and we notice that this was becoming a much richer experience that people were using this mechanism even if they could get the same kind of pricing on the screens but just because of the experience and so the pin is designed to be a virtual pit really it's similar to the Chicago trading pits and the way that people interact there and the way that they play the long game you know it's not so much let me just do this one trade and try to screw over the other side it's you know you have a lasting relationship you're gonna have to deal with these people going forward so kind of playing playing the long game there and so that's what the the pit is designed to do for our institutional customer base I love that that's a great lesson from your Goldman days and one other thing that I was curious about was they believe that um you worked at Goldman during the financial crisis is that correct that's correct yeah so do you think that that kind of affected your interest in Bitcoin and if so like or or you know regardless of whether or not it did like how do you take that experience you know in this venture like how does it affect how you plan to manage leisure x I think the the biggest thing that a got out of that experience was just realizing how bad things can get very quickly and so it just you know it I think in my current role you know running a mission-critical operation it's kind of good to have that healthy amount of of paranoia just realizing you know what what can go wrong um and and how badly things can go wrong really quickly as we saw at the economy and in 2008 I don't know that it you know maybe maybe years later as I you know in 2011 I think when I got introduced to Bitcoin I think I had more of an appreciation for it because of having gone through 2008 but um you know obviously at the time I didn't really even though that's around when the white paper came out I wasn't really aware of it till a little bit later all right well where can people learn more about you and letter X so ledger X on our website and I am recently on Twitter so my twitter handles
