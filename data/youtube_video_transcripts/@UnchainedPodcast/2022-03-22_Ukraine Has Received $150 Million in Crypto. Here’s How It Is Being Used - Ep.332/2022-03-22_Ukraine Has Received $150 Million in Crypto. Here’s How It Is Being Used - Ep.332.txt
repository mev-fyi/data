co-founder of near protocol welcome george anilia hi laura thank you great to be back let's just start with your background in crypto so people understand what your involvement was in crypto before we get to the main topic sure yeah uh thanks for inviting me here kind of my journeys encrypted start in mid 2018 where we were actually trying to build a crowdsourcing platform using blockchain as a payment service and have kind of struggled to use any of the existing at the moment platforms have be being systems engineers being kind of uh ourselves geeks who who like to dig in we started looking around trying to understand why platforms like ethereum are not able to handle kind of global payment use case and realizing kind of a set of limitations like usability like scalability and uh yeah trying to explore can we contribute to existing solutions and then deciding to start near protocol kind of trying to solve the scalability security and simplicity of usage of blockchain great and george yeah i mean actually my bitcoin story started in ukraine in 2013. i was working with one of the largest aggro holdings and the idea was to you know take the aggro holding public uh with the western capital markets and to secure the funding for it and through close friends of mine i met val vavilov you know who you know who is the founder of bitfury and the idea was to scale the business and and uh you know make it and global and it's it's a it's a funny story because i met val when bitcoin was at twenty dollars at fifty dollars at a hundred dollars and finally at uh at this situation where it got to you know at 4 500 i i and i speaking to a few of my friends in silicon valley and and getting feedback that this this technology was real and the innovation uh was uh serious i decided to uh leave the agriculture the field in ukraine and join bit fury so i've been in uh in the crypto community since 2013 and uh sort of consider myself a dinosaur and have seen a lot happening um and uh it's it's been one hell of a ride as you know and so here we're going to be discussing the crypto community efforts in ukraine and both of you have personal connections there obviously george you even just mentioned uh that that was where you were when you discovered bitcoin um but elia why don't we start with you what is your connection to ukraine well i was born there and i lived there until i was 21 so i left to us in 2012 and so studied you know my family lived and continued living there even after i left all my friends classmates friends of friends living many of them are still there and so yeah have kind of pretty deep background from before and then over past year as near connect have been after launch have been scaling out we actually started building hubs and communities around the world and i've actually spent a significant amount of my time in kiev and harkev uh kind of growing their developer community because there's a lot of web 3 entrepreneurs and developers there so engaging with them we were actually planning to have a blockchain ua in end of march kind of to galvanize the community there so yeah it's been unfortunate and and very devastating because a lot of like i mean some of my like people i know are right now at territorial defense right now in in in in various cities even sounds like like colleagues in the ecosystem uh are there as well and so um and then obviously just a lot of kind of women and like parents who who have been fleeing from the from the scene there yeah i just need to express my you know how sorry i am about everything that you know you and your family and all your friends have been going through um and george why don't you also describe your connection there well ukraine is uh like my second homeland you know when uh russia struck georgia in 2008 i was at a time working in moscow and basically overnight i had to pick everything up and leave and i was working for a large us-based hedge fund at the time where i was sort of head of the region and uh when you know the august war happened uh you know i basically had 24 hours to pick everything up and move my family to to kiev you know i spent six years in kiev you know have obviously a lot of friends you know family members you know this is the country where my first son was born my firstborn was there it's it's a country where you know i really got the appreciation of the freedom and liberty love of the people of ukraine and this is the country where um you know i experienced the first maidan where people of ukraine were fed up by the corruption of yanukovych and uh you know we all marched you know in in the streets in 2013 in the maidan and actually i was uh i was one of the 33 members of the infamous tsariov uh list where i was deported from ukraine it was not led into the country and uh you know was sort of a barred from entering the country for my you know support and uh and affection towards towards the cost so uh there there is a lot of emotion there's a lot of uh uh contact more you know spiritual uh you know from from the standpoint of friends we have quite a bit of presence in ukraine as well from the standpoint of of people and software developers working there so all in the all in all um you know there's a lot of ties and and and seeing this atrocity being committed in in my second homeland my homeland i felt compelled to act as soon as practical in order to do whatever we could to help you know our friends and people of ukraine so let's talk a little bit more about that you know a number of people have talked about how there has been a vibrant crypto or web 3 community in ukraine so describe what that community was like there you know which companies were there or which developers what that scene was like was it more entrepreneurs or investors or traders or just kind of paying a picture of what crypto community was like in ukraine before this war i can maybe cover sounds because um i was i was there in january uh before leaving for uh east denver and so overall i would say like the tech community in ukraine have been growing insanely fast over past 10 15 years and i would say big part is because this is a very much a career path that is has clear kind of financial outcomes which obviously people prefer and also you know is you're able to work with your mind and and kind of contribute to a global economy and so because of that there's kind of a lot of developers who are working actually for companies around the world um in various ways some of them are directly selling them throughout stuffing sell them through outsourcing but all that like a lot of projects that people are using around the world are developed in ukraine like this is booking.com hotels.com this is you know projects from crypto i would say probably all of them have somewhere a group of developers working at them in ukraine including obviously near uh given kind of our roots from like me coming from ukraine and on top of it i would say because of that kind of the product and a web 2 product culture did not develop in ukraine there was no time there was no internal market it's kind of hard to break in into it was hard to break it actually into kind of silicon valley if you're ukrainian founder was ukrainian company like you need to actually move to us spend some time there and then you can raise funds but that is not true about f3 and especially became less true after covet where investors became way more kind of i would say willing to invest in companies just after zoom call with uh with founders and so i think between these two changes kind of a lot of new enterprises in web3 specifically started in ukraine because there was already a lot of technical talent or able to do this but now it could convert into you know funding rounds which then you know are able to build bigger teams uh you know build marketing all those kind of other things that you need to build a proper company and so i would say there was kind of the on the rise like switch from maybe a little bit more retail community which to be clear ukraine is number four crypto market globally because that the crypto is the way to invest pretty much there's only two things to invest in real estate and crypto before the war and so and because of such a big technical i would say crowd right like a lot of people know how to do at least like you know can easily figure out how to use cryptic changes and then go beyond that right and like have technical capability to read white papers and do all the stuff so a lot of people like i was literally on the train from kiev to hakeef somebody was talking about all the coins they invested and like different compared them right just randomly on the side so let's say like i i saw also the shift where like there's a lot of retail especially kind of in between it professionals and and also beyond that but then that started to switch and convert into actual founders because it kind of gave them this freedom and ability and what we see now is actually these founders being really engaged in kind of the community to help people around the whole country as well because they're so connected and coming from different directions as well yeah i agree i mean ukraine has been one of the top destinations for talent and especially early on the government was very sort of savvy in terms of experimenting with few blockchain applications and has been actually at the forefront of regulatory aspects of that you know in terms of vibrancy of an entrepreneurship culture i mean you you know you have at current moment just numerous groups that you know i see various you know tasks whether it is you know setting up the uh you know startling systems or going in and you know setting up the i.t army of ukraine that's uh going out and helping out with combating the cyber uh space uh or you know documenting the you know the crimes the war crimes that are being committed so um you know there are dozens of these groups extremely active with savvy founders uh that have roots not only in ukraine but all around the world that are collaborating on various projects and allocating resources in order to uh protect their motherland and you know ensure that you know this uh tyranny uh if warded and uh you know the peace returns and ukraine is you know rebuilt to much better than it was before and i'm absolutely confident that you know given the spirit of the people being lear you know the world has learned what it is to fight like ukrainian and uh you know the western hemisphere uh that has been very shallow on understanding what liberty and freedom is ukraine has exported it and exported what it means to fight for freedom to fight for statehood and fight for liberty and i think that has lacked to some degree you know these were the qualities that have been forgotten all around the world you know because frankly speaking in the last sort of 10 15 years we had this advent of authoritarianisms and tyrannies around the world and in a little ukraine uh you know it was a david that has roared and has showed the world what it is to you know to love the country to love the freedom and to love the liberty and i think this will go down in the history books as the shining example and frankly speaking as a turning example of a civilization to really focus on really what matters and on the big stones and freedom and liberties is one of these those key uh parameters yeah i agree and i also think that this will go down in the history books because of how quickly crypto got involved in this war i mean it was really mind-blowing frankly for you know as i i've said i started covering this space almost seven years ago and definitely you know at that time just with the way the technology had developed you know there was very little adoption and so to see it become used both kind of on the ground as well as at the highest levels of government very very quickly or or at least discussed i mean it's it's really been remarkable let's talk about kind of that on the ground picture first as far as i understand and obviously i'm sure you're only aware of the picture in ukraine but i even saw that in russia you know people are turning like everyday people are turning to crypto to transact so in ukraine why don't you kind of explain uh what that has looked like why it is that people have been turning to crypto for what purpose why is it that they're choosing crypto over other forms of money and um how has the demand for crypto in ukraine kind of changed uh people's ability to transact or how they're transacting in crypto well i think it started really at the point where when we learned about this right i think kind of all of us tried to find a way to help and the simplest way was to donate and so the first thing i actually did was donating to come back alive via bitcoin uh which is what george will talk about probably but then kind of a group of entrepreneurs uh crypto entrepreneurs from ukraine kind of came together to form a kind of more i would say like focused on humanitarian needs of of the people who will be kind of affected by this and the benefit there is that if you want to start a new nonprofit new ngo that that's a very complicated process if you want to open a bank account if you want to start accepting donations if you then donations themselves you know why it transfers like to new ngos there's lots of compliance that we'll need to go through and given we're kind of at a very fast moving situation right that's just not the right way and so crypto became kind of this really easy way to create an organization that is like has a specific mandate and is able to distribute his funds as well and so you know setting up multi-sig sent the app dials uh even as a kind of structure you know was just super easy and and was done like you know was in minutes and then you know we can start posting it and start spreading it around right so the interesting part is that the finally started called unchain fund very much within the name of the podcast and so you know the goal of which was you know like ukraine has this very unfortunate history of being kind of hit by everyone who is fighting over and over again and ukraine you know people want to stand up and have their own freedom their their own history not like history of other countries around them and so really trying to kind of break this chain of events and at the same time you know use the blockchain use the crypto as a driver as a as an engine but doing that and so as we launch it and there's like a number of number of people like uh ref miller and ollie kochenko alexey uh merski uh alexey bovac who have been kind of driving this it allowed to really move like and start you know distributing money two people to volunteers honest kind of on the streets of kiev and harkey for example like losing the same day right and so like i think vision first day it was already over a million dollars that like were collected and then you know hundreds of thousands of dollars started to be kind of distributed at this moment already over 6.8 million uh was like almost three million dollars being allocated already so really it's kind of the speed the agility and also the trust right because we can actually build a multisig we can build a dao structure that is transparent that is like accountable that we can actually see where the transactions are going and we can assign like what a specific needs have been fulfilled now obviously not everything is being accepted in crypto and it still needs to be converted here and there to vietnam which by the way big thanks is to some of the kind of crypto exchanges in ukraine that are still running and operating uh grieve the pairs and are able to cast this out at the same time more and more people are willing to accept crypt as well because it creates like they are able in in ukraine they are able to kind of have this asset themselves as well which may be decorated of the current exchange rates something that interests me about what you said is so i obviously totally get how fundraising would be a lot faster and easier but even you know when you were saying that the people who are kind of like buying supplies and stuff that the suppliers are starting to accept it what's in it for them like why would they be compelled to do this as well what is it that you know kind of the normal payment system is breaking down or what's happening that would even cause them to start transacting in crypto so i would say it actually was like it was moving down so first volunteers who would be going out in the interest or they never accept start accepting crypto and by that do you mean like bitcoin and ether or just to define what you mean anything near like anything that's liquid and has a pair was green enough for example because they could actually convert it to greenland to their card and it actually is pretty much instant and so they can actually get it to their cards from any crypto through like exchanges like kunai and white bit to to a card and pay for it in a store these are like prepaid cards like debit cards yeah like a debit card yeah credit cards are not used as much but i think like that was kind of first step and so the reasoning to do that actually are limits so there are limits on exchanges limits on central bank like how much currency you can exchange and stuff like this so this way kind of by pretty much crowdsourcing the exchanging on itself was already was already powerful but then beyond that the suppliers started accepting it as well because they wanted if they wanted to deal with dollars dollars don't actually are in circulation in ukraine right and so if they want to de-risk their exchange rate they can actually accept stable clients for example uh for themselves okay yeah because i was hearing that a tether is now more valuable than us dollars that there's a premium of like four to five percent and that even then people won't want to sell you their tether um because they view it as more valuable than us dollars is that something that you've also heard or what's your sense of why that might be yeah that happens every time there's a crunch on demand on on going into crypto that that's just like that that happens every like few months or every six months even before when there's like something in the market the desert price go up like locally on on a spot because it like it's hard to get it like if you are in ukraine it's actually hard to get tesser from bitfinex right because like the flow of money is complicated but i would say like beyond that is is people are want to convert currencies back and forth right depending on what what does their kind of what is their next steps going to be and so yeah kind of stable coins have been you know growing in adoption for sure in ukraine because they are allowing to kind of move some of the assets they had in green for example to a stable coin that's not you know directly in paper which is also hard to to get by and george did you want to add any of this about kind of how everyday people are transacting in crypto yeah i mean i think to step back a little bit the whole purpose of kind of realizing okay this is um you know this is quite serious and people of ukraine will need help uh and they will net a lot of help fast you know you step back and you know obviously um i'm quite familiar with the key crypto community players you got to step back that crypto itself and the people behind crypto to large extent are the people that have gotten into it to make a world a better place you know they have gotten in to improve things to alter the status quo and when we saw the pictures of the russian planes attacking innocent civilians that channeled energy and in our community that energy and that support on the crypto uh community crypto was just a means of channeling that energy of the support to the people in ukraine and uh as soon as the invasion started which ironically started at four in the morning same time when the hitler uh you know invaded soviet union in 1941 uh 4 am some twisted uh you know kremlin sort of applaud you know in the morning when i woke up and we saw the the news first of all i woke up i looked at the bitcoin price it was down and i knew oh  something really must have happened you know that was and actually interestingly throughout this sort of a war every time i you know been waking up and help me get my sleep but i'm seeing prices and it's it's amazing how sort of uh the prices reacted when situation got worse versus towards the peace settlement it really is profound how momentarily the the sort of bitcoin price has been reacting to that obviously the crypto market so i contacted few of my friends whom i trust on the ground and i said listen you know we're here we're here to help how can we help and through few of the trusted parties that come out and come back alive is the organization and i started going out and how can we make a donations and i realized that their usd account that was with cartoon or pontian the the uh antion it was blocked because party on considered them uh to be buying military equipment um and was a complete bs uh because the uh the funds allocated from come back alive were focused on primarily on getting defensive gear such as bulletproof vests helmets uh you know medications uh you know various protective gear to protect the the cities and i realized it would not even be worth right now to get the best legal console and going and sorting that out and i realized why don't we get the btc address rev it up and start promoting and that's what we've been you know started doing and in a very short period of time a lot of that energy was channeled into the bitcoin wallet and the volunteers on the ground you know use that to acquire those helmets and frankly speaking a lot of the sellers of this equipment they're completely fine getting paid in the crypto you know these are the entities located in finland in sweden in germany in united states and there was no issue whatsoever and i'll tell you more we actually ran few of the extraction operations by the ex-green berets on the ground and they were completely fine to be paid in bitcoin to go and get the job done and you know to get the innocent uh you know civilians from cherniga from sumi from kharkiv and other places so in environment where there is instability and upheaval in a financial system what i realized that people view having a an option outside of existing system is extremely valuable and you just don't know you may have grieved us but god forbid the national bank gets bombed or you know or you know as you've seen you know they're bombing maternity wars what precludes them bombing central bank and you know major bank and all of a sudden you you know you're stuck your system is frozen crypto has provided this alternative which is extremely valuable in turbulent times like this so uh we had great success and you know we raised uh close to 16 million dollars which big chunk has been allocated and uh you know i we're very proud that you know many of the crypto community folks that have come in and met allocations have uh you know have made an impact and that's where we met with ilia through common friends through you know discussions and one of the first things was ilia being sort of operational like what are the logistics how can we improve it what is the procurement system you know because yeah you know we're sort of getting the funds but actually how how do you make sure that those funds get allocated to the right equipment that get to the right people on the ground that are used uh in the right operational environment so we had few collaborations and you know i'm glad that uh you know in this time of need many people stepped up from the crypto community through our efforts or outside our efforts like cz uh from binance has donated 10 million dollars gavin from polka has donated five solana has had a big effort um outside of crypto ashton uh kutcher and mila mila is from chernipsi actually from west ukraine and they started the gofund campaign uh and they're narrowing you know nearing 30 million dollar donation so all in all and michael fiodarov and the team at at uh ministry you know they're nearing uh all in all with all the ukraine close to 70. so all we know with his efforts we are kind of approaching 150 million ish which properly allocated for the right sort of targeted approaches i think is making tremendous impact and frankly speaking this is first time during a war of such scales such scale has been organized so rapidly and dispersed so uh you know efficiently in in in time horizon that we have seen yeah it's honestly really remarkable to be watching it from the outside i mean it it's obviously historic um one point i wanted to clarify so for when you talked about posting the bitcoin address uh where was that which uh because obviously there were multiple different fundraising efforts so for the one that you helped organize which one was that it was purely come back alive foundation and their bitcoin world yeah so we focused on that and actually they have had such huge uh inflow of not only crypto but also donations in kind and also fiat donation that is sorted out that uh you know they they are well funded right now and the next effort that we will be announcing in couple of weeks is actually an effort to help the children of ukraine uh children that have uh lost their parents during bombing or you know during military uh during the war will be raising a foundation to to help the children of heroes it's a children of hero foundation and we'll be announcing in the next couple weeks time so stay tuned for that all right so in a moment we'll talk more about how these funds will

at crossriver.com crypto back to my conversation with george and ilya so we kind of discussed a little bit about how you're using the funds you know i have seen some chatter where people have said oh you know do people realize what this money is going toward you know you talked about how patreon blocked those efforts because um you know they i guess have a policy against funding military the purchase of military equipment but i did want to ask so i've heard you know from some people that some of the funds are being used to purchase military equipment and then from others that it's being used to purchase other things such as like bulletproof vests or night vision goggles or tourniquets so can you just talk a little bit about how it is that these funds are being used and um you know how those decisions are being made so for us kind of the goal original goal was yeah to focus specifically on humanitarian needs so what what are the all kind of you know food shelter evacuation uh kind of funds needed and then kind of over time there definitely appeared in need that you know literally our friends who are you know subs or like for some people their family who actually signed up for territorial defense were pretty much sitting there without defensive gear right they were did not have a glue pro vest they did not have kind of even basic like you know cask uh type of equipment because it was you know not delivered and so this is where kind of unchained fun a lot of it was focused on you know this you know food medicine uh things that needed for civilians to you know survive get out of the place there are settle them for example western ukraine and then this is where i actually connected with george and has come back live because yeah there was a huge need in like how do we get defensive equipment to you know our friends pretty much who are in in this kind of front lines right again my friends are in harkey afraid they are actually inactive combat um like every day and so at the same time there are you know other friends who are in europe who are actually procuring uh can like get a lot of this equipment so that that's uh where kind of comeback life i think became a very important piece at least for me and i know george kind of was there from for day one yeah i mean you gotta understand laura when uh the extent of the invasion was uh realized by by the ukrainians uh you know you had the situation where the country was being attacked from five different sites uh by you know worlds are arguably you know world's second largest army now now we know what years of corruption has done to the russian army and you know how sort of a strong it is but uh nevertheless it's a massive army that has attacked from belarus from you know russian side from uh you know the southern flanks and ukrainians just started mass mobilization so we had a case where hundreds of thousands of ukrainians would be showing up including you know women and there would be not enough not only we know weapons but protective gear so you basically had you know all of a sudden hundreds of thousands of volunteers ready to stand up and protect the country but they were completely unprotected you know and the priority was sort of a signal that you know if you have this full stage invasion where the major ukrainian army is back down actually in the east with the donetsk and lugansk region and you have this major onslaught coming from the north from the east and from the south you need to have these people have protective gear because if you don't first they're not gonna be protecting the civilians and you've seen cases of you know innocent civilians being completely shot out by you know by the soul by the russian soldiers and second you're just going to have examination of the humanitarian crisis because you will need the medications to treat these people and the health care system is not equipped to be all of a sudden treating so many wounded and incapacitated people so we had to scramble we had to scramble right away to start getting the vests you know to start getting uh you know the helmets these were the priorities and eighty percent of the resources were allocated towards that and then channeling them towards sue me towards harkov toward the chernigan frankly speaking the reason kiev has stood and actually thwarted the invasion and now kind of our counter-attack and throwing out because of heroic defense of the harkov and tsumi of torniga because if the russian army came through there from the eastern flanks they would have been already in you know in kiev and that army was held in the in the eastern part and a lot of defensive weapons um gear was was there in terms of getting you know obviously you know the west had this wake-up call and they realized okay well you know what guess what uh you know if ukraine falls we are next and where next means that uh in in a very high probability native fifth article and you you're looking at sort of a world war three actually in that regard so they scrambled to their credit and they started providing uh lots of military gear you know lots of stingers lots of general javelins lots of end loss so a lot of military equipment has been provided by governments directly and obviously they have made a big difference you know they have made a big difference it's great to have a courage it's important but having modern equipment and modern military equipment does help and ukrainians have shown their courage in terms of going out and thwarting their tracks and we played a small role in terms of making sure that when the army attacks and when the bombs fall at least they have a protective gear so they don't get uh you know injured and they don't put additional strain on the healthcare system listen in addition come back alive has been doing a lot of evacuation missions uh to be taking out women and children from uh from uh you know places as far away as mariupol for example that you're seeing uh assisting of the refugees um you know that over two and a half million refugees now um have gone to up in outside ukraine predominantly towards you know poland and uh you know other place in western europe and in georgia as well so that has been a primary primary sort of effort that we've been funding and so ilya you mentioned how some of your friends are fighting in the front lines during all this you know as we discussed there is this vibrant crypto community in the ukraine so where did the crypto community go are some of those people fighting or did they go to other countries or what has happened to that community yeah i would say there's a combination of i would say they're a subset of people who either had a military training before or had some kind of training who have decided to stay back and fight like it doesn't actually make sense to fight if you don't know because there's been a lot of kind of training prior there's indeed like hundreds of thousands of volunteers and so those people kind of are you know like literally some of them in harkin right now that i know that we've been helping with protective gear with getting them mobility for example because their cars keep getting break breaking down it's like weather is pretty really bad right they also under attack all the time the other set of people have been kind of helping so there's a lot of volunteers on the ground who are helping like driving food water i mean things are getting bombed like cars getting shot at so there's people actually who are driving around delivering food and water and kind of other supplies to people i can actually uh send over some pictures of people who who have been funding uh there is a set of people who've been helping out to evacuate others right especially when we're talking about women children and grandparents the mine for example and to get them out of this and and kind of move them towards western ukraine and uh over the border for women and children and there's a set of people who are not fighters who are invested in ukraine now who are kind of you know the one of the other things we need to continue doing is actually working because we will need to restore the ukraine which means we need to continue making economy work and so there's a lot of people who are continue working as as kind of much as possible be including you know engineers and and uh like folks we we uh working with who are you know continue to contribute uh even though sometimes we need to go to bomb shelters when there's a siren and so i think the people who have left like they're kind of starting to aggregate in different hubs for us we decided portugal will be one of those hubs we're setting up kind of infrastructure here for our teams for near community more broadly and also kind of trying to help out like working with local city hall here and some of the other uh kind of district level books to see how we can help we actually launched away from ukraine as a portal for all the information that people need to like when they are away from ukraine immigration health care and kind of starting to collect volunteer information as well because a lot of people around whole europe are willing to help but they don't know how and they don't know how to get matched with people who need help right like we have people offering you know translation services we have people who drivers like actually like there are some volunteers in romania who helped to drive my family over the border outside right and so like people like that who are right now driving uh food and and other supplies through romanian border into ukraine that gets distributed back to volunteers that drive it to harcave so like all those people right they're willing to help and so like coordinating that making sure there's a clear kind of place where people can find information and then kind of building a little bit of tech around that like question answering bots and stuff like this to kind of help coordinate that you know in terms of this issue of people needing help and then you know trying to coordinate that help one of my personal friends tweeted about how her grandmother and father were trapped there and i i can't remember i think i think it was a while before i myself saw the tweet um like maybe like hours after she posted it and by the time i saw it and retweeted it it already had like 90 000 likes and another you know tens of thousands of retweets so definitely and then later she tweeted that you know they were rescued and stuff but you know definitely people were doing all they could i mean from our homes on our on our phones and on twitter um but you know still it it actually hurt her cry for help from san francisco finally actually did result in her um grandmother and father being rescued so yeah i mean it's it's really fascinating how this is all happening but you know in a similar vein i did want to talk a little bit about how the ukrainian government has been making these appeals and has been using crypto as a tool and you know i don't know how much insight you have there but you know i was just curious like how it is that the ukrainian government you know was so kind of savvy about crypto and um if you have any intel on how they had these ideas to just tweet out their um various crypto addresses and stuff like that i think it's very fascinating because i personally don't think that if the us were in the same situation that we would see um high-level administration officials tweeting out a bitcoin or ether address for the us um so you know it's just interested kind of like how they became so savvy so specifically there's a ministry of digital transformation who has been driving all of these efforts and so all credit to them they actually been proponents of crypto for a long time and actually ukraine has passed the crypto clarification laws a few weeks before this all-star thing started uh which we all were super happy about and and wanted to celebrate and uh hopefully at the blockchain ui and so yeah in general yeah i mean the digital transformation ministry is kind of extremely savvy in everything digital in general they have built a kind of an amazing platform called dia that functions inside in inside ukraine which was kind of a single platform for all the services that you would usually engage with the government everything from you know taxation uh creation of company medical like all of those things were in one place and it worked with your banking account as well so it kind of created a whole ecosystem and uh yeah i mean they are very savvy in crypto we like actually we were in the same coworking space as the development team which is led by kind of uh like directly by the digital transformation group and so kind of in general uh they know very well kind of uh how all those things work and they you know started creating um accounts pretty rapidly to to collect this they also are working with a lot of entrepreneurs and kind of are connected with with the whole ecosystem i don't know like how much of this is public but yeah like they they are working with tons of entrepreneurs in crypto kind of both to get help as well as to ask for you know connections and then sounds like technical help as well and they have started the it army kind of initiative as well to kind of galvanize the technical talent that ukraine has to kind of help with a lot of the problems but both kind of on defensive front like the cyber attacks from russia's side as well as limiting kind of the spread of information that russia's been having i mean if you if you look i think it has been profound what ukrainian government and the leadership has done in terms of utilizing social media uh platform uh for reaching out hearts of minds of not just politicians but of common people all around the world and not only ukrainians have been uh sort of a kicking ass on the military front but they they completely kicked ass and obliterated russian propaganda machine to a point where the propaganda uh even inside russia is starting to take it's it's kind of it seems are coming off you know you know obviously it comes in uh from the leadership of president zelinski um you know i've met him on couple of occasions this is a very patriotic man that you know stood up to the challenge and he has on a very human level reached out and pierced through the feelings of people around the world and i think the team around him has rallied behind and have used the social media whether it's you know enlisting elon to get the starlings or going out and kind of calling out uh you know samsung or apple or google or youtube in order to do this or that and obviously when you know that that those messages kind of come alive that get caught by media and then people that know people talk directly to you know to the decision makers and you know say hey what's going on can you you know do this or can you do that so we've been calling in frankly a lot of favors and not just favors it's just asking directly hey you want to be on the right side of the history and uh you know this is the situation and you know this is the ask and uh you know we had a very high convert rate so the government itself has been very savvy from the reforms that have been doing up to that and now with this situation that have they have completely you know sort of a slam dunk in terms of using um social media and channels in terms of getting the message out rallying out uh support uh through common people and you know rallying up governments and frankly speaking if you know we didn't have social media and this conflict happened 20 years ago uh you know it would have been a very very uh different outcome you know it would have been a very very hard sort of a push and hard struggle and uh you know there's there's been there would have much more tragic and many more atrocities committed and such but now everything is you know live basically you have you know tanks coming out and ukrainian partisans are face timing their locations in real time and you know they're being the the you know the satellite images or you know the recordings and all of that is giving you sort of a a live uh situation of things on the ground that's you know helping tremendously the armed forces and obviously information war using the tools have uh have been done marvelously and and have uh you know given a lot of uh positive to to ukrainian people yeah i agree i've said this repeatedly throughout the episode but it is just so fascinating to watch because clearly things would have turned out very differently if it weren't for the various ways that the technology both of web 2 and web 3 is being used here one thing that i did want to ask about was obviously there was a moment when the ukrainian government promised an airdrop for people who contributed obviously they ended up uh you know kind of saying that they were decided against going through with that but what did you make of that move and then the decision to reverse course you know what do you think kind of uh maybe happened there that initially caused them to make that announcement but then change their minds so i don't know the reasoning behind the kind of making the decision and changing mind but i would say like the idea was definitely to kind of highlight the people who have contributed right and so the kind of idea of to give out nfts that you know would show that you supported uh your donations to to this or we can speculate on what kind of change in the mind i think generally right now it's just not the right time like they have plenty of more immediate things to do and so uh kind of the nft project there's a lot of nfc projects right now to support ukraine that are happening and kind of their their goal is to actually raise more funds to then fund them to help people and so i think the there will be a time hopefully soon when this war ends and we're gonna switch to recovery mode where we should you know highlight people who have helped and who have done you know job here but it's not right now right now it's really kind of how do we stop this how do we kind of help people who are still in immediate danger and how we kind of help people who are not in immediate danger but actually are you know we'll be running our food or you know right now kind of outside of ukraine now kind of in a new environment and actually have huge ptsd this is something that i haven't heard anyone talking about but like even just from the friends who are arriving now in portugal who have been there or my my family like they all have ptsd in some form right they've you know they've been under bombs they've been under shooting they've been like forcefully relocated and like this would be kind of a lot of time to recover and and this is actually something that like i hope you know we can find like this wars you know there's a piece at least some like ceasefire we can start recovering and rebuilding because we can actually build way stronger country from this and help people kind of to really you know with this rallying around get them in stronger and bigger country out of ukraine yeah one thing i will say obviously um people probably know already but after the airdrop was announced then of course there were a bunch of wallets that were farming the airdrop you know sending like just tiny tiny tiny donations um so i do wonder if that played a role you know clearly yeah it's interesting because of course the war has brought out i think such a great response from the cryptic community it really highlights kind of all the wonderful things about it but then of course uh we've also seen um the same kind of shady or just opportunistic behaviors that we're all familiar with in crypto as well so you know we've seen both sides it's been one of the i would say major issues that we actually need website to solve and kind of understand the reputation of people that you're dealing with because especially now like a lot of it is in telegram and signal which is you know useful for for for many reasons but then we don't actually understand who is the person who's the other side like how like what's their reputation who they're who they're connected to which communities they're a part of and so having that information being kind of private but also available in some summarized you know zero knowledge form that you can judge on based on when you're connecting with people when you're engaging with someone to prevent this kind of forms of there is actually scams happening like people are trying like even within chain fund we are open to for volunteers who are helping the ground but we're doing like deep kyc with like proof of location and we keep actually finding people who try to scam this right and so actually building out a kind of working kyc kind of not not kyc but actual reputation system that works beyond just kind of basic identity but actually like you know what are the things that you've done already what are the things that kind of positive that you bring to the world who are there other friends who are where you're working with communities that you're participating in kind of encompassing that into some some form that others can work on and judge on when they're engaging with you is super important i think like is something that like i'm excited about again after after we hopefully get into a stable state and start rebuilding uh to start engaging in yeah i actually just did an interview i have this new like premium offering where people can subscribe and they get additional content and i just did an interview with a project called galaxy and they're actually doing uh just what you're talking about so it was a very interesting interview it sort of you know made you realize kind of finally how because it's long been promised that blockchain technology could be applied to identity and reputation but yeah this is one project that is kind of working on that george did you want to add anything on this airdrop or even the subsequent nft that they announced they were going to drop yeah i mean i've been so kind of focusing on the fundraising efforts and kind of evacuating um you know friends and relatives from uh churnigo and harkef that you know i i saw that in the news but frankly speaking it's it's been overshadowed by bombs dropping and maternity wars being blown up getting help on the ground but i'm sure once the dust settles that will you know that will be one of the questions and i think uh the uh the team should provide the answer what was the reasoning behind and uh see what can be can be done to make sort of uh uh make people hold so to speak that that would be my advice yeah my understanding it was just nft there was no like it wasn't supposed to be like a token air drop it was supposed to be just nft for people who have contributed to kind of showcase your support oh oh okay so but i thought originally it was a token and then they changed to nfts but you were saying that originally it was nfts yeah i think that was it just kind of i think again they're very overworked that twitter is you know like twitter for that like so that is something kind of trainery that they're doing so i think they were just i mean they were trying to kind of again as my understanding to to highlight the people who have been contributing and helping that that should have been the goal not not to create some kind of other talking economics okay at least as far as as far as i understand all right well let's talk a little bit more about you know kind of the the what it is that the crypto community can do going forward you know i feel like this was obviously in the news in a much bigger way just even a little while ago but i feel like there's been less news about it at least in the crypto world so what would you want for people to know or to have them do um based off of listening to this episode yeah i think there are few things i mean obviously beyond just kind of contributing to various of this efforts depending on what kind of you align with most or or um what kind of you directly want to contribute to i think there are you know looking for volunteers to help out with there's a lot of this like we're if we're talking you know somebody who is in european union like who people who can help with with all those refugees and and kind of people who have been displaced again i mentioned away from ukraine is is a portal we're trying to build two kind of organizes information and uh options and then beyond that i think supporting ukrainians like honestly even even in kind of mental like you know friendly way because like everyone having a hard time and they need they need your support they need your kind of friendship as well yeah i mean i just want to um thank everybody in a major way who has um come in times of need um and i've been uh overwhelmed and my heart has been warmed by the help and assistance from many and in some cases from unexpected places uh there have been few surprises on the other side as well that have kind of stayed aloof and stayed i wouldn't say indifferent but i'm not as active as i would have expected but you know it is what it is and you know 95 of people i reached out and discussions have uh came out in in in small way in big way in unexpected way and uh you know thanks you know it's it's a great karma for uh for the world and uh in times of this i think when world comes together to help each other and to give a caring hand is what it matters and crypto community to a large extent i mean all this infighting between various protocols sometimes and twitter wars and stuff you know i i came to witness that when when there was a human tragedy and human uh need that people put aside you know all this all this and united together to do and and i wanna thank everybody um thank uh you yeah for all the work you're doing and uh he actually has a great group on telegram and so many participants and every day there is you know soup kitchen or you know evacuating people and with pictures and it's a very vibrant community it's it's it's wonderful seeing people from all over the world coming and you know here in georgia we're also putting together trucks of humanitarian stuff and sending out and we have thousands and thousands of ukrainians that are coming that are being lodged free of charge and staying and you know sort of cared for him and i just want to thank everyone who has um who has come in and you've done a great thing and uh something to be proud of so thank you all right so for people who want to get involved what are all the handles and um websites and uh groups that they should know about yeah i mean unchained fund and chain.fund is kind of this humanitarian fund i mean come back to life is kind of what george been working with uh you can also check out the digital ministry of digital transformation their website and then away from ukraine is for the kind of for helping people who have been who are outside of ukraine now and who you know need help because they've been kind of forcefully removed yeah perfect yeah i mean i think uh exactly what elia said i also pay now to many in united states that uh ashton's and mila's go fund campaign um i think it's it's it's a great effort and they're nearing uh their sort of a target so that's um you know it's a great way to get engaged and in couple weeks times we'll announce the heroes of ukraine children's fund and uh you know i'll be more than happy to then promote and uh get uh you know get crypto community engaged and continue sort of helping and uh you know doing doing good great well thank you both so much for coming on unchained thank you thanks so much thanks so much for joining us today to learn
