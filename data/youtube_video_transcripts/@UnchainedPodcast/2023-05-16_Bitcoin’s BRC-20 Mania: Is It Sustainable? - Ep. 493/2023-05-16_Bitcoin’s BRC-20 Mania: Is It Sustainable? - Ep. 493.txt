Bitcoin educator and marketing advisor at trust machines and Trevor Owens managing partner at Bitcoin Frontier fund welcome Dan and Trevor thanks Laura thanks for having us Laura BRC 20 tokens are generating a ton of interest plus they're causing a bit of a furor in the Bitcoin Community before we dive into the topic of the rc20s we need to define a few terms and give some background and I personally feel like people need to understand a bit more about ordinals before we can even get there so why don't we start by explaining what Bitcoin ordinal theory is sounds good so I'll start with the basics on Trevor's you know he's uh really deep in this space so he can cover the even more technical stuff ordinals refer to the ordering of satoshi's so it's essentially a um a shared social consensus over the order of satoshi's and it gives them assigns them in order value and that's why it's called ordinals it's an ordering of the of the satoshi's then you have something called inscriptions which is the process of inscribing data onto a particular Satoshi so that could be a video audio or jpeg or code so that could be any type of data set and so when you think about ordinals when people refer to ordinals they're actually referring more to I would say generally Bitcoin nfts but with brc20 now we're talking about meme coins and so ordinals ordinals are simply meaning the ordering process but that term ordinals has become all-encompassing for everything like Bitcoin d5-esque and then I'll hand it over to Trevor here to be a little bit more technical yeah so great intro uh Dan so um ordinals is essentially our ordinal Theory essentially colored coin model to take um the utxo model of Bitcoin and be able to trace or to identify a serial number for specific satoshi's and so what that allows you to do is by using a first in first out model and sort of tracing the utxos back through the blockchain history you we have created a way to say hey Satoshi in my wallet the specific utxo and SAS in this wallet goes all the way back to the block where it was mined based on this first in first out serialization just one second um utxo for people who don't always unspent transaction output which is like oh you can think of it as like change from any transaction yeah so so Bitcoin and ethereum for example handle balances very differently like Bitcoin is a utxo model ethereum is an account based model and so what that means is like a utxo is like a specific almost like a package of Bitcoin that can be sent from like one place to another and that allows it to be more trackable and and less fungible I mean it's still fungible but by adding a serial number to it we can then say that a specific image or inscription or file is tied to us uh essentially a pointer like so a pointer meaning you look at ethereum the image is not hosted on ethereum it's actually hosted on ipfs but we have a token that we send back and forth that says this token is connected to this image or this file and so we've been able to replicate the same concept using ordinal Theory and one other thing so you started to mention like on ethereum data stored elsewhere and what's interesting about Bitcoin is the data is actually stored where fully on chain so that's I that's one of the cool things is that ordinal Theory and ordinals and inscriptions took a very different approach to the typical ERC 721 standard which as we've seen ever their blockchain they just said this is work on ethereum let's copy the same same standard and these these standards are design decisions and ordinals and descriptions took a completely different design decisions that I think made the right trade-offs or you know if you look at the blockchain trilemma for example you know like you can pick which corner you want to be on of the triangle and typically if there's already someone else who's really successful in one corner you want to go to the opposite corner and that's exactly what ordinals and inscriptions did they said erc721 is working great we're going to go to the opposite corner of the of the trade-offs that we can make that users care about and that's why it found a product Market fit and to build on that I think you know Trevor I think very eloquently puts it like everything is a series of design trade-offs right and that's where I'd consider myself more of a Bitcoin moderate these days where it's like you know Bitcoin I think has made a lot of the right trade-offs for a money right it preserves decentralization at the cost of higher throughput a lot of other fun things you can do and so I think ordinals do a very very elegant job especially around like nfts of actually building what I would argue is maybe a superior platform so for example you've got the graphic asset on chain instead of it pointing to an ipfs file or being a hash which means the data persistence or that image or that graphic asset surviving you know for an nft like having the original asset on chain I think is hugely valuable but that's only particularly you know for like nfts that are Community or artistic focused versus you know I'm not talking about you know nfts that represent real life things like links down or something like that right um and then also with the utxo model you know it's that this is not a smart contract that issues The nft Collection so you can't go back and update the smart contract and change ownership or or number of ones created these are inscribed upon satoshi's and so it's immutable and unchangeable so I think that it's interesting to see nfts come back to bitcoin because you know Bitcoin nfts did originate on bitcoin back in the day but seeing them come back I think in a bitcoin-esque um trade-off I think makes a lot of sense and I think that's what Trevor was touching on is that it's really interesting to see the surface area of design decisions here and how this might yield different interactions with Bitcoin protocol versus like ethereum's interactions with their nfts yeah two points one is that one of my favorite early Bitcoin nfts is one by the artist Ria Myers and it's something like or actually now I think my I think it like wasn't exactly a Bitcoin nft but I'll tell this right anyway because it's so funny she took a hash of her 23andMe result and then she put it on like a fork of some it was called like Doge party and it was like some magic between Dogecoin and counterparty which is just hilarious and then like the blockchain isn't even functioning anymore so she is this hash of her soul um over there but um and then the other thing I wanted to say was because of the differences in storage like um I think there have been so many rug pulls uh with nft projects like one of the kind of snarkiest ones was when somebody swapped out the images that they the jpegs that they had promised for like images of actual rugs so um you know that kind of thing obviously it's impossible in this situation so um now this gives us the backdrop to explain what are brc20s um so uh brc20 is an attempt and I would say an attempt with significant attraction and kind of proven demand now I think we're up to over 500 million in volume traded um I mean it's been like a few weeks here since it really took off to create a fungible token standard so with with ordinals and inscriptions it's a non-fungible token standard which means that non-fungible assets like art media things that are not interchangeable versus a fungible token standard like what like uh you know Bitcoin ethereum uniswap token blur token like these type of protocol tokens that are used throughout the web 3 space and so it was a very maybe counterintuitive interesting model because what people are doing is they're using the same inscription lock space on bitcoin and they're using it to record any type of arbitrary data and so I think the first project to do this was the dot SATs namespace which is kind of like an ens or or dot BTC or dot e they were inscribing these registrations for names and then an individual named Domo had this kind of fun project said Hey what if we created a brc20 and you just made a simple get Book Project and um from there it kind of organically took off to the point where we now have like major centralized exchanges uh listing the most most popular uh brc20 token and so kind of the theme of this new design space that's created by ordinals is the concept of adding smart contracts for example to bitcoin through node software as opposed to on-chain logic like an evm or you know solidity what we see on ethereum and so when people run the ordinals node that sort of enables ordinal Theory and also reading the inscription space for brc20s you're running Bitcoin node and they run a separate node and this Paradigm can be extended well we're finding out how far this Paradigm can go right now in real time with the rc20s and so there are certain situations where from a technology perspective like you don't need the whole evm smart contracts you don't need to turn completeness and for simple assets like a non-nft that doesn't have programmability to it or in or a fungible token like a brz20 doesn't have programmingly programmability to it perhaps just the asset and indexer is sufficient as opposed to full smart contracts which could be actually be added to bitcoin through other layers yeah and just to explain that in a even slightly less technical way for people um and correct me if I have this wrong but this was my understanding from the research is that obviously on ethereum with the smart contracts like everything can be read by the blockchain in terms of like how these tokens should function Etc but what you're saying is that's not what's happening here it's that people have come to an agreement that sort of like off chain about this is how we're going to run this system and so then they're running these nodes which I guess is like some combination of both hardware and software that's not intrinsic yeah to the blockchain itself in order to make this work right Bitcoin the Bitcoin coding language Bitcoin script cannot recognize or or deal with or deal with any of these however some of the some of the key ways that people are dealing with it for example or it is usually utilizing the Bitcoin script is for the trading aspect so some of the key aspects of what you would need where there's risk are using Bitcoin script and then other areas are using the additional node or the additional indexers and that's kind of the interesting I think from a technical perspective one of the most interesting Parts is that this is kind of pushing the boundary of what people might think is viable and I can I can chime in on kind of a more non-technical perspective so brc20s hit a market cap of a billion dollars and I would say I mean brc20s have been around a little bit longer but in terms of being popular in a matter of weeks it hit a billion dollar market cap this is pretty insane I think it also represents the speculative fervor in interest that people had pinned up on over you know on other chains that they wanted to bring back to bitcoin time so hitting a billion dollar market cap in aggregate representing all of these new BRC 20s was a really interesting phenomenon to see how fast it happened and when we look at the minting process of brc20s it's very interesting because this isn't um you know when you create a per year sd20 it's basically whoever crumbs up with that four character you know four character BRC 21st and then the and then everyone agrees that that's the original version so if it's AAA that's the original version and then um the individual who create that brc20 for the first time can set the parameters of the you know total Supply how many tokens are minted per on-chain transaction but these mints were collaborative which is actually quite interesting so unlike you know other types of tokens where the Creator can create all they want and they can give themselves 100 of it to meant to brc20 meant you had to use on-chain transaction fees in order to Mint it and so the brc20 was perceived more or less Fair depending on how many participants it allowed to participate and that was usually dictated by like the max mint per on-chain transaction value so basically these were open mints so thousands of people came together to Mint a brc20 which is a really interesting phenomenon because this is a very fair way to launch something and I think again you know really highlights like back to bitcoin's ethos and bitcoin's culture around that around that fairness um so I was really interested in to see both the minting dynamic the the huge surge in adoption also the volume so on gate.io they were the first ones to live it was the first exchange to list ordi which is the first um brc20 to be created and it had volume of like 100 million dollars day one which is pretty insane for a new asset class that's literally a meme mind-blowing so that was really cool to see and then you know Trevor was talking about some smart contract functionality you know you've got partially signed Bitcoin transactions where unisat which is an exchange and uh website oriented around ordinals they've got a Chrome extension wallet that you can use and we already have a working Dex for treating these ordinals which is uh pretty impressive and really cool to see and a lot of people I think I thought of Bitcoin as a dinosaur chained but both Trevor myself I think for a long time now I've been mentioning that you know you can bring some of this functionality back to bitcoin of course it can't do a lot of the things that ethereum and Solana can do but it can do some things like as you know you could have dexes you can have nfts you can have all sorts of tokens on top of Bitcoin and so we're starting to see that all come back to bitcoin so one thing is you know as you mentioned earlier that the I guess all of them are or at least the vast majority are basically meme coins so is it really um that they're more kind of like these cultural objects or because like for instance Dogecoin is a meme coin but people also talk about how it could be used as a currency so I was wondering like are there other functions or is it really more of this kind of Collectibles like um you know cultural uh type of of product yeah it's it there's no there's no other functionality yet I mean people are starting to use it in a way where they can incentivize use of uh their product or application but it's really just I mean we're in a we're in a bear market right now there's not a lot of innovation in terms of like new types of tokens and I think the Market's still a little bit immature but what vrc20 did is they just created a superior meme coin uh protocol to ethereum and the reason being because as what Dan mentioned number one there's no crowdfunding with with uh BRC 20s uh it's all fair launch like the person who creates it um once they submit the transaction everybody including the person who created it has the same opportunity to claim the brc20s and there's it can't be rugged by a smart contract so if you're out there like jumping into the erc20 ethereum meme uh coins there's quite a bit of research you need to do to figure out where is the contract who controls it what is the distribution uh can they rug me and then there's like even confusion over they they gave up the contract I think you know like that's kind of what people say but with brc20 all that's removed and so it's created a Simplicity by having by having less functionality and you actually see in the unique holder distribution for example for the already token which is the most popular one like the the largest holders are in the like one two percent of of Holdings and so you know objectively and you know it's kind of saying like someone who is you know five foot two is taller than someone who's five foot one objectively it's they're it's they're taller in this situation is to understand that so essentially it's almost like there are no whales in in this in BRC 20s is that what you're saying well there's no ability to pre-clean to pre-mind there's no ability to get all the supply unless as Dan said there there are some ways and you know a fair launch can it like can always be gamed in certain ways but the default like this at the starting point makes it more difficult and so I think that objectively makes it better yeah the whale would have to spend a lot of on a lot of money on on-chain transaction fees to become a whale so yes there are whales but they have to do the proof of work there's no way around it okay yeah you know what's so funny um this whole brc20 thing is I mean it's literally echoing the erc20 Ico craze that happened in 2017 which was the focus of my book so um I obviously know that era very well and um what's I'm just realizing is so there was this one particular Ico that kind of practically broke up there I mean there were a number of them but one of them was the status Ico and the reason was that they tried really hard to prevent whales from getting a ton of tokens and so there were like these crazy ceilings of like how much you could get in any given time and the ceiling kept dropping over time and then hilariously like when I interviewed them about it they were like you know what the whales ended up getting a ton of tokens anyway it's just that they had to pay a lot more in gas fees so um you know yeah you're right I guess a lot of these things can be gamed um but so to go back to like my questions about usage like I was just kind of curious like you know obviously we're talking about tons of um mints and a lot of trading volume out of the gate like these market caps Are Climbing super fast um and what is it exactly that people are excited about because like if we're saying that um you know the kind of or you tell me but my understanding is that the the financial possibilities that's um you know uh available to BRC 20 tokens is much more limited than in ethereum or Solana D5 for instance so what is like the value that people are kind of seeing in them and Trevor I hope you don't mind them I'll take this one first ethereum and Solana I think showed the Bitcoin community that there are a lot of financial Primitives and a lot of financial Innovation that can occur from unknown and unexpected places I don't think anyone on in those communities as well could have predicted the outcome or the emergence of these different you know Financial types of transactions these Financial Primitives and so I think in the same vein of that that Spirit we don't really fully know what will come out of BRC 20s or out of ordinals so I think you know right now I think a lot of a lot of crypto started with very silly Origins right so brc20s for sure are just are just meme coins at the moment and what do meme coins bring in terms of raw utility I mean we've all seen doshiba you know these these meme coins aren't necessarily tied to real real world utility however a lot of the beginnings of new Financial uh Primitives in the space have started with very silly things um or what we might subjectively view as silly but objectively the market decides to Value it and people like you know people if people want to buy mimetic coins and me you know Meme coins they're they're free to buy them right and if Society values those as valuable things then who are we to say it has real world utility or not you know in a similar vein are Beanie Babies a good or bad thing do they have any real world utility you can't really eat them you can't use them to build anything but people like them and I'm you know people want to trade them and so you know humans subjectively like to value different things long story short I think there's you know a lot of different Financial Primitives that will emerge from here that we have not predicted or that we don't um we can't fully uh you know Express right now so I'm just interested to see how it plays out yeah and on this point one thing I wanted to call out you sort of referred to it earlier or somebody did but um the Creator Domo even like when he announced it he literally was like oh these are gonna be worthless like that was the exact word that he used so that's kind of hilarious that this person was like I made this thing it's going to be worthless I I think it gives a certain um humility or innocence to the protocol in fact which I think is always kind of a good thing if you look at the origin of like Bitcoin with Satoshi Nakamoto and that the myth and the myth and story there The Narrative that sort of innocence and um I think um a really interesting thing is that uh like what I'm what I've been saying to you know troll some of my ethereum friends is that it's like Bitcoin is doing to ethereum what Twitter did to clubhouse I always get frustrated with Twitter because I don't think I think there's a lot of bugs I've hosted so many Twitter spaces that got rugged you know it's not a bet as good a tech as let's say Clubhouse was but the network effect the liquidity uh Etc you can launch a subpar technology and it's not it's not the best product that wins in the market it's the it's the good enough product with the most distribution and so if you have like something that's maybe you know a little bit subpar or you can't do all the things that you want to do but it has has enough momentum behind it and enough resources are attracted to it it will eventually become the best technology and so the user interest the user demand the developers that we're seeing come to bitcoin are like oxygen for this fire or you know gasoline for this fire yeah I I probably will I I think there's just going to be different I I don't know for a long time now I view them as just being different and I feel like this is just another example that they're different um but we'll see how this all plays out so one thing that I did want to ask about is all of this activity you know uh we've talked about some of it but like they're already accounting for like 50 of all Bitcoin transactions which is obviously insane um even like a few days ago it was actually accounting for 65 of all Bitcoin transactions um so all of this is pushing up transaction fees which are at a two-year High um due to BRC 20s so I wondered you know this has been causing some controversy people are saying oh you're making it impossible for people in Africa or El Salvador to transact on bitcoin so what's your take on whether or not that's a good or bad thing for a Bitcoin yeah I'll jump in here I think Trevor and I have discussed this privately quite quite extensively so when we look at scarce block space like Bitcoin scares block space it was entirely intuitive and agreed upon by the community that during the you know block size Wars that a more limited block space would you know keep the level of decentralization that we required at you know as a community and then the idea would be that we scale in layers lightning being a prime example of that liquid Stacks rootstock Etc these are all different layers built on top of bitcoin's L1 or the base layer so this was gen this was generally and widely accepted by the remaining Bitcoin community on bitcoin versus the community that forked off into Bitcoin cash this community also shared the value that bitcoin's purpose in a larger large portion of its value appreciation and network effect came from its speculative gold 2.0 type value rather than uh payments or you know peer-to-peer uh you know peer-to-peer cash sort of idea that it's this daily payment method and so because of that you know the Bitcoin Network in the Bitcoin Community have largely thought of scaling and happening in layers where L1 would represent very economically dense transactions what does that mean in common you know Common terms that means that the transactions be very valuable there would be a large value transactions and those large value transactions would be willing to pay a higher fee because those transactions on L1 likely represent many more transactions on L2 um and so essentially like when you open and close the lightning Channel there could be millions of transactions that occur on L2 on lightning that that are net settled on the Bitcoin Network and so because of that because of all the transaction and economic activity that happens on L2 when that's compressed into an L1 transaction that that allows that L1 transactor to have much more price elasticity so you know when we look at transaction fees over time it was entirely intuitive that they would rise transaction fees should grow higher and higher on L1 this represents a functioning healthy fee Market which eventually transaction fees have to replace the block subsidy in the block reward for Bitcoin Miners And so this represented very healthy and anticipated activity on bitcoin L1 so I think as Gregory Maxwell puts it popping the champagne if you will to see a healthy functioning fee Market or uh you know people bidding for Bitcoin block space to set a level that we see it replacing the subsidy so this is a good thing and entirely anticipated thing however there were some very dishonest and dis dishonest individuals in the Bitcoin community who either willingly ignored technical issues around how Bitcoin would scale and or use their own subjective I would say virtue signaling to say hey Bitcoin is meant for cheap transaction fees in Nigeria it's not true it's not it's not technically how it will work it's not technically how the network would scale this was always going to be an issue and we all knew about it that transaction fees would rise in L1 now is bitcoin useful for those who want to transact in Nigeria or some other country on L2 absolutely but they had dishonestly marketed Bitcoin to these South American African countries in Southeast Asia as this cheap way to send payments and this is not true it was never going to work that way when you're saying this are you um referring to somebody like Roger beer is that what year I would say newer a newer cohort um Roger was from the seven you know Roger kind of exited the community in the Bitcoin cash Fork this represents bitcoiners that came after that wave after the hard fork and after the block size Wars because I don't know if you saw like the recent comments about this word from Anita Posh um who I don't know if you put her in that category I would yeah oh you would yeah she was the one who made I think some of the most prominent comments because she's in Africa right now traveling around teaching people about Bitcoin and she was the one expressing frustration about the fees she should not be frustrated in the slightest this was all anticipated by the community widely accepted as the way Bitcoin is going to scale there should be zero complaints there should be no whining about it it's exactly how the network should be built and what do you mean to her um response which was that because people I guess were saying they should use lightning and then she was like yeah you need a transaction to create a lightning channel so this is again not feasible so what would your response be to that entirely anticipated and obvious to anyone with a pulse so this was entirely anticipated and like yes L1 we should encourage them to go use you know L1 was going to be expensive so L2 is worth that that activity would occur for cheaper fees but she's right you know you have to open and close the lightning channel so it'd be more of like custodial lighting or something like that these were entirely anticipated though so you know it was it was up to her and others who were championing that narrative to have set expectations yeah I think I think it's important to add you could you know in theory have we're not there yet but the idea that Innovation is coming back to bitcoin and people are starting to think differently about the sort of tropes and ideas that we've had over the past three to four years there's now interest in other types of l2s like ZK Roll-Ups on bitcoin that would actually require a soft Fork but people are now having that conversation and you can have a situation like a ZK rope on bitcoin or people could enter from the L2 you don't need to send a transaction to to enter it and you could even have some a situation where you have a light Network on top of a ZK roll-up and that's something that people are investigating because they're saying having lightning on top of Ezekiel might actually make more sense on top of the base layer you've got like rootstock and liquid as well these are l2s um and you know well again this terminology I'm roughly using the term of L2 just to be overly simple here rootstock and liquid allow you to transact and you know with basically almost no fees and then once you accumulate enough you could go you know Peg out and and move that Bitcoin to an on-chain Bitcoin address so there are methods to where you don't have to open and close you know you don't have to have two transaction fees to transact in an L2 that's just how lightning works but there's multiple l2s okay yeah and I don't know to transact in those is that it was super simple I don't know why I I feel like I never see people talking about either of those I I think the that until like these other layers are really for scalability right so even if you look at ethereum I paid so much money in gas during the nft Bull Run of ethereum like I could have bought a new car and you know but people but the adoption for the l2s as soon as gas goes down you'd opt for the l2s also goes down so it's really a factor of like what are the network fees and right now we we saw it with BRC 20s it was 500x um what it was before ordinals it was like the minimum one stat per V byte cost and we were over 600 uh during the kind of craziness with brc20 and now it's back down to like it's gone down quite a bit and so no just to find V byte yeah it's like it's like the cost in satoshi's per byte of like what you know bits and bytes like kilobyte megabyte what you're storing on bitcoin and so that went up 500x and then it went back down but I think at that level that's when we felt a lot of pain so until it gets to that level that's when we'll really see the L2 race take off in a meaningful way I think Trevor brings up a good point it's basically load balancing right like you've got you know transaction fees as the increase should push that activity to happen on l2s and then of course when those transaction fees come down maybe more activity happens on L1 so it's yeah I definitely see it as kind of a a load balancing function all right so in a moment we're going to talk more about the discussion around brc20s

conversation with Dan and Trevor so as we were just discussing uh the trading of the brc20 tokens is spiking transaction fees it's pushing up even the number of unconfirmed transactions that are waiting in the mempool and that is actually at high levels that have never actually before uh been seen so uh it's super intense in that regard uh even binance had to pause Bitcoin withdrawals which obviously that's also pretty Bonkers um however some people in the Bitcoin Community are looking at all this activity they're calling it a denial of service attack on bitcoin so you know obviously you're both here and um from the discussion it seems like you guys are pro ordinals and pro BRC 20s but can you characterize the anti-position what that side of the argument is trying to say is they're trying to say that these are spam transactions um because they are not your typical transaction type which it's hard to play devil's advocate for their side because it is it's really hard to really conceptualize what they're saying here but I mean what they're because when you say it out loud it's pretty ridiculous they're saying subjectively that they can decide what transaction type is valid um so they're claiming these are not valid transaction types even though these transactions are 100 legitimate based on the protocol and are completely Allowed by the code they are saying subjectively that we think these are non-valid transaction types that are spamming the network well I think what we could say is that these are not in line with the original purpose and vision of Bitcoin which you agree with that and I think maybe that's kind of where they're going I I definitely wouldn't agree with that I think like it's really hard to know what the original intention was and any disruptive product evolves over time and I think this is part of the underlying flaw and logic that some of the developers or people who are against us make is that they're of the opinion that you just that the the use case is just payments and that it's working for payments already and we just need to come better at that one use case but I think where Dan and I differ as we think the use case is store of value and in fact in order to become in order for the payments use case to be viable the people need to store a majority of their wealth in Bitcoin and so what Dan has said to me is like you could snap your fingers today and if every single Merchant in the world accepted Bitcoin sure there'd be some more Bitcoin adoption in use because of the advertising but until people hold majority of their wealth in Bitcoin they're not going to have a strong need to pay for it every single day so you know coming from like the the Silicon Valley world you come into the Bitcoin world and the idea is like kind of what is the end state that we want to get to and we can just walk backwards to figure out what the starting state is and so if like you look at and that's not how Innovation Works with with Twitter specifically like it started at South by Southwest as a way to figure out like what parties people were going to and to update people it was used by a lot of bloggers but if you started with the idea in mind of like creating a platform where presidents are going to use it where the most important journalists in the world are going to use it it's going to be a real-time fastest real-time you know information exchange you probably wouldn't have started uh in terms of like a conference where people can say what parties are going to yeah and just but also also Southwest it started in the Bay Area and it was actually supposed to be some like I'm sorry we've launched at Southwest right I don't know I mean I think Jack made the first tweet and it was about him eating lunch or something I think was just in the Bay Area but but regardless it might have might have taken off there um but one other thing is like earlier you said that you disagree that this that um the money use case was the original um vision for Bitcoin and actually um interestingly in doing research for this episode I did see that um apparently early on someone had suggested to Satoshi oh we can do uh domain names using Bitcoin and he had rejected that notion and that's essentially saying we can do nfts with Bitcoin and he had been like no no no no no so I mean there's a couple I can I can hop in here you know the uh first Bitcoin block has a message from Satoshi text message the UK Chancellor on the verge of second bailout for banks so Satoshi himself used the protocol to inscribe a message onto the Bitcoin blockchain so that does show in the first Bitcoin block you have essentially this this message from Satoshi himself in addition when we look at you know the origins of Bitcoin in the SEC you know the uh the people who came before like Hal Finney alfini and others were huge Advocates of you know digital trading cards his health and he put it which were a precursor to nft the idea of nfts you've also got something where Satoshi refers to the original growth strategy for Bitcoin Satoshi didn't he goes I don't really know how this is going to take off basically was his Vibe and Satoshi I think was pretty humble in knowing that he didn't know and so Satoshi encourages developers to explore different types of use cases one is of course your your classic Merchant one because he wasn't sure and that's where a lot of people I think take those quotes very much out of context without looking at any of his other quotes So he refers to like Merchant activity but he also refers to it as like a speculative gold type instrument and he goes you know refers to it as Bitcoin could be just viewed as a collectible a digital collectible in a way because this is before bitcoin's worth a penny right and he goes well I think the origins of a bitcoin's adoption originally might just be for collection purposes people collect it as a digital Oddity like a digital digital collectible and when you look at Nick zabo's origins of money most money or at least the his his agreed upon thesis that a lot of people also agree upon is that you know money starts first as a collectible and and that's the kind of origins of it so you know collectible we could call that nft-esque where yes it's fungible which is different than a non-fungible token but collectible is in a kind of silly shared aggregate belief that this thing this digital thing is worth something um so I don't think Satoshi really you know he had his vision of I built this thing and I bring it out to the world is his new money but money is just a collection of data like this isn't this is a new type of money this cryptocurrency never existed before and what is money like is money just simply the underlying coin value or is it other economic activity I don't think that if Satoshi was around today he would go no only the the only economic activity that could ever occur on a blockchain can only be the native asset you know I think you would probably widely agree with how the space is flourished and since he was very encouraging of developers to explore all use case types I think you'd be really excited and surprised to see Bitcoin used in in creative ways like this so you know one thing is uh I just wanted to draw this conversation kind of um created a bit of a firestorm on the Bitcoin mailing list where people were talking about you know whether or not to even like censor the blockchain and stuff like that and so I wondered it's just like do you even see any Merit on the that side because like people are you know just talking about how this is kind of um yeah it's causing all these issues like with congestion and the high fees and the mental um being uh you know having all these unconfirmed transactions so do you just think this is all fine or um do you see like any reason for um concern and let me add one more Point here Trevor before we hand it over to you um you know people I think the complaints as well are these that these transaction types are highly speculative and therefore are less legitimate because it's greedy speculators I'd like to call out that bitcoin's entire adoption cycle in 1317 and 2021 was due to speculative fervor as we all know that's where you know when the ogs like us who've been around in the bear markets know that everyone leaves in the bear and then you you know in the bowl you've got this huge surge of interest and that surge of Interest isn't because Bitcoin is being used as a payment method in Africa or anywhere else it's because the spot trading volume is going up you've got the price going up people become aware of it because the price is increasing in value and that kicks off the adoption cycle and so that's why we have these big spurts of adoption and kind of the lulls in the bear market so come for the speculation stay for the sound money um is sort of the the way that my thesis of user acquisition versus retention right and so when we look at on-chain transaction fees of course they were going to go higher because of speculative nature of of people because people inherently are speculative and they want to use blockchain technology for speculative purposes um so I think they derive these transactions as hey these aren't coffee payments in Africa but in reality most transaction Types on bitcoin for its entire existence have been usually between exchanges to go speculate or people moving money from their Cold Storage to an exchange to go speculate so that that was most of bitcoin's economic activity and that's not necessarily a bad thing yeah I think um I think it's a great thing that people are are talking about this I think the discussion is really healthy and I think that people being opposed to this is totally fine uh the thing with Bitcoin is that it's very hard to stop anyone from using it it's very hard to change things and it's set up in a way where the people who pay the fees get to do what they want with their Bitcoin and there's not there's nothing anyone can do about that and I think in order for us to get to a future world where we have everyone using Bitcoin as a medium exchange or as a global digital currency we have a kind of a chicken and egg problem to solve here between like if you think about like users who want to send Bitcoin and like people who want to receive Bitcoin and so when we think about chicken and egg problem the idea I like to use is lions and deer so if you can bring the deer to you know the the uh the Savannah or you know the gazelle right then um the lines will come right and so when we look at this two-sided Marketplace it really comes down to store value and giving users new ways to store value on bitcoin so that they will hold more of their wealth in Bitcoin and that's going to unlock Merchant adoption and acceptance of Bitcoin um as a medium of payment and so ordinals digital art inscriptions BRC 20s provide new ways for people to store value on bitcoin that may provide a different kind of portfolio than just holding Bitcoin alone and in the same time is bringing more users it's driving up the network fees increasing security and it's you know leading to more Innovation like we saw in 2022 something like 25 to 30 billion dollars in VC when to the web three space at large when it comes to bitcoin Nick Carter has famously said there weren't enough startups in Bitcoin for him to invest 100 million dollars a year and two and so now that a new design space has opened we've seen a ton of developers coming in and we're starting to see the venture capitalist as well Nick has actually even changed his mind now that uh that ordinals has opened up a new uh Avenue yeah um so I know you guys agree with him but I just thought this was a very pointed criticism of the side that wanted to censor these transactions he wrote in an article on coindesk um and he's characterizing the you know the anti-group their perverse framework is one in which it's morally acceptable for North Korea to use Bitcoin for sanctions evasion but unacceptable for an artist to issue their nft on the Bitcoin block space um so that was it was a pretty um a strong way to put their position um so we kind of mentioned layer twos but I wanted to ask have you guys seen that all this activity in brc20s has increased activity on layer twos I think so yeah I think well it's definitely accelerated the conversation for developers I think a lot of the l2s on bitcoin or other layers you know people like to be pedantic about the definition of an L2 so I'm just saying like Bitcoin layers is a better approach they're not mature yet they're still and I think you know ethereum other layers are also not completely mature yet you see like polygon has been the main you know L2 which is technically a side chain now they're introducing the uh ZK roll-up aspect to it that the whole Space is immature and I think that the the fees are not high enough yet to push significant demand there um but we will see in the next few years that this is going to be a very important place to play yeah I think Trevor's Trevor hits it on the head here where he's like if transaction fees stay high then we see people pushed by the market into cheaper uh you know cheaper you know L2 side chains Etc so yeah I think with a sustained High fee situation we should see the L2 economic activity flourish um due to people kind of being forced over there out of necessity so one other thing I want to ask about was that for a while now people have been talking about how in the long term bitcoin's security model is broken or at least faces Peril at some point in the future and I wondered if you thought that brc20s and ordinals would help resolve that yeah absolutely I think is the answer um any economic activity that's happened in L1 that pushes transaction fees higher that leads to transaction fees slowly replacing the subsidy decline through the having schedules so I think this is an extremely encouraging sign well we'll see how long it's sustained right we'll see if this academic activity is sustained I do think it will be I think there's a lot of folks that are really interested in building on top of ordinals and building all sorts of things so I think this economic activity will be will be persistent and if it is that does I think put a pretty good nail on the coffin around the um Bitcoin security model issue where people have long argued because transaction fees have not compensated or risen in um you know not in response but to offset the decline in the block subsidy that Bitcoin had a long-term security model issue and so I think this really kind of hammers the point home that no people will transact on bitcoin L1 and that transaction fees will climb higher in the future yeah I think Dan you know covered it really well like in order for Bitcoin to be like there's only gonna be 21 million Bitcoin So eventually right now the one of the purposes of Bitcoin as a as a as a token people don't realize is to subsidize the security so um every Bitcoin block whoever wins it is given 6.25 in Bitcoin and that has been going down by 50 every four years that The Happening and so what that does is it it when you when where we want to go to is a future world where miners in security is paid for by fees so people will people have to spend electricity in order to run Miners and that's a these are like you know revenue and cost basically for Miners and so the more profit they make the it becomes an efficient market where more miners are coming in and then the security gets stronger and for like the first time since 2017 we saw a block where the fees were greater than the subsidy and there was actually three blocks almost in a row where the fee was greater than the subsidy and so what that means is that miners are more profitable they're not going to go out they're not going to go out of business because the margins can be quite thin and more miners have room to come in to also compete for some of that additional profit and we're moving towards a way a place where every happening that subsidy goes down which means the security budget goes down and we can already compensate for that decrease in security budget of course if the token goes up by 2x every happening which you know we've talked about the stock to flow model not being like you know not being fully scientific in terms of like you know we need more demand for the price to go up not necessarily the supply to go down um that covers us if we can get more fees right so we're in a place where we're de-risking the long-term security of Bitcoin thanks to demand for Block space there's one other part that I think a touchdown that I want to hammer home the subsidy is you know the newly minted Bitcoins and Trump is right you know we've had exponential increases in the price of Bitcoin so that has Offset you know in terms of Ross dollar spend on security budget the security budget over a long period of time has gone consistently up exponentially just due to the appreciating price of Bitcoin so even though the the having you know halves the amount of new coins produced in each block the value per coin has increased dramatically so but that won't last for forever and so that's where we're talking about transaction fees eventually need to replace the subsidy and one last Point here too no one knows what an appropriate level of security spend should look like is it a hundred billion dollars a year is is it a billion is it a percentage of flow or stock we don't know Nick Carter had a really great MIT presentation at MIT in 2019 that I saw on the night I also wrote a long form paper on this um we just simply don't know what an appropriate level of security spend is Bitcoin security spend has historically been much lower you know back in time and it wasn't 51 attacked so technically lower levels of security spend in the Bitcoin network has been okay but that doesn't necessarily mean that the same security spend number would be appropriate in the future so just wanted to make that point because I think a lot of people there's a I think there's a lot of dishonesty on um folks attacking Bitcoin and saying hey it's broken it's long-term security model's broken and I'm like a quick question what's the appropriate level of security spending they're like well I don't know so I'm like well you can't call it broken if you don't know what the appropriate level should be so I think that's a very important thing to call out because a lot of people will look at just the decline in subsidy and the the lack of off city and transaction fees but they don't actually call out what an appropriate aggregate level of security spend should be yeah I remember back in the day like literally 2015 um Chris bernisky uh even back then was trying to figure it out and the way he did it was I don't know what this is called but like in other parts of Finance would be called like Monte Carlo simulations and he had kind of a full range of like where it gets in the red but then it gets a little lighter red and then it's like an another color and then it's like in the great so you're right it's sort of a spectrum and I don't think there's like one magic number um so one Trend that has been kind of interesting to me is that even as we speak which is Friday morning Eastern time for people who are listening to this um I was doing research for this last night and even as of Thursday night it seems like the media had died down um like I noticed for instance the total BRC 20 market cap was at about 500 million on Thursday night and on Tuesday had been at 1 billion um even like the price of already which is that original brc20 we mentioned that had plunged it had originally or sorry not rich the high had been around 29 and as of Thursday evening it was about um 12 50. so I was wondering where you thought things were going with this is this just kind of a classic speculative fervor that's just gonna die down or do you think the trend has um longer term staying power I think it definitely has uh staying power like the the way I think about it is like I think I generally tried to have the idea that I don't know what the right answer is I try to come up with a thesis and look for disconfirming evidence and erc20 was not something I thought would would work and I still have thoughts about how the technology um has issues but with enough resources in demand I think these issues can probably be solved and so like every day the demand sustains the odds of it being a fad for me go down right and then what other dominoes can get knocked over in a big way like will developers come in and start building it yes a lot of developers are coming in our exchange our centralized exchange is going to pick it up yes we've seen a ton of centralized exchanges coming in and picking up as these additional dominoes go down and as every day the demand sustains the ability for shortcomings to be fixed by you know the community by developers and for this to have a stronger Network effect just make it much more likely to exist in the future and to Echo Trevor sentiment I don't think that we're gonna see this go to zero I don't think we're going to see as we've seen with many other speculative type new Financial Primitives in the crypto space there's always the uh the naysayers who want to cling the bell and and I you know I've been there before and they've been proven wrong so I want to call that out before where the naysayers will cling the bell and be like look all this economic activity is over for it to you know six months later surge back up 100x so you never know in this space the Ebbs and flows of interest and enthusiasm are totally Market dependent I think that these Financial Primitives these aren't going away the demand for these Financial Primitives will fluctuate and as we've seen with previous Market Cycles it'll ebb and flow but um you know anecdotally if we look at you know when I talk to like um you know Bitcoin nft folks you know they're waiting for transaction fees to come down so they can start to produce and inscribe their nft collections on top of Bitcoin so I know that there is demand as those fees go down and since this is all a Marketplace everyone's going to see you know as they start to go deploy you know more nfts or other types of financial Primitives you know it seems to me anecdotally that there's a healthy active Market of bidders for Block space whether that be BRC 20s or um you know Bitcoin nfts that are you know jpeg inscriptions I think that these uh I don't see that activity going away I see people already making plans to you know go and Scribe if fees drop a little bit more so I see a very healthy healthy bid for Bitcoin block space so if we were to kind of see all these different Trends play out that we've been discussing in this show um I'm gonna put out a scenario there and I'm interested for your thoughts on this as we mentioned the meme coins are what's really taking off in BRC 20s and um due to you know the issues that we talked about with the data being stored offline uh for um ethereum based nfts but then also for um because there are certain like limitations on the types of financial activity you can use BRC 20s for would it be fair to say that we might see kind of like more nfts and more or or certain types of entities I should say not all types but certain types and then also the meme coin section of the erc20 sphere to maybe shift more to bitcoin um whereas like the more kind of defyish type of coins would you know continue to flourish in the erc20 world um but then I think what's interesting to me about that is like if those Trends continue to play out because I do agree the two coins they're different they have um different features that lead you know certain use cases to be superior on one or the other um then I feel like what we end up with is Bitcoin which it traditionally has been thought of as the chain for um sound money and um you know this kind of more uh what I call Money crypto world will live on the same blockchain as the meme coins and then these more um yeah like Collectibles type objects whereas like it feels like on ethereum you might have more of that true defy world where it's like a lot of composability and stuff am I wrong in thinking that that's how we might see the trends play out I think you know whichever brought up earlier around the design surface area we just don't know exactly how this is going to play out but we do know they're very different Design Surfaces and trade-offs that have been made on either or so I you know this is totally speculative right which I think that's the the whole theme of this conversation um I mean I think nfts on bitcoin is a superior platform due to the graphic asset existing on chain and due to the utxo model versus the account model and smart contract model of how the nfts are deployed um that's a little less subjective it's I think a little bit more objective in terms of like the technical design decisions but as we've noticed retail and network effects don't necessarily occur just because of technical design considerations that can sometimes occur just because there's a network effect there so yeah deciding you know right now what what's going to end up on each one I think that's really hard to do personally I think nfts would be better on top of Bitcoin due to ordinals design architecture um but yeah again it's I think for any of these it's really hard to say you know the composability you know composability is a blessing and a curse right so when you build these D5 Legos the idea that they can interact with these other smart contracts and you can build this you know really expressive sort of um process of building Legos on top of Legos and and having all these work together that's great in all until like usdc is frozen and then that base LEGO breaks and shatters and so composability is fantastic in terms of the expressiveness and the ability to build really exotic and fun things um Bitcoin you know of course can do things like that but it's more single purpose gaps if you will which is a good and bad thing it limits the expressiveness of Bitcoin but then again you don't have structural huge structural um potential failures that could occur due to that that D5 Lego breaking the defy Lego doesn't have other dependencies built on top of it um so yeah it it's tldr super complex um hard to say what's going to manifest on either change it just depends on the design architecture yeah I would agree with with Dan like the um we don't know where the design space for this ends and where the limitations lie and we're kind of finding out in real time um like Laura you mentioned uh Doge party earlier which is the counterparty on Dogecoin counterparty was created in January 2014 and counterparty has a DEX for trustlessly swapping it has you know uh semi-fungible tokens has a lot of features that ethereum have not to the same level of functionality but that's been around since 2014 and there's been a narrative that you can't build any of these things on bitcoin that you can't build a unit swap that you can't build uh open C and we have both of those on ordinals already and so to figure out where um sort of like the where D5 will take off um I mean we also haven't had the level of venture capital interest right or the level of developer interest so there's other tools there's more sort of juice in this fruit to squeeze like when it comes to discrete log contracts it's a technology that has been around for many years that people have not really explored on bitcoin The partially signed Bitcoin transactions was actually the key to creating the open C on bitcoin and the unit swap on bitcoin and so these Technologies are very underexplored and now that there's actual developer interest and Venture Capital interest we're going to see in the coming months uh where this design space ends and where other layers that maybe turn complete or have a different virtual environment it could be evm it could be another actually need to come in and so let's continue on that theme what are the different things that you think need to be developed to see this ecosystem truly flourish like you know we don't even have simple things like exchanges and wallets really um being able to interact with them in a big way so I just talk about some of the little signposts that you would want to see on that roadmap definitely integration into different wallets you know when we look at um ordinals it's they haven't they only came out really I mean ordinals only really started to be developed in like January of this year so it's honestly pretty astounding how much has been built given the very very short duration that they've existed um but yeah ordinal support for wallets of course I think is a base base function that you need exchanges adding ordinal support which we're seeing a lot of that occur quite rapidly whether that be BRC 20s or Bitcoin nfts um so I think we're seeing everything to be on Pace to be integrated into most consumer facing you know guise or interfaces that consumers would use to interact with blockchain tech so I think we're seeing that happen at at probably one of the craziest Paces I've ever seen just because of all these existing wallets and exchanges have had to do this for ethereum and other chains and so they're quickly realizing hey we need to do this for Bitcoin it's good for them financially and their users are asking for it so um yeah I think we've seen that at a blazing fast speed um but yeah I would say we'll probably see widespread ordinal support across all major wallets and exchanges I couldn't imagine any later than the winter of this year I think it'll be widely integrated into most of them yeah I would I would agree with that I think that we've seen an incredible pace of adoption from the start of ordinals seeing you know Yuga labs and board ape coming into a collection um seeing many of the top NFC projects and artists coming over to do ordinals and then now seeing exchanges come in seeing that the you know typically like the a lot of the Bitcoin Maxis or the toxic Maxis would have tried to kill this and they and it it kind of failed right like all the criticism against it as we talked about earlier developers saying that like this is a DDOS attack or this is a bug um most of people have come around and and when you look at like kind of the political situation of these ecosystems it's been much more um agreeable to those people that's why we're seeing you know uh like sailor come in sailor who typically has been saying you know uh or a lot of the Bitcoin Max he's rather have been saying what's happening in ethereum old is is not good or it's you know not impressive Taylor said that uh ordinals took nfts from something that was bearish and now something that's bullish and so we're starting to see uh like the the normal cast on bitcoin come around to this but it's happening slowly and so I think it's happening slowly and organically that these dominoes are kind of falling over and I think that we have like the the fundamental building blocks we have the fun the non-fungible token standard we have the fungible token standard people are going to use uh creativity and the entrepreneurial inclination to try lots of experiments and the more experiments that we have the more learning that we have and the more likely that something is going to stick and I think we're going to be very surprised um and I've been you know someone who was very excited about this from the very beginning I've been constantly surprised over the past few months all right well this has been such a fascinating discussion about one of the hottest topics in crypto today um where can people learn more about each of you and your work you can go to my website danheld.com uh there you can see my newsletter Twitter account Etc depending on what social media channel you're on you pick uh pick which one you'd like to follow me on um on there I talk about um you know Basics around Bitcoin uh Bitcoin nfts and the rise of ordinals and you can follow me on Twitter I'm at to and also the Bitcoin Frontier fund is BTC frontier.fund and we host a a twice a week Twitter spaces on ordinals at the ordinal show I was kind of talking about the the technical topics uh so you can check out that as well perfect it's been a pleasure having you both on Unchained thanks Laura thanks Laura thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about Dan Trevor and the RC 20s check
