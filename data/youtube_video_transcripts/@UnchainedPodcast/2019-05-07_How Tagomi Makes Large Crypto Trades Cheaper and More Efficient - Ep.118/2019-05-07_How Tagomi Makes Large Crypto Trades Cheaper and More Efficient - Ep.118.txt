relationships cipher trace is helping you grow the crypto economy by keeping it safe and secure my guests today are Jennifer Campbell co-founder of tech owe me and Kevin Johnson CEO of t√∫cume welcome Jennifer and Kevin thanks for having us Laura great to be here how did you come up with well actually why don't we start with Jennifer how did you come up with the idea for it ago me so the first I was working at Union Square Ventures which is a venture capital firm in New York probably most well-known for investing in Twitter very early on but also spent a lot of time in the crypto space so they invest in coinbase in 2012 invested in other crypto projects like fowl coin and Algar and a block stack to name a few and so I spent most of my time there looking at the space and I guess over time I became the go-to person when you know someone wants to sit what someone wants to buy you know let's say a million dollars with Bitcoin the go-to person they'd asked like you know so how do I buy a million dollars of Bitcoin and you know I'd send some to some of the exchanges sometimes the FTC desks some sometimes to other folks that I knew in my network but there really wasn't a great solution for folks who are buying in size and a lot of them because they were more sophisticated investors had you know really expected something a little bit better you know they wanted the execution they wanted to understand how their trades were routed all of which didn't really exist in this space and so my co-founder gregg previously was head of elephant trading at goldman and he was a partner there for ten years and we spent a lot of time together looking at the space and thought you know there really could be a better solution here and so we decided to start to go me and you mentioned this phrase best execution i know that has like a very particular meaning so can you describe what that is yeah so we think of best execution as you know the ability to serve a liquidity across many different markets in order to find you know if you're buying bitcoin the lowest price possible and that means you're usually having you know fast electronic access to those markets and having your you know capital and ability to fund those accounts ready to go in advance so it's essentially like a way to give people a bird's-eye view so that way they can get the best price possible which is especially important when you are deploying a million dollars in these markets which are pretty small is that the thinking there yeah that's that's definitely right you know it in traditional markets you know best execution is is really important it's something that institutions care a lot about they spend a lot of time sort of you know after trades are done analyzing did I get the best price possible they'll look at you know market data you know they'll compare trades over time it's really a process and it's it's it's it's something that a lot of major institutions really focus on in crypto you know we sort of have a very young market but we do think that as larger institutions move into the space they're gonna have the same questions the same concerns they're gonna want to understand you know how did their broker route their trade did they get the best price was there information leakage was there some kind of adverse impact so we're gonna apply those same kinds of principles that we learned from traditional markets to the crypto space yeah so why don't you tell us what does Takumi do yeah so we we have a couple different things that we do you know first and foremost we have built a smart order router as its called which essentially allows us to monitor market data coming from all the different exchanges or market makers that we connect to to understand you know what are the prices that are available on those venues and then when we get an order from a client let's say to buy you know a large amount of Bitcoin well take a look at all those different order books and say what's the right way to break up this order into smaller pieces and send orders to each of the markets to get you know sort of a piece of the best price Bitcoin on each exchange and what that means is then sort of the weighted average price of all that Bitcoin that we'll buy will be the lowest possible for that client you know it's much better than if you were to just go to one exchange at one time because if you were to eat up all that liquidity in one place you'd end up paying a higher average price so it's really important that you have access to lots of markets you route your orders simultaneously to all the venues and you get the best prices across the entire street then the other thing that's important is you after the trade kind of going back and analyzing that you know seeing they did I do the right thing doing post trade reporting being able to explain the analysis to your client which which is really you know we think it's critical it's something we do as an agency brokerage and we want to be very transparent with you know why we did what we did and Jennifer you did describe this very briefly but can you describe more in full how it was that prior to to go me or without to go me how people do things like make very large purchases of Bitcoin sure so before to Jeremy there were really two main options one you could go to one of the retail exchanges and so for a lot of these larger clients who are buying in size there's a large liquidity cost to buying in size so that means that while you know it's the price of Bitcoin is $1,000 if you want to buy ten or a hundred dollars of Bitcoin it's still $1,000 but if you want to buy say 500,000 or a million dollars of Bitcoin the price is actually you know maybe $1,200 or something like that and so the price gets higher as your order size goes up and so how you execute that trade really matters if you buy Bitcoin and the alittle acquittee cost is you know 5% well that means you have to believe that you know Bitcoin goes you know up five percent before you actually want to get into the market so that execution cost is really important for some of these more institutional clients so you know that was another great solution just because the space was so fragmented you'd have to go to you know five or ten different exchanges you'd have to sign up and get selfies at each of these ten exchanges you know an institutional client is just isn't going to do that or you know even for the average person that's a lot of operational work a lot of hassle to get all those accounts and trade all across one of these exchanges and this selfie is for the know your customer procedures that's right know your customer kyc AML anti money laundering and so it was just a lot of operational work just to get a trade then the other option was to go to these OTC desks which you know sometimes is a great solution but also a lot of these clients are looking for best execution so they I want to understand how your trade was executed how it was routed like why did they get the price they got and you don't really get that with an OTC because you're you know it's not they're not an agent you're you know you're buying from their balance sheets and so they have a set price there's a but you know sometimes there can be a pretty big spread there and so some clients you know aren't looking for a different solution and with to go me how does a large purchase of crypto work so it would feel like you know you would wire a million dollars to go me you only have one counterparty which is to get me but we would smart wrap that across all the different exchanges and liquidy pools and market makers and other Liberty sources for you you don't have to have accounts or I have money on any of these liquidy pools and then we smart wrap that and then you'll have your Bitcoin air you can at the end of the day and it would really feel like you're interacting with just one counterparty except we're reading across all the different exchanges for you so you know one analogy I use that's quite simple is you know imagine that you know say crackin or coinbase or bitstamp is Delta or united but you know we're Expedia or you know kayak or something like that and so it you know you just have you can go to Expedia and buy you know coins from you know coin base or crack in or Gemini but you know there's just one place you can go to get all of those exchanges in one place who are your clients or what types of clients do you have so it's a pretty broad range to date we launched in December and so we've mostly been focused on more of the institutional clients our clients have been hedge funds Ras other broker dealers who want to sell Bitcoin to their clients but there's also you know a lot of high work high net worth individuals and also clients who just want to use to get me because they feel like it's a better experience and they're not really institution so you know we're gonna be expanding to more people but in the first couple months we've only been taking the really large institutions and so and most of them are from traditional finance or they larger players in the crypto world but I'd say it's a mix I'd say half you know a lot of crypto funds and then half you know more are IAS other traditional broker dealers they want to offer client points to their own clients what is their typical trade size you know it varies a lot it's hard to say what a trade size typically is because every time they trade it's broken up into a really small tiny trade so if you want to do a let's say thirty million dollar trade you're not gonna do that all at once you know you're gonna break that up into bits little bit bits of you know maybe thirty cents or a dollar each and then spread that out across all the different exchanges and so you know it's hard to say was that you know was that thirty million dollar trade was that a ten cents trade because a lot of our out goes we'll split up your trade into much smaller trades so but I'd say you know between 25 k2 in the tens of millions we've seen a pretty broad range how much do you or well yeah how much do you make off of e-trade and how do you make the money off of each trade so we just take a flat Commission on top of each trade there's no monthly cost of the software there's no yearly fee or anything like that it's just a flat Commission on top of your trade oh and it's not it's not there's no like scale based on volume or anything like that oh there is yeah so it ranges from you know up to 25 pips depending on your volume and which exchanges do you connect with we connect with all the exchanges that have USD so you know the top 10 there and then also market makers and other liquidity sources as well so I know I don't know if you saw that long bitwise report about a kind of real versus thanks to volumes on the exchanges but it has that of influenced which exchanges you decided have decided to integrate with so it hasn't influenced us at all but it's actually been very helpful so you know previously when a lot of times you know clients would log into our platform and then I'd show them you know the volume for the day and when they saw that metric they'd be really surprised and say what do you mean that's that's the real volume and you know you know coin market cap has something that says you know 20x the volume and we'd have to explain no that we you know we we curate all our own data and we think that's the actual volume you can actually interact with and actually execute on and they'd be very surprised and so you know that's been really helpful for us you know and explaining you know why that number is so much lower oh that's interesting okay so you had yeah I was going to ask you like how you decide which exchanges to integrate with but it looks like you were using your own data to make those decisions about kind of where there was enough liquidity and stuff like that is that how you did that that's right so when we looked at where the liquidity was we ended up with a very similar set of exchanges but you know it was a little bit hard to explain to clients why that number was so much lower than you know what they thought it was because everyone had gone to you know koi market cap and seen or the you know numbers and the billions or and then you know the number we actually had was you know a fraction of that and so it's been really helpful for us yeah looking at that report just the visuals on it we're just so clear and yeah I was just looking and I was like okay this is like one of those cases where a picture is definitely worth a thousand words see you guys also custody or customers funds yes yes and no so which custodians do you work with yeah so we we evaluated probably two dozen different custody providers when we were building out our process we ended up focusing on the ones that we thought had you know really great security really great features and for the most part have you know some kind of trust license so you know we worked for places like you know coinbase and bit Co and Gemini and we're always interested in seeing you know what other new technologies are out there as we expand the coins that we list as we looked at features like staking or other things to our system so you know as an agent we're very happy to you know keep monitoring the market for for what's best for our clients and we'll always make sure we get the best technology the best security and the best features for for our clients do you spread out the customers funds across multiple custodians meaning that um even one single person Oh entities funds will be spread out like why do you use multiple custodians yeah it's a great question so we generally do spread it out you know for for risk purposes not keeping all the eggs in one basket and then the reason other reasons for using multiple are you know different custodians have different coins that they list they have different features in terms of you know do they offer staking what's their service level agreement for how fast our withdrawal can happen what type of storage is it so we think it's prudent just to be able to have multiple and to be able to offer different features to our clients do your clients have any concerns about the fact that they don't hold their own private keys yeah definitely some of them you know if you're a different kind of fund sometimes it's important but you know Tacoma is able to accommodate many different structures so we're more than happy to use our cold wall solution or you know if somebody has their own custodian they've already worked with we can always whitelist a withdrawal address and after the execution is done we can always send it to their to their own storage system of their choice we're happy to work with the clients to figure out what's best for them and if that's what they need then that's what we'll do okay so it sounds pretty flexible on that part it's like the coast like you can custody for them if they want that and then if they don't then they don't have to use that service yeah that's right we're trying to mimic what you would feel in a traditional brokerage and equities or futures right if you call up your your broker and say I want to buy a million dollars of Apple stock you know they don't they don't send you a box in the mail with a bunch of stock certificates at the end of the week you know they they hold onto that for you yeah you know so we're we're trying to get more people into the industry by providing the same types of products and services that they're used to having in traditional products and that means you know like Jennifer said not having to connect to all the exchanges not having to worry about how to smart order out and then custody and treasury management is another facet of that they you know they don't need to worry about where their stocks are held they don't need to worry about moving money around Tsugumi has figured out ways to handle that in the crypto space for example if you have a prime broker relationship with Goldman Sachs you don't also need an account with at the bat's exchange or the nicey right and so that's the same with to go me we follow similar workflows as you know if you would if you were to have a prime broker relationship and traditional equity markets and how do you make that possible on the back end really it's a combination of you know strong technology that was built you know with experience that we have from traditional markets it's both a combination of being able to quickly route orders to the right markets where the best prices are and then you know building out the sort of settlement and clearing infrastructure that allows us to handle moving capital between exchanges you know pulling back the you know the Bitcoin that we buy for clients into our own storage system our own wallets and sort of managing managing that balance throughout the day so we've built systems that allow us to do this quickly and efficiency efficiently and that's really what I think differentiates us from you know some of the other software providers that are out there so we have a veteran team who's built this multiple times before as a team and multiple markets and so you know it's really textbook solutions that you know clients expect and you know we think the crypto space will adopt it seems like you have to have accounts on all these exchanges and then you must pre fund at least some of these trades is that correct yeah it's actually a mix so you know we the crypto market is evolving and it's changing all the time so we have to meet the market where it is which means that a lot of the major sources of liquidity require pre funding for trading so if an exchange requires that we work with that but there are also counterparties out there that will have post trade settlement arrangements so we have some liquidity sources that do that as well so to Gomi figures all this out for the clients while we provide best execution and so really you know managing that that liquidity and that access that we have is really the main service we provide to clients that's really where the the secret sauce is I would say and for the cases where you do have to keep funds on exchanges as we all know the history of crypto is littered with exchanges being hacked and customers losing their coins so how do you keep the funds that you have on exchange is secure yeah that's a great question you know it starts off with a rigorous review of which exchanges we connect to making sure that you know their security and kyc systems make sense and then we make a risk-based assessment you and we say okay what what's the right balance of you know our liquidity desires and in our desire to you know minimize counterparty risk wherever possible you know there's really there's really no perfectly safe way to do this you know I think when you're trading on a centralized crypto exchange there there is a temporary risk that you take when your funds are there but again we try to minimize that upfront we make sure we don't have too much in any one place in any given time and you know that's that's what one of the main services that de Comey provides for our clients is you know constantly keeping an eye on that constantly making sure we're minimizing risk while still trying to get the best execution possible and I believe so far you've raised twenty seven and a half million is some of that used as working capital to pre-fund those trades or do you have another source of liquidity so we don't have additional liquidity apart from that you know it's mostly the clients funds that we're using you know we have other financing arrangements where we can you know provide additional backstops into that so really it's a matter sort of balancing all that liquidity at the same time but client funds are always you know fully funded there's a full reserve there and we're never in a situation where we don't have access to all the clients funds that that they have with us in which cryptocurrencies do support we have Bitcoin etherium litecoin and Bitcoin cash but we'll be adding quite a few more number of coins in the next couple months so stay tuned and how do you decide which ones to add yeah so there's a couple factors we look at you know client demand is obviously important and then we take a look at you know our ability to technically trade each coin what exchanges is it listed on and then it's also you know taking a look at the regulatory requirements and all the jurisdictions that we have clients you know so it might be different state-by-state for example in the US or country by country around the world so we'll always you know work with our legal team to to assess how that works you know for example in the US the big question is is it a security or not in other jurisdictions that might be a little bit different so we look at all all three of those factors when we decide what to list oh well so in the u.s. it could differ from state to state which assets I'm just trying to think like what's an example of an instance where customers of one state might be able to trade a crypto asset but customers of another state wouldn't yeah it really comes down to things like money transmitter licenses so different states have different rules and regulations around that where you know we've got licenses in many different states you know certainly the biggest ones in the US but places like New York have additional requirements for cryptocurrencies for example so we we did recently get our bit license in New York which allows us to take your clients but generally the process for approving new assets there takes a little bit more time and you'll see this with other exchanges too if you look at you know coinbase you'll see that some assets are able to trade in California but not New York for example so that's it's pretty normal but again what we're always you know keep an eye on what's available and we're always making sure our clients know what they can do in their jurisdictions and over the longer term let's say that digitized securities really become a thing do you see to go me adding assets like those yeah definitely so we've been proactive there you know talking to the SEC and FINRA figuring out what does it mean to be a sort of a registered broker-dealer in the crypto space a lot of us you know have our licenses from previous jobs and understand how to set up those types of institutions and so we're working very closely with the regulators and other other partners in the space other you know exchanges you know different companies that are working on listing tokens and working with issuers other 80 s's of custodians so all these things are necessary to really bring security tokens to our clients and we're like I said where we think we're at the forefront of that making sure as soon as that's those approvals start coming through from the SEC we'll be ready to add those to the platform luckily a lot of the technology we've already built is the same to support those things it's it's really a matter of getting the right licenses and regulations in place yeah I feel like that's the refrain I'm hearing from a lot of a lot of these startups right now I know what kind of training volume are you seeing so it's been increasing all the time you know depending on client demand on any given day like Jen said we have a lot of different styles of clients you know different needs but it's definitely been growing since we launched in December as we saw in 2013 and then again in 2017 when there's a crypto bull run it happens at a breathtaking pace so how does to Gomi plan to accommodate these sometimes unpredictable run-up events yeah so really the the key there is to be to be ready to make sure we're on boarding clients now has the you know sort of the crypto winter is thawing getting their accounts ready getting getting all the exchanges connected is so that when clients are ready you know they're ready to quickly you know deposit money or coin and trade with us and then pretty much everything after that is electronic you know we have an automated system for trading there's not a lot of human intervention that's need to to trade once the funding is completed so we think we'll be ready for that as soon as it comes and about that pre-funding question that I asked Charlie about having the money ready at exchanges is that something that would affect your ability to scale or in that case would you just require that the the client wire their funds first yeah generally our requirement is that the client just funds with us the process for moving to exchanges is fairly quick we're working with a lot of partners in that space both on the banking and on the wallet side technology is always getting better there so we think we have a pretty good set up now and it'll keep improving over time all right we're gonna discuss the bit license and other trends in crypto after the space but after the break but first a quick word from our fabulous sponsors did you know that if money-laundering were an economy its GDP would be the size of Canada's large volumes of tainted crypto assets move through financial networks often below the radar of banks cyber criminals use unregulated crypto exchanges to avoid detection no wonder governments around the world are rolling out tough new anti money laundering laws for crypto currencies complying with those laws isn't easy banks and exchanges need the best cryptocurrency intelligence available to avoid penalties now you can use the same powerful AML and compliance

tickets to join Laura and hundreds of the brightest minds in Bach chain at ethereal some New York May 10th and 11th at pioneer works in Brooklyn back to my conversation with Jennifer Campbell and Kevin Johnson have to go me let's just make sure people understand where to go me sits in the market compared to some other similar players can you explain how you're differentiated from the ODC desks and other types of software that facilitate trading on crypto exchanges market makers etc sure so I think there's three main buckets one like you said are the software only solutions so what that means is that you know first of all you have to have your own accounts at each of these let's say ten exchanges and then you have to send a wire into each of these ten exchanges and split your balance sheet up between each of those ten and then it'll show you where the good trades are and you know you can buy and sell in an in one hour gated interface but then to you know collect your coin at the end of the day you then have to log back into each of the accounts and then send them back to your own wallet and so there's a lot of operational hassle there that is just really not familiar to some of these more sophisticated investors but you know even if you're just the average clients you know it's a lot of work I think the second category is like you said the OTC desks and you know there's sort of a place in time for some of these OTC desks you know if you want to offload a lot of risk instantly the OTC desks will do that for you but for a lot of these larger clients say if they're trying to buy let's say you know 200 million dollars of Bitcoin over the course of a year well you know they really need an algorithm to do that for them you know over a period of time and so the OTC desks aren't a great place there and also for clients who want best execution you know essentially that means best price you can think about it that way but you know they need a different solution to show exactly how we have secured their trades why we did what we did and they need a lot more detail around you know why was that price the true market price that you showed me so I'd say those are the two broad categories and you guys you're not making markets either like you're not trading or anything like that it's just all for clients we're not making markets exactly and so there are uh there are also some desks that are agency only but what that means really is that you have to pre-fund your trades but they only actually rent you to market makers there isn't another product in the space that will actually smart route you to multiple liquidity pools and you know aren't also market making against you as well so we have mentioned the bitlicense I kind of was pretty impressed because you guys were recently approved for one but as far as I understand it I think it took quite a bit longer for some of the older companies in this face to receive theirs do you have any sense of why yours was approved so quickly or maybe you started applying before you launched or what was actually we we applied in the late summer around August well we just have a team that you know has really gone through a lot of these applications before they're really familiar with all the processes you know the security requirements you know all the operational procedures and so we just you know sort of had everything lined up you know the team was just sort of really familiar with all the background checks cetera and so it was a well understood process for for our team and because we did talk about how the bitlicense in particular is one example of a reason why the offerings from state to state would differ and I know you're probably not gonna want to answer this directly but I'm just curious to know like from a startups perspective what you think the bitlicense is adding or or not adding to the experience of being an entrepreneur in the space well I think it adds protections for you know New York clients to ensure that you know any company they interact with who has a bit license has really thought about every single potential edge case and you wants and you know you know it's a product they can really trust and so I think you know that definitely adds some value to the you know to the space but do you find it like particularly onerous i I mean you guys are a pretty young startup and yes you have good funding but I'm just I just wonder what that experiences like for entrepreneurs who have to especially in this case where you're trying to service in traditional financial players who you know definitely will want to be compliant right I do think you know it can be an expensive process and you know that's part of the reason we raise 15 million in our very first round and you know just because we wanted to get all those licenses it was part of our business plan so and so earlier Kevin said that having the bit license enables you to service New York customers is there are there any other things that enables you to do that you couldn't do without it the main two things would be taking New York clients and then operating out of New York yeah so we so we are able to have a presence they are able to take clients from there which is obviously important when we're servicing traditional institutions you know the New York City is the financial capital of America for sure and you know our goal is to not only service you know crypto native firms but also traditional asset managers and really try to make cryptocurrencies an asset class for for all types of investors Jennifer did reference Gregg to Starr's background a little bit earlier and obviously she spoke about hers but you know when I think of teams in the crypto space I really do feel like this is one of the area if they're one of the teams where I can look and say oh wow it's very clear how their background has led them here so can you just give an overview of the experience that's on the other people on your team and maybe Kevin you could just lead with describing your own background yeah definitely I've been involved in trading whether it's electronic or quantitative for my whole career I've worked at places like Citadel 2 Sigma and then gecko and kcg that's actually where I met Greg so always been working with you know how do we make trading efficient and more quantitative and electronic as the industry has changed and then I got into cryptocurrencies really as a hobby you know I was mining aetherium in my basement for a while and doing a lot of trading on the side and so when I had an opportunity to work with Greg again and kind of take my my finance knowledge and apply it to my hobby it was something I couldn't pass up and you'll find a lot of the people on our team have some our backgrounds they've worked at you know places like you know Citadel or to Sigma or kcg in the past and they they understand you know how electronic markets you improve experiences for clients and then they understand that your cryptocurrencies are it can certainly benefit from more efficient markets and better pricing for clients so given your background how would you say the financial infrastructure of the crypto space compares to that of traditional finance at least for now that's a great question it's pretty different but there are some similarities and you know a lot of the solutions we have from traditional finance need to be applied to crypto certainly you know taking a look at best execution and smart order routing and you know ensuring we get the best prices for clients is you know something you know we know how to do and we're trying to apply to the crypto markets where it differs is you know in a lot of the operational aspects that we talked about earlier you know how do you handle exchanges that require pre-funding how do you store assets for clients after you have them how do you figure out cold storage versus hot storage you know the also figuring out what can you trade in different jurisdictions what is a commodity what's the security those are what make it different but I think over time we're gonna take all of those learnings from traditional finance and continue to apply them to crypto in order to make sure that this can be an institutional asset class and how would you compare the early days of electronic trading and traditional finance to the early days of electronic trading now in crypto yeah it's actually probably pretty similar so you know as the equity markets grew up you know you have floor traders yelling at each other across a room you start to have more dealers come into the space providing additional liquidity things eventually happen more over the phone and then eventually on on screens on electronic platforms and you guys you got your farther into the 90s and 2000's you know the rise of electronic market makers who you know really ended up being the dominant liquidity providers and kind of took over for a lot of the dealers in most cases you know certainly even in mature financial markets there's a room for both you know liquid you know efficient electronic market makers as well as dealers what you tend to find are that the dealers focus on you know lower volume lower liquidity harder to source assets then if you're looking for something that's really liquid and highly traded like if you want to buy you know Apple or Facebook stock you're gonna go to an exchange you're gonna go through a broker that's electronic you're gonna use an algo and you're gonna end up interacting with a high-frequency electronic market maker that's the most efficient way to buy liquid instruments and what we've seen is that over the last couple years crypto certain crypto assets are moving into that category right certainly Bitcoin and aetherium and some of the other or liquid assets are traded on plenty of exchanges there are now electronic market makers quoting in those venues and so it makes sense then to take the same process of you know building an electronic smart order router to source all that liquidity for clients so this might be a stupid question but just listening to you talk I just realized I'm not sure if I understand the difference between an electronic market maker versus a bot which I don't know if you saw there was like this paper that came out last week that was talking about bots on exchanges front running sorry on Dex's front running people but I just realized I'm not really sure what the difference is yeah definitely so I think the way to think about it is you have to understand what what's the reason for the trading you know if the persons whoever writes the bot if their primary focus is providing liquidity if they're constantly providing two-sided markets on exchanges in order to capture spread yeah that's what I'm working maker is and that's what a lot of the you know either traditional finance or now crypto high-frequency market makers are doing they're trying to be flat they're trying to collect spread and they're trying to provide you know a great tight market and liquidity to natural customers trading BOTS can mean a lot of things bots can be market makers but BOTS can also be you know what you'd call removing liquidity they can be making a bet on a direction of an investment so you know they might look at a momentum or a reversion signal or you know they might be scraping Twitter feeds for sentiment you know they're actually gonna make a bet so BOTS can both provide liquidity as well as take liquidity it just sort of depends on what their what their ultimate investment strategy is oh I see so it's more like of an umbrella term and an electronic maker that can be one category of bot yeah that's right people trade for different reasons some people trade because they want to invest some people trade because they want to speculate and some people trade because they're providing liquidity so trading is trading but you know it all comes down to what's your model what's your alpha what's your what's your style of interacting with the market all right so something else that I was curious to ask you guys is a lot of people say that crypto is about democratizing access to finance so why do you think it's important to also recreate some aspects of traditional finance in these markets yeah I definitely agree with you know kryptos goal of you know decentralizing different institutions that have you know rent-seeking middlemen at the same time you know it's really important to realize that anything that touches our our monetary system needs to have you know rules and regulations and go through different types of controls you know so in different jurisdictions especially in the u.s. obviously regulators you know want to protect investors there's you know lots of rules around how to trade equities you need to be a broker dealer to trade directly on exchanges there's lots of great you know rules that help protect and users to make sure they get best execution and you know we've seen a lot of those play out over the years you know I think eventually crypto will be subject to the same kinds of things you know making sure that markets aren't manipulated making sure that you know retail customers especially ultimately get the best price as possible and that's really just to protect the client so we should we should expect that regulators always you are trying to are trying to make sure that people don't don't get ripped off aren't exposed to fraud or manipulation and what software like yours so obviously we can see that it's making markets more efficient for kind of the bigger players but is it then also having a similar effect for everyday people that are just buying you know like 10 not even 10 but if five bitcoins or something yeah absolutely so a good example of that is you know in a really efficient market no matter what exchange you go to the price will generally be the same right so when you want to buy Apple stock from your etrade account you're gonna get a very similar price for a small order whether it gets ratted to the noisy or to the Nasdaq or to a wholesaler and so you kind of count on that as a retail investor you don't you don't want to think about which exchange in my trading on in crypto right now the current state of the market is that it's very fragmented and the reality is because not everybody has access to all the markets because there's not a lot of you know smart order routing going on from an institutional standpoint there's plenty of price discrepancy now you know in in addition to the bots that are trading and making markets they're also BOTS conducting arbitrage which actually do provide a good service in the market they help make sure that those price differentials disappear over time as there's more liquidity and more access to the markets so that's that's ultimately what's going to help make sure that retail clients when they go you know to buy on coinbase that it's the same price they would have got if they would have bought on Gemini or on bitstamp so that's actually a sort of a natural progression of the market bringing in institutional clients having electronic market makers having people conducting arbitrage ultimately all of those things in an ecosystem make it so that when a retail client shows up at any one exchange they actually get you know what would be the best price for a small order ultimately I see to give me as a bridge between the centralized and decentralized worlds so you know back to your earlier question you know once you get into the centralized worlds you know going from Bitcoin to some other application you know that's it very easy for everything to be decentralized but to bridge the centralized and decentralized worlds you know there necessarily has to be some centralized solutions and so I think that's okay you know it's just the bridge and so you know that's what I'd say yeah it's sort of like coinbase being the bridge yes it's centralized but how are you going to get people's money into this base if you don't have something like coin phase right so both of you obviously have been watching these markets for a long time I'm curious to know what trends you've noticed in the way crypto trades over the years like you know what were the markets like at first and how are they now and like or you know obviously because we had that that big bull run in 2017 also you know what was that period like like you know if you were to make a you know observations about the trends in the trading of crypto what would those be well I think the biggest change is the shift in market structure right so when you started off you had you know people calling on the phone or skyping to buy and sell and now you have a lot more of the traditional market makers in the space who are making spreads you know really bringing spreads down it's really narrowing you know there's a lot more electronification of a lot of the markets and it's less dealer much more less dealer oriented than it used to be that's really shifting and so I think at least in terms of market structure shift that's I think that's the biggest difference for me Kevin do you have anything nad yeah definitely agree with all that you know we've seen you know the market kind of take off in 2017 as people were rushing to buy into I cos you know a lot of that was very sort of retail driven I think it's actually a good thing that the markets come back down to earth a little bit you know I think what we're seeing is you know higher-quality projects surviving and then as more investors get access to the market you know through either you know commodities that are you know efficiently traded on markets or you know security tokens that are properly registered and are able to be traded through brokers you know that's gonna bring more investment in the space and then you know cryptocurrencies ultimately will be you know not only a utility in and of themselves but also a platform for for other digital assets so I've seen that change over the last couple years and I'm excited for this next phase of growth and as you see more professionalization come to the crypto space do you have any predictions about how that's going to affect the players who have so far succeeded in crypto I think the people that have been successful through the bull and the bear market you know will continue to provide important services I think you know we'll all continue to grow as the market changes you know I think you know all the other major exchanges are continuing to upgrade technology and provide new great services for their clients firms like to go me are now providing the additional services that institutions really would require to access the market so we partner with a lot of people to make sure that the industry keeps evolving and improving so that it can be a you know an asset class that institutions can get into and I just out of curiosity do you see a place for OTC desks in the future always for sure you know like Jen said there's different styles of trading and different needs from a client if you if you have a large trade and you want to risk price and OTC just makes a lot of sense also for less liquid assets you know that might not trade on many exchanges you know that they might be a great destination they're you know I think you have to go me we'll focus on the liquid products that are traded Elektra Leon exchanges and as more assets become more liquid and with more volume well we'll continue to add support for those assets on Tacoma so I know you guys haven't been live for very long but I was just curious for a while now there's been this notion that institutional money is sitting on the sidelines but that a wall of institutional money is coming in and I can't help but laugh because I think I've been hearing these phrases since like 2017 although maybe a little bit less so now today's for good reason probably so you know just out of curiosity like even in the short time you've been live would you say that the the types of financial institutions and traders that are interested in your product are they changing at all I think we need to broaden the term institutional a little bit and so I think in mainstream media when we talk about institutions immediately everyone thinks about the bulge bracket banks like Goldman or Barclays or another Bank like that and for those folks I think it's gonna take some time for them to enter the space you know we're doing having a lot of conversations with folks like that but it feels like a much longer education process there are a lot of other folks who are also I would say institutions but they're much more nimble and agile so for example you know bigger hedge funds are is other broker dealers who trade quite a bit on our platform and I'd say they're the largest category really who don't have all the requirements that these larger bulge bracket makes have and who are in the space already Kevin where you can add something I was just gonna say that everybody is waiting for to go me you know the word we uh you know we look like that broker that you're used to working with in different asset classes you know we certainly have had a couple clients obviously come from from the crypto background already but there are some people that have never traded crypto before that come today go me and say you know now I can now I can finally do this in a familiar way you handle trading best execution and custody for me so yeah I definitely agree with Jennifer though that you know a lot of the traditional service providers in the space will you know are looking at crypto they're they're interested in it they're studying it but the more players you know some forward-thinking VCS and endowments and hedge funds are definitely getting at its pace yeah exactly so our first client actually was a very traditional RA who had never before been in the space and you know what they said was you know I've been waiting a long time for a solution that was you know compatible with you know all the requirements I have and so you know he did his first Bitcoin trade ever and so that was very exciting for sure Kevin referenced this earlier briefly but one of the trends that's starting to pick up to pick up in the crypto space is staking although none of the assets you offer now are currently sticking coins of hearing this actually working toward becoming a proof of state coin is that something that your clientele has an interest in and if so do you plan to offer them some way to stake their assets yeah absolutely that's that's something that's definitely a requirement you know for a theory and when it's available and for a lot of the other assets that we're looking at you know the same way you want to get you know interest on your cash deposits at your bank you know you need to make sure that your your assets that have you know some kind of additional feature are working for you whether that means staking or even things like even for a coin like Bitcoin being able to lend out your coin in order to get additional interest these are all features that our clients definitely want and we're working on ways that we can provide those services to our clients by working with different lenders different custodians different technology providers this is definitely going to be an important thing for us and it's really something else that can differentiate to go me because we're acting as your as your sort of one-stop shop for trading crypto and we handle while it's in custody for you we can do all of these other neat things for our clients without them having to go and set all this infrastructure up themselves so then as we know coin based custody is launching its stinking solution and will also offer governance so is that the kind of situation where if you have a relationship with coin based custody you would use their sticking service or do you plan to also do things like run your own notes and a participate in these networks yeah we'll definitely look for great partners in the space to help us implement these things you know there's there's a lot of things we're focusing on so having having lots of different custodians that we can look to that provide these services or other infrastructure providers you know are all things that we'll look to to to do this for our clients another trend is decentralized exchanges do you ever see to go me using those yeah absolutely I think that's that's an exciting space for us to look at over the next couple couple months especially as liquidity grows on them there's lots of other considerations we need to think about though for trading on on Dex's we need to obviously have a great system of wallets that we can interact with you know I'm excited for additional assets being moved on to things like the ethereum blockchain projects like W BTC or stable coins are all critical to making Dex's an interesting place for us to trade so we're definitely looking into that and just so I understand the appeal of using a Dex because so at the moment they're quite low liquidity but the appeal would be that then you don't have the risk of losing customer funds yeah that's right Texas has a couple features and it's worth breaking them out one feature is the fact that they're non-custodial and that you generally don't need to give up access to your private keys to trade on them the other thing that most exits have is that they're decentralized and that you know they don't necessarily have some-some single parties deciding what can or can't be listed so it's important when you're looking at Dex is to understand which features are you getting because you know some Dex is out there provide the sort of non-custodial aspect but they still provide you know some kind of gatekeeper for listings or some kind of kyc so the term Dex is probably used a little too widely now a lot of these are just non-custodial exchanges but even that's an improvement to not have to worry about the risk of losing your funds or getting hacked okay yeah I was just realizing yet in your case the regulatory issues would also factor in to which exchanges you would use yeah that's right when we look at exchanges we you know we want to understand do they do kyc do they have a listing policy so so Dex's are useful to us because of the non-custodial aspect but well you know we do to some extent want to understand who are we going to be interacting with so those are all considerations for trading on Dex's so we'll look at all those things before we make a choice stable coins are another big trend how might you take of those absolutely where we're looking at integrating those into the platform we've done some initial testing with that already stable coins will be our gateway to certainly to Dex's as well as to you know different exchanges around the world you know we we focused on exchanges like Jen said that folks that do u.s. dollar trading to begin with and that requires banking relationships and you know additional considerations for onboarding so being able to move into stable coins will open up the places we can trade and open up the door to things like Texas because then you don't need only Fiat to crypto exchanges you can use crypto decrypt exchanges yep that's exactly right you know a lot of our demand initially was for Fiat to crypto yeah these are institutions that are trying to invest dollars into cryptocurrencies but over time as people you know build up those crypto assets they're gonna want to trade them for other crypto assets and you know as you know the the base pair for most altcoins is Bitcoin or one of the stable coins so once you're sort of you know part of the crypto ecosystem you you're gonna be looking for that coin to coin liquidity yeah and I imagine simply for speed that would be you know I imagine once people enter your system they might want to keep their the US dollar value of their money in in a digital asset rather than because it's just the the slowness with the banking system I would imagine would be a disadvantage is that correct yeah that's definitely right you know if they're looking to withdraw quickly from our system you know stable coins are a fast way to do that for sure we're also working with a lot of great banks though that provide faster fiat services as well so I expect both both to improve over time so I'm sure you guys are busy adding new features to take o me what are some of the things that your clients can look forward to in the future well I think shorting margin and lending are things that are definitely on the roadmap and we're we hear clients asked us about those things all the time and so you know where it's really excited to be building out those features and stay tuned you know we'll have some we'll be adding those features quite quickly in the next year and for the lending how would that work exactly is that something where you would have other investors provide that capital or it can happen a couple different ways you know there are a lot of great partners out there that we're starting to work with that can either lend us coin so that our clients can short or that we can pledge our clients collateral or two to get interest on that and then over time as we grow you know there's opportunities for us to do that between our own clients as well making sure of course that we follow all the regulations in different states related to that and that the clients understand you know exactly what we're doing on their behalf all right well it's been so great having you on and change where can people learn more about you and to go me we go to - Jimmy calm and signup for our product all right well thanks so much for
