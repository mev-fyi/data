Jordan founder at DBA and former co-head of Investments at Galaxy digital and Alex pack managing partner at hack VC welcome Alex and Michael good morning good morning good to see you Laura good to see you Alex yeah good morning quick coffee on everyone speakers are not providing any investment advice and nothing they say should be construed as such any companies any of the speakers discuss may or may not be companies in which they or their firms would actually invest and they are discussing these companies only because they are interesting to them and probably you all already know since this is a news show nothing in the show has ever or will be investment advice all right the other thing heads up listeners because of the Thanksgiving holiday here in the US we've recorded this on Tuesday November 22nd a full week before this episode airs this means that whatever news happens between now and then which I'm sure will be plenty unfortunately won't be discussed in this show however at this moment we at least have some sense of how events could play out so we can discuss those potentialities even if we don't know what eventually transpires specifically okay Alex and Michael let's after after this long speech Let's finally get into it um let's just start with where we're at at the time of this recording which is that the collapse of FTX and Alameda may be knocking over another Domino or two namely probably at this point the crypto lender Genesis at the time of recording it has not filed from bankruptcy and I'll just add the word yet and in fact the Wall Street Journal quotes a Genesis spokesperson is saying our goal is to resolve the current situation consensually without the need for any bankruptcy filing Genesis continues to have constructive conversations with creditors so Additionally the Wall Street Journal reported that Genesis had reached out to finance which declined and to private Equity giant Apollo for either investment or to bid on their loan book okay so knowing that this episode will come out next week what do you think is most likely to happen with Genesis and also to its parent company dcg if you don't want to make a projection maybe just talk about how you're thinking about contagion crypto lending in general who wants to start I'm going to just volunteer Michael okay Michael good luck predicting one plus week into the future in this current market environment oh gosh well um I think it's interesting that we've seen complete silence on the dcg side I think that the thing that we saw that was different with Alameda was Sam was actively tweeting uh it was kind of crazy how actively he was tweeting and so I think when I think of what you should look for it's who's not saying anything and I've asked my friend who could possibly be working on the financing what's going on and the people who are working on it are dead silent you can see their telegram they haven't responded with it you know they haven't checked Telegram in two days that means they're up all night working so there's something going on in the background that there are there is some type of financing trying to be done it would take a traditional Finance lender to step in here this is a lot of money it sounds like it's 500 million dollars there are not as far as I know any crypto balance sheets that could take this Alex who could even be the categories of people that could step in and finance this yeah I mean it's the room you know the words we hear are like binance we've heard before uh Apollo group uh there are a few uh pretty large investment firms and tech companies even like Google that are on the cap table of Genesis you know basically I think what we've seen over the last six 12 months is just an incredible overreach and sort of fundamental problem with a lot of the a lot of the C5 models in crypto you know if you'd asked me a few days ago what's a sign that something is going to go wrong the silence is one thing but but to actually play the other side of the argument Michael like like I mean Sam was like you said Sam was extremely vocal and is just talked and talked to sort of hide this what we now know is you know allegedly this massive fraud right um so silence is one thing but generally like the more centralized the more levered you know the more leverage you have and then the more opaque you are the bigger your problems are probably going to be and the worse it's going to be in this market for you so you you got on the one hand Genesis very centralized but actually very very regulated like as about as regulated As It Gets In in crypto right I mean they even have they're even operating in New York but literally the source of like probably the biggest source of Leverage in the entire crypto Community was Genesis I mean at their height there were tens of billion dollars I think on the loan book so this is kind of the big the last big whale left right on the to get Unwound yeah and the the thing really that we're dealing with today started a long time ago right it's this should have ended and resolved itself in June the fact that dcg stepped into Genesis to deal with that three arrows loss we're paying for that today that's coming to surface right now this is not something that came out of FTX there was a new Alameda hole left but the thing that happened was everyone started doubting all opaque balance sheets after FDX so all the Genesis customers started to withdraw their funds dcg and Genesis then had to find the cash to pay those withdrawals and they had this liquidity mismatch where they had term lending term lending just means that you've given someone Capital with more than open you can't just call it back it could be three six months it could be a year and that creates different kind of liquidity structures there's different uh instruments in that there could be things like gbtc the ethereum trust and that's created this this problem for dcg and Genesis where they need to pay cash out and so I think I'm I'm looking for to resolve this is is really who is going to willing to take the haircut here is dcg going to take the haircut are they going to sell grayscale are they going to sell Genesis are they going to shut stuff down because they do need to raise Capital somehow and to do that they're going to need to sell some type of asset um Alex and I both come from private investing backgrounds and so we have a decent understanding of what their Equity book looks like their Venture Equity dcg is a very active participant Venture Equity space I think they have over 150 single names they traditionally are a much smaller check firm they were a little bit like coinbase Ventures started out to be these were 150 to 500k relationship checks relationship checks means that you're not underwriting like a venture capitalist you're looking this for some type of founder relationship to do business with Genesis those type of things and so that's something I think some people think they could generate cash with which is selling off some of these dcg Venture Equity books I don't know Alex how much you've looked at this but have you heard some of that stuff being shopped is that a possibility that they could start selling off this equity the problem with this is the timeline and the market environment it's obviously the worst time I mean maybe next week will be even worse but today is the worst time to try to do a distressed sale or any really Venture raise of any kind in crypto yeah I think a lot of these assets are are very interesting I mean grayscale is a huge Cash Cow even Genesis I I agree with you like knock on wood that some big fraud doesn't get discovered in the next week but for the most part it's probably an asset liability mismatch for on the one hand or two it's this issue of you know we discover there's like dcg had this one billion the parent company had this one billion dollar loan from Genesis and so there was this sort of question of maybe they were double like Levering up and doing their their own trade uh with the with the parent and that that sort of cloud things but okay so a couple of things so so first of all just to go back um just to make it clear so binance was approached and they declined to invest because they expected their it might cause some conflicts of interest down the line um but a couple of things that I want to address that it's actually kind of plays into what Alex was just saying so I did an interview with ram alawalia who he's been tracking this very closely and he said that Genesis is both illiquid but also insolvent and so Alex when you talked about this one billion dollar loan I believe it was from dcg to Genesis oh okay just somehow the way you phrase that no no it was it was the opposite it was Genesis to dcg oh wait so but then I have a question oh right we're right sorry that's right but wait um how does this work with um because this was caused by 3ac right so these are two separate things the first thing that that happened a few months ago was dcg came out and said we're gonna recapitalize Genesis we're gonna push I don't remember what the number a billion dollars or whatever I think it was 1.2 billion thing came out of ago that said that Genesis has loaned a billion dollars to thereabouts give or take a few hundred million I remember the exact number two dcg and this we don't know if this occurred recently if this occurred a year ago I think what people are speculating is that basically dcg did the same trade that blocked Phi and three arrows did the sort of Market neutral you buy a bunch of gbtc you you then sell you had hedge Bitcoin on the other end to take advantage of the ARB that would be bad that would be worth the insolvency comes from that you're like doubling down on this trade that's broke in the backs of several other large like counterparties okay and wait and but that's because gbdc started training below nav is that essentially I mean that's only been getting worse so I guess yeah but the timeline of that doesn't match up so just to take a step back because I think we actually have a pretty good understanding of the Genesis and dcg situation we've pieced together the idea this week and so just two seconds of what happened right um Luna implode three arrows is now Belly Up Genesis is owed a billion dollars by three arrows and so now there's this billion dollar hole the things that they the collateral that was left at Genesis was the most illiquid collateral right in any type of liquidity scenario you start to sell the Bitcoin you sell the eth and the things you're left with are the things you can't sell so you inherently have this liquidity mismatch and so that was the gbtc and E the thing that was dangerous inside of that was the accounting of the asset right there are different levels of accounting um when Alex and I run our valuations we have to tell our investors what we think things are worth they're different assets and they're different kind of quality of the price if that makes sense like really early Venture stuff versus very liquid assets like DTC the difference between the nav and the trading price of gbtc caused a lot of these issues they were being accounted at different rates and so this created a bit of an actual value Gap that's where the insolvency would come from uh the value gap between the nav and the price of the actual gbtc and E so that's the actual impairment loss and when you say the installment that's where the insolvency would come from are you talking about for dcg or for Genesis Genesis so the money that Genesis was out and they were out to basically you know they had a hold of Phil came in from dcg from that promise or note that 1.2 billion dollar promissory note that said we're going to step in and we will make sure that we are well capitalized that our counterparties have Equity to trade against because right in a trading business the equity is really important you're probably going to trade people with larger Equity than the assets they're lending okay so one other thing that ROM was saying that when you have that kind of situation along with things like Gemini urn and circle lend and their customers being probably kind of waiting to see what happens here with Genesis that there's a question of who will be first in line and I was running a few had any insight into that yeah so our understanding of the thing that's really holding up this deal is that in August Genesis called back a loan from Alameda it was a large loan everybody rethought their risk and they called it back the concern is that Alameda went to FTX to get that capital and that capital is now sensitive to a clawback so there are these concepts of 90-day clawbacks and this type of thing and if Alameda took customer funds and gave it to Genesis now Genesis has a whole nother problem which is that itself is indeterminate so how does how can you raise Capital when you don't know the size of the hole and that there's this big clawback risk and so I think that in talking to people working on the financing there are different interpretations of that club at risk there's different interpretations of who is where in the cap stack because this isn't really clean this is the big issue FTX was not a bank they were not an FDIC insured place they were not a custodian and so you start to go through the equity stack normally which means you have senior debt you have Junior debt you have unsecured that then you have the act the employees right this is the water what I'm describing is the waterfall of who would get paid out in some type of trust liquidation the concern is where is Genesis in that stack especially if the money came from some type of FDX customer liability and so this is confusing kind of legal minutia but it's really important to understanding the finance the ability to finance Genesis and dcg on a go forward do you have a sense of how much money it is that is at risk of being clawed back the numbers that Genesis in was out to uh three arrows in Alameda was significant uh we don't have the actual numbers but the the stories are two to three billion dollars um and that sounds reasonable with the traditional kind of risk that people were running well okay okay so this potentially I mean it could take so long or do you know how long it would take to figure out all of this like it sounds like what minimum a year or something I don't know I don't think anyone has a good interpretation a lot of this is new if this was happening at a US regulated exchange like a Commodities exchange we would have plenty of precedent transactions this is new it's it's a lot of different laws a lot of different jurisdictions that are going to claim over this and so I think that to Alex's point about selling private assets time is of the issue Essence here because dcg does have debt out and they have debt interest rate payment right they do have this um I don't remember Alex you know when they actually did that maybe it was August of 2021 that dcg parentco it was in when things were going really well ECG opened up like a six percent revolver is that public now yeah yeah but yeah I so that so now they sort of are going in both directions as the what I was saying earlier like there are loans from Genesis to dcg and there's recapitalization from DCd to Genesis it's just really tough because yeah the lack of precedent transactions and then there's like there's no doubt that it's gotten a lot harder to raise institutional money for any crypto crypto Venture deals crypto funds crypto companies so now you have this this remarkable headline risk on top of the opacity and difficulty of like figuring out the legal minutia yeah like there's a ticking time bomb with these with these interest payments um it's ironic because dcg was like you know they they have this huge office in Stanford that's new that's like 50 million dollars and they do the like I don't know they they are they were a Bedrock of of the crypto space and they were spending cash uh quite quite free you know a lot um uh just a few months ago so yeah life comes at you fast yeah seriously one last thing I thought I'd mention here is that Apollo did recently hire Christine Moy uh to lead their blockchain strategy that was just back in April and I don't remember hearing too much about them being super active in this space before so it's just interesting that they're being approached now at this moment when not that long ago they decided to perhaps put a foot in the space and who knows if kind of this new interest uh in crypto will kind of help the situation or if they'll feel like oh whoa what are we getting into maybe we don't want to get in I don't know anyway do you have any thoughts on any of that or yeah I I think that there are a lot of people who specialize in traditional finance and this type of stuff I think that the president transaction would be the mount gox claims I think we are aware of some crypto friendly traditional asset managers who stepped in and spent a lot of time understanding what the you know what the claims you trade at there was a pretty institutional effort to transfer those claims I think that they sold everywhere from one to five thousand dollars for Bitcoin that I Alex I'm sure you've been chopped those deals before but that kind of feels like where this what this FTX type credit would be resolved and it is in one of those people who understands crypto and has good debt distress background this is complicating two things I know the FTX side and the Genesis side but they're obviously interlinked all right so Michael you kind of started to talk about the roots of um what I'm now calling the crypto Carnage of 2022. so maybe let's just keep going with that because clearly you know looking back there's just so many ways in which all of this is interrelated so you know with with the idea that hopefully the crypto industry will learn some lessons from this let's try to unpack all the different causes because I it looks to me like there are so many why don't we maybe start with we can start with I guess the lending bed that you started to talk about but I definitely also want to ask Alex about his tweet threads so we'll go to that right after if you but I feel like you you didn't get to finish your full thoughts on the crypto lending so why don't we start there yeah the the way we got here was a dramatic credit expansion in 2021 during covet right I think we talked about it where genesis's lending book goes from a billion dollars to 130 billion of originations but I think something like 14 billion outstanding and Genesis was by far the most sophisticated lending death Genesis and block five and start to see this opportunity where the space is capital constrained everybody has Bitcoin and they want cash the two most sophisticated players to do it are three hours capital and Alameda they're running generally what's considered no price risk strategies these are the what we talked about with the gbtc Arbitrage and across exchange delta neutral Arbitrage that was the Alameda thing and so lenders are generally pretty I mean you know happy to give out Capital there they start to grow the value of their collateral and so they're able to grow the value of their uh borrow so what we get is a boiling up the Frog there is marginal risk being added because the perception of risk is not there the assets are growing the value of the collateral is growing the thing that really gets dangerous is the entrance of new less scrupulous lenders I'm not going to say names because we actually don't know their internal risk models but a lot of people start offering under collateralized or completely uncollateralized lending Alex I don't know if you'd been pitched some of these companies that were raising money but they were showing spectacular amounts of revenue from their lending businesses and this is like mid 2021 all these people have really grown their lending books and really grown their lending business and they're driving Equity value and what that does is it forces the more sophisticated people like block five like genesis like Galaxy to take on more risk if they want to continue lending there is a very self-destructive nature of Lindy markets where the rational participants either stop lending and basically you know stop offering their business or take on more risk than they're comfortable with that's the that's the really dangerous part of this business and so we see that in both private Market investing and lend and so that's the condition that sets up this giant explosion where three arrows in element are able to grow their books to two or three billion dollars each they didn't start there they started with 20 million dollars and they grew it and so the amount of risk on was just way more than anybody understood I don't know Alex if you are on the other side of some of those lending company Equity financings but I remember um blocked by linden Celsius all went to Market with big fundraises yeah absolutely a lot of a lot of equity went into it as well um yeah look I think the I think the big problem is crypto's early use cases are very Financial Services that's Defy is by far the category of of crypto that has the strongest like product Market fit and the sort of speculation leveraged loan uh lending um and C5 is is really big it's the early stuff and so what this means is it becomes very like crypto uh prices and activity becomes very susceptible to these debt crises and it becomes very susceptible to macro issues so yeah why did why did uh all these lenders pop up and grow so fast to be honest it was probably because of the FED like it's because you have very low interest rates uh for multiple years and many forget that literally the way that the fed and sort of other central banks influence the the economy is through the credit markets right and since quantitative easing they literally buy and sell like private Market debt right so when the FED wants to raise interest rates the actual mechanism by which they do so is deleveraging like they take debt off of the markets and that trickles down to crypto in a really big way right so yeah even in a period of deleveraging like that's happening now over just a couple percentage points basically you're seeing every big source of credit that's been pooling in crypto just blowing up and collapsing um one by one so the main one was three three AC and and this sort of incestuous you know these lenders and then uh the borrowers these big trading firms but the other one was Tara too which started and Tara was actually like a sort of hidden version of Leverage and Alex did you see uh did you see Doe's tweet this week he actually finally admitted what happened which is crazy go um to reference this does responding to Dan from CMS Dan is saying it looks like this is the transaction that killed Luna uh and doe confirmed it publicly for the first time for for the audience Luna was buying Bitcoin to kind of shore up this stable coin it was the idea of the value of the collateral the Luna Foundation sent I believe it was 1.5 billion UST something like that to the desk to go buy Bitcoin but what happened was they depeg themselves right they what happens is the desk has to sell all that uh UST risk and so it really drains all the liquidity out and so this sets up the condition for Luna to depeg they were selling the asset that they needed to keep the peg on which drives the pig the other way and so we get this realization that the thing that blew up three arrows in Alameda for the first time was does that transaction and so now we actually know the source of the crisis wait wait wait wait you were saying that when Tara when the Luna Foundation guard went to implement its plan to have the BTC backstop that the first kind of payment to to purchase that BTC is what kicked off the death spiral no sorry there was there was a specific you know study Labs deploying more work I probably got it wrong but there was a famous transaction where the the lfg tweets that they're sending I know Alex what was it exactly is like a billion and a half yeah they basically were were selling a bunch of UST for Bitcoin uh to shore up their balance sheet ironically this is sort of a version of deleveraging we could stop having all this totally uncollateralized unbacked UST we should give it get it off our books and give it to Genesis in exchange for some Bitcoin which is maybe more real collateral to back our algorithmic highly leveraged stable coin but yeah I like we we did a rough estimate and by the time three eight like by the time the madness of the Terra death spiral happened like that was basically 15 to 20 billion dollars worth of Leverage that was just just got Unwound in like two or three days right and yeah Genesis was one of the counterparties free AC I mean Alameda everybody everybody lost and nobody really said exactly how much they lost and that yeah 15 billion dollars getting poked out of the system can quickly lead to whatever 50 you know another eight or ten billion dollars from Ft FTX 10 or 20 billion more from Genesis the important thing right is that Voyager and blockfy also were involved in this and then Sam stepped in to bail them out so a lot of this pain got that got taped over and now we're seeing the fact that there was not assets there that that's that significant value destruction is now showing up in a lot of places because a lot of those people were lending their assets to the people who are running these anchor yield farming and other you know Luna they're long Luna the asset which got destroyed and so there was just a tremendous amount of value destruction there okay wait but just let me fully understand because I still don't understand so the Luna Foundation guard goes to sell UST in order to purchase Bitcoin and then that kicked off what exactly that was the Deep this is this is during the depending if you remember the the liquidity of the market got really bad the idea the depicting happens around the idea of the the three pool um there was a proposal to add the three pool to add UST as the fourth stable coin and I believe the devote pass out because I don't remember correctly it doesn't but regardless there's this this all happens around these these acute points where people need to make some transformation transfers of assets and transfers of risk and we start to see UST get away from the dollar I think it trades at 98 cents the problem with all algorithmic stable coins is that your confidence decreases as you need it to grow right the lower the farther away it gets from the peg the less likely people are you feel like it's going to get back and so what they were doing was they had a lot of an asset UST they were selling that to buy Bitcoin to place in the reserve to shore up you know study Labs deploying Capital but what it does is you have to send that UST to somebody and that person is now less confident that it's going to go back to a dollar so their risk manager says so this is actually good risk management their risk manager says you can't hold a billion and a half dollars of a stable coin that could go to zero you need to get that to a better asset that could be eth it could be Bitcoin it could be usdc it could be tether you basically going to buy it anywhere you can and so all of this transfer causes a complete drain because of the risk manager of the person they transferred it to so that takes the peg from 98 cents I think down to 92 and then that just starts the complete unwinding of of UST and Luna and we don't know really on the Alameda side where their losses were because in the market they were representing that they did a good job on that trade but we just don't know because it was so opaque okay okay and I I view the sort of high level story here is these are all deleveraging events that happened as interest rates started to rise and they were very opaque ironically Tara was the most like on chain you actually could calculate pretty reasonably like how much leverage I don't think anyone with three arrows was doing that that sort of very simple napkin math or I guess Genesis yeah so this is all like this is a sort of very opaque uh forms of Leverage that had been built up over the last few years that all sort of popped over a multi-month period as rates rised um and then you know sprinkled a little bit of like just fraud and confidence on top and uh which is you know gets into the FTX part yeah a lot of us Michael and I probably I don't I didn't really guess that fgx was going to that that we were going to have this other like serious leg down and I have like a serious like long-term uh negative opinion of Sam uh but still yeah so once you get fraud in there too and and just sort of this opacity it gets really it just keeps spiraling okay so in a moment we're going to talk about how your suspicions of Sam

start earning every day until mainnet launch get started at minima.global back to my conversation with Alex and Michael Alex so you have alluded to this and so have I you had an experience early on with Sam and it was interesting because you know I want to finish that with and Alameda or and FTX I guess technically you were supposed to be talking about Alameda but FTX came up in an inadvertent way so why don't you tell us what it is that happened when you considered investing in Alameda in 2018. yeah so we were one of the first Venture Capital firms to consider investing in in Alameda this was before FTX existed so it was just Alameda at the time investing in Sam and I think we were probably the the one the earliest one that did the most serious diligence around 2018. this is my like I I'm an investor in early stage crypto infrastructure I've seeded a bunch of D5 protocols and player ones and I love and and I've backed exchanges and trading firms and so I love this I view it as like sort of tech enabled liquidity provisioning for crypto it's important infrastructure what Sam was was doing in building so I met him early on in 2018 and like we were very excited we basically did a handshake agreement to do a deal uh pending diligence and then the diligence was just nuts like it was just months and months of work we spent probably like five months five six months on diligence and and typically yeah what's the normal oh I mean we were writing like a like a single digit million check so it uh you don't you know like a few weeks sometimes is diligence for that right um we're not you know we're putting in a billion dollars here but the reason we just kept like we spent all this time on this was because there was just so much to unravel and there was like peeling off layers of this onion there were these financials that he would show us about Alameda in the early days that were very reminiscent of the spreadsheets that I've seen in the bankruptcy filings just these like chaotic footnotes randomly strewn around the sheet that say like sorry we don't have this information or just a startup you know there were like all these hidden losses that came to light only after months of diligence the losses we could never they were called like untraceable losses by the team and by us internally we never figure out if there was like just massive infrastructure problems if they like forgot that they were custodying some assets or like sent it to a wrong address and lost the assets or if there was fraud or whatever um but like half of his team ended up leaving after that big incident so it's called like the April Fiasco so it probably wasn't just an honest mistake and then there was all this ambiguity about where the money was going and he was creating FTX sort of in secret while he was talking to us to raise money for Alameda and this came to light and uh he didn't want us to invest or have exposure to uh FTX so he was like he was sort of like using or proposed to use our money if he would have taken our investment to basically fund this sort of separate business that we had no part of or exposure to behind our backs which is the opposite of what he did today allegedly like you know he has this side business Alameda that nobody has any information on or ownership in I think it's just him and Gary that are on the cap table and it had crushing losses and he decided to just give all the FTX money not just investor money but you know customer deposits apparently to prop up Alameda so this sort of shell game of like I'm going to use a bunch of money here to pay this to pay off my other entity that I own over here that nobody knows about it was we just saw a bunch of red flags and we passed pretty early and it wasn't great for us actually Sam was pretty upset at us and he called us out on Twitter he posted this like tweet Thread about us a couple years ago saying he had this Horror Story with this bad VC everyone should avoid this VC and they asked too many questions and they were they were stringing us along and stuff yeah so that that's sort of the high level it was interesting I mean I've had to deal with this for four years but I look I didn't expect it to end in this way even after all this early stuff that I encountered and so you did other VCS know that that your firm is who he was talking about and like avoid you for for that reason well yeah yeah it was very specific information in his Twitter Thread about us it was like it was like I'm not gonna mention names but you know who you are and then he went on to mention some very specific like situations and this like trip to China that and we're like we were one of the most prominent I was I was a co-founder of dragonfly Capital at the time when we did this and you know we were one of the most prominent VCS in China and the US it's like kind of obvious and yeah we lost a few deals people I think think of VCS as like we make all the decisions and we're the Masters of the Universe but we're in sales like the best deals are always very competitive and Michael and I fight over deals and we should you know it's like you have to sort of win allocation and so for a while Sam was going around saying hey uh if you want to take FTX Ventures or Alameda research money you can't take Alex's or dragonfly's money so that you know we lost a few deals for that reason Alex I think it's worth also bringing in CZ at this point because you know I don't know if you were involved but originally Alameda was building a derivatives exchange for binance is my understanding binance ended up acquiring Jex is that right no the acquisition did not go through but it came very close yeah yeah they spent a lot of time on it right because Finance did not have a strong derivatives look and this is the Alex's old partner Bill and CZ and Sam have this different side of the world this is the kind of onshore and offshore China exchanges Alameda research started in Berkeley but really went quickly to Hong Kong and so this is happening a little bit out of the purview of the major US VCS right like the the San Francisco New York crew does not really know that this is emerging because the the both information and social network are very different over there and so I think that that's a lot of how Alameda and FTX snuck up on the US kind of capital markets and Technology focused investors that Alex's background and his team have a very strong you know trading Capital markets Asia pipeline that we don't have here and so I think they saw this earlier than us and because of that they also had a much different sense of diligence right they had people that they could call and say do you see these people on markets what type of activity are they doing you know what type of size are they how much smarter are you than them and there wasn't really that side of the equation that we could ever get to check out which was they told us they were the best but none of their competitors told us that they were fearful of them so that was always a sign for people that were sophisticated there yeah it's very difficult to do diligence on a offshore supernational like International yeah supernational exchange um yeah Mo most of the investors in FTX were first-time investors in crypto projects and maybe never even invested in exchange before because that's not a there aren't many like startup exchanges even but let alone one of these International entities that have to have very odd you know banking relationships and things like that and then add that to a Founder who just like habitually lies to or exaggerates or uh you know lies by Omission or whatever it ends up being it's very tough to to discover something like this if they're like very gung-ho on just not telling you the truth and uh obfuscating things as far as I know no investor looked under the hood and found fraud that the fraud was not discovered I don't know if anyone else feels or has heard this but I don't know anybody who requested documentation was given it and said that this is um they did the initial Equity financing was around a billion dollars and they sent out a pretty limited data room but it was a data room it showed enough information that for the size of the check for the maturity of the business that people could get comfortable with it uh my old firm spent time on it we requested more information more on the Alameda relationship we wanted to understand who owned what because we wanted to own it right like anytime you invest you want to be on the same side aligned with your founder to make sure that all decisions are made through the best interest of of the investors and everybody that's the idea and a lot of people couldn't get comfortable with the alignment not fraud I don't think any of us expected that the numbers weren't there and that the bank accounts were co-mingled those type of kind of more operational due diligence is not a big thing at early stage Venture firms it's just not where they spend as much time and I don't think they would know the right questions to ask and so a lot of this is like anything it's not a single event into three or four things that happen at the same time and what was happening in the private financing markets at the time was if you told a Founder I need more information to do this deal they would say I'm just going to go with an investor who doesn't feel that way right capital is a commodity at the time it was a very accessible commodity and if you said I need to do more work unless they founder really really loved you and wanted to work with you and in exchange doesn't care right exchange just needs a capital to go they didn't need to provide more information so like the lending markets the private markets were getting into a state that they were self-destructive that the the fact that there were less scrupulous investors meant that if you did your work you just weren't investing like I can't tell you Alex I don't know how many deals you feel like you lost because you asked for information you asked for time and they said someone else is going to gonna do this without doing the work basically yeah it honestly it sounds like a lot of Race To The Bottom type things like when you were talking about the crypto lending situation and about how people kind of loosened their standards because of of competition it sort of feels like the same thing is happening here in the in the VC thing that when the entrepreneurs have the upper hand they can kind of force that situation which leads to these outcomes where they might have been perpetrating fraud and nobody seemed to pick that up who was closely working with them but Alex because of your experience I did want to ask you you know in your Tweet thread you said I sat on this story for years because I was afraid of Sam's retribution and I also talked in a recent episode about how it's sort of the same for journalists when you maybe get a tip but then you find out like other than the one person who tipped you off like nobody will talk about about this thing um because you know whoever their you know their issue is with they're very powerful so I was curious like if you had thoughts on how it is that you know VCS can overcome this or how the industry can overcome this and and like kind of catch Bad actors uh beforehand in a preventative way yeah yeah it's uh it's it's quite it's quite tough um especially if you have this founder who's I think at this point it's very obvious he was very he was very intentional about a lot of the stuff that he did he was very vindictive and yeah actually I think even going back to Michael's Point earlier that like a lot of investors they saw audited financials you know of FTX but no one as far as I know I talked you know a lot a lot of people called me after after my tweets last week nobody saw any balance sheet of Alameda and I as far as I know we might have been the last one to really see the full all the weird spreadsheets all the financials um yeah so I think I think Sam like learned after his experience with us like hide all the bad stuff into this box and this back box is called Alameda and it's separate nobody gets to invest in it nobody gets any ownership or information in it but me and all the bad stuff happens there and I can have audited financials here and you know Alameda is just one line item right uh we don't have to dig into what's actually going on with the surface so again that's really hard I mean I think if you step back and think about how do you prevent these ftxs in the future these incidents just sort of sociopathic Bad actors like there's stuff that investors can do on better like Risk Management more holistic diligence we could refuse to invest we could try to ask each other for sure and you know there's some like some stuff that we can do by just sharing stories with each other but um this doesn't really scale right this this is really tough and yeah once you to your point like there's no coincidence that this happened during just like a a bull market within a bull market like the zero interest rate generational like post covid uh boom and then the the crypto boom within it it's just hard to get yeah it's a race to the bottom I think the two things that you actually can do on a systematic level to stop this one you you obviously need regulation um of centralized crypto platforms uh this is the classic way to weed out Bad actors right but it's very difficult here because these are supernational organizations I mean in many ways these orgs like like FTX and binance and so forth they're like they're like the East India Company hundreds of years ago like they're just these they operate in they interact like they negotiate directly with governments and heads of state and it's it's tough like it we don't have like a a global regulatory body to deal with them that effectively and that so but that's you have to do something right and then the third area uh is is actually is the art the most ironic thing which is like the way that Sam and Alameda made most of their money was like in defy they got really early in the defy they made all these D5 coins that they pumped up the values the mark to Mark values of and they used to convince like genesis and so forth to give them huge loans and then they basically at the end the way they went down was because they try to like kill defy and pursue this like secondary regulatory agenda or the shadowy regulatory agenda in DC yeah I mean the technology behind what like MJ and I invest in uh this like D5 based Financial system it's all about like how do you create non-custodial open permissionless fully transparent like Financial rails and and that's the kind of thing that we have to I hope we could get to long term it might take years but so I think that's the important thing right is that it's a combination of Citizen journalism that caught this right I think it was parsec in the block noticed that the stable coin wallets were drained right if we could have seen the Silver Gate leg you know the Alameda bank account if it was unstable coins if it was on chain we would have observed the solvency or not and so there's a proposal Mike belshi has a good tweet Thread about this that exchanges may need to hold customer accounts and stable coins on chain and that might be the best way to do the audit because these things are very audible so I think the really important thing as an industry is we need to make falsifiable claims and we need data-driven investigations and so when people come out and say things like eth is a scam well that's not productive because you know there is that's not a falsifiable claim that's an opinion but when you say things like hey the FTX wallet has not sent out withdrawal in four hours or it's stopped or the stablecoin wallets these are evidence-based things and instantly the market knows what to do with that information now people certainly got hurt because it was this combination of fully transparent and opaque systems right that caused this exacerbated uh a banker on everything got bank run but I think that that's what we really need to do going forward is evidence-based reporting um using a very clear on-chain data and then on the other side of course we need to regulate things that are acting with trust any trusted system needs to be regulated that's the point the idea of Defy is that you don't have trust you have trustless systems that you can verify and so you don't need to regulate these things without those issues I think that Alex and I would want to put a big caveat on this that defy still is not faultless there are issues there's an issue going on as we're talking that Ave is being attacked by an oracle manipulator is maybe the best way to describe what they're doing with it but it's the same problem and to give a quick two seconds on that the the quality of collateral is what caused a lot of these issues FTX was generating SRM and CRM and ftt their exchange token they were posting that as if it was a dollar of that was a dollar of staplecoin it's certainly not and so the lenders need to underwrite the quality and liquidable whatever that word is the ability to liquidate that collateral and what we're seeing today is that low liquidity collateral has a really hard time finding the right value and so people are manipulating that that can happen in D5 as it can happen in centralized exchanges it's the same concept and so the citizen journalism the transparent versus trusted systems plus this kind of collateral underwriting are the a lot of The Primitives that we need to focus on yeah real journalism too not just citizen but like like the coindesk article was what yeah that's basically leaked not even much they leaked like a small subset I think of of alameda's balance sheet and then and at first when that article came out I was like whatever like what does this mean it doesn't none of this is useful and then people started like to your point they started doing like this on-chain forensics to try to figure out and then it became actually very exciting and and it I think it actually like part of it cracked the case right so you had these three three big elements of like on-chain sleuthing that went on one like all the loans were obviously off chain but yeah the value of the collateral assets is on chain so this is like the most basic thing like you could see for yourself ftt is like Sam thinks it's worth eight billion dollars and there's only like a one billion circulating Supply and the trading volume is a couple million a day and 80 of that trading volume happens on the FTX exchange like these are you can sort of make your conclusions about well are they being marked to Market appropriately so that was one and then you had these money flows out of uh uh between this was I don't remember this crazy thing that came out like there was this tweet a few months ago that Sam posted and he said heads up just rotating some old ftt wallets like nothing big happening and in the background it was obviously like he was moving like 10 billion dollars of ftt from Alameda to FTX or vice versa it didn't really matter because like on the other end with a part we didn't see was that he was moving like you know billions of dollars of FTX deposits uh of real money and then like sort of swapping it with with ftt collateral so again we don't see all side we don't see both legs of the trade um but seeing one side and then just having a small leak of the of the centralized off chain part can help a ton really so let's talk a little bit more about these kinds of tokens like ftt I don't know what the takeaway is is it that this spells the end of coins that are kind of closely associated with a single company or is it just they didn't do this kind of coin right and there's a way to do it where it doesn't cause these sort of systemic risks or what are your thoughts I think it's less about the nature of the coin and more about the place that's gonna treat it as quality collateral right I can create MJ coin overnight and nobody here should take it to be worth anything but zero that's the truth the most sophisticated D5 systems like compound and Ave have pretty interesting risks going on under the hood there's companies like Gauntlet companies like chaos Labs that are trying to assist D5 protocols and how do you actually treat a coin what's the difference between ftt Bitcoin and eth if I need to sell 100 million dollars of it how much am I going to get out what type of risk does that create what is the you know these are the very interesting questions that we need to look at going forward is like what is quality collateral and um how do you price it and so I think that that it's less about the exchange tokens that's a completely different question of of good exchange token design but the idea of of collateral quality and underwriting I think is a thing that we're going to see a lot of innovation on yeah and and the transparency of of D5 is is ultimately it's uh like you know come for this sort of like wild west like everything permissionless Finance you could trade any assets stay for like these transparent composable systems right so yeah with ftt just real quick if you could think of ftt as basically like pseudo and BNB as pseudo Equity of of FTX The Exchange right so you have these tricky situations in Trad Phi 2 where a public company in a moment of Bull Run Mania decides to take out a debt Alone collateralized by its own equity and it doesn't often work out very well in those situations because like their likelihood to repay their interest payments is highly correlated with their stock price right but that's a known like that's a known situation I believe it's illegal for any Financial Service Company doing that though right like the Norwegian banking crisis a lot of these banking crises were caused by this type of behavior and you regulate that out yeah like these these C5 lenders shouldn't be throwing up their hands like oh I have no idea how to Value this ftt like it's a known yeah centuries of of like like Equity you can collateralize loans have occurred in the world yeah the big issue I think to to MJ's point is you had the situation where the there were these employees at these lending companies whose job was to increase revenue and increase AUM and they were incentivized in a way to say well maybe this thing is actually pretty safe and anyway who's gonna it's all private who's gonna tell on me like I but in in Ave or compound uh the decisions about how do we treat the value of collateral how do we Market at what point do we do we Margin Call and and the Margin Call happens algorithmically there's no like call up your broker and say hey I'm good for it can you not Margin Call me today give me an extra week none of that is possible in defy and that's the benefit that's why it's so much more robust and anti-fragile really uh than a lot of these C5 lenders Alex do you think regulation had a something to do with this where we see a lot of these pseudo Equity tokens I think a lot of investors are frustrated with the state of the governance token world where it's clearly being priced as the market as pseudo Equity but it doesn't have any claims it doesn't have any control and if you treat that as collateral if you're posting governance tokens and there's no claim on cash flows no claim on rights like what actually is it and I think the U.S regulatory environment and lack of clarity has contributed to these complicated non-obvious token models I don't know how you feel about that yeah it's a it's a reasonable Point generally I think tokens that have fundamental value and actually have cash flows and claims on on like cash flows are much more interesting they're the most they're the exciting and that's what like in many ways tokens is an evolution on the concept of of equity right um of shares but the problem is the more you make your token like actually valuable and have a claim on Real World Resources or assets the more you have to worry about the SEC coming in and saying oh this is security right I don't know if that was the biggest impact here uh as opposed to just the mass fraud uh which you know leveraged a lot of the ambiguity and Novelty of crypto to sort of Hoodwink uh Trad five people or various people around the world but it's not yeah it we do need yeah of course I mean we've been you know we've been banging on this drum for years like we need a little bit more clarity uh so that we can have know what these assets actually are but do you think we are to blame it all in terms of the community had a bit of a naivete of the Dual use of these things you know I spent a lot of time thinking about things like nuclear energy I think everybody believes it's a great tool but it could also be used it's got a dual use the other side of this you can weaponize it and create really bad outcomes and so one of the questions I've been thinking through post FTX is what naivete did we have with these open permissionless systems that someone like Sam could exist I the thing I think my conversations all land at the same places I just never contemplated this level of fraud sophistication and cynicism his first mask slip was on odd Lots I don't know this is the famous description it was so cynical that even even the cynics are like what he did this as you want you want to share the story it's like unbelievable he's describing this is a famous exchange with um uh the odd Lots occur and Matt Levine I believe is actual other guest and he's describing defy as his black box where you're printing collateral out of thin air and then you're posting that to get dollars out he's just describing this Rube Goldberg of Ponzi in such a literal and direct way with no utility value whatsoever like no discernment for why this thing should exist and what type of risk transferring risk pricing you know bootstrapping of users whatever the most generous interpretation of of yield farming in defy was he took this like radically cynical approach and I think it was the first time people are like whoa wow that guy's thinking different from us and so I think one of our my questions is really when you have a dual use technology like what is the sobriety that we need to have the type of guardrails we need to put in place where a very bad actor could step into the system and abuse it and it's not going to use it the way that the crypto Believers are going to this is the first time that I think a lot of us had to do that soul searching now we had to take a step back and say everything we're doing is not just for use for good it can be used for drastic bad how do we prevent that and how do we weed out that that thing so that what we're doing is actually a Force for good yeah the exact I looked this up just now the exact phrase he basically called D5 farming a Ponzi black box and then Matt Levine was like wait so are you just saying you're in the Ponzi business and SPF says yeah yeah I would agree that's a good character that's a good summary of I'm in the Fonzi business yeah I mean I think again the problem is really the more centralized the more highly levered the more opaque you are the the worse it's gonna be for you and the harder it is I I think actually this may have been intentional and this was part of Sam's phase of like what he said with Matt Levine this was actually part of Sam's phase of like okay I've like basically like raped and pillaged defy I've taken a bunch of money out of it and now I would like to close it up close up the shop and sort of regulate it so I actually think maybe there was there was some malice going on here too where he's trying to sort of discredit um what's happening but the fact is like the other the last piece of of uh like Intel that that FTX was going down which is the part that that convinced me like I I had basically up until a day before withdrawals were paused I didn't even think that after I just it was a so unbelievable that they would do something this egregious and lie to everybody for years but the part that made me realize something was really wrong was they started with drawing from every defy pool that they had any money in and there was one specific D5 pool even that it was called like gearbox and it was crazy they had like 5 million in it and there was a huge withdrawal fee and the withdrawal fee was going to was going to go to zero in like five days like there was a governance said so yeah it costs like five or ten percent to withdraw from this pool but if you just wait five days you don't have to pay anything and he you know they took everything out immediately and I was you know I was like oh my God this is like what could be going how how bad can it be that they're just eating this huge some Traders eating this like ridiculous like p l loss just for like a few days worth of liquidity so yeah I think I think generally defy it's the more transparency the better like you have to you have to defy your way out of this out of this problem um with more transparency and more stuff happening on chain yeah going back to the cynicism and the the magical box analogy that he made on the odd Lots episode yeah I feel like is kind of the same exact thing that a true crypto believer would describe except that they would do it in a way where you know it's all about building this decentralize such and such and you um use this as a booth shopping mechanism to get people in early and then eventually like all the people participating in the network are user owners and it's this kind of you know Grassroots thing rather than like this top-down company that that would have existed in an earlier stage of the internet and what he did was he like took that concept and then this just like stripped it down to the most kind of traitery way of looking at it which is just like the the financial bit and not any of the kind of building aspects I kind of mentioned this before but yeah the even when I interviewed him I was kind of trying to figure out are you like this effective altruist who is just using crypto like for the money making abilities to further your other ends are you actually a crypto person and yeah just certain uh things like that now looking back it's like pretty obvious that he definitely had this more sort of traitoring aspect rather than this kind of um I'm gonna build something you know for the crypto space uh you know he didn't really talk about all the kind of ideals that a lot of crypto people espouse the best framing that I've heard is there's crypto 1.0 cracking coinbase Galaxy Genesis and some of those were run by real Believers Like Jesse at Kraken is a True Believer I think you've spoken to him recently he speaks very differently they don't take those type of risks they do proof of reserves right and so we do have some crypto 1.0 or that survive this and it turns out the ones that survived tended to be run by a Believer uh and so that was an interesting data point and then the crypto 2.0 stuff worked the purely on chain radically open incredibly nutrible stuff worked unit swap is functioning perfectly here the 1.5 stuff is the dangerous stuff that was the Sam stuff that is hmm I can run these uh extractive games on these open systems because not everybody has to play by the same rules there are no rules here and Sam was actually creating his own Zoo to hunting right like he he he was literally breeding animals to hunt them and he had the exclusive pass he owned on the entrance is actually it's a incredibly cynical approach to life but it's this 1.5 idea that I think we needed to get right off of the industry to succeed the 1.5 idea being just taking all the opaque extractive nature of of some of these Financial systems and applying them to open systems where you can exploit them because of the the open permissionless Nature and people said listen to one of the recent episodes of The Chopping chopping block Warehouse Steve talked about how he had lunch with Kyle Davies at some point who said oh I figured out what Sam's doing and so obviously this is what third or fourth hand that I'm I'm repeating the story but basically um you know Sam had saw that during the Ico craze like people were minting this money out of thin air but then you know brings all this like regulatory pressure on you and there are other issues because then you have to like um you know provide these services to people but his idea was to create coins but then to be the main buyer of them which could kind of obviate some of those issues but then as um hasib and tarun pointed out then if you're posting your this on your coin that you created as collateral for uh the loans that you took out in real money then of course it's like very reflexive when the price goes down and then you just end up in a really bad situation um so very quickly because we're running out of time I just want to ask about um two more things one is Michael when we had our premium interview I asked you about FTX Ventures and um it was announced last January that they were investing two billion dollars and at some point I guess Bloomberg had reported that they merged um but then Amy Wu the head of FDA expenses and Sam thank Godfrey both denied that and you've had an interesting theory about what was happening there or like why that confused the industry so can you talk a little bit about that yeah well first off no one knew where the money came from that was the first question two billion dollars I mean Paradigm and injuries to do that but they have really strong Capital raising arms and so everyone's understanding was that FTX Ventures had nothing to do with FTX it was just a name that Sam licensed and that the money was actually alameda's money that was our understanding and when we heard that and but did you confirm that or is that just your theory that that is complete speculation and that's things that we heard but we heard it from good sources the thing that the thing that everyone was really suspicious about with FTX was their spending this is actually what CZ got as far as my understandings what really kind of everyone is like where are they getting all this money from we know two billion dollars is a lot of money to raise and the the rate at which they were deploying it was incongruous with the company that was doing I don't know 50 or 75 million dollars of ebitda it wasn't like it wasn't two billion dollars of Evita that you could be putting out in a year of of private finances and that's the type of cash that you would have to talk about FTX was not that good of a business if you looked at their earnings right like it was not some money printing machine sure it had significant volumes but it wasn't taking out a lot of profit from the business and so that's what everyone was trying to figure out where is the profit coming from and we all just naturally assumed it was Alameda okay and then the last thing I wanted to ask about was the fact that FCX was also investing in the same Venture Capital uh funds that had invested or I don't know if it's literally the same funds but um you know they invested in Sequoia and some of these other VC firms so that was kind of interesting and weird it's like a sort of circular investment thing and I was kind of curious for your thoughts on on that I think that's actually pretty innocuous a lot of the founders who we had backed we have great relationships with and they want to invest in the ecosystem and so they will invest in the funds I think I would say that's extremely normal the other thing that's extremely normal is people like sequoians have like a private wealth arm almost where they will manage the partner's Capital mostly but some very high performing Founders get access to that and it's just like uh you know they have very good funds on the platform they have good risk management all that stuff so that's not completely uh incongruous or unprecedented nor do I think it creates the type of conflict that you would think from the outside people like myself and Alex love to have Founders invest in us because it's we have great relationships with them they're our personal friends we've done we've been successful together and they're a great deal Source right like they send us lots of deals and Founders call them and say who are your best investors and so I don't I personally don't have this big of issue with that the order of I don't know if there if there was any type of hey if you invest in us we'll invest you that's clearly unethical and inappropriate but I have not someone like Sequoia would not take that type of arrangement I'm sure that that exists in some lower levels but not at that level of Institution yeah I think the one area that that I was surprised I I totally agree we are like there are lots of Founders that have invested in my firms and things like that um but it's like I've to have a founder of a pre-ipo company invest hundreds of millions of dollars yeah that's weird is what I was I was actually quite shocked when I when I read that article or that headline and to be clear I think it was like 500 million dollars in Sequoia was that it or maybe between various firms the big thing that came out was crazy was he Sam sold 300 million dollars of secondary right this wasn't just that that is the weird thing that's it that is it well and and he gave himself a three billion dollar loan through Alameda yeah but I guess the the point is that 300 million dollars a secondary even in a world where secondary is common is very atypical that's a lot of money off the table for sophisticated investors to feel comfortable with it the logic is that it avoids dilution right secondary you're selling already issued shares instead of deluding everybody and so people are comfortable with it but 300 is that's a shocking number and that wasn't public as far as I know so I think the the issue that was really incredible here was just the scale of of the fraud and recklessness going on just take everything you've ever seen that maybe could be an issue like sometimes Founders invest whatever and then just magnify it by 100x and look it's not like yeah class cases of fraud happen a lot in like low interest rate environments in a new tech like Enron happened around Enron was like a bandwidth company right and even Madoff like he was like the Pioneer and inventor of electronic trading so you you use these sort of new Concepts and and new jargon and language to confuse people in order to perpetrate like pretty classic like fraud schemes if if what uh what like half of what these reports are saying is is true yeah so it's it's just a it's just like a I think it's honestly a once in a generation scale like magnitude of of uh of like sort of fraudulent catastrophe but yeah I hope I hope people don't take away that this is like uniquely created by the concept of a token or the concept of ftt like we talked about in many ways like the fact that these things were that even some of these things were tokenized and some of his activity was on chain was probably the reason why he was caught in one to three like it was a three-year up and down cycle whereas Madoff was 30 years you know so you know a lot more leaked and and people figured this stuff out because of what was going on on chain yeah yeah I agree that that definitely hasten things all right well this has been so um amazing discussing all of this with you guys I just loved your insights where can people learn more about you and your work uh I'm just on Twitter at different MJ um we're we're DBA will start having a public face pretty soon and I'm on Twitter at alpaca P like my last name pack and also or hack VC we're an real estate venture firm we have a
