link as for today's episode this debate over Bitcoin maximalism between Lynn Alden and Udi wertheimer started off in a Twitter thread and it ended up being a really thoughtful discussion about the Bitcoin community and how bitcoiners should handle the ways in which Bitcoin is distinct from other crypto assets Lin makes a strong case for all the ways in which Bitcoin is unique especially in terms of how decentralized it is while Udi wonders why bitcoiners have turned themselves into the token police and why morality forms the basis of the identity for a number of bitcoiners he takes a more practical approach looking at how people have recently been entering the space and pointing out that they're probably not starting with Bitcoin Lynn pushed back noting that bitcoiners have been entering in bottom-up communities in developing countries what was interesting to me was that they actually agreed on a number of things but have different conclusions I'd be interested to hear what you think either on Twitter or if you're in our Discord than over in that forum and now on to the discussion with Lynn and Udi foreign welcome to Unchained your no hype resource for all things crypto

our Udi wartheimer recovering Bitcoin Maxi and Lynn Alden founder of Lynn Alden investment strategy welcome Lynn and Udi hey it's great to be here thanks for having me back so um for those of you who are watching on the video you may notice that we are all wearing sunglasses which we decided to do to kind of poke a little bit of fun at Duty um this kind of person wears a sunglasses indoors exactly what are you doing although you know it's it's a pretty sunny day where I am so you know what I'm kind of grateful for it um not sure how long we'll keep this up but for now let's go with it okay so before we dive into the meat of the discussion let's just Define our terms how would you each Define Bitcoin maximalist or Bitcoin maximalism do you want to go first Lynn or should I start you go first because you were on the prior show all right so um it's a tough one right it's funny I think that I think Vitality coined the term Bitcoin maximum is probably many years ago I don't know 2015 roughly and you definitely didn't mean it in the uh in a flattering way I I think that um a big part of the Bitcoin Community kind of adopted the term later maybe half as a joke and half just because I guess they felt like that like it's right or a good description and but it's kind of you know like some people would say a Bitcoin Maximus is just someone who focuses only on bitcoin right and and just doesn't care about the other cryptocurrencies doesn't find them interesting or just think they're too complicated or don't find any benefit in in using their or looking into them and I think that you know that definition and that you know position is very very reasonable like there's you know there's nothing there's nothing bad to say about someone who just chooses to focus on one thing that's great the other definition of Bitcoin maximum almost has nothing to do with Bitcoin so it's kind of the other type of Bitcoin maximalist is defined by what they don't do right like they don't touch other coins they maybe don't eat vegetables they may be you know it's really defined by what they do not do and not really but what they do know do so it's kind of hard to come up with a definition that explains it very clearly at least for me I know I should be able to but it's it's really hard um but but like you you are against why because so I definitely am not against focusing on bitcoin that's definitely not something I guess I think that's you know I think that's great like you know people can focus on cooking and other people can focus on bitcoin and it's great that's awesome um usually the best things happen when someone focuses on one thing there's really nothing wrong with that um I think that the part that I'm kind of against is the moralization or or assigning immorality to to any other type of asset I think that that's what I'm kind of against and I think that it's in a way hurting Bitcoin too because I think that or you know the Bitcoin itself is a digital asset nothing can hurt it right but um I would say that it it hurts the adoption of Bitcoin in a way because I think that we could do better job with Outreach if we for example understood why some people choose to trade Dogecoin or trade nfts we don't have to encourage them to do that but we can still go and say hey you're an nft Trader you're a dose Trader good for you if you happen to manage to make some money if you didn't lose all of your savings I think you should put five percent of your wins in in Bitcoin for the long term right so and I think we kind of miss all of that Lynn what about you how would you define it yes I think you point out you know the fact that it was coined by you know someone who's not a bitcoiner um or at least not at the time metallic is a very much a Bitcoin he was then he was at that time yeah yeah he was a journalist covering Bitcoin at that time yeah so as as that term came out right so as that and we went the other direction obviously towards ethereum you know it's coined by someone who at least at the current time is not a bitcoiner and it was kind of against a certain segment of Bitcoin and so that's part of why it's a complex term is because I mean we see about in history that often terms are taken by the you know someone it's first used against you and then you kind of turn it back on them as like a a proud thing and so that's always going to be a shifting definition of what Bitcoin maximum is I I think what I would focus on is the idea that there is an important element in the Bitcoin space that I think pushes back on a lot of what other happens in crypto space and of course there's a spectrum for how they do that there are some people that are like you know absolutely Bitcoin only there are other people that are Bitcoin and stable coins to other people that are you know Bitcoin and privacy coins but then as you go out as you kind of broaden that I think there's a recognition among a lot of people that are very in Bitcoin that you know the vast majority of what we're seeing in this space is is largely scams and I think Pete Rizzo does a really good job for example of of articulating in detail a vision of Bitcoin maximums he has got like an article on Forbes called you know how to be a Bitcoin Maximus and it has like nine points people can check that out if they want one way I would boil it down I think or at least at least a vision that I look at when I kind of analyze the Bitcoin space and why a Bitcoin only or a Bitcoin focused view makes a lot of sense or how I would phrase it is that you know Bitcoin maximum is the rejection of undeserved senior age right so it's the rejection of Fiat currencies where you know governments and and you know central banks can create more they can they can adjust the Ledger in their favor whenever it's it's politically uh important for them to do so and then also in the crypto space with pre-mines and with changing monetary policies and very centralized types of systems that are prone to change over time that kind of you know give more of the power to developers and VCS and less power to node operators if people can even run a node and they can therefore change the system over time they can change the rules uh rather arbitrarily or as they see fit which is much like a normal software project a normal centralized software project and so I think I think a big distinction is that in the Bitcoin space that idea of self-sovereignty is a really big factor and you know part of why I was drawn to the Bitcoin ecosystem is because of the outcome of the block size War uh so during that bear Market as that played out I think it showed the importance of of having that power in the user base and not in the developer base and not in not among you know large uh centralized companies exchanges different companies with interests and you know to this day I see Bitcoin as the only one that has I think a rightful claim on decentralization and immutability or as close as you're going to get to immutability you know I would phrase it as you know in software self-sovereignty is like a platonic idea you can never reach it but you can you can get as close as you can as possible right so you can run a node then you can interact with the network on your own of course there's always the risk of bugs that's why you can never reach you know fully you know complete Perfection but a lot of these other systems what they do is then they they take some element of that away they give it more to a centralized you know set of participants but then they still try to assert that it's essentially the same thing that it's still decentralized and that they somehow made a strictly better improvement over Bitcoin another way that I focus on it because you know my background is is multi-asset I cover equities I cover commodities I'm known for diversification but in this space I I don't diversify and you know I think the one lens I look through is that Bitcoin is the one system that I think is still kind of focusing on the initial purpose of having an actual decentralized open protocol and that most of these other things in the space to varying extents they might be interesting or exploring interesting ideas look a lot more like equities where you're relying on a centralized team to do something to advance that ecosystem and that that you know to some extent is fine but I guess the where I push back or where I kind of uh you know publish research reports or things like that is air is where they try to argue that they're that they're strictly better in Bitcoin in some way right so it you know I don't I don't sit there going after some like token on like a defy exchange for example I I focus on l1s that would claim that they're just as hard money for example or just as decentralized as Bitcoin or in some cases they argue that they're more so but I think the evidence shows that they're not and so Lynn just so we're clear do you consider yourself a Bitcoin maximalist or no so I I'm not a fan of labels I'm firmly in the Bitcoin Focus Camp right so I mean I you know I'm on the board of a Bitcoin only company I you know I work with a Bitcoin only VC advisory firm you know I've been openly bullish on stable coins um obviously I'd like to see more of them on on bitcoin again I mean they started on bitcoin I like to see them back on bitcoin but I think stable coins on multiple platforms are serving an actual purpose for a lot of people uh especially in countries where they have very high inflation so you know I'm not sure I I would stick to a specific term but I certainly identify with that group there's even people that would be classified as Bitcoin Maximus that don't like that term specifically because it was kind of coined against them right so labels side I would consider myself a bitcoiner well one thing I want to ask about was that P Aid panel that happened in 2021 to coined Miami that was basically about why toxic Bitcoin maximalism was good um I have a feeling that that's really the element that Udi when he denounces Bitcoin Maximus and that he's against Udi would you agree with that I mean you know it really depends on definitions I I wouldn't say that the main thing I'm concerned about is people being you know um not nice online that's you know whatever that's that's not something that you know people can do whatever they want um I I think that uh specifically the dismissiveness and you know what it's even okay to dismiss but the the painting other projects as immoral just for being other projects that are not Bitcoin is the is the main thing that I'm I'm concerned about and you know as far as as you know if someone sits down and analyzes the risks in in another asset and and explains why uh an asset is risky and what you're holding it might be um a problem then that's fine but the you know as long as we understand that it's a question of risk and not not a question of morals and Injustice than than the the discussion I believe is much healthier and it allows you to connect to people who are you know not in your same camp who are um you know have other interests and motivations in life and still you know show them how Bitcoin can be a fit for for their needs so two things are true one the majority of Bitcoin holders also hold altcoins um I believe that in the US grayscale has a research that says that in the US the number is around 80 percent of Bitcoin holders also also hold other coins and I think that the reverse is true as well so most altcoin holders also hold Bitcoin um so you know we're not that different as at least in asset locations in in um it's funny I think that you know me and me and Lynn are probably probably share an opinion on on most you know most Bitcoin related and Bitcoin maximum is the issues too you know like I my portfolio has been very heavy on bitcoin for many years and continues to be you know um I I believe that it is the only decentralized cryptocurrency and the rest are at best maybe one day will be probably not that even I do agree that most of them are very similar to equities um I just think it's fine so you know like I think we would agree on a lot of things the I think the main thing that that we might have a disagreement on is that I think that the assignment of morality to to assets is is not beneficial not to to the person who holds that view and not beneficial for Bitcoin either I wonder if I should kind of address some of the points that Glenn um talked about yeah go ahead so you know the first one and it's it's maybe a little bit of a nitpick but you know I think vitalik is a bitcoiner in the present you know he definitely was a Bitcoin or he was a Bitcoin developer prolific one that that you know had a lot of influence on on just the Bitcoin technology stack early on and also on bitcoin journalism early on and a lot of influence and just getting a lot of people to know about Bitcoin so he definitely was a bitcoiner but I would say he's a bitcoiner today as well even though he obviously thinks ethereum is better I think he wants ethereum to be more successful I don't think that makes him not a bitcoiner I mean he he holds Bitcoin he he's he's public about that and and I think that makes him a bitcoiner you know um there seems to have been this shift in some some sectors of the Bitcoin Community where the definition of bitcoiner is become very very narrow like in order to be a Bitcoin you have to bitcoin only and that's that's very new I don't know like that was definitely not the case when I joined you know like almost all bitcoiners were exploring other old coins because that's you know we still didn't even figure out the difference you know so and and new people who joined today they also didn't figure out the difference yet so of course they're exploring other assets um and even people who do figure out and I'm sure the vitalik is very well aware of the differences between Bitcoin and ethereum I still think they're bitcoiners if they own Bitcoin I would say you know if we want to have a definition for bitcoiner is it will probably be someone who won uh has some financial interest in Bitcoin and two is willing to identify as a bitcoiner right if if those two terms exist and it's probably a bitcoiner I think that's enough um and I I kind of I kind of reject the idea that anyone who doesn't fall into the specific maximalism is not a bitcoiner um and and you know if we're thinking about bitcoiners then like it's true and and it's really true that a lot of of Bitcoin Maximus do a pretty good job at pointing at problems at these other coins many of which are really actual scams and I think there is value in that but the thing that I'm about a bit surprised about and Lynn maybe you can help me figure that out like how did it become the job of bitcoiners to do that like how did bitcoiners become the token police like why is it not lawyers who do that or you know Regulators or gardeners why is it Bitcoin or specifically we took that job of of policing the tokens of the world and saying which ones are right and which ones are wrong and obviously they usually say that all of them are wrong like how how that happened how come we don't see ethereum people making it their you know culture to dismiss other coins like why why is that a Bitcoin thing well I don't speak for you know bitcoiners or maxillism but I'll get my view on that and I'll I'll kind of address a couple other points that came up there I think it's all kind of tied together you know when it comes to ethics obviously people have different views on this I I think where ethics comes into play is is the people that are generally trying to gain undeserved seniors so it goes back to that kind of Prior argument of who controls the Ledger who wants to manipulate other people to come into the ledger so that they can you know for example exit The Ledger at an opportune time and so what you see a lot of in the crypto space is you know let me let's let's go for actually like a normal startup for example if you do normal Venture Capital you know you're trying to build an actual business with it with a user case it's not primarily about speculation and then over multiple years if your project is successful you get an exit either from a you know a company actually choosing to to you know buy your company with real money or you go public if you're big enough and you have to go through a series of disclosures there's kind of a hurdle for for of quality there and so they go through that whole thing and then and then the developers the VCS they can get an exit after they built something that is actually to some degree self-sustaining or valuable whereas what we see in the you know in the crypto space this technology the same the same technology allows for peer-to-peer money uh also allows for you know kind of like a scam to end user direct marketing uh on the internet right it kind of amplifies you can like sell penny stocks to the public you can kind of create anything you want to do you have a global kind of playground of different jurisdictions you can bounce around and so this is like a known issue in the space where you know developers and their VCS and what they're essentially trying to do is they they build this like quote-unquote company and the idea of fast X liquidity that they can get out of their position or a part of their position on to essentially what are retail investors often before their product has any sort of long-term viability and then we know from this you know kind of the the history that we've had so far in the space is the vast majority don't have any sort of long-term uh sustainable use case that they were only based on speculative tokenomics so I think there's certainly ethics there and then there's ethics around people that promote them uh influencers that you know get into a position promote it and then they might they might be exiting the position while they're still promoting it anything that I think goes in that line and that it you know takes like valuable market share either way from Bitcoin or that gets people into things that are highly likely to be scams that's different than a professional you know Trader or or someone who's you know very very tech savvy going through different projects looking for novel ideas that they might but explore something in I think the vast majority of what we see in the space does have that ethics component to it when it gets to the idea of toxic Bitcoin from its beginning was under attack I mean it the whole you know it's it's it started as this this technology that's you know it's against central banks it's against censorship uh you know it's it's a you know it's not partisan but it's a politically charged technology from the from the very beginning and from the very beginning it's been under attack by me media it's been under attack by people that want to change it from within different divisions of of how they perceive what bitcoin's future should be should it be this more centralized type of thing or should it be that you know node Runners essentially control it and so I I think there's a long history of of defense and protection you know bitcoin's immune system around bans around being unfairly described in the media among the block size War for example the majority of Miners and exchanges and large entities wanted to change it in such a way that they'd be they'd make it harder to run a node in exchange for more throughput and more scaling which would risk decentralizing it and also threatens the immutability of the whole project and so I think that there's this healthy level of defense and I think that you know if you get back in the history of the uh The Cypher Punk movement it's if it's you know it's it's kind of inherently disagreeable people they even kind of Click often it's like not all of them obviously but a lot of times they'll they'll it's like that the whole thing of like kind of that self-sufficiency or that that distrust of large corporations that distrust of large governments people they don't that don't go the crowd very easily and so I think that culture is still intact in large part in Bitcoin and so I think they're a very healthy you know toxic is obviously a low to term but I think that there are for lack of a better word there there's healthy toxicity or there's healthy disagreement among bitcoiners and I think that's best expressed when they when they do it accurately and with humor and things like that memes making fun of those but in insightful ways versus like the actual toxicity of like harassing people making threats you know that that's that's obviously the gross type of toxicity I think that's a that's a small minority that kind of thing is is always present in any group and when it comes to like you know morality police obviously there's different parts of the ecosystem there but I think essentially because bitcoin's always been under attack and one of the attack factors is these altcoins they say hey we're like Bitcoin but we scale better so we're just strictly better and they don't show their trade-offs they don't say oh well the problem is that the node is much harder to run and therefore far fewer people are going to run a node and therefore it's going to end up being more more centralized and so I think a lot of what the Bitcoin bases had to do a lot of people in that space have it say look all of these things dilute bitcoin's you know adoption curve while at the same time you know convincing people that there's this other thing that's better without giving off all the trade-offs that are usually around centralization in that space and so I think it's it's kind of sort of become bitcoiner's job to push back on those another thing is that you know when you look at media they often lump Bitcoin and all these other crypto projects together I see it among like macro colleagues like you know other other investors kind of from a more traditional asset space they're like you know isn't that like all scams like uh what's the difference between Bitcoin and Dogecoin for example or like isn't that Luna thing blew up I mean why did Bitcoin blow blue net right there's like there's that level of of you know connection that the media and that people make and so I think there's a a very large or a meaningful percentage of bitcoiners that want to say look there's here's this thing Bitcoin here's why it's interesting and then you know this this vast majority of other stuff that's happening scam M's and rug poles and things that are like you know marketed poorly and you know Fast Access liquidity that's a very different thing that's happening compared to bitcoin and I think that it's natural that bitcoiners want to make that distinction uh obviously you know we can go to the definition of what is a Bitcoin or many people will hold multiple coins but people that actually I think are are very focused on I think advancing the Bitcoin ecosystem have an interest in pushing back on a lot of projects that claim you better than Bitcoin in some way or always or that I think that they solely bitcoin's brand by introducing that that repeated scam element yeah and one data point in favor of what you were talking about there is I saw literally like right before we went to record that 98 of the tokens that were launched on uniswap were Red Bulls according to a recent study so um it just goes to show we must have missed some there's no way just 98 yeah so Udi you can respond to that but one other thing that I did want to bring up is like I feel like a really good example of kind of where the bitcoiner versus the toxic element sort of came to a head was obviously kind of the event that sort of kicked off this whole trend of bitcoiners coming out and denouncing maximalism which was when Nick Carter was attacked by the coin maximalist because his Venture Firm made an investment into a blockchain based identity startup and he ended up writing this huge blog post called setting the record straight in it he wrote I am not a Bitcoin maximalist I have never been one I will never be one so you can abandon that delusion right now and then he went on to criticize certain tenants of Bitcoin maximalism for instance this notion that all all coins are crap that all banks should be full Reserve he criticized the stock to flow model Etc so I feel like that's like uh kind of one of these uh sort of pivotal moments and I was curious for your thoughts both of you on what happened at that time yeah I think you know there seems to be and and it's not the first time this is happening that there's so sort of at least from my point of view there's sort of a narrative collapse in in the Bitcoin space and it had this happened before it's not the end of the world um you know the there's always a small world when that happens and things settle down and and and it's not the end of the role really isn't but you know a lot of the narratives that people have been talking about the last bull market just didn't work out you know definitely the s2f the stock to flow thing was probably not the best one that we had in Bitcoin um the inflation hedge narrative seems kind of silly now although I do think that Bitcoin will proved to be an inflation Edge in the long term um you know perhaps it's perhaps um the reason that it's not doing that well right now is that because people expect the pleasure to go down you know a lot of those narratives just didn't really work out and I think that a lot of people are kind of disillusioned and some people are expressing that disillusionment and some people aren't so there are a lot of people who are expressing this privately um uh you know both in in conversation I have privately with a lot of people and also there's you know there's a lot of well-known Bitcoin or groups where people are kind of expressing uh certain levels of disillusionment and it happens and it's part of of the ball bear bust cycle and it's fine more than anything else for someone like Nick Carter you know he's obviously a net positive for Bitcoin right I think I think every uh bitcoiner who's who's not completely insane would agree with that is obviously enough positive so even if there are some disagreements with him over over the Investments that he makes or the the things he chooses to focus on in his life I think it is obviously a loss to not have him on our side and and I hope that he does stay on our side because it would be really sad if this if this is the end of the Nick Carter episode in Bitcoin you know no one is is irreplaceable but it's it's we it's not like we have hundreds of people who are both educated and eloquent and really understanding these topics and really good at explaining them and you know it reminds me of Andreas Antonopoulos who was um a very big and very well known Bitcoin educator back in um well I mean definitely when I joined Bitcoin he was like my hero and and everything I know I learned from his lectures and videos in books and he kind of was chased out of the Bitcoin Maximus Community too um and and you know you we could argue about why that is some would say that he was open to uh some ideas of changing the Bitcoin protocol um and that that was his sin some would say that his involvement in writing a book about ethereum and and you know talking positively about ethereum in some of his lectures that was maybe his sin but uh it came to a point where you know whenever Andreas would show himself on Twitter in Bitcoin circles he would literally be chased out of the conversation which is you know to me it's amazing because he single-handedly minted you know I don't know thousands tens of thousands of Bitcoin millionaires maybe some billionaires too A lot of people who listened and learned everything from address and all their entire Bitcoin existence to him and he ends up being executed educated from the Bitcoin Community because of you know things that really don't matter like I don't care if he likes ethereum you know it's it's and it's just a shame now you could say you know it's on him he shouldn't be so soft that he runs away whenever a few mild behaved people on Twitter are calling him names and okay maybe but shouldn't we have those people too who are soft he was like he was really great so even if you think that he's soft shouldn't we still find a way to be welcoming to people like him because he was very beneficial instrumental to the success of Bitcoin really was and I think that Nick Carter is is you know very similar um definitely in a you know in a certain in a different period of time in the Bitcoin story so maybe he's not gonna mint you know hundreds of billionaires but he's very influential the Bitcoin space and it's very beneficial to bitcoin and and those kind of events where we kind of kick people out for very minor offensive is I think not good for anyone and it's it also you know if someone looks outside of outside of of a community and and you know I agree with Lynn that a lot of people definitely when they're new they don't understand the difference between Bitcoin and let's say luna they think they're exactly the same thing right and getting to a point where you explain the difference that takes probably hours of of learning so they get into the community they don't know what the difference is between those different coins so they just look at different communities on Twitter and the Bitcoin communities possibly the worst one like if you just if you're just looking at them right if you're just sitting down there and and trying to figure out what kind of community you want to be a part of it's very unlikely that you'll choose the Bitcoin one some people do I'm not saying no one does but it's kind of unlikely that you will now there are reasons for that right like there are reasons why the Luna Community would maybe be very nice to people while the Bitcoin Community will not right like obviously if you're an actual scam and you're being very nice to people then maybe they will not notice that you're a scam and they will happily put your put their money into your scam so I'm not saying that being nice is the most important thing here but there is value to being welcoming I think that's obvious now you know then you have people again like Lynn like many other people in in the business Community who who I think do a lot to welcome people into Bitcoin right like either they write very useful research or you know they they go on mainstream media and they explain the benefits of Bitcoin those things are great people are focused on bitcoin are great that's very good but then there's that other part which again I wouldn't I wouldn't call it's not a toxicity that I'm concerned about like they can be toxic if they want um it's just that their approach is not convincing you know if you want to be toxic go ahead but you need to be convincing and the results speak for themselves like if we look at the people who join the crypto space in the last year I don't have the hard numbers but I think we probably can all agree that most of them did not start with Bitcoin right they probably started with other coins I'm not saying all of them definitely some people chose to go Bitcoin only from the globe get go that's great but most didn't and well probably frankly they mostly join via nfts so you're right they probably went with esar Sol yeah yeah or Doge at the top that was a huge influx people probably have to go to the top they were like Uber drivers you know trading Doge uh and things like that right near the peak and there's this huge gigantic hype bubble you know from stimulus money from zero Industries and things like that and people poured into like the riskiest silliest game is part of the whole market right and but I think that will continue to happen so here's the thing I agree with that and that's of course horrible right but that will continue to happen I believe every cycle so I'll just share kind of my experience um when I probably joined the Bitcoin around the um bull market of 2013-14 probably I'm I'm hoping that the last podcast I said the same thing because I tend to make things up so hopefully hopefully if someone cross-references this with the last podcast it will check out so the first time I experienced a bull market seeing new people you know sitting there as a bitcoiner seeing people coming in was in 2017 and the interesting thing that happened back then in order they they were only interested in buying Iota and ripple and whatever scam of the year was back then but um the interesting part was they had to buy Bitcoin in order to get those so they came to us and they said Hey how do I buy Bitcoin what's the best way for me to buy Bitcoin what's the best wallet I can get how do I keep them safe because I need them in order to trade my scam coins right and then they went and traded their scam coins some of them you know made a lot of money but the vast majority of them lost almost everything the nice thing was though even those who lost everything on on the things like Ripple and Iota they ended up withholding some Bitcoin in in their Bitcoin wallet because they they use Bitcoin they they bought Bitcoin in exchange they transferred it to their own wallet they had to transfer it between exchanges because the exchange that would sell them Bitcoin would not sell Ripple so they had to buy Bitcoin One exchange transfer it to their own wallet and then transfer it to another exchange it was unregulated and would sell them those other coins so they they they used it they understand how it works I would say probably better than most of the newer Bitcoin maximalist of 2021 some of which I've never really transacted with Bitcoin directly so they had a very good understanding of it and they kept some you know they kept some just like if they had a portfolio they had a portfolio of five percent Bitcoin 10 Ripple 15 Iota whatever the 10 Ripple in Iota went to zero but the Bitcoin part became from five percent a hundred percent of their portfolio and they became bitcoiners some of them this cycle this doesn't happen at all because when when someone uh wants to go into that uh crypto frenzy of 2021 one they don't need to buy Bitcoin because the exchanges can sell them the other coins directly and also the bitcoiners tell them go away we don't we don't want anything to do with you you're you're a scammer or an idiot and we don't we don't want you to be part of our community so when they're you know their Luna goes to zero and their stable coins get Frozen and so on those goes to zero but they don't have any Bitcoin that that remains for the long term because they never they don't even have a Bitcoin wallet they don't know how it works amazingly most of the new newcomers to the space you know they probably use metabask they they know how to use an ethereum wall really well and if you showed them a Bitcoin wallet they would not know what to do with it because it's it is a little bit different so yeah you've been chatting for a while so

incident and I actually wanted to just quote from a description that he had in his medium post which I think is sort of characterization of Bitcoin maximalism that we've been dancing around a little bit he said it's clear that there's an awful sickness pervading the Bitcoin space there's a subset of people a small flailing shrinking group who are mostly new to bitcoin it made Bitcoin their entire personality and became completely emotionally invested in it they are spoon fed on a diet of the same half dozen thinkers and suffer from an ideological monoculture they cannot extricate themselves from their lifestyle or environment and so when anyone in their tribe or Jason says anything that remotely contradicts their established Dogma they go on the attack now they've all lost money and treasured ideas like we never draw down below previous cycle highs and also now the having in stock to flow ratio are just president discredited so they feel deep within them the intellectual Poverty of their thesis so they lash out everyone in Bitcoin and the crypto industry knows what I'm talking about the moral basis of these people is cartoonish it's something that might appeal to a toddler so you know I feel like this is maybe because like both of you I think sort of agree or just like on slightly different sides of a divide but I feel like this is kind of that element that we've kind of been talking about so Lynn I was curious for your thoughts on what happened to Nick and then as Udi brought up you know and Andreas Antonopoulos is also a great example and I was curious for your thoughts on you know how um some of some of these sort of true bitcoiners have been attacked by the community well I think I think Nick does great work uh big fan of Nick and I think you know he got the initial pushback I think he got was unfair and it came out of nowhere because it was not different than what he was already doing right so it was just kind of I think it came to surprise to people and I think the where the the real trouble started was when he kind of pushed back and went on bankless and some of the comments there I think that's when it kind of hit that whole Crescendo and he's I mean he's still a bitcoiner and you know he would he would say that himself I think it's funny because I like his work and he I also like the the work of the people that he called repulsive he had that tweet where he called like three people repulsive uh that are kind of you know in the Bitcoin Maxi camp and I like their work too and so I just kind of watched that whole thing play out um I I think the way I would phrase it I think UD made a good point about how you know in Prior Cycles people had to come in through Bitcoin to other things right instead of using say for example stable coins as trading pair they would use Bitcoin as a trading pair and they're going to these exchanges and now we don't have that and I I would say that's that's currently not a failing of Bitcoin I would say that's more like that prior level of demand was artificial and that that demand's not here anymore it's only demand for Bitcoin itself and we have you know for example huge just massive billions of dollars of VC funding going into a lot of these other things most of which turn out to be scams and then huge marketing budgets for things like you know putting your name on stadiums putting your getting Super Bowl ads things like that and so there's there's kind of been this separation of say we've had breakouts of Bitcoin only companies which I think is actually healthy because I think that you know a a casino type of trading environment is not necessarily the best place for a lot of people to be to buy Bitcoin doesn't mean that you you know that those can serve some people but I think there's also a place for Bitcoin only purchases or Bitcoin focused purchases and so we've had we have had this segmentation and that you know that could have hurt the price I think but I think it's it's healthy and inevitable in the long run because if some of the demand bears are artificial and only there for those other things then it was never really there in the first place but it is kind of just a reality of of the way that the industry's gone in it for example in the in the prior uh episode you did that kind of was the Catalyst for this where where you and Eric were talking about kind of the state of of you know Bitcoin thought and this ties into you know the comments that you quoted from Nick you know that that's where I would disagree because I think that you know from looking at it with you know my perspective which is you know I came into the space I looked at the cultures I looked at the technology definitely you know I I did like the Bitcoin space I liked the fact that that it was very user-centric that node-centric that that decentralized long-term thinking type of approach um and you know we look at the space now for example one thing I've been highlighting here in 2022 is that there's been this rise for example of progressive bitcoiners you know bitcoiners that identify as as Progressive or left-leaning people that is is somewhat different than what you've normally seen in in bitcoin's history which is that more libertarian or somewhat conservative side of things and the funny thing is a lot of them have actually been there for a while but they've they've kind of hit critical mass in terms of having appearances getting to know each other uh Peter McCormack intentionally had a lot of them on his show to give them a platform and and a lot of them are actually like philosophy professors right so there's actually there's there's a bunch of philosophy professors that you know kind of game into prominence in the space and I would say that the Bitcoin ecosystem is actually in some ways more decentralized and more you know there's no Central Hub in the way that there might have been in Prior Cycles when it was smaller you have Progressive bitcoiners you have libertarian bitcoiners you have very conservative bitcoiners there's Muslim bitcoiners that specifically viewed through the lens of ribba you know for example the idea that that interest or certain types of Interest are you know a ram and that Bitcoin is is kind of a solution to that there's there's still the tech Focus people and the difference in in you know compared to other spaces where you have this kind of rapidly iterating technology right where you have developers able to kind of change the code push push updates onto users Bitcoin is obviously all about that immutability so you have that more slow deliberate change over time and I think what makes Bitcoin different from a lot of the space that you know from the beginning Bitcoin was already a largely finished project obviously it had to go through bug fixes it had to go through Evolution over time segwit was was the obviously the largest update but most of the refinements are around how to make Bitcoin better doing what it already does right so Taproot adds certain efficiencies and certain long-term privacy improvements as it gets used over time that'll take a while there's recent updates around improving the bandwidth characteristics of nodes to to basically reduce the effective bandwidth of running a node that's not in place yet but that's an active area that's being that's being kind of pushed forward there is the the stratum V2 update so it changed like the mining software that's kind of a new thing that's being rolled out that there's been a lot of work on that over the past couple years and then there you know there has been research on things like Roll-Ups there's also you know I know that Udi's been critical the lighting network but we've actually seen in the past two years specifically that's growing pretty rapidly from a small base right so even though that even though the actual medium of exchange uh market for let alone Bitcoin but all the crypto there's not a lot of people that want to use crypto or Bitcoin to buy something physical right but to the extent that that is taking off lighting's actually I think in a pretty healthy space and they've they've been improving liquidity and they've been improving usability on that for a long time and so you know there's this pushback that among some people that Bitcoin is too much of an echo chamber or that the technology is stagnant whereas I I view one I think the first one is wrong I think that it's actually in a very healthy diverse space and that people can kind of find the niche that they most resonate with uh and then two I think that the technology you know to the extent that it's stagnant it's mostly on purpose that's a feature rather than a bug of Bitcoin that is purposely hard to change and number two that to the extent that there are technology changes they are around making Bitcoin better there's also been developments in the ecosystem around it so a lot of actually a lot of the developments have been in Hardware you know better while it's better kind of cards and things like that to make self-custody cheaper and then we've also seen this kind of Rise of these Bitcoin Beach communities right so it obviously started with Bitcoin beach in El Salvador that's a different thing than the than the broader El Salvador situation that was like this this more localized Community bottom-up type of thing and then from that you it's kind of meme itself in some ways in small areas around the world we have Bitcoin Lake you have Bitcoin um Island you have a jungle for example there's 80s popping up in Guatemala uh communities popping up Costa Rica Vietnam uh uh you know Switzerland there's places around the world that are these kind of like little bottom-up communities and I think that's going to be a thing for the next couple years and that that's largely separate from this whole kind of like you know Twitter podcast uh uh you know kind of uh you know this sort of smaller segment I think the the vast majority of what we see in Bitcoin is underneath the surface right so the developers are you know they're doing tons of work and a lot of them don't have gigantic you know social media followers they don't do a ton of media but they're constantly working and developing things either for Bitcoin itself or something in the in the surrounding ecosystem and it's it's a rather International movement I mean for example Nigeria has a gigantic Bitcoin scene and of course it's also a lot of other cryptos there you know there's large companies that come in and try to get people to go on board but I think that you know kind of just to sum that up I think you know from what I'm seeing I think bitcoin's in a healthy space and I think that it's attracting you know maybe it's filtering better than it did before maybe that you know the idea that big people used to come through Bitcoin into other things and now they're more separate and now the people that go into Bitcoin are more specifically seeking Bitcoin yeah so you know you you brought up the idea that um maybe the demand in 2017 for Bitcoin was artificial in the sense that um people would acquire Bitcoin only so that they can buy some other coins and I mean it's definitely true to an extent I would say though the special thing about Bitcoin and and the thing that makes Bitcoin to me so great and I think for for a lot of bitcoiners is that it it is permissionless right you can do whatever you want with it um and that enables a lot of use cases that that we cannot think about we cannot come up with them ourselves and definitely Satoshi didn't come up with them in the early Cipher bunks didn't come up with them and the early Bitcoin developers didn't come up with them um that's that's the great thing about it that's why uh in many ways it is better than digital dollars um because because people can use them however they want then use cases pop up and the interesting thing about how it works is take Silk Road for example um a lot of people got into Bitcoin through Silk Road in in I don't know 2012 2013 they just wanted to buy drugs some friend told them they can do it on Silk Road they told them they need to get Bitcoin in order to do that so they did and you know after they maybe grew up a little they realized they still have some Bitcoin in their wallet and they realize it's worth something so they started learning about that might have been years later that's a very common story actually um within the Bitcoin community at least the early Bitcoin Community I literally saw one of those coin sessions the other day that like said exactly this yeah and it ended with thanks marijuana for helping me find Bitcoin and you end up with uh generational wealth that happened that happened to a few people so you know and then that that use case of buying drugs online it's probably not gonna stay um a Bitcoin only use case as that gray industry kind of flashed itself out they realize that there are other ways for them to accept payments it doesn't have to be only Bitcoin Bitcoin was the easiest first available way and now they can use some other payment mechanism most of most of them are crypto related some of them are better for privacy it doesn't really matter the point is that Bitcoin because it's permissionless it allowed that thing to exist that if anyone needed to make the decision of should Silk Road exist they would probably make the decision of no it shouldn't exist because for the very least because of the legal implications because of Bitcoin no one needed to make that decision and it was allowed to exist and as it flourished they realize that there are other ways to do what they need to do that aren't just Bitcoin and in that use case sort of died down a little bit um and then I think similarly that use case of of cryptocurrency um you know of trading and speculating on cryptocurrencies it used to be really necessary to use Bitcoin for that but as that industry kind of fleshed out they realized there are other ways to achieve the specific things that their users need and maybe that doesn't go through Bitcoin but the one thing that remained very Bitcoin related in the cryptocurrency industry is that um Bitcoin is still a speculative instrument and still and largely unregulated speculative instrument and the same audience that wants to trade dog coins and Cat coins also seems to want to trade Bitcoin for similar reasons they are not interested in Bitcoin because of its ability to improve human rights or stop human right violations if they are interested in Bitcoin because of its speculative nature but that is probably the number one use case of Bitcoin or not only by volume but probably also by number of people I think that saying that that's artificial is very subjective you know like there's um those things you know those things are real the use of Bitcoin in Nigeria is real the the use of Bitcoin in in in small micropayments is real the use of Bitcoin and speculation is is more real and and some of it is through regulated institutions and a lot of it probably the vast majority of it is through unregulated institutions most of the people trading Bitcoin do not do it through Bitcoin only exchanges they do it through crypto exchanges the vast majority of them they usually give better terms too like on most crypto exchanges these days you'll you'll find that Bitcoin trading is free actually with no trading fees and it's very low spreads because they use that as as a as a way to promote the exchange so definitely most of the Bitcoin users are using Bitcoin for speculation I think that's you know that's just a fact so I wouldn't call it artificial myself um but I think it's maybe a mistake that the kind of Hardcore Bitcoin Community is not kind of lost the interest in appealing to that group because that's the majority right so if someone comes into Bitcoin and says well I want to speculate on bitcoin the Bitcoin Maximus Community will usually say something like well you shouldn't speculate on it you should buy and hold and stacks tax ads and DCA I would say that's a form of speculation too but you know that's that's the recommendation they would get that's just not what they want to do you know so I think if we have those people they they are interested in Bitcoin I think we maybe should pursue you know connecting with them and and not rejecting them that's that's kind of my view that's that that's been my Approach too you know over the years well I'll jump in there just to clarify it's basically I'm not saying that speculation is artificial I'm saying that in the early days when you had to purposely speculate through Bitcoin to get to them that was kind of this thing that was it was inevitably going to open up right so the fact that there are some people that at the time if they would if if if they had the option they would have just gone straight to whatever you know spam like scam coin they wanted to do and that they they went through Bitcoin out of necessity I'm saying that that the fact that that opened up I think was inevitable and that it's natural that some of that went away not that not that the idea that I mean any of any asset of this level of volatility is going to attract speculators and Bitcoin is obviously it's got tons of liquidity I mean it's got the one with the most the most brand the most staying power so it's going to that's going to naturally pull in some speculators that some of them later as they as they you know put more time into reading it than they actually you know they decide to change their approach with it or that they view as they view Bitcoin as more than something they might want to hold for six months right so that's obviously a that's a funnel that brings people into the space and so my only point was that that some of those that that Bitcoin has a gateway to other things uh I think was at the time just a natural part of the industry but that was always going to go away yeah yeah I think yeah I agree with you I think it was very much like the Silk Road of the cycle before it was it was this artificial thing that needed Bitcoin and stopped needing it but the core interest in speculation I think remains and I I think we need to kind of try to appeal to that I want to talk about lightning you know it's it's definitely true the lighting is is growing fast I there's the um fairly recent uh research by Arcane it was probably middle of last year I think May or April last year and if I recall correctly they're saying that at the peak of the you know what they were able to record and observe in 2021 they observed about 30 million dollars in transactions per month at the peak it's possible that I grew since then I guess although that would be difficult because prices of the price of Bitcoin tips and dramatically so so I don't know if it would grow in in dollar terms so let's assume we're talking about three Thirty million dollars a month that's you know about one million dollars a day in transactions and you know that ends up I think I made that analogy before that's that's similar to you know that's in the ballpark of uh the you know the revenue or the sales of a single Walmart branch is around one million dollars a day so that's that's roughly the size of the entire lightning Network it's roughly the size of a single branch of Walmart or it was at its peak now obviously on global scale that's nothing right I'm sure we both agree on that it it did grow it was less than that before I think it growed grew in many multiples it probably grew like you know five times during 2021 um and hopefully continues to grow but I think that there's there's the the correct way in my opinion to compare this is obviously not to Walmart Walmart is already established the best way the best way to compare this to anything in my opinion is to compare this to payments in crypto um so when you said that people don't want to spend their Bitcoin I kind of agree with that you also said they don't necessarily want to spend their crypto and that's you know people do spend their crypto so if there's a there's a very interesting presentation by um Sergey from bitre field betterfield is really a Bitcoin focused company they sell um gift cards for uh for Bitcoin for other cryptocurrencies and he's talking about the usage they they were one of the earliest pioneers of lightning better Phil was so a lot of the early research and development of implementing lightning in in you know in in Practical actual Merchants was done by bit refill so lightning Labs is really a comp and block stream are really focused on the infrastructure um of lightning and they're doing a lot of impressive work there but better feel was one of the first to take that and really put that in practice and and put it in front of a relatively large audience of users so they are very very familiar with lightning and you know what what Sergey is saying is about maybe four to five percent of the transaction volume and number of transactions is enlightening uh through their website and the rest of another is is either in Bitcoin mainnet or in other coins so I think about 15 to 20 is ethereum if I recall correctly 10 to 15 is in stable coins I think 10 to 15 is using binance Pay which is a centralized payment processor by binance that lets you use you any cryptocurrency you hold on on your binance account and you know the list goes on I think Litecoin has more usage on better field than lightning does the usage of lightning seems to be very low and and I think you know the reason you know who knows right but from my experience you know I've been trying to promote lightning for years I've been helping Merchants implement it I've been helping events Implement payments with lightning so with my experience with how users interface with it I think that um it doesn't really answer any of their immediate needs so most people don't want to spend Bitcoin that's probably true and if they do want to spend Bitcoin that would often be because maybe they're kind of all in on bitcoin maybe they bought Bitcoin early and now they have you know a lot and they want to just spend Bitcoin another anything else but they still usually don't particularly care about the you know the payment infrastructure being decentralized they just want to make a payment right they don't really care about how the infrastructure Works they just want to make sure that they can make the payment somehow so if they happen to have their Bitcoin on binance because that's where they trade they're happy to use binance pay in order to transfer their Bitcoins and pay with it if they um happen to have some Bitcoin in their main chain wallet they're happy to use that in order to pay for something and very often they don't have Bitcoin they're happy to pay with stable coins but the the group of people who want to specifically use a decentralized payment system and not any other payment system is I think very small maybe there's a fit for you know something like Silk Road right maybe they cannot use centralized payment processors because of the nature of their business and they will maybe want to use lightning that's possible maybe in some countries where you don't have access to some payment processors maybe that's where lightning will be more useful that's that's definitely possible but I think for the vast majority of people in the vast majority of payments even within crypto lightning seems to have a very small presence there so you know that's not to say lighting is bad I just think that the impact of it compared to other crypto Solutions seems to be relatively small yeah so let's have Lynn respond and then I have two topics we absolutely have to hit before we end sure so I think when you talk about lightning you have to kind of focus on what what are the specific things that it's good at right so one thing is it's good at lowering fees and two is it's really really fast right so if you're if you're buying something online in the comfort of your own home do you care if you need to wait for a Bitcoin confirmation or two uh rather than you know Lightnings like a couple seconds not really right so I'm not surprised that online purchases especially when fees are low are still primarily on the Bitcoin main chain especially when that's where people have their money that's where that's where it's a scale they're transferring out of out of you know wallets or exchanges and things like that where they're just holding Bitcoin itself and of course because it ethereum's large ecosystem and stable coins are widely held it's natural that you know a lot of the the those types of purchases are with those assets and so the question is what is lightning specifically good at what it's good at when you need something both fast and decentralized and then usually low fee right so for example lighting is better for in-purchase uh transactions by a mile than Bitcoin and many of these other type of things because it can it can resolve so quickly right so just on the spot you go to Merchant you buy the thing you're out of there as fast as you would if you did a credit card if not faster and then two the whole premise of Bitcoin is is that kind of permissionless censorship resistant decentralized money and I think lightning specifically advances that mission even though I would agree that the the current demand the current use case for that is not super high compared to you know these other types of activities in the ecosystem so I think a lot of people use the wrong measuring stick for what they expect lightning to be in any sort of time frame I think the medium of Exchange Market for a decentralized fast payments is something that's going to take a long time to develop and that the important thing is the technology there is is there now it works the more people use it the more liquid and and more usable get so it's got that kind of flywheel that Network effect and so I think it's actually a really healthy space for what it's trying to do I think a lot of people make mistakes when they compare to things like grab to bitcoin which is centralized and used for leveraging and trading right so for example I would compare wrapped Bitcoin instead to the number of Bitcoin on major exchanges I would compare it to the number of Bitcoin on coinbase I would compare it to the number of Bitcoin on Kraken for example and if you look at that wrap Bitcoin on ethereum is something like the say the fourth you know biggest Bitcoin exchange ethereum and that's that makes sense right and so I would consider that like an uh say an apples to oranges comparison even though a lot of people make that comparison and I think the better thing is you know what else is competing in terms of decentralized and fast in-person payments when you need them even things like Roll-Ups for example don't even though they can they can solve scaling issues they don't solve speed issues necessarily in the same way you know long term we'll see what happens but the point is the lighting is the solution that's in place now it's getting better and for the specific use case where it shines I think it's doing it's doing quite well and it kind of increases the censorship resistance of the whole Bitcoin Network and it also answers the question for people of how the how know one of the ways that this is this is going to scale over long term and of course there's always other areas that they can explore long term if the current level of scaling is insufficient I'll just be with Laura so I yeah I got a chance to try and we're not trying to show anything here okay don't don't buy it but I I got a chance to try Solana pay in a couple of of physical locations really it's just a way to send stable coins with a Solana wallet to a merchant there's really nothing too exciting about it there's it's very simple and you know the stable coins are obviously centralized Solana itself is arguably centralized I would say I can't even run a node for Salon as a normal user right so you're entirely it's entirely trusted system and so you're that's that's comparing it to like a credit card or something like that lightning is for people that want to hold Bitcoin want that decentralized approach and they want to build a pay with that in an environment where speeds we agree 100 we agree 100 so Alana is centralized you can't run a node it's it's not for you if you if you want to be a Bitcoin holder it's it's irrelevant but but if if you're a merchant and what you want is to accept payments quickly and you want to bypass the credit card companies and you want to not pay their fees or you want to you know not adhere to their regulations and laws and and you just want to be able to accept payments from anyone then you can use so on a pay you will get usdc stable coins the entire process is 100 centralized but you will get what you want the merchant gets what they want the the customers get what they want and then my question is why would they prefer to pick lightning which I assume I agree that there is a subgroup of people who really want to use a decentralized payment system but most people just want to make a purchase so what I'm saying is it seems in practice too that even if what you want is fast payments in a physical location most people will choose the centralized option like Solana or others just because it's easier and faster and cheaper and you know and it's stable people it's it's using stable coins instead of using lightning that's that's the reason I'm saying that the impact seems to be kind of low right now it's it's because those people who want the specific thing of buying in a store they have a solution if that's really what they want right if they if they want a permissionless payment system they can use that and if Solana stops working one day or usdc stops working one day then they can go ahead and use another blockchain with another stable coin but for now it works so that's why I kind of feel like lightning is a solution for very very specific group of people that seems to be kind of small yeah I would say at the at the current time the people that want that is low and you can always have these other Solutions the problem is that you know to the extent that they're engaging in regulatory Arbitrage or they're buying something that say governments would prefer them not to that's always something that could be centralized and censored in the future and so I think you know I do agree that most people when they pay they're happy to use these centralized systems where it's available and so I I just viewed as an apples apples to oranges comparison when lightning is compared to a more centralized thing and I agree that the current market is small and I think long term the question is you know in five ten years uh you know if bitcoin's larger if more people hold it more people are wealthy in it they want to spend with it and they want to do that in a global decentralized very hard to censor way with with some privacy benefits and it's also getting more private over time there's still things that they can do there's specific uh upgrades they can do to further make it private and I think that's that's you know it's just a different market and I think it's it gets criticism even though I think it's it's increasingly good at serving the market that is designed to serve all right so now let's talk about bitcoin's changing narrative which we you know have alluded to at various points in this conversation but I actually want to talk about it in the face of what's also a changing narrative from ethereum and there's a couple of ways that this is playing out but maybe the first really basic one is as I'm sure you're aware in ethereum the monetary policy has changed and so a number of pro ethereum people have now been saying that eth is actually ultrasound money that it's you know harder money than Bitcoin they talk about how the inflation rate is lower or the issuance rate is lower than on bitcoin about how you know at times obviously when usage goes up it's actually deflationary whereas Bitcoin will be inflationary for still another 100 or so years so um I was curious for your thoughts on just bitcoin's narrative in the face of ethereum sort of maybe competing on similar grounds I could take that once or at least to start it so I would say that basically because this is this is something I've focused us on a lot I would Define sound money or hard money as something that no centralized entity can print not how much they're choosing to bring at the current time right so for example in 2022 you look at if you look at a dollar broad money supply it's been like flat all year is the dollar ultrasound money this year I would say no because we know that you know there's a handful of people that can expand that at any given time and I would also point to things like Apple stock right so Apple stock went from 26 billion shares down to 16 billion shares over the past 10 years through share BuyBacks right so it's actually it's a deflate you know and a lot of people use the stock market like like a store of value money type of thing it's just liquid fungible asset that trades around obviously it's very centralized you have to go you know you you can't it's not a bare asset and people access that and it's just it's it's is it you know is Apple stock ultrasound money because it's it's like you know outright deflationary and I would say no because of course at any given time if there's an acquisition or something they wanted to do they could they could change their rate of of what they do with their shares and so you know when we look at say for example the ethereum space they it's not in my view the value is not in in maintaining a low or even deflationary Supply it's it's the fact that the Bitcoin space there's no one that even could change that that the monetary policy remains fixed and that you know the the assessment of how hard would be for any sort of entity to try to change that at is is you know very low whereas we look at you know there is a good price impact from cryptocurrencies to try to have a more deflationary Supply I mean if you look at the eth BTC ratio right now if you ask me does that look like a bullish or a bearish chart obviously it looks like a bullish chart right just if they don't put the title on it just show me the chart looks looks bullish and when you have that combination of basically no Supply issuance and then you have people that stake and still can't withdraw until the devs let them right that's that's a decent you know mix for price but I would separate that from kind of the purpose of of what you know kind of the concept of Digital hard money is the same thing is true if you look at binance right so binance is an outright deflationary currency it's more deflationary than ethereum so far uh the price is also it's been one of the best performing altcoins you know if you look at at its price relative to bitcoin or ethereum it's a it's an upward you know bullish looking price chart but again of course it's a very centralized system right where they could change that that policy over time and so I I think that the people have been caught up in the idea of of defining sound money as what is the inflation or deflation rate and I would say it's more about the immutability or the decentralization the ability to affect that and you know with a theorem specifically now that they've gone to proof of stake right so for example you know if you're running a node if you go offline for any amount of time and you come back online you have to reach out to trusted entities to find out what is the state of The Ledger right because anytime part of the Network's offline there's that infinite infinite uh Ledger problem right the long-range attack scenario where you can basically create any number of them and there's no way to actually verify which one was the historical Ledger and if the whole if a whole proof of stake Network goes offline like you see in Solana for example the people that run it have to get into a Discord and and kind of manually figure out where that started whereas something like a proof of work system the whole purpose is that even if the even if the network goes offline even if the internet shuts off for a week and then you know let's say a solar flare brings that and it goes off it comes back on bitcoin can start trustlessly from where it left off because the longest chain is still like an irrefutable evidence of what had happened and it would take years to come up with a longer chain and so I I think it's just categorically different to compare Supply you know kind of tokenomics with actual you know hard money so yeah I I obviously agree with the you know the definition of sell money and you know we talked about this Lauren in the previous podcast too I think that the the main differentiator is is bitcoin's predictability um ethereum you know it's the proof is in between the pudding the way you you formulated the question was recently ethereum changed the supply Dynamics and that's exactly it they changed it recently and they'll probably change it again and with Bitcoin it's it's just predictable so that's then the question for both of you because and this came up in the discussion well actually it came up first with the discussion I had with um Eric Wallen Justin bonds but basically you know a number of people are saying that within the next decade or so the admission of Bitcoin will go down so much that the network will basically be reliant on transaction fees and that that will be insufficient to secure the network so do you guys think Bitcoin will change at that time or will they not or what's going to happen I mean the the best answer is that you know we don't know exactly what will happen uh fee wise in 10 years um I think that I think that the odds that this will become a problem in in specifically 10 years is is pretty low it could become a it could become an issue later on if it happens in the next 20 or 30 years then what do you think I mean you know it's at some point I don't care right like if it's in 100 years I can tell you that I don't really care but um but uh let's say that if you know in 20 30 years it's it's um there are a bunch of things we could do right the making the supply uh bigger is not the only thing we could do um there's a bunch of other things we could do the the thing that ethereum researchers like to call Securities is a is a very complex thing right or security budget it's actually a very complex thing we specifically talk about the ability to roll back a chain and rewrite a transaction that happened in the in the past by applying more proof of work you would be able to to you know to apply more proof of work because the the price of applying more proof of work will be lower because the rewards would be lower that's that's what the thinking that's how the thinking goes [Music] um but the you know there's a question of why would you even um want to reverse a transaction and if you you're making a transaction that you think someone else might want to revert you can just pay more in fees right so if for example you have a very important transaction and you want to make sure that no one is trying to undo it you can just pay a lot in fees in order to make sure you know really a lot in order to make sure that that it happens and and then you don't have to worry about those things so the the way that people use Bitcoin might change like for example maybe in in 50 years from now people would expect uh reorg of of five six blocks to be relatively common that's possible um I don't think so but it's possible but that doesn't mean you can't use Bitcoin you just need to adjust the way that you use transaction fees in in order to um support the idea of the occasional or reorg as long as you know that your transactions the transactions that you received are not going to get reordered you don't really care about what happens to other transactions but how would you know if it was your transaction versus someone else that's going to get reorged so again if you if you if your transaction pays enough of a fee then you know it's going to get included because any any Miner who wants to reorg would would include it right because there's a fee yeah I mean I think it just limits it to like wealthier people then yeah and I think I think both for Bitcoin and for ethereum the expectation is that there would be very few small transactions by into end users um using the main chain so Bitcoin would probably encourage things like side chains and lightning on ethereum would probably encourage things like Roll-Ups but at both ends I think the expectation is that for the very long term people are not going to use the main chain they're not going to be able to afford the main chain and and that's just that's just the way it's going to be okay Lynn you were gonna say something yeah so I think aside from a couple serious researchers I think largely this is kind of like a meme and it's funny because like you know in the prior chat you and uh UD and Eric talked about how like in the in the Bitcoin space so you know supposedly leaders would say something and then people on the bottom just paired it right and it becomes like a a non-thought thing and there there have been a couple you know intelligent people that that do kind of long-term you know analysis on this and then they pose a question and now because of the ethereum proof of switch there's just like you know I I'll post something about Bitcoin or lightning and I get like a bunch of replies like big it's almost like word for word they're like Bitcoin it's a security budget is not going to be good as though it's like guaranteed as though they know it's going to happen and they're just parroting what they hear from from you know a handful of of researchers and the way I would uh the way I would phrase this is it's an it's almost entirely an adoption question right so the same people that criticize Bitcoin First supposed to not having a good security budget are also saying that bitcoin's not scaling quickly enough right that it's not you know it's not innovating enough for scaling and it's well which is it is is block space going to be so in demand that that are that the current scaling efforts are insufficient or is block is Bitcoin block space going to be so Barren and so uh unwilling and undesirable to pay fees to access that doesn't even need scaling right it's like people I think I think what they're talking about is the block size limit how there's only so much that can fit and once the emission goes down that unless price like jumps really high no that becomes that's that's my point it becomes a fee market right so right now and and for the foreseeable future as long as the block size does not change only a few tens of millions of people per month can use an on-chain Bitcoin transaction right and so if in the future 5 10 15 20 years from now you know if if not that many people want to use an on-chain transaction that's an adoption problem right that means that means this Bitcoin did not grow uh as as uh you know a desirable settlement and payments Network right whereas on the other hand you know if there are a billion people or a hundred a hundred million people that would prefer to use the Bitcoin blockchain and only a few tens of millions of them can get in per month that's going to be a fee market right and so I I think it's entirely almost an adoption question uh rather than uh you know kind of the way that it's currently being framed and so that's why that's why I tied to scaling because people you know they say well bitcoin's not scaling enough on the other hand they're saying it even even in the current type block space that they would have trouble generating a free market long term and the only way that it fails to generate a fee Market long term is if adoption stagnates at pretty low levels and another and and UD touched on this which is you know and I see this in macro analysis a lot people will look at a complex system and assume that you know this thing's going to happen and then they don't take into account responses feedback loops that happen if that thing should occur so for example you know it's not the miners that enforce the rules it's the nodes that enforce kind of the rules of the network and what miners can do is either reverse transactions or censor the network and so you if you get that environment where block reworks become more common or if the network gets outright censored because the cost of attack it becomes too low then that generates a response in terms of fees to you know change the dynamic right so so you can get an environment where you can be complacent playing paying low fees maybe there's not a lot of demand for Block space but if then there's censorship on the network then you get that response you get you know people willing to pay higher fees and if you've run the numbers I mean you know people are willing to pay 10 20 30 per transaction which again are settlement transactions large large settlement transactions that's billions of dollars per year in fee Revenue which is backed up by you know billions and billions of dollars worth of Asics so you'd have to acquire 51 percent of if you wanted to attack the network and so I think long term it's almost entirely an adoption question and then when it comes down to making it affordable for other users that's where things like lighting comes into play right so you can do like a one-time transaction you know even if it costs 50 you do a one-time transaction it's like buying a modem you know it kind of like it it's a one-time transaction to buy a computer to buy something that gets you online and then you're online right so and and you know people can do a one-time transaction get on Lightning and use it that way and then there can be side change there can be other sort of scaling mechanisms Some people prefer to do these kind of custody Solutions if they want to access it you know like like Udi pointed out a lot of people just are happy with a centralized solution they're happy to use cash app they're happy to use say fetiment uh you know kind of private custody wallets local local you know like uh Bitcoin Beach kind of local Community Bank type style wallets there's a lot of different ways to scale that and make it so that people can kind of choose or an adventure on what level the stack they want to go to but I think the long-term question about security budget is is a simple question of in 10 15 20 years do more than a few tens of millions of people want to use Bitcoin on chain or no and I think that's that's the biggest question for whether or not it's going to be you know censorship resistant and secure so essentially your your what you're saying is that enough people will like like so adoption will happen through lightning but then larger players will be the one paying these bigger fees to settle on the main chain is that kind of how the the fees yeah they're they're I mean there are multiple million dollar transactions that happen all the time trillions of dollars per year even after adjusting for some for some of the noise I mean there's a lot of value that settles on the Bitcoin Network even at current usage let alone what users might look like in 5 10 15 years and so to the extent that it's used as this large Global Payments and settlement Network there's always going to be you know if that adoption stays strong there's going to be people that want to send substantial payments and that are willing to pay a substantial fee which is still a tiny percentage of the the payment that they're making right so that's why I view it as entirely an adoption question and to the extent that scaling matters is about you know having kind of a you know sort of like balanced solutions for people that want to access some of that some degree of that decentralization that might not be able to pay a fee for every transaction of that size and so that's where things like lightning and side change and and other sort of scaling Solutions come into play you know people have been researching Roll-Ups uh you know we'll see where that goes but there's there's multiple different solutions that you can do for for long-term scaling and I think you know to the extent that there's not a fee Market on the Bitcoin base layer in 10 15 20 years that's an adoption question rather than a design question booty go ahead and respond to Lynn and we'll have to end after that yeah so I agree 100 with Flynn that that it's really fully a meme the whole ultrasound thing and the whole you know security budget thing with Bitcoin and you know it's funny because the ethereum narrative is trying to kind of dance on both of these weddings you know what the trade-off really is is between prioritizing uh minor revenue or block producer revenue and prioritizing um the uh inflation schedule of the coin you kind of can't have both uh guaranteed you have to sacrifice uh the guarantee of one of them Bitcoin obviously um puts the inflation schedule above all and kind of says you know the security thing will will deal with it ethereum is kind of saying the opposite ethereum is saying we are we put the security budget above all and you know the inflation schedule will probably be fine but it's important to be clear uh having um you know not enough adoption to pay for fees is something that can happen both in Bitcoin and ethereum the difference is that ethereum solves this by increasing inflation so Bitcoin just chooses not to to do that but ethereum solves this problem by by increasing inflation so it prioritizes block producer revenue on top of uh inflation schedule predictability the funny thing is that the way that the ethereum narrative is built they're trying to present this as ethereum having ultrasound um properties um due to that um you know trade-off that they're making but it's really the other way around because they can't have both things you can't both have um guaranteed inflation schedule and guaranteed security budget so ethereum specifically chooses to have a guaranteed you know security budget and forego the inflation schedule so that that is the exact thing that makes ethereum not or that's one of the things that make ethereum not sound money ethereum has the same problem in how you know you have to choose between scalability and you know main chain usage so you can't have everyone using the main chain so ethereum people do want people to use Roll-Ups in other layer 2 Solutions in order to remove usage from the main chain which you know would increase inflation because again you can't have both so you have to decide do you want to have rollups with scalability or do you want to have low inflation or deflation so you you can only have one of those two things and ethereum makes it very clear you can only have one um but in the narrative Wars ethereum is trying to present itself as having won both uh you know both sides of the trade-off they both have uh deflationary um Supply and they also have high security budget but what we do know is that they'll have to choose between one they can't have both of them and I'll make I want to jump into a point I know Laura's little uh you know you want to end this I would just say a big aspect of security is being able to run your own node and then access the network privately if you choose to right so ability access this bill to be censorship resistant right now for example the major ethereum node providers the infrastructure they for example censor to Nato cache we're going to see what happens with you know the whole the whole Mev boost validation of fat compliance thing that's a it's a growing part of the network we'll see if that ends up censoring at the base layer and what the response will be but another issue with ethereum and and many other blockchains and for example Salon is worse on this metric is the the bloat and the scale of running your own node a fully validating node that lets you participate you know in the network fully and you know we don't know what what for example ethereum block size is going to be in five ten years we don't know what the bandwidth and storage requirements of running a node is going to be like whereas with Bitcoin we actually have quite a bit of predictability for that so I think actually a huge part of security for any blockchain let alone the you know the the the minor validator uh revenue for you know censorship resistance a big part of security is that ability to run your own node and that's one of the things that Bitcoin optimizes for above just about any other blockchain is keeping that node tight and small for the user without because I definitely know some other bitcoiners do agree that this could be a problem in the future in particular I guess Eric is is one of them um and Odie this is uh one way that you and Eric are not aligned um you guys this has been super fun and fascinating and I loved the points that both of you made you know especially you know you guys didn't like always completely disagree which I think is you know really good but clearly there there are also points where um you know I think each of your thoughts will uh sort of get the listeners to you know think more critically about you know what their opinions are um all right well where can people learn more about each of you and your work uh for me just don't [Music] you can you can look up my Twitter account but it's really hard to type my full name so it'll be delivered okay we'll we'll put it in the show notes unless Udi um prohibits us from doing it Lynn how about you I'm at lyndon.com if you want to check that out awesome all right well it's been a pleasure having you both on Unchained thanks a lot thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about bitcoin's culture Lin and Udi check out the show notes for this episode Unchained is produced by me Laura Shin with all from Anthony Yoon Matt pilchard Juan
