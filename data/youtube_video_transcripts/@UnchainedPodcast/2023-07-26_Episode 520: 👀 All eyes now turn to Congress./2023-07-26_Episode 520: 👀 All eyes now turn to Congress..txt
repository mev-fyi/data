the way that I think this order affects the political calculus is that right now Republicans and Democrats in Congress are negotiating with each other about what Market structure legislation should look like and one of the important narratives that has affected that set of negotiations is what the SEC has been saying what sure Gensler has been saying which is no new legislation is necessary we've got this under control the crypto industry is regulated already by the Securities laws they're just non-compliant don't worry about this we'll clean it all up in the courts and I think what this order says is that is not true we really do need to get something done and to the extent that Democrats in particular were less engaged on this type of legislation thinking it wasn't a high priority I think this should really sharpen their focus on getting something done because the sec's promise of getting this whole thing quote unquote under a control that's just not true
