you said that Mev cost users 160 000 eth per year that's roughly 300 million dollars and about 50 of that is front running that's that's kind of like taking it from the immediate result of flash what was kind of like that effect on the other hand I think front running is bad okay basically if a user Make a transaction and somebody else come and this user gets a worse trade then the outcome is friction it's not value it's not economic activity it's that me trying to buy a thousand if cost me um I don't know 1.1 million rather than 1 million okay that kind of thing and I'm trying to look for ways to capture all the good and the upside of the Mev in the system kind of figuring figuring that piece out without hurting the users which is hard
