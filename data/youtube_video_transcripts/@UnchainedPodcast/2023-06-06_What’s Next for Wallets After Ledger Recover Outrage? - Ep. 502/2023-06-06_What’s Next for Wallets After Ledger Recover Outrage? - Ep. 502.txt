[Music] foreign welcome to Unchained your no hype resource for all things crypto I'm your host Laura Shin author of The crypto fans I started covering crypto eight years ago and as a senior editor at Forbes was the first mainstream media reporter to cover cryptocurrency full-time this is the June 6th 2023 episode of Unchained Buy trade and spend crypto on the crypto.com app new users can enjoy zero credit card fees on crypto purchases in the first seven days download the crypto.com app and get 25 with the code Laura Link in the description today's topic is new developments in crypto wallets here to discuss our etai turban co-founder and CEO of dynamic labs and Uriel Ohan CEO of Zengo welcome Oriel and etai good morning so I'm sure everyone knows wallet security recently became quite a Hot Topic with the uh announcement of Ledger recover which is the service that lecture announced offering um people a way to have a backup of their private seed phrase that would be split up amongst different custodians and also tied to their personal identity the character Community kind of freaked out about this and uh some of the reasons include the fact that it could be possible for the companies to be compelled by the government to give up the identities of these people um it could also be because people suddenly realized oh right the code for Ledger is not open source there's numerous reasons here but before we go into all the details on Ledger recover let's just take a step back because there's actually a lot of issues when it comes to wallet security so why don't we just kind of give an overview of what all the different problems are the pain points um when it comes to especially the self-custody of our digital assets um Oriel do you want to kick off the conversation sure uh thanks Laura uh so just for the context uh we we're writing a non-custer crypto for wallet for four years so we've been looking at this problem for uh for some time uh the problem of security and crypto wallet is a deep problem unsolved to this day you know the famous not your keys not your coins happens to be your key is your problem and the reason is because it's really really hard to protect the seed phrase uh it's it's a single Factor security system where you know if you lose it or if you miss it or if someone steals it everything is gone and there is a reason Ledger and other companies are trying to bring a solution to this problem so there is multiple issues with that first there is the system the system where a wallet tell you you know by Design you have to be in charge of your security right and if you are not doing the writing everything will go away so that's already a problem to solve because most people are not equipped to be good at security the second problem is that you have to trust the system that you are putting your coins in to when you know with Ledger people have finally realized that they had to trust Ledger at some point and you know people suddenly opened their eyes you know they they thought the woman would never betray them and and and would never would never leave them but it happens that in that case it was indeed possible that something was going to be broken in the you know perceived promise that the hardware wallet is protecting you because they are part of a wallet system that is either closed Source or that you have to delegate some trust so that the system works for you it means that you can protect the private key and finally there is all the problems around the wallet security that is not that has nothing to do with the wallet system itself but with the vector of attacks that a user can be exposed to and there are many many from like poor pure human error to social engineering and more and we can discuss those so the bottom line is that wallet security is a 360 problem that is extremely hard to resolve and the real question that you want to ask yourself is what do you want to trust who do you want to trust do you want to trust the system and then you have to delegate some kind of trust and the question is up to which level and then the alternative is do you trust yourself right can you make the right choices in terms of choosing the right wallet and protecting yourself around that and that happens to be a very complicated problem so I think that's kind of already some foundations for the conversation uh you know I'm sure we'll double click yeah etai what do you think are some of the big pain points and issues that need to be resolved yeah so I mean Ariel made a bunch of really important points at the end of the day this is about trade-offs right like anything in life there these are all uh kind of trade-offs and the trade-offs are always trade-offs of kind of security user interface or experience kind of recovery cost and so on and and you always have these levers that kind of you have to switch between and each one of them comes with their own pain points right on the security side you can lock everything in this giant castle and never have anything leave but that's not you know that has massive costs and that has massive pain points of accessibility to your information or your kind of keys on the other side you can trust someone else with everything which gives you the accessibility and user experience but has a massive costs on trust and kind of delegating access and that comes with its own pain point so it's always and we'll as we dive in we'll see this there's always kind of these trade-offs that we have to talk about and each comes with its own kind of pros and cons and I think and specifically we'll dive into this but The Ledger example uh they kind of went from one side of the trade-offs to another side pretty quickly and kind of you know with communication served a key component there not necessarily not necessarily the technology side but rather kind of how you deal with communication of trade-offs right so that's that's kind of in my uh from my perspective the key thing is these are all kind of uh questions of what do you prioritize and what are the challenges for each kind of element uh that you can get to okay so yeah let's dive a little deeper into the lecture recover situation because obviously that was something that just caused a really big outcry in the crypto community so there's I think probably multiple issues or problems with the service that they were offering or at least um reasons to be concerned about it so why don't you just break down and it can be either one of you what some of the different fundamental issues were with that service so just to get started at a high level I think the the first element is the fact that it exists right the possibility that there is a system even in Optics an opt-in system you mean that you have to choose it that can indeed extract in some capacity the the the holy of holy the the seed phrase out of the hardware wallet that was not supposed to do that and I I think there was a massive disconnect between what most people understood about the role of a hardware wallet and the capability of a firmware which is part of a hardware that has this ability to do basically whatever it wants including extracting the private key and because Ledger as part of this code that is closed Source there was no way to actually realize that so I think the first fact that it exists is is a problem and and just to expand on that so you're saying that previously people had this conception that when they received a hardware wallet from Ledger um that what that meant was that the key could never be accessed uh unless you like had the device is that what you're saying that's correct actually that was actually their actual claim you know that you know the in the the private key can never be extracted from uh from the hardware ever it was repeated it was written it was said it was communicated but there was always a small asterisks you know saying that assuming that you trust on our firmware right and the firmware is this piece of software that you know manages the relation with the hardware and what the user wants to do with it and so it so happens that indeed a firmware once updated in you know by those the fabric under this firmware can actually have the capability to in you know in that case extract in some way the private key the seed phrase from the not the private key but the C phrase from the from the hardware so so that's something that was not understood from the market and that was in part one of the reason of the outcry because that was something that was never supposed to happen although to be honest if you really double click into the meaning of everything it was always is possible right so that's something that you know I think was the beginning of everything but you add to that also the how they did it right and you know this it was a misunderstanding and everything and it's it's not a misunderstanding they know exactly what they're doing and I have to to say you know building a competitor I have to kind of give them credit I think they're going into the right direction but I think they are making some very important tactical uh I would say mistake here the the tying of the recovery to a kyc and an identification which breaks privacy and can create scenarios which they admitted of corrosion uh and a government coercion that's that's a problem okay that's a problem it's not also very clear that the recovery can be safe of impersonations impersonations of Ledger and impersonation of the user through the kyc and we've seen so much crazy stories that I want to see before I believe it so there are other big questions around how it's built so the fact that it exists and its execution although I have to say that I I think they're going to the right direction I think no this was probably overblown but I think this is the right move maybe Italian like some more on that yeah I I so I do want to ask you about the right direction thing but before we move on I just wanted to comment just you know what you talked about how people could then fake other people's identities to access those assets I mean when you know this rolled out I remember thinking like oh it's so similar to um what was happening with the SIM swaps or what continues to happen with the SIM swaps where you know people go into like an ATT store Verizon or whatever and they're pretending to be you know like Oreo like I could pretend to be you and I say you know move move my account to Sprint and then you know from there I can go into all of your sensitive passwords and click forgot password and then have the code sent to your phone number which I now have and you know change all your passwords lock you out and do whatever I want with your accounts so um you know it felt like okay that's opening up that level of attack which you know has been very prevalent in the crypto Community yeah and you know actually see fake kyc document today okay and even mimicking uh with no deep fake videos and AI today uh a person it's a problem we know really well because we do liveness Biometrics at Zango is actually extremely easy so I think there is a lot of questions about how this is going to be actually secure and not to mention even the impersonation of Ledger as a brand right I mean you know you remember they were hacked in the past their e-commerce website was hacked and it was a massive amount of campaigns around impersonating Ledger into you know tricking people to give the sea phrases so it's not like there is not a past around this problem it's very very real it's very serious and so I want to see it before I I can give a stamp of approval on on not approval but uh at least understand better the security model around what they're building Anita what were your thoughts about some of the issues with the Ledger recovery service yeah so I think first I think their heart's in the right place right so that they if if you if I put myself in in their shoes I would assume one of the challenges they face from their end is folks lose their ledgers right folks kind of literally just kind of store a lot of information on it or a lot of uh Crypt on it and then it disappears right and at that point they have a challenge to solve which is the challenge of how do you deal with customers that can't uh they don't remember their passwords but don't actually physically remember what they're with the alert their Ledger right the second challenge that they face is a challenge of uh they have a one-time purchase business right and they have to start moving to a subscription business in order to build a kind of company value right and so there there's this economic Challenge and there's this user challenge that they have to face right so uh it starts from there and their heart is in the right place I think the approach of creating some sort of Recovery Solution is not a terrible idea it's actually a a pretty important con concept which is uh you know let us help you make sure that if something happens we can help you but Oriel mentioned this there's how Ledger is perceived which is ledger is a perceived as a device that is really as close as you can get to your keys your crypto right and all of a sudden within a single day for most people um there's a break in that promise which essentially says well your device your your keys and your crypto but we can actually kind of with a firmware update extract uh kind of a uh kind of shares of that uh storage and store them on additional devices right so there's a lot of the challenge isn't just necessarily uh kind of a a security Challenge and again I think their approach is correct I think the fact that you should be able to store information recover it and I think doing it with Shamir secret chair and being able to store different and kind of in a in a less risky way where you have one kind of a tech Vector to a single partner but rather storing it across three is actually a super smart way of doing it but it's a break of a customer promise uh that you have to do over months and years of communication done in a single day uh very very quickly and that that in my opinion is the biggest problem they face is not necessarily a security problem or around uh their product approach and I feel for their product managers uh looking at this from that side in I I really feel for for the product management experience but that that to me is the biggest challenge is actually a PR challenge versus the actual security challenge is a break of customer promise for what you expect from Ledger I do think that if you fast forward two years this this solution will come back in a second iteration uh and we'll talk about this but to a Real's Point it'll come back kind of as an open source uh type of solution a comeback uh potentially with Alternative forms of ID verification that don't rely on Biometrics or image but rather rely on uh kind of more privacy per serving information but the solution itself and the concept of making sure that if you lose your device not everything is lost is is not a terrible idea okay so both of you have kind of indicated that certain aspects of the way um Ledger recover is designed were correct directionally at least both of you have said things like that so what about this service was in the correct direction as you both indicated I mean we've been doing what I've recovery Cloud what recovery for four years we actually invented that uh that approach we do it for free uh without kyc and uh very successfully at scale so we can only be you know in favor of that type of approach we've always said and you know Ledger recognize it even on their website that the seed phrase model is problematic right even put on their on their website testimonies of users who lost their the seed phrases from their own Hardware wallets and that's something that's very very common so I think the approach of relying on what we call the two-man rule versus the one-man rule meaning you distribute the security and the recap recovery instead of like making the user trust himself which is a terrible idea eventually uh it is directionally correct there is a set of problems here is that indeed you know it's kyc based and so privacy issues easy impersonation and so you know we have to see how they play it right but you know they do use like three part three parties to kind of allow people to distribute the the secrets one of which is ledger itself it's already you know possibly uh and you know an issue because now they're part of the recovery and another is a company called coin cover which also provides some insurance in some capacity but it's not clear how and finally escrow Tech which is a company we have been we've brought to crypto four years ago so using the same company that the one that we've been using for four years so so it's like directionally there is something that makes sense there but the the execution is problematic so they started with a closed Source approach where they forced also the firmware update to everyone and now what they're trying to kind of go towards is open sourcing that solution and making it mandatory only from certain devices but I'm not sure it solves the problem because even if you open source the recovery only the wallet itself has a massive amount of code that is closed source so it's not really resolving the problem second it's a paid service so the question is what happens if you stop paying like are you losing your your recovery right you know it's not very clear what happens there then what will be the system of resistance to coercion right if a government sends a subpoena they admitted that they would comply and that they would give away uh you know the parts and so that that's a that's a problem in in our wallet for example if we receive a subpoena we we can give something but it's useless so so there is nothing that can give away the user account right so that's that there is there is a set of questions around how is that resistant to a government state attack right which is a very real thing we know it happens and so I think there are still a lot of unresolved questions and um we'll see how they play that play that out I mean you know I I think they are version one and like it I said probably in the future they will do better I want also to make a prediction today I'm fairly convinced that it's not the last company to try to do that right I mean we were the first the coming second and I can already know and tell you that there is other companies that will do that because directionally there is no way to stay in to stay sane and tell to your users if you lose your seed you know trust us but if you lose yourself you lose everything that can't be the future everyone knows it and so I'm sure there will be more and more of that so I think there will be iterations of that model towards something that is more resilient to government attacks that will probably take the price down or to free as we always did for example and that will have a more robust security system that doesn't rely just on kyc well now that we've kind of you obviously have you know as you mentioned a competitor and it has quite a different model so um why don't you describe how it is that Zengo secures users crypto so it starts with the foundation we don't use seed phrases and private Keys which you know is the mother of our issues by the way even with a recovery system like Ledger recover you still have to back up manually 24 words or 12 words somewhere safe right and so that's the mother of all problems even if you have a recovery service in place you are still likely to give that away to a Fisher or to some sort of attack or physical or digital all sorts of a program that can happen around that so we don't use that we use NPC multi-party computation which by default and by Design does not generate private keys but distributed independent secrets so there is no magic here you still generate Secrets but they are never in the same place at the same time so that there is no single point of failure right so if you lose one secret you don't compromise the entire system so that's kind of the first point of difference the second point of difference is we have created on top of that a system of authentication that does not rely on passwords and does not rely on passcodes or PIN codes right so on in the wallet you traditionally have some sort of pin or a code or something to get in we created an authentication mechanism that is multi-factor and does not relied on on passwords and relies among other things on liveness Biometrics which is a way to identify that you are who you are at scale very very securely it's already been deployed at scale you know millions and millions of users so the authentication mechanism is also a guarantee that no one else but you can access your your wallet and finally there is a an element of security at the transaction level where the wallet tells you what's going to happen before you hit the send button so that you avoid transactional risks like you know connecting to a malicious dab for example so the word is designed in a way that makes it extremely resilient to traditional attack vectors related to C phrases related to human errors related to sim swapping you're related to phishing attacks you know to this day we had zero accounts left zero we have you know nearly a million users so so that's really remarkable when you think about the security system and it's kind of its proof and its validity and it's because it's designed by default very differently just maybe I'll add one one maybe distinction that I think we might want to dive into at one point but as a key distinction is you know we talk about all this stuff as NPC and you know L'Oreal mentions uh kind of the the approach of Zengo there there's a Nuance of kind of uh Technologies within it so uh one thing we should probably touch on is ledger uses Shamir secret chair which essentially says we will take a key that exists and then we will split that key versus a Zengo approach or uh coinbase while in a service or a lot of providers uh kind of um that say the key will not exist to begin with but rather independently you will calculate the result from kind of independent independent chairs so there's a lot of nuance uh that isn't necessarily clear in the market on what does MPC or what does the splitting of keys actually means and whether a key has existed to begin with so essentially there are multiple ways to to actually think about kind of private publicies right and they're this is not necessarily related to cryptocurrency right in general you generate a you have a private public key uh type uh security and it relies on a single private key and uh that uh kind of gen kind of lets you uh interact with the world you send your public key to someone they can encrypt stuff with their public keys and back to you you can open it right so that's the kind of the classic kind of uh crypto kind of way to go about the world there The Challenge and this is what we talked about in the last uh 20 minutes the challenge is that you have a single private key there are multiple Technologies out there to actually address how you solve it uh they are in the categories of multi-party computation they're in the categories of multi-sig uh they're in the categories of essentially what we'll call other which is storing things in AWS Nitro uh enclaves and things of that sort uh within NPC in really the categories are the following there's NPC which essentially says take a single key and split it up there's multi-seg which essentially says take a single key and add another four five six twenty keys on top of that and make sure all keys need to unlock and then there's a third category which is uh take a key and store it in a very safe place either on a cloud or in other way and create kind of architecture that makes it really hard to access the private key right those are kind of three approaches within NPC if you double click on that then sorry to create this weird tree of NPC multisig and other but within NPC there are actually two technologies there's what's called Shamir secret chair and there's threshold signature scheme Shamir secret chair is this really cool 1970s technology that is is it like works really well which does the following which essentially says we can take a key we can split it into two three Etc and then we can create this calculation where the key is usually separated so parts or shares of the key aren't stored at the same place at the same time lowering the risk of let's call it a hack of someone kind of you know knocking on your door and taking your private key because it's not stored in a single location the challenge was Shamir secret chair is that the way the math Works means that at a certain point of time the key is reconstructed to sign a message so essentially you have uh shares right you took a single and single kind of key broken into three but then you reconstructed it to actually create a signature that's what Ledger does for instance right so Ledger and the reason they do this is because they started with kind of a single key they broke it up and then they reconstructed right there's a second approach with MPC and that's what's used by xango that's what's used by uh um fire blocks or um you know coinbase wallet as a service or curve that was sold to PayPal uh or another um kind of couple of solutions out there uh fortify Etc there essentially the approaches a key never has to exist in the first place there are three shares and through coordination they independently kind of create the result or an outcome I'll call it math magic and I know real actually has the details around the actually how this works but there's some really cool math magic there with with proofs around the coordination but essentially while maintaining independent shares of keys you get to an outcome of the the kind of assigning of calculation that's really cool because essentially it's this math magic of a key has never existed to begin with uh but you still have the same effect and so what you see companies uh again that secure billions of dollars like a fire blocks or or a xengo or coinbase while your service use is they use uh kind of threshold signature scheme kind of that subset of NPC to actually do things in the the world and we'll talk about this there are multiple while the service companies moving exactly to that model as a way to kind of kind of secure private keys in a much more scalable way so that's kind of the breakdown but again coming back to just Ledger uses Shamir secret chair uh because they start with a private key Zengo uses threshold signatures safe uses a combination of multi-second account abstraction now there are multiple approaches to this and just to complete on on what it I described what's that what that means in effect in terms of security consequences is that in the world of Shamir secret execution if the parts are attacked right or coerced right you you can reconstruct the private key and therefore take away the funds right very very easy to do all right if you have the minimum threshold to get them two out of three three out of four whatever in the case of Ledger is two out of three then it's game over in the world of threshold signature even if there is a takeover of the server of the of the wallet operator right in the in that case xango or fireblock so whoever operates by that cryptography nothing can be done it's impossible to take away the funds because there is never a private key that existed in the first place and and the threshold to obtain the the the permission to withdraw the funds as to be completed on the user side and obviously the the system doesn't have access to the user side right so so I think it's like there's a very fundamental difference in terms of security system and guarantee that you have with one that you don't have with others all right so in a moment we're going to talk about the downsides of NPC wallets because it's not um it's all a game of trade-offs but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this

wallets are more secure but there are some downsides in terms of computation so can you run through those sure I mean there is obviously uh security risk at the cryptographic level right you know the cryptography could not be maybe you know solid enough or robust enough in its Randomness and its calculations so that the private key could be extracted in some kind of way recently there was a disclosure made by fireblocks around what bitgo made for their TSS threshold signature library and and revealed that there was a possibility to extract the private key out of the way the the sequentials were computed so it's not like a you know 100 Securities it's never 100 security it's always about how you execute it how you better test it how you audit it how you improve it over time and so there is a risk at the cryptographic level the second risk is obviously a trade-off at the point of signature meaning that when you accept to use a wallet that is based on TSS you accept the fact that the cosigner uh the wallet operator will have to agree to sign the transactions if you want absolute guarantee and total control that the signature will happen then the TSS model is not perfect for that because you will never obtain the total equivalent of you alone signing your transaction what that means is that in theory although that has never happened in the past the TSS operator or a threshold wallet operator can stop a transaction can make it so that it will not be signed there are ways to mitigate that and we can discuss it and we have one of them for example but this is a real a real risk and so I would say there is a system increase at the cryptographic level and there is a design system risk of trust at the at the signature level so that you can make a transaction and move your funds out all right so now we've done a really deep dive on senko um itai you are working on Dynamic wallet uh why don't you tell us about it yeah absolutely so we uh are essentially we're in the other side of this we're I would call it the the Switzerland of the wallet industry where which Mo we are essentially an authentication provider we work on the application side so we have customers like sound.xyz and Flipside crypto and um you know and token proof and others and we power their system to interact with wallets whether it's branded wallets whether it's uh kind of embedded wallets uh like a blocked Etc or whether it's wild as a service wall it's like a coin-based wireless service or a magic or or a web three off so uh we get to see kind of the wallet industry as a whole and kind of interact with all types of wallets and our customers or developers or sites and apps that interact with these Wallets on a day-to-day basis we provide both the kind of login services for these wallets uh for these applications the user management authentication authorization services we help end users spin up wallets uh through NPC or other options if they don't have access but our customers are not necessarily and consumers they're actually developers uh and we power the entire kind of authentication system for those developers uh as they run sites they want to interact rather than rather with uh you know email account creation they want to interact with wallets we uh you know we've been talking about wallets for the last 30 minutes and just so everyone knows our vision we fundamentally believe that that's pretty much the world the world is going so in five years uh everything becomes a wallet and the way you interact with sites and apps is not going to be account creation it's going to be logging in with your wallet and so that's the future we're essentially building to and that's why we're so passionate about world security is because for that world to exist there needs to be a lot of innovation in that trade-off of security and experience uh that let customers kind of move to that model from trying to kind of create an account and save a passport everywhere move through that model where they interact with a wallet again saying that for the 50th time in two minutes but interact with a wallet as they log in and one thing that I was curious about was that because you can link multiple wallets to a single account if a hacker gets control of that account then they can access multiple wallets correct or how does that work it's a great question it's one of the features uh to your point that we offer is we realize pretty quickly that customers don't have a single wallet they have multiple wallets right they have their social wallet they have kind of where they store their nfts they have their more financial services wallets and the number of types of wallets you have are expanding and so a service that we offer uh developers is the ability on their site and siled to their site help customers link these wallets to a single account but the signature itself the the and a transaction still happens on the wallet itself meaning regardless of the linking or not linking to approve something a user has to to sign on their own wallet so if uh to your point if hacker gains access to a dynamic user system of record they can't actually uh do much with it they because essentially it's just Association of different wallets and how they connect together but the actual transactions sending something out of your wallet still is a signature that happens your uh your own identity provider you you sign to transfer so there's no kind of a tech Vector there you know because it doesn't it's more of an association we store associations between wallets not the actual kind of content of the private key all right so let's now just talk about some other aspects of security when it comes to walls um so we've just been talking generally about the wallet itself but obviously there's um security that can be done around transactions and I'm sure you guys have heard um that there are a lot of times when people are um kind of overcome by a feeling of either fomo or other sort of urgency or um you know there's all kinds of social engineering ways to get people to do things that's against their best interest so um what are some of the ways that either wallets or other kinds of products are protecting users from Bad transactions so by the way before mentioning that transaction the first and by far the biggest risk is actually impersonation of what it Brands uh you know typically someone says hey I am Ledger I met a mask you know give me your seed phrase so I can help you right this is very very common it happens at scale you know Reddit is full of pages and testimonies of those and there is very very little that you can do to protect users against that because I mean except educating people but even that is difficult sometimes the the system itself gets hacked as it happened with Ledger and there is nothing that you can do people think they should give their receipt phrase and so the only protection that you can give them is a system where there is nothing to give away and uh that's why passwordless authentication I believe is the future that's why apple is moving there Google is moving there Microsoft is moving there so that there is nothing to give away to a feature an impersonator then you have the program of malicious applications which usually start with a link right it's a link that will look similar to something that you heard of that you know of an nft program an influencer a famous Persona you will click on it and it will ask you to connect your wallet right and possibly it will be with dynamic or with wallet connect or with a another system and then you will have to give a permission because that's how uh smart contracts interpret with wallets you you give a permission to do certain things and this permission usually can become very quickly a wallet drainer meaning that it will abusively uh go Way Beyond the permission that it initially asks you to to give and basically remove everything from your wallet sometimes at the same moment sometimes later on you will not even realize and so the way to resolve that is to actually provide to the user in the context of the transaction a preview of what's about to happen if the proof the interaction with that wallet we have one of the solution we call it clear sign it's it's a built-in firewall but there are many others that are providing that as an extension and you know so it works only on the computer but you know some things will at some point work on the mobile and they basically tell you when we tell you hey you're about to get your funds removed completely hey you're about to give your ball dip away right is it really what you want to do and so you raise the awareness of uh the the program that's about to happen you cannot prevent it because if someone wants to do a transaction well they do it you know if someone wants to die and then you know it will die but at least you know that he's about to die and so you give him a chance to stop before the the last step right and so that's kind of a world in itself I mean there are many many variations you know colors and flavors about how this happened it happens all the time until today many people fall into it including the most sophisticated people you know famously you know Kevin Rose the founder of Mundra words clicked on the wrong minting link and and many others and so it's not something that you should think that it's just about you know people falling into it because they don't know even the people who know fall into it because it's so easy right it's so easy to perform and so the only thing that you can do as a wallet is to provide the right awareness before things bad things happened and so that the user is informed about what he's about to do maybe that you want to complete with other things that you are seeing or aware of yeah absolutely I think uh your point is right I I think one example is a company there's a company called stello which does a browser extension that essentially simulates uh transactions uh before they happen but and they do a really great job of kind of showing you what you're about to sign um that's it the way I'm thinking about this is I'm thinking about this like the 1990s email right where uh it was kind of pretty much a wild west and over the next 20 25 years there was this constant iteration of how you fight spam how you fight uh phishing emails how you fight making sure that you have trusted senders and things of that sort and it was this constant Evolution to get email to a safe spot where you can really trust it right so if if we remember uh 15 years ago before the world of Gmail it was pretty much terrifying to open links and kind of make sure you click them and and information is collected about you now that's emailed which is an information protocol we're now talking about this at a financial protocol so the risk of things is kind of a hundred X as complex right because it's not just stealing your information but literally stealing your money right and so both the incentives to create theft and as incentives to create phishing attacks Etc go up exponentially but also the incentives for companies to tackle this right I think just in Israel alone I heard of 10 companies trying to create uh transaction simulations in order to try to tackle this field and so what you'll see is jury Osborne's a combination of kind of a social engineering where you're gonna you know there's gonna be services that provide wallets with easier way to um tell users what they're about to do there's going to be services on the DAP side where Dynamic plays to ensure that um users cannot sign for something that is out of scope in some way there's going to be kind of this containment of type of functionality you can do to interact with the wallet and while it's over time we'll close a little bit kind of the types of things you can do with them uh but it's going to be this massive competition between great incentives for people people to steal your money uh in massive incentives for companies to then claim uh to then essentially create a structure to compete that very similar to what we see we saw with email in the 90s just on steroids at a far uh faster clip of innovation so that's what we'll see essentially and again you see Matt uh really cool companies uh rain I think is another one that's trying to do this uh you'll see a bunch of companies try to compete with this whether it's space Forte forta is another example and so on so another thing I wanted to ask about is that people obviously have Wellness at the keep online and then once they keep offline so um can you just talk about how it is that people can kind of secure their wallets depending on the spectrum of kind of how hot they are yeah I think maybe I'll I'll start with uh that one uh if okay uh the the uh first by the way on wallets they're stored offline if we come back to our first conversation of Ledger it is a wallet that started as an offline wallet and is now moving to an online wallet right so it's moving from ledger to Ledger live to kind of recovery so even quote unquote offline wallets are starting to move online because there's value of not just storing things the wallet is moving from a storage device to kind of an interaction authentication device and so it makes it real really hard to just be an offline wallet in that world right we're moving the entire concept of web3 is not about just storing things in your wallet but also using your wallet and using it as a financial devices and authentication devices storage device Etc but very similar to how we do everything in life where some things are very sensitive we put them in the safe deposit box and some things kind of you know are in our wallet on a day-to-day basis you'll see something similar in in crypto which is over time you'll have very secure Services where you access things once a year once every several months and you store kind of you know massive amounts of of money Etc and then on the other side of the spectrum you will have wallets which are more your social wallets or nft wallets or you know wallets where you interact with small transactions which you open multiple times a day and there the user experience is a little bit more important than the security side so you're gonna always have that spectrum of types of wallets and the world will in my opinion will move to is not that there is a win or take all wallet but rather you'll have multiple wallets for different use cases some of which more secure more quote unquote offline some are slightly you know more user friendly with that trade-off but something you use 10 times a day that's what we'll see over time but again coming back to the point even an offline wallet like Ledger is inherently just moved fully online right which is really interesting so I think there's also um kind of new ways of securing wallets some of these um we had discussed in a brief chat before um recording and you mentioned things like magic and TurnKey um you know I don't even know really what those are but can you describe a little bit about them sure yeah absolutely so we talked right at the beginning of the conversation about different Technologies out there right NPC multisig and other if you double click on that other category there are multiple approaches for how you can store your keys right and I think about them a little bit like say posit boxes and Banks where you store something in a bank but the bank can't necessarily access it right and it's a different way of sorry information you have to go to the bank you have your key but the bank itself can't actually open your safe deposit box uh magic or TurnKey are inherently uh and I'm I'm simplifying this significantly because they have massive technology around this and you know magic just raised a massive round around this uh but magic and TurnKey are inherently technologies that apply that safe deposit box type approach which say we will store your key in kind of an AWS uh Enclave like a Nitro or something of that sort we will secure it we will ensure you get the benefit the massive benefit of security there but we'll build it in a way where we can't access it so you still enjoy the non-custody element of kind of you know you're the only one that can access your information but rather than storing that in your pocket like a ledger you will store it in giant server Farms of folks that do this for a living right so those are Technologies which are inherently are the the safe deposit box on the cloud and I'm simplifying I hope I'm not hurting magic or turnkeys feeling here because I think they're actually these are super Innovative and super smart technology so this analogy hopefully is is a compliment not a a thing but the these are kind of really cool approaches that are completely different from NPC to solve the same fundamental problem which is how do you think about recovery storage Etc while maintaining that you're going to lose the thing that you have in your pocket which is like that ledger device uh over time so that those are magic TurnKey and in other approaches uh there as well which are really cool companies in this space to complete on what you said and you described really well is that what happens is that the world of waret is becoming a more complex and more articulated historically we've known the world of wallets which were personal primary wallets right whether they are Hardware or software this is something that the user chooses to install or to buy and puts its uh coins or nfts on it right this is what we've been knowing for the past basically 12 years now you have an entire new category of what we could call embedded wallet right they're not destination where people go and you know choose their you know to create their wallet as they do for for wizango or Ledger or metamask but they are choosing an app which can be a game or a social network network and by doing by creating an account there at the same time behind the scene they're basically creating an embedded wallet which is tied to this application so that means that you have a wallet that is associated to the app that you have chosen to uh to to use not because you need a wallet but just because you want to participate and enjoy the game or the app that you want to use and so they have they come with a big trade-off in security because now your wallet security depends on the security system of that application so for example if you choose to create your account with let's say a Google connect or a Facebook connect or a Twitter connect your security is as good as your Twitter account or your Gmail account which we all know is not necessarily the best security in place and so so you the trade-off comes like with like greater convenience because you don't need to think about creating a personal primary wallet and you have a wallet tied or embedded into that application between account with a trade-off around the security around that and that category is growing and so I think we're going to see a world where you will have in parallel primary personal wallets where people will have their base their home where they put what they want to use first and some will be for their day-to-day usage or as it has said in a vote that is frozen and offline or possibly not offline and you know might have some announcements on that very soon but that for larger amounts and then you'll have embedded wallets which are tied to applications which like much lighter security and and or sort of like you know risk that can happen that you don't have usually with a personal ad but greater convenience because it's just right there and you don't need to think about it so I also wanted to just address something which we've kind of talked about here and there during the episode but I just want to have a um dedicated moment to discuss it during The Ledger outcry people were concerned with the fact that Ledger's code is not open source and of course the company pointed out well it's you know always been like that um so how do you guys I think about you know that factor when it comes to users choosing amongst different wallets like how important is it for a wallet to be open source or how concerned should they be about closed source so so open source is is a great is a great addition but it's not a perfect medicine for any disease in security I know the proof of that by the way is that recently treasure which is a competitor of Ledger Hardware which is fully open sourced was cracked by a security company right so that you know open sourcing brings more transparency because you actually see what happens but also by showing what happens you also allow attackers to know exactly how the the sausage is made and and basically you can actually deconstruct it and break it and so even though open source brings more transparency and possibly even more increasing security because by being more transparent you allow the community to contribute to a to to a better system in our case for example we open source our cryptography and our MPC library has become more robust because of that so I think it's a good thing but it would be also very dangerous to consider that because something is open source it's resilient to any sort of attack and security risk sometimes it's even the opposite just as a an example trust wallet used to be fully open sourced which is a mobile wallet and uh they came back from it and they want to close Source because they were too many attacks on their uh on their wallet and and recently their extension was uh uh was hacked and so that's not something that is necessarily a good thing and you know I I understand why lejure decided to kind of open sources like a way to kind of count down the community that wanted to kind of get more transparency but make no mistake it's not a solution it doesn't bring any kind of additional comfort and people who are dramatically repeating if you're not open source you're not secure are hiding very important uh realities behind it all right uh and etai do you have any thoughts I I would just say I actually I think coming back to on on open source you know real earlier in the conversation made a point that actually uh ties into open source which open source also carries some risks with it which is at times what people do is take an open source library and Fork it right and and kind of build it as their own and as a good example in math heavy libraries like NPC uh you now have a lot of companies relying on kind of you know code that they haven't written and so it carries open source essentially uh kind of opens what you did to the world but then let someone else take it implement it and potentially launch things on top of it and create risks where if you made the first mistake someone will make mistakes on top of it and there's going to be this ongoing cycle right so there's a lot of NPC companies today which are built on open source libraries as an example where they don't necessarily have the fundamental math understanding of kind of the cryptographic ceremonies that happen in the background or things of that sort uh which brings in additional risks right so there's the vertical of Open Source as kind of a way to have someone validate that your code is secure and you implemented things correctly but they're kind of second order effects of open sourcing uh that create these uh massive issues and by the way there are alternatives to open sourcing right so there's audits you can do right trail of bids or other kind of uh um security audits that you can do on your code that at times bring the same result uh while not open sourcing right so these are all again trade-offs right they're they're massive benefits to open sourcing in in Ledger's case I think they have no way around it uh and I think that is fundamentally their only uh path forward along with auditing Etc it is not uh you know a silver bullet solution to anything it is at times also just a marketing thing there it's not a kind of yes no type uh solution and just to complete uh and maybe to conclude while open sourcing reduces the uh the spectrum of attacks of the system because you understand better what's going on it does not reduce in any way the risk that are user-centric the the type of errors that a human can make by using a crypto wallet namely backing up the C phrases somewhere safe you know traditionally they write it on a piece of paper most wallets provide this famous piece of paper and people make a mistake usually there they forgot to write about it or they write it the wrong place they put it in a place that they thought was safe and then it's not they give it away in a phishing scam and so the world can be perfectly open source and perfectly kosher and yet the user and the risk around him because it is a simple human will still be there and so I think the it is very very important to say and repeat and make it extremely clear that something being open source is not is far from enough uh in terms of like protecting the user and protecting the user from his own mistakes and the risks that are related to the user itself all right so um let's now talk a little bit about the future of where wallets are going um ethereum is looking to implement account abstraction how will that change the user experience I guess I can start on that front I think they're so we need to think about key management and account management and I think they're they're tied together but they're not necessarily essentially the same thing right so until now in this conversation we actually talked about Key Management kind of the offline you have a key do you break it where do you store it how is it access Etc then the second question is now that you have this key what can you do with it right and until today uh to your point most of it was eoas externally owned accounts uh you can essentially just sign things do very basic uh activities and so on now to your point we're moving to a point where uh instead of EOS you move to account abstraction which means that you can have a lot more logic that your account has right so it's first an important part to remember it's not again it's not a competitor to like an MPC technology or a you know a threshold signature from your secret chair Etc but rather a way to expand the capabilities of what a wallet can do it's it's a super exciting uh technology we just actually announced a kind of a collaboration on that front uh to spin up um kind of uh ad hoc uh account abstraction accounts on dynamic as you log in uh what it allows you to do though is allows you to do more clever things on an account so as an example you can now easily sponsor someone else's gas so if you're running a game and you want to make sure that someone buys something and only pays for that thing uh it not doesn't pay for gas you can do that with account abstraction you can also collect 50 batch signatures and essentially and I'm simplifying this but essentially to make sure that the game that you're playing does not ask you to sign a private key or sign a transaction every time you can start doing things around social recovery and how the ownership of your account moves uh between folks right so it allows you to expand you can start abstracting payments so you can start abstracting it so instead of paying an eth you pay in usdc and it happens to be in is in the background so it essentially enhances uh it it kind of takes a very simple concept of an account and puts uh kind of enhances the capabilities of it very very quickly and the beauty especially about account abstraction how it's implemented on on ethereum with 4337 is that it does it without requiring an entire change to the kind of a theory protocol right with it without requiring massive upgrades or anything of that sort so um short answer is it's an extremely exciting thing it operates at a different level than everything we talked about on Key Management uh which can it can work very closely hand in hand with and just generally where do you see the direction of wallets going in the future what are some new developments you're keeping your eye on or um you know what are your thoughts generally on where the industry is headed so I I would say the keyword is security uh it's very obvious that the field is I mean this is a podcast about we talk essentially about that but it's not just by chance it's because it's still a massive problem in the industry uh you know I think there's a reason why Ledger which is a ledger in a leader in the hardware space has decided to go that way because there is still a very systemic problem with the way people think about the security or better said don't think about their security and the question is what kind of design system can you build so that they don't have to think about all these things you abstract it away so that they can just use it and don't have to go through all this insane decisions about where to store a piece of paper or where to distribute pieces of code here and there and how to protect themselves from scammers I mean if that was like that in web 2 there is no way we would use the internet as we do today so something a better rest weapon and so I believe that the iterations that we will see in the world of wallets whether this is through account abstraction which I think is going to increase security or MPC which is a sort of account abstraction on steroid because it enables you to do the same things as a count abstraction but on any blockchain including Bitcoin then we'll enhance the user the user experience and increase the security by having to make less decisions about how you think about your security about how the authentication Works about how the recovery Works how about how you connect to Applications about the transactions that you are about to send about all sorts of kind of crazy edge cases that today are on results so to me the uh the the the direction that the industry has to go in through into is not so much into because you know people talk about always improving the user experience but I think it's a it's a it's a false debate the real problem that the industry has not solved in the wallet space is the security user experience meaning the number of things a user has to think of has to do as to decide as to remember in order to be protected by default not by toggling on an option that cost 9.99 per month and providing a kyc those things should be a default period and it should be free otherwise it there is no future to crypto it's impossible to think that this industry can go on like that so to me the most important thing is doubling down on security and improving all those elements that we have discussed by iterations of the cryptography iterations of authentications better connectivity like you know systems that itai and dynamic are are building up to connect wallets and applications and to allow users to make better decisions when they connect to apps to me this is really uh really the future and I think we're already multiple steps into it I think we start to see already very significant progress uh you know safe wallet the you know the former diagnosis is probably the best wallet in terms of account obstruction today I mean it sounds like it's a account abstraction is a new thing but it's not they've been at it for many many years and they have a really really nice executed wallet and you point to me please how many times they were hacked I don't think there was even once that it happened so I think we're already in the future but I think the problem is that the awareness is still not there people still believe that the right way to protect themselves is by choosing open source systems and writing down pieces you know 24 words on a piece of paper and this is the past this this cannot be the future if people are comfortable with that so big but there is still a billion people to bring to crypto and that can be the future maybe I'll I'll just add to that I think one one thing we're very bullish about is that everything on your phone turns into a wallet essentially you're gonna if you open Robin Hood in two years that app will probably have an additional tab which is a wallet and if you open Twitter in two years that app will probably have a tap which is a wallet and and the same goes with coinbase today and in any other application so uh what you'll see I think in the next two three four years is that everything all your existing applications turn into wallets and in addition what you'll see is a part of that is essentially this hypothesis of the professionalism of of Key Management and things of that sort right you see companies like coinbase bring out coinbase wild as a service which essentially say or portal as another example essentially say hey this is actually going to become extremely complex to manage on your own wallets should not actually be in the key management business let us kind of Outsource the NPC solutions for you right so you're gonna see and we're super excited about everything within uh kind of you know know what's called while this service or even at the more abstracted layer just key management and MPC infrastructure or alternatives on on kind of on steroids that are going to essentially turn everything on your phone or everything on your browser into a while today you have uh even at the browser level you have Brave you have you know Oprah which have turned into Wallets on your browser there's no reason why chrome doesn't become a wallet within the next uh one two uh three years it is clearly gonna go in that direction and that's that's essentially what we're extremely bullish about is essentially everything uh just toggles on into a wallet which we play on the other side of you know where that means you will interact with every site and app via VIA that while it's that's on your phone great well this has been a fascinating discussion thank you so much for sharing your thoughts where can people learn more about each of you and your work just go to
