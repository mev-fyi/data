is it a risk manager and somebody who's kind of worked and fixing them for a long time as the liability matching is a big thing and and that has big implications from that regard and it's pretty clear at this point that you know that hole cannot currently be filled because that promissory note is a 10-year promissory note and not then not anything shorter than that if I can add to that you know I think it's worth noting that we know that dcg has been trying to uh to sell off some of their assets and I I think it's worth thinking about how you know what does that really mean part of that could really mean that their conscious that they might have to plug a hole and they might need to make those you know that pay back that 1.1 billion sooner than later or or actually monetize for example that loss from 3ac right by covering it up with other assets and liquidity now I think the reality is is that we're going to be in a position where dcg and Genesis are going to have to you know empty their pockets and see what really makes sense
