my personal opinion is it's a horrible system if you're trying to create a decentralized autonomous organization which is what a dow is supposed to be right so if you have a situation like we've seen before with uni uh with maker Dao with a bunch of other Dows out there where these small token holders operate and they they do the work and they vote on things and they're able to do what they want to do until something that they want to do goes against the interests of one of those large whale organizations or whatever it might be then that whale organization comes in and just votes on those certain proposals that do go against their financial interests that is a problem right because you you are creating this illusion that it is decentralized and that it is people powered when in reality it's always being watched by the actual owner in this case a16z
