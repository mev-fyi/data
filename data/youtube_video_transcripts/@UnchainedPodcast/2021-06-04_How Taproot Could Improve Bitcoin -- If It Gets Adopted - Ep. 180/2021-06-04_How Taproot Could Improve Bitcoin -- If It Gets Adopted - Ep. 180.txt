bitcoin core contributor and the founder of judica.org a bitcoin research and development organization welcome jeremy hey yeah thanks so much for having me on the show you're in miami for btc miami the first crypto conference since the pandemic started how is it what's the atmosphere like it is a little bit wild it's like the combination and constructive interference of both a bitcoin event and whatever usually happens in miami so i would say the perspective here is the pandemic is definitely over uh you know there's a lot of close social contact which takes a few days to get used to after the long stretch of not really seeing so many people but it's really good to be back that's great that's great yeah i um i'm very much missing out but but for good reason and i look forward to kind of keeping up on social media so while you're there bitcoin is kind of undergoing a momentous event which is the potential taproot upgrade to the bitcoin network what is taproot is a new feature coming to bitcoin pretty soon hopefully um what it does is essentially an optimization of things that people are using bitcoin to do today but it's a little bit too inefficient or it reveals too much information about what you're trying to do and taproot helps bitcoin users be more efficient and more private that's what it helps you do how it actually works we can also get into as well yeah so let's just start with the first one how to be more private what are the ways in which it does that imagine that you are a business and you have a super secure cold storage solution that you use and you have 10 keys that need to come online in order to be able to redeem your funds in bitcoin today what you would end up doing is you would have a script that is protecting your coins that's how bitcoin works there are these little predicates that you use to protect your coin and when they're satisfied you're allowed to spend that could be something like alice has a key and bob has a key and they've both unlocked this coin to be spent in a specific transaction with taproot it changes it slightly so in in the old world what you would have is if you needed 10 keys you would see all 10 of those keys broadcast to everyone in the world and they would all be able to see that those are the keys that signed in the taproot world you are able to combine those keys into a single key and so if you're using one key 10 keys or 100 keys it all looks the same to the bitcoin network so it really helps people who want to use a more secure service have a little bit more privacy and there are examples of applications that people use today such as the lightning network where they are a two of two sign-in key and you can show the network that you're 202 they might be able to guess that you're doing a lightning channel but with taproot it's easier to hide what you're actually doing one thing that i was wondering about is we have often used um these kinds of analytics you know looking at these different types of transactions to make observations about the network such as you know how quickly the lightning network is growing will that make it more difficult to do those things i believe it may um people always have a way of finding some piece of metadata about what people are doing there are different behaviors that people do so i think that the the way that i like to think of it is that people pay these chain analysis firms for something so you know may as well make their job a little bit harder and for the multi-sig transactions is another effect of the change that those will become cheaper yeah those will become less expensive to use and the hope is that means more businesses and users will choose to adopt when there's less of a cost obstacle for them to adopt the technology so once well assuming that taproot is implemented what parts of bitcoin will still remain public um everything still remains public taproot is in some senses even a little bit more public that's another feature that people are excited about taproot exposes the public key directly on the network which previously it was hash this seems like maybe a minor point but there's some applications people have created that exploit that functionality and we can get into that too but everything basically remains the same the the main thing that is hidden more so is in cases where you're doing a multi-signature the keys are collapsed down into a single one so it basically remains the same you can see all the transactions going by you can audit the supply you can make sure that no points have been minted that should not have been um there are a few other things that tap root helps with as well around um depends on who you ask but either a mercallized abstract syntax tree that's a mouthful or a merklized alternative script tree uh which allows people who are doing something even a little bit more non-standard than um than a multi-signature to express a bunch of different conditions more efficiently and you would still see all of those scripts on the main chain so in in terms of what remains public it's not um you can think of it as helping users be a little bit more private with what they're doing but it's not uh removing information that's already public today and so you reference two things to answer one was more uh i can't remember how you phrased it things uh where you can kind of exploit the fact that now the public key will be available something like that and then this other piece um more features which i think maybe is like more wallet functionality or something can you expound on those and tell us a bit more about each yeah so one of the cool things that you're able to do when you have all of the public keys available is something called a ring signature what that has been proposed to be used for is you go you scan the blockchain and you collect all of the public keys that you see and then for transactions that are currently unspent on the network and then you aggregate them again into a single key and then you can produce a signature that comes from one of those utxos so what you might be able to do is prove to somebody that i own one bitcoin but i don't tell you which bitcoin that i own um so that that's an exciting application that people are working on that depends on that uh there are some use cases for that that are those are gonna take a little bit of time to be fully developed out so it's more of a neat thing that you can do people also do have a mild concern around that because exposing the public key means that there's perhaps some small element of worse quantum security if quantum computers existed but the general consensus has been among the bitcoin development developers that the quantum computing risk is pretty negligible at this point and there will be a lot of other problems to solve if that becomes uh broken and so we'll probably have a migration plan for that in any case the other bit was about when you have a bitcoin script and really a script it's kind of like a weird way of thinking of it i like to think of it as like a permission slip so when you are writing this permission slip you want to write down all the different people who could access this coin that aggregated key that we talked about earlier that can only express certain limited types of logic there could be other things that you might want to do for example you might say alice and bob can spend today but next week if alice and bob haven't spent then carol can spend and that next week that you can't express in that sort of combined private way this is sort of what's called the taproot assumption that for every contract there's some group of people who you just want to let sign and they can cooperate in order to spend the transaction without revealing that there was some other logic existing in the contract so in this example alice and bob can spend today or carol can spend in a week what you would do as a taproot tree is you would say at the top level there is alice bob and carol if alice bob and carol all agree then the coins can move but then if just alice and bob later today then they can spend or just carol later and what taproot will do is you will bundle those up all into a single key and then if you need to use one of the more specific clauses like uh carol in a week you have to extract it you would reveal that script fragment to the network so not the entire permission slip just that small little bit that says you know the way that i like to think of it is uh you lift up your driver's license and they don't need to see all the information on your driver's license they just need to see that you're 21 right so you could have a little template in front of your thing and you could say hey look i'm 21. and they wouldn't maybe they need to see your photo and that they don't need to see your home address so kind of a similar thing you would pull up the permission slip and you would say look carol can spend after a week and it's been a week so please let me spend the coins but they wouldn't know any of the other spending conditions of that script so that's the way that it's a little bit more private and there's sort of a fundamental link between the concept of privacy and efficiency if people don't need to know something why tell them it'd be more efficient not to tell them so that's sort of why taproot bundles these concepts together of privacy and efficiency great so in a moment we're going to discuss a few more features of taproot as well as another part of the upgrade schnorr signatures but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible did you know nearly 338 million dollars worth of nfts were sent last year

that kind of interested me was i did see also that this would enable more vault type features which i know has been discussed in bitcoin for kind of a long time and um ever since that new york times article came out a few months ago about somebody who lost access to hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoin i've had so many random people who don't know anything about crypto mentioned this to me and they think only this that this has happened to only one person and anyway um the point is that when i read that this was coming i was like oh well for the next generation of the coin haulers like this maybe won't be so much of an issue but anyway can you explain what that is yeah so vaults refers to a family of types of bitcoin wallet that are a little bit different than a normal wallet a normal wallet is essentially you get the keys you get the coin um that would be like a single signature wallet you could do multi-signature and you could say well if you get two out of three of these keys then you get the coin and maybe one of them's in cold storage that's not really not quite yet a vault the way that i think about a vault is where there's a lot more structure to how you're allowed to spend so for example you can take one bitcoin out per month that would be a fault and it's like okay well i can withdraw a little bit but i can't withdraw everything all at once another type of vault that exists is anytime i try to withdraw i have a week to say i didn't actually mean to withdraw and you can cancel it and send it somewhere else so there are different types of things that get lumped under the concept of a vault and they all rely on ideas of you wanting to have multiple steps and factors of authentication before you're actually able to get access to the coin and having multiple chances to being able to subvert the funds back into maybe a more secure custody facility taproot itself does help with making vaults possible but i personally don't think that just taproot is going to get us vaults it will get you it will get you multi-sig being cheaper it will let you do more sophisticated multi-sigs but i do think that in order for the structured spending you need a few other things and those do happen to be things that i'm working on so i'm happy to get into detail uh on that um there's a proposal bip 119 check template verify that i've been working on in a programming language that uses it called sapio that helps people being able to define and implement things like vaults so those i think are around the corner and taproot the idea of having a mast that merklized abstract syntax tree or alternative script tree people use different terminologies so giving your listeners both those do help with being able to make vaults with alternative spending conditions because you could say well the fund can move this way or it could move this way or it can move this other way and then you only need to show one of them to the network so tapper is a part of that but it's not by itself i think enough to get vaults really fully functional okay and can you just actually give as user-friendly an explanation as possible of mast and like these technical technical terms that you were using yeah so what a mass is is a type of tree and a tree is a computer science data structure that you can use to efficiently look something up we're familiar with trees from things like a i i think like the dewey decimal system is kind of like a little bit of a tree where the first numbers tell you like a more general category and then the later numbers tell you a more specific category so i could be getting this wrong i haven't used a dewey decimal system you know uh since like third grade or something but you know you might start with some number that corresponds to fiction and then you would say okay well if i'm looking at in some somebody who's a librarian is probably going to hate me for this parks i'm going to get all everything wrong but you might look at like a nine and you'd be like well nine is the fiction section okay so eight is the non-fiction section and so if the number starts with nine it's this if it starts with eight it's something else and then you go nine dot five and five is uh science fiction and you might keep on going and then well 9.5.3 that's science fiction that happens in space so you're kind of traversing and it's narrowing down the number of things and if you were to imagine in your head all of the shape of how you might go number to number to number it kind of looks like the spanning out of a tree of where you would start at the base at nine and then you would go up to five and then to three and there are these branches that you kind of go down that's the concept of a tree now what a merklized tree is is something where you take the tree and let's flip it upside down so you're thinking of the things that are at the bottom all of the books just lined up in a row and what you do is you take two books and then you say okay each book has a serial number uh let's take that serial number and let's take the other serial number and then let's add them together and now we've got another serial number that refers to that bucket that has two books in it and then in merkelization the sort of very brilliant idea is that you're using a special type of serial number called the hash that specifically refers to the exact content of that book and what you do is you say okay i've got two books they're serial numbers cover the entire contents so we'll always get this exact book back and then i add together both their serial numbers and then i hash that again and that keeps those serial numbers from growing to be too long if you just add them together so that you have serial number a and b they would get really really long and then it would take forever for you to tell somebody which bucket you're looking for but by hashing you get these compact identifiers and as you go up this tree you have buckets that represent more and more and more books so that you would say okay well first we start with two and then we have four and then we have eight 16 32 64 128 256 etc etc you keep on growing the number of books that your serial number refers to and then at some point somebody can say hey look here's this hash and then this is the really important part is you can then say okay well give me the book with the specific set of serial numbers going down and merkle trees provide a really easy way to look up and verify a specific book and be able to check later when somebody does give you that book you can say wait a minute i read this book and i computed what the serial number should be and you gave me a different book you've checked that it was the correct book in the correct bucket now the last concept and this is it's a like i said it's a mouthful so it's a lot of different things coming in is the notion of it being an alternative script tree or an abstract syntax tree they kind of mean the same thing the alternative script tree is a little bit easier to understand instead of books we use pieces of the permission slip so what you say is you say hey i've got this permission slip and i built a merkle tree out of it and that window that i talked about on the driver's license you would say just give me this little bit of it that tells me if carol's allowed to spend today and then you would provide what's called this merkle lookup path into the tree and then they would be able to check that this was actually the correct document inside of the permission slip and the spending is authorized i know that's probably not easy but that's sort of the most faithful explanation i could give for it to give your listeners a little bit of that sense huh okay okay yeah that um i could see how um it just enables developers to kind of more easily create new um things that people can do with bitcoin basically that's kind of like the main thing but but actually i loved this description it's obviously more technical than i normally um would would learn about um but i've always heard people use these terms and i didn't really understand what they were saying um so before we go uh so actually quickly we should touch on short signatures but also we should explain why it is that it's not certain yet whether or not the taproot upgrade will go through um so we should kind of go into a little bit about how this is being decided upon yeah so uh do you want the snore signatures or the uh well or the upgrades why don't we do both because we're at time but and i know i know you want to get back to the conference but these are both important uh topics yeah so for snore signatures it's mostly what i covered earlier um they allow for that aggregation there are a couple other cool things that they that you can do with them that previously you couldn't it has to do with a niche property of how the signature equations are structured such that they can be added together and previously they were not you couldn't add them together kind of like you know you can't just like add two fractions together in kind of an obvious way it made it difficult with the previous scheme to be able to make protocols where you can add signatures together which north signatures you can just take the signatures from multiple parties and add them together a little bit more easily and so that enables a lot of new protocols but i think that those things are a little bit uh niche or specific the upgrading stuff i can tell you a bit more about i actually have here um this hat made by uh one of the block stream employees samson um which talks about uh the notion that there is this whole question of signaling and there's lock-in on timeout true there's no lock in on timeout there's a website that you can check out taproot.watch that kind of shows you a visual interactive to see what's happening essentially when you come up with a change for bitcoin and upgrade nobody has the authority to make the note network run that code um so it's really difficult to know when a fundamental upgrade to bitcoin can actually be enforced so if there's a new feature like taproot when would you feel comfortable actually putting coins that could be stolen if nobody's enforcing that new rule it's pretty tricky and so what we've adopted as more or less a norm and i use the word norm very specifically because it's not how it has to be it's just a norm that we've used is that miners have the ability to signal in a block that they are ready and upgraded to enforce the new rule when they validate and mine a block and that's sort of the minimum thing that you need for the network understood as being the union of users and minors to be able to know that the rule is safe to use if you didn't have the miners and just the users who are enforcing it it would still be safe for those users but they wouldn't have the hash rate and they would see network disruption in terms of like a loss of blocks being mined and things would get a little bit wonky like it could take you know 200 minutes for your transaction to get confirmed um even if you're paying the top fee rate so that's where the idea of minor signaling it's sort of like the easiest thing if miners say universally they're all going to enforce a new rule then it's probably going to be okay to use on the network and what's happening right now is the signaling window for taproot where miners have been able to mark in their blocks that they are ready for taproot to be locked in and over the last week miners have started signaling basically universally that they are ready for tap route and that means at the end of this two-week period taproot will lock in which means that the entire network knows the rule is going to take effect and then in november it will actually activate and that means that the net the rule will actually be usable so there's a gap between when we as a network say the new rule is going to turn on and when the rule actually turns on and that's to ensure that any stragglers actually have time to be fully upgraded all right and so um it but it hasn't reached the threshold yet right but it's quite close so does it look likely that it will be adopted yeah so the way that the threshold works is i believe it is uh either 1814 or 1815 out of 2016 of the last group of blocks mind and it's not a sliding window it's like can create chunks like you know starting at zero then 2016 then it goes like that if that threshold which corresponds to 90 of block signal then it will lock in and then at some point in the future it will activate so you need a certain number if you don't have that enough miners then it's unclear that the there won't be issues uh around the stability of consensus in the future so we set a pretty high threshold and then miners have um i think we said around three months uh in order to signal sufficiently if miners don't and this is where there's a little bit of controversy if miners were to not have signaled um in that three month period then the upgrade which you heard about all the great things that people are gonna get out of it so we really really want this thing to go through we wouldn't get that upgrade and so there's a group of people who at the outset of this process said and that's what the hat is about is they said under no circumstances are we not going to get this upgrade and in fact if you don't signal we will throw away any blocks that you mine that do not signal for taproot and we will do that two years from now and so it's kind of a very uh aggressive maneuver to tell miners you know either our way or the highway a lot of developers feel very uncomfortable with setting ultimatums like that they want things to be a little bit more uh opt-in and voluntary but a lot of users felt miners have no business deciding what transactions should be valid or invalid they're there to serve us we pay them via a subsidy if they're not going to do what we want they can hit the road and so there's definitely a little bit of disagreement around how that should happen i think you can see a more clear-cut example where um with the recent marathon mining pool that said that they're going to be ofac compliant and they're going to censor transactions where everybody kind of said ah this is bitcoin like you know screw you guys we couldn't stop them from mining you know we couldn't say you can't do it but everybody else said no like you know you mind our transactions like you know we're not here to serve you you know so we're not going to participate in your kyc scheme or whatever so i think that there is a very delicate relationship between what minors want to do and what users do and what developers are like willing to personally advance and i think we got to see a little microcosm of that with the tap root process but the overall reality is that taproot was so uncontroversial it was sort of like uh people discussing how one day we might go to war about something in the future based on some battles that were fought in the past over some other upgrades in a less in a more turbulent time but it's basically a time of peace right now and so the upgrade was pretty quickly picked up by miners and looks like it will ship uncontroversially yeah yeah this is not like the block size debate and uh just to be clear about marathon the blowback was so intense that they reversed course so well i think it's i think they even got like a new ceo right like that's what i had heard that it was like very very intense yeah yeah he started a month ago so and and yeah now they're saying they're not going to do that i mean it was very um not with the bitcoin ethos so it's not surprising that they got pushed back but anyway okay well this has been so informative i really appreciate that you took the time especially during bitcoin miami um so yeah thanks so much for explaining tough route and coming on

last week the biden administration released its 2022 budget proposal tucked inside was an emphasis on expanding the irs in order to combat tax evasion specifically the us treasury highlighted crypto as an area to focus on saying quote tax evasion using crypto assets is a rapidly growing problem the global nature of the crypto market offers opportunities for u.s taxpayers to conceal assets and taxable income by using offshore crypto exchanges and wallet providers treasury's proposal looks to expand the reporting requirements of crypto brokers to include the beneficial owners of accounts internationally which basically would force financial institutions to collect and verify information from customers holding or transacting in crypto assets according to the blog this new proposal is not quite as groundbreaking as it initially sounds as crypto exchanges are already expected to keep information on their clients however treasury is now focused on tracking information internationally

association next headline marathon will no longer censor bitcoin blocks marathon holdings a prominent bitcoin miner announced in a press release that the mining firm quote will be updating all our miners to the full standard bitcoin core 0.21.1 node including support for taproot the announcement comes about a month into fred teal's tenure as chief executive officer where he appears to be taking the miner in a slightly different direction than previous leadership the latest press release is important for two reasons one previously marathon had described itself as an ofac compliant pool meaning they would only mine blocks compliant with u.s regulations excluding transactions associated with sanctioned addresses from the blocks at mind from now on marathon will no longer censor transactions with teal saying quote marathon is committed to the core tenants of the bitcoin community including decentralization inclusion and no censorship the next thing to note is that marathon will now be signaling in favor of taproot over the past month not all of marapol which is marathon's mining pole has signaled for taproot activation with half of the non-signaling blocks for taproot coming from mira this epic bitcoin's tap root update which jeremy and i just discussed at length should be should enable improvements to bitcoin's scaling privacy and custody software and it recently began its three month activation period miners who wish to adopt the update can signal support by adding what is called a signal bit in blocks they mine at the time of publishing miners have signals for activation at a ratio of 97.67 percent with 251 out of 257 blocks signaling readiness for tap root however there is a long way to go before tap read is activated as 1562 additional blocks are
