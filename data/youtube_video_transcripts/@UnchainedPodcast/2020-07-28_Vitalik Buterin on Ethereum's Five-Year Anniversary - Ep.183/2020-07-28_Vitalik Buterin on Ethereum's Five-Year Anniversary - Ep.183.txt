congratulations on the five-year anniversary of ethereum thank you yay so glad that we're finally here so something that's really funny is you and I did our last interview a little over a year ago and afterward uh this this was for the live event I did in New York one of the attendees wrote me and yelled at me saying that because I asked YouTube questions that you would never do an interview with me again so I'm happy that we are proving that person wrong yay um so upon the five-year anniversary of the ethereum network being live what are your main thoughts and feelings I mean ethereum has definitely come a long way in the last five years and it's definitely been a really striking to just see the change uh just see how much change there has been and even just see how more and more of the changes just outside of mine even outside of the ethereum foundation's control so like if you remember ethereum in 2014 and 2015 it was this much a kind of small words that are in a community everyone who was doing anything important and have knew each other and was coordinating really closely you know there was myself there was Gavin there was a the developers team whether a Vlad um some other people and everyone was in a very closely talking to each other and then just kind of over time you know just started to be more and more people coming into the community right so I remember Defcon one in the London was this big kind of coming out party for ethereum in a lot of ways and that was when Microsoft announced their cooperation with ethereum for the first time and like that was huge right like in 2020 it's like you know and okay it's another bank another software company doing something but in 2015 it's like whoa you mean a big software company is doing blockchain things and you know since then there are a lot of these different banking groups doing things on blockchains uh there have been uh a lot of just independent individual projects that all have their own stories you know auger um is pretty big and has its own story makers are quite big it has its own story as do all of these other kind of sub-communities within the ethereum ecosystem that are at this point even even themselves bigger than ethereum was five years ago and so just again seeing that expansion and they're just continuing non-stop you know going from 2014 to 2016 and then the big you're gonna bubble and then Ethan passed the bubble right like the hype died down but I think uh you know the communities continue to expand in a lot of ways and just seeing that happen has been incredible in seeing the technology progress has been incredible seeing things like uh proof of stake progress from being you know not sure if they can even work to an idea to a white paper to a spec to now um a public multi-client test network has been wonderful as well so you know lots of great things are happening and I'm very happy that lots of great things are happening I solicited some questions on Twitter and there was an interesting one from someone whose handle was Mr Kim crypto and he said what would you change if you could do it all over again there's definitely like a lot of little things and and some of them are technical little things like you know like using a binary tree instead of a hex or H3 and there's like 50 different things like that that like sounds really boring but if we did them we would have been like a year or closer to ethereum 2.0 by now but um aside from that there is also a kind of social things and in a lot of ways the social things are one of the more interesting things right so things though like for example just the way that the project started and then of the history of starting off with this kind of big and heavy development team um that's like as opposed to kind of starting with a smaller and kind of more development focused effort that was uh one of the things that I might have done differently and anyway the distinction you're making when you said big and heavy development team did you mean the business side yeah yeah okay yeah so big and heavy not just development teams um and and the I think like for example the grant program has been great and we could have been in a much better place had we started that like two or three years earlier than we did so Nick a lot of things that the ethereum foundation has been kind of doing over the last two years has in many ways been they're just kind of correcting for some of the things that we've did that we did in the years before that and just trying to fix all of the mistakes and uh had we known then everything that we know now then of course you know we would have just started doing the correct thing from day one aside like from that and I'm sure there's lots of mistakes that we're still making but sometimes you don't know what the mistakes are you know because if you knew what the mistakes are then you would find a way to stop making them right right and so let's talk about an issue right now that a lot of people are talking about I'm sure you're well aware that one of the chief complaints at the moment is the high gas fees what do you plan to do about that and what solution do you think would be best to bring them down so ultimately high gas prices are just a function of high demand right like lots of people want to send ethereum transactions on the blockchain and there's not enough space for them and so people just keep it kind of outbitting each other trying to be the ones that get in so ultimately there's only two ways to get gas prices down one is to get people to stop wanting to use ethereum and so the other is to find a way they increase the amount of space so first of all I should say the first one is like slightly less ridiculous than it sounds right because there are specific cases where people are using the ethereum blockchain in ways that where they don't really need to be using it for every single thing they're using it for right so even just to give one example just a lot of the D5 Arbitrage things that are happening like they involve people sending lots of transactions and some of them getting on chain and a lot of the time just the transactions that get on chain or transactions that just don't do anything because they're like first they're not the first to get in an erase or whatever right so like that kind of category exists like there's a lot of room for applications so and have increased their efficiency sometimes it even involves moving things off chain and all these things and I know that application teams are definitely working really hard on that but at the same time the more and if interesting and one long-term viable thing is obviously increasing scalability right and scalability is the thing that we've been talking about for more than five years and like every major ethereum presentation from me you can find I probably mentioned scalability um and you know big problems we're working on privacy scalability user experience security what what did I forget something scalability um I get the difference now of course is that instead of just being this kind of far away Theory thing it's this you know very short-term necessary reality that we have to find a way to work around and the good news is that a lot of the scalability solutions are much further ahead now than they were at any time in the past so ethereum 2.0 is of course the big one that people talk about and they always talk about the proof of stake which is coming very very soon but then there's shorting and sharding is Phase One and not phase zero so sharding is going to take a bit longer than the kind of the launch of it of the East Cube blockchain by itself so each two was of course really important in big but at the same time it is kind of farther away than some of the other things but the good news is that there are these other enclosure things in the pipeline right so like Roll-Ups are one thing that I just mentioned all the time right roll up to be in this kind of really wonderful scalability technique that basically says instead of doing everything on chain you just put a very kind of minimum and compressed amount of information on chain that just basically tells people how they should update the state so how they should update kind of the internal record keeping of this roll-up system you know who has how much money in the roll-up and then instead of putting things like signatures for example on chain and verifying them on chain you just you know have one zero knowledge proof that just says here's the proof that that these thousands of signatures exist and I'm not going to tell you what the signatures are but you know here's the proof it says that they exist and and because of the cryptographic proof you can now trust that these transactions are all that one or alternatively you can you can combine all of your different signatures together and add them all into one big signature and then say no no if anyone can prove that this block is invalid they can submit a challenge and only if there's a challenge does any computation happen on chain right so and for the first family I talked about is the ZK roll up the second family I talked about is the optimistic roll up they've made both made a lot of progress right so like ZK Roll-Ups are already live on ethereum uh so you know if you saw loopering um The decentralized Exchange and it's this Chinese ethereum company they've been just putting out this decentralized exchange and uh is basically just a system of ethereum contracts and it's been running for a while and it's worked great uh ZK stink are the one from matter Labs is so both of those exist and you can use them they both even have built-in payments so I think for ZK roll up to the challenge is that it's like people love ethereum because ethereum lets you go beyond just moving coins around right like if you just want to move coins around then like you know whatever there's like Master coin or like SLP on bitcoin cash or like any other of these things right like the the true power of ethereum is that it does it's not just about that it's also about all these other things and so like moving coins around is a big part of what people use ethereum for but if he wants to expand beyond that then like if your knowledge proofs are not yet friendly enough for that in the future they will be right but we're still a couple of years away so that's one problem but if you just want to move coins around then like the only challenge is that we just have to get all of these you know wallets and exchanges and teams kind of to just work together and adopt a thing well one thing I wanted to ask was earlier when you talked about how the high gas fees reflect High demands um Alex mazmatch who he's the guy who's selling shares of himself on Via a coin he had a question which was what percentage of ethereum block spaces used for valuable actions versus bad ones so I'm curious what your thoughts are on that figuring out what's actually valuable is such a tough thing right from one standpoint You could argue that anything that people are willing to pay a 50-way per gas for is valuable because well by paying that transaction fee they clearly say it's valuable but on the other hand there's a lot of activity happening that's like clearly involves you know these zone of competitive games between different people like just like even you know D5 Arbitrage where everyone's just sending a transaction on chain and a lot of them end up failing and it would be nicer if uh that entire you know basically what's happening there is kind of like an auction between all of these garbage Rogers if that could happen more efficiently in some way then like you really could clear out a lot of kind of ethereum blockchain space and that wouldn't actually hurt anyone there's a lot of cases like that and then there's obviously applications on the chain that people just like might think are outright bad so you know ponzis are one example and there's always a couple of them somewhere so it's complicated and I I definitely think that the great majority of the of the activity is um kind of valuable and not the source that you can just uh kind of removed by you know me kind of coming up with us with a slightly better game in some way I don't know it's hard to say it's uh I mean one of the kind of disadvantages of an open system is that you they just you just get all sorts of characters from all around the world building things on it so it's hard to tell and speaking of complexity let's now talk about ethereum 2.0 which I you know just for me somebody who spends a lot of time trying to figure out how to convey things to other people especially when it comes to this space I find it quite complicated and I believe that it would be something that would also be complicated for validators to understand and for them to make a cost-benefit analysis and in general for them to assess what their risks are and it reminded me a little bit of how defy composability introduces a lot of risks because protocol creators can't always foresee what other protocols will introduce and so I just wonder do you think that complexity of ethereum 2.0 does create a risk for the security of the network it definitely does and that's a big part of the reason why we've been working really hard to try to make the protocol simpler okay I definitely think that it's twice as simple now as a as it was a year and a half ago which has been a very significant saying if we press but at the same time there's definitely complexity that's unavoidable in some ways right like you know if you have a regular blockchain that everyone's just validating everything if you have a shorted blockchain and you need some kind of rules for figuring out you know who's validating what blocks at what time and that's just like more code that has to be in there that would it be in there if we weren't charting and there's no way around it uh even in my proof of stake for example like one of its disadvantages is that it's definitely a bit more technologically uh complex because like you have to deal with validators you have to figure out like what's the process for validators logging in what's the process for validators logging out and there's a lot of just this kind of management happening in the protocol so that definitely does exist though at the same time I do think a lot of it is just the fact that people are less familiar than with a proof of stake and so it feels more like an unknown unknown to them what actually is the chance of something is crazy is going to happen on chain I don't know well you know what it's like how many people are actually going to be willing to validate at an interest rate of nine or reward rate of nine percent I don't know so like these are the sorts of things that like unfortunately just can't make answers to until you have a live running system so my I think it's perfectly fair for a lot of people to just kind of say we're sitting out of the thing until for uh it just runs by itself for one or two years and that's perfectly fine there there are so many things I want to discuss around this but let's maybe just talk about eth price at the beginning because one of the things that I gleaned is that the security of ethereum 2.0 will be highly reliant on the stability and the value of the price and historically ethereum has not been one of those crypto networks that has focused quite a bit on price especially compared to some of the other coins so I wondered if he thought that staking will usher in a new era in which ethereum does focus on the price of eth and on issues like monetary policy it's hard to kind of figure out like what concrete actions could reduce price volatility for example right and if you look at ethereum versus a lot of these other coins like ethereum's price volatility is not necessarily that high like it's statistically definitely higher than Bitcoin but it's lower than a lot of these other smaller cryptocurrencies and even the ones that say you know rah-rah look we have a fixed cap and so that you should trust us more so like there's some aspects of uh kind of monetary properties of easy assets that just can't be engineered no matter how hard you try there are other aspects um that you know you can look at right so like one of the big you know discussions happening in the ethereum community is this thing that if you Market reform debate around the eip1559 where basically it's this uh kind of very significant proposed reform to how transaction fees works and basically says that instead of having a fixed block size and the kind of transaction fee is constantly jumping around you would have a kind of very short-term variable block sizes and the transaction fee would be a kind of stabilized more and it would not move much between one watch to the other and this and there's a lot of reasons why this would improve economic efficiency but one of the other things that it does is basically means that some portion of coins and transaction fees get burned which of course means that you know it reduces issuance and potentially like if there's enough transaction fees it could even give each negative issuance right so if you even look at like the transaction fees on the ethereum network the last two weeks it's been somewhere between like two thousand and five thousand ether per day and if you kind of expand that out to per year then it's looking like well seven hundred thousand to a 1.7 million either a year which is higher than the proof of stake issuance that we're expecting right so it's actually the negative issuance is not even far outside the realm of possibility for ethereum and there's a lot of people in the ethereum community that are like excited about this and that sort of actively wants us to start uh you know talking about monetary policy taking monetary policy seriously um and all of these things you know which is interesting and and it's it's also kind of a sign of uh the Project's decentralization in some ways like that that kind of pushed towards taking um Esther's monetary properties more seriously was definitely not an ethereum Foundation thing right like it was just these community members that just like stood up and said you know hey we have east and East as an asset and but you should care more about EC asset and they're kind of not so I guess though the price doesn't matter because the reality is that if the price goes down by 90 then like we go bankrupt and realistically the platform of security goes down when the platform breaks and that would be true in proof of work work proof of stake right like in proof of work if the price of each drop slight factor of 10 then suddenly the ethereum proof of work miners would have to go and compete with uh you know ethereum classic and Dogecoin and all these other coins and uh like when a coin stops being the dominant coin was uh within its kind of class of proof of work Hardware then it becomes much easier from for miners to come in from the outside and attack it and so really price has always been a uh a blockchain security concern it's just people are kind of more willing to talk about it honestly now than in the past and what about you what camp do you put yourself in because you sort of talked about it as if you are not in that camp of wanting to place an emphasis on it but the thing is that is I mean okay so you have your role at the foundation but you also have your role as a researcher and I would imagine as a researcher focused on security you would recognize that price is a linchpin in the security of ethereum 2.0 I definitely think price is important for security and it's important for a lot of things I mean I think um maybe one kind of difference in emphasis is that like if you have if and you're interested in like basically ethazine of get rich asset then you care about you know the chance that the probability that it goes up to ten thousand but if you care about the value of ease for network security purposes or even for making sure the ecosystem continues to have funding or for you know just like pointy node a kind of stability to ensure the utility of yes then the thing you care more about is the price of not dropping to zero so those are two kind of somewhat different kinds of iOS caring about the price right like one focuses more on you know maximizing the upside and the other focuses more on just minimizing downside risk so I mean I think there is definitely a kind of convergence of goals there between um you know people who hold these because they want it to go up and people who you you know realize that e is having value as necessary for security but there is also end of this other Divergence as well but I mean in practice I I don't think it ends up causing that much of a disagreement and so it sounds like ultimately you think the monetary for monetary policy for if will be variable it sounds like sometimes it will be deflationary and sometimes it will be inflationary and it just sort of depends on what's happening with Demand on the network that's definitely the current path and I mean this has definitely also been another one of the kind of big debates for us like on the one hand you know we recognize that there was kind of neem value in having a cap and you know there's the value in being able to say you know the the price will or the the market cap sorry the token Supply will never go above 150 billion we're gonna go not one step backward from here and uh even coming going out and saying crazy things like if the ethereum protocol ever changes so there's more than 150 million ethers and it is no longer ethereum um you know like these things that like coin Supply maximalists say which are kind of obviously false but kind of motivational at the same time and uh like we are posture has always been to kind of not go in that direction basically our kind of line is that like ultimately there's a trade-off between stability of the coin Supply and stability of the security level of the blockchain and ultimately ethereum isn't a coin first it's uh a worldwide decentralized technology platform first and so security a stability of the security level is more important than stability of the coin Supply I mean at the same time look we're definitely end of recognized what we're missing out on by taking that path so oh no it's a difficult question I think like the community is the viewers and like my own a lot of people's views are definitely still kind of influx on this yeah and earlier when you talked about how right now you are making these theoretical assumptions about what will happen with ethereum 2.0 but ultimately you won't really know until it goes live I saw that you read this Economic Review of ethereum 2.0 that was put out by researchers at consensus and in that they assert that the cost of perpetrating attacks on ethereum 2.0 will be lower than in ethereum 1.0 and they advocated that there be a minimum of 3 13.8 percent of the network supply of be staked and afterward you tweeted that you disagreed and you thought it didn't need to be that high and so it it strikes me that you know you admitted earlier you really don't know but wouldn't it be kind of better to err on the side of caution in this case so like I feel like we have strong kind of outside of you arguments uh to uh for why attacking a proof of work change should be much or sorry attacking improve State change should be much more expensive than attacking a proof of work chain right the outside of the argument basically is that like if you look at what a proof of work mining rig does right it mines and it mines for maybe one or two years and then you have to buy another one and even while it's running you have to pay for a lot of electricity and you have to do a lot of Maintenance and so the cost of a mining rig should realistically Target somewhere around like one year maybe one and a half years of issuance right basically what that would or the cost of all the mining rigs that are currently out there rather should Target maybe a year to one and a half years of issuance right because like that's roughly the time Horizon within which those mining rigs are going to be actually working and kind of subtracting out the electricity and maintenance and like a mosula and all of those things but with proof of stake if you have coins then like the coins aren't going to just burn after one and a half years of staking right like after one and a half years of staking you can just get your coins out again and so we're gonna we should expect the ratio between kind of the cost of the backing assets and the cost of the rewards to be much higher in proof of stake than um it is in proof of work right and that's like that's something I told them and uh that's something that like I remember when I did my my own uh and a quick calculations on and of the cost of proof of work A6 I definitely got a number that was substantially lower than theirs but I mean I don't know I mean it's definitely kind of a puzzle like What's um in that analysis and there's I mean I definitely be happy to just talk to them more and just they see how to kind of get these different risk factors to line up with each other yeah and one other thing that I wanted to ask about was and maybe this is just me not knowing the system that well but when I was reading their Economic Review it seemed that in most situations sticking would be profitable but at low prices the net yield for stickers does go into the negative and I wondered if there was some mechanism that's similar to the difficulty mining algorithm in Bitcoin that then makes staking more profitable if it goes if the if the net profit goes into the negative so as to incentivize more people at stake and push the price up because otherwise it just seems like then you could end up in these like death spiral type situations right I mean it's a challenge right because if you respond to uh and if prices dropping by increasing the issuance rate then you risk entering into another kind of death spiral which is like price goes down print more coins price goes down more print goes both coins and you get um you know ethereum goes the way of all of these hyperinflating Fiat currencies and so look we definitely don't want that right and I think like the challenge with that that sharded blockchains do have is basically that like if you have a blockchain where the capacity of the blockchain is like n times bigger than the capacity of one single computer then ultimately you need to have at least n computers and then watch it somewhere in the network for it to be able to process all those transactions right and I mean actually you would need somewhere like more than n times 200 because you want redundancy but like you know you get how you need at least and and plus like some Factor right the problem of course is that in the worst case if people stop caring about ethereum and the size of the user Community goes down to n minus one then you're kind of screwed no matter what the mechanism is right so there's this kind of mathematical challenge here that's kind of short and change do have and I think like this problem is actually one of the things that's probably going to end up putting limits on the capacity of a sharded blockchain right like so we're doing 64 shards with uh kind of an eye to pushing up to 1024 eventually and then some people might ask well why are you sticking with this kind of what we call quadratic shorting just kind of two layer structure where you just have shards the charts like why not just go all the way and have shards of shards of shards and then go up to infinity and the answer basically is like well if you put the number of shards to be really high then if this size of the community drops to below what you were expecting then the network can't really verify anything and you're kind of screwed right ideally of course what you would want actually is you would want a system that says if the price of the currency drops then like if the U.S dollar price is the currency drops then uh kind of dial down the capacity of each of these shards and try to dial down the number of shards or whatever and to kind of scale down the size of the system right but the problem is that it's hard for blockchains to have built-in price oracles um but you know it's hard to make Pro Oracle is kind of decentralized enough for for a layer of a layer one and so we have this problem where either a shorted system has to be kind of much smaller than it otherwise would be which is the path that ethereum is going or a shortest system has to kind of dynamically scale up and down with some Metric of how big its Community is and the problem is that a blockchain has no way of measuring how Vegas Community is because you know simple it's action all of that stuff so like the the economic kind of price dependence has been is actually like basically a version of that same problem right like it basically says that you know if the price goes down the wad and so people are less uh and just interested in the uh ethereum Network then the ethereum network uh maybe no longer has the ability to compensate all of these people just for running nodes that are part of the chain um and we do have some ways of a kind of partially dealing with this right so like for example one thing that would happen in that kind of scenario like if there were low prices and people dropped out is that the amount of e-stakes would end up dropping and once the amount of each stake drops below a certain amount like I think it's either four million or 8 million I forget then what happens is that the shards sometimes start skipping slots so like basically you you stop having every shot have one block every slot and so the capacity of the system kind of starts uh shrinking because of that and so there is a kind of a bit of this Auto adjusting mechanics that helps kind of stabilize the chain in that case but um you know it's definitely far from perfect and there are kind of just fundamental impossibilities that we have to whack against all right so in a moment we're going to talk more about issues regarding proof of stake as well as D5 but first a quick word from the sponsors who make

next sign up and learn more about the virtual series at T quorum.com back to my conversation with vitalik buterin I also got a good question from tarun chitra of Gauntlet Network and he pointed out that existing proof of stake networks have run at a capital constraint issues for some of their validators and that some you know individuals in particular find it unprofitable to be validators and they can't realize economies of scale without professional validation setups similar to what you get from Amazon web services so how do you think ethereum's proof of stake system can be more democratic so I think uh there's two major differences in the incentive structure between ethereum and a lot of these other chains right so one of them is that um a lot of these other systems uh end up kind of importantly making the assumptions they expect like the majority of their participants to a really really huge number of participants to stake right and they set the numbers and they try to basically create a situation where like 80 of people are staking or 50 of people are staking or some other a fairly huge number like that and ethereum is not doing that right ethereum is basically targeting you know somewhere between five and thirty percent staking is the kind of the level that we're expecting to watch wanting was the one thing probably being kind of a bit on the higher side of that but you know if it's lower that's fine too um so that's one part of the response right which is that like we're explicitly expecting there to be even fewer stakers than a lot of these other networks and that's fine the other part of the response is that our incentive structure is like deliberately designed to be very forgiving right so like a lot of these other chains they have staking inside the structures that basically say if you're online less than like 95 or 90 of the time then like you start getting these penalties very quickly um and ethereum is not like that right in ethereum you know you can be net profitable even if you're on offline like 30 or potentially even 40 of the time ethereum is uh basically designed and at least in terms of its incentives for kind of more immature stickers that potentially kind of have their setups break more often and and that was a deliberate design Choice like we're definitely not deliberately trying to kind of engineer for a high performance Network like basically because you know if you engineer for a high performance Network then like you risk creating incentives for everyone to start like concentrating in the same cloud computing setups and then are you really decentralized they're really censorship resistant and all of these things so like in ethereum you know we've made a lot of these conservative choices like you know Target the the percentage online that we're targeting I mean even the test debts are like costs they jump between 80 to 95 percent I think whereas like I think Cosmos or some of these other networks they just constantly stay considerably above 95 percent uh in other places the the 12 seconds a lot time right so ethereum is a lot of time and game two spot time is 12 seconds and in the future I could see a decrease into eight seconds or six seconds but you know we're never gonna go all the way to one second whereas some of these other chains are so you know there's a lot of these the kind of trade-offs that we're making where we are kind of indefinitely refused to you know satisfy a lot of people's needs for Unique Performance but again I think the result is more resilient okay yeah it's Aruna and his um colleague or actually I think it's Alex Evans a placeholder they wrote of a great post and house taking actually lends itself to the kind of securitization that looks very similar to mortgage-backed Securities did you see that post I think I so I I don't remember two hours a while back yeah it's about just lending and um yeah but I mean it granted obviously these products are more transparent uh because all this happens in a smart contract but they pointed out these are the kinds of financial products that did lead to the creation of Bitcoin so we were curious what your opinion was on that honestly I'm less worried about staking and more worried about existing D5 and I guess the thing with speaking is that and I definitely would expect a kind of staking setups to just remain fairly simple because like there's well basically either you're staging yourself or you're giving your money to someone else who staged for you and like maybe you can like sponge things beyond that and you could say oh here's a flight like a contract and it gives uh 80 them of the first 80 of these to the holder of one coin and the last 20 which is much more in a performance dependent to the holder of another coin and then you can concentrate to kind of um ownership of these tokens that represents like basically interest and be a really high quality staking and all these things but generally like I guess I just I'm not expecting the complexity of just that part to go too high but the places where the complexity can go high is basically like if people want either just a lot of the things that people are doing with with existing uh these D5 projects they're kind of trying to get leverage on different assets and trying to get uh lovely Financial Arrangements that kind of satisfy a very specific functions and yield farming and all of these things or potentially kind of those things plus proof of stake right so like you could imagine like you you know there is lending East but then you can imagine a system that allows you to land snakes eat and if you're lending fake beef then suddenly it starts mattering well who is doing mistaking there's definitely concerns I guess my kind of big picture reason why I'm not too scared is basically that if we just maintain this really kind of important property that says that if an attack happens then lots of people lots of coins get destroyed right if you just maintain that invariant then if an attack happens then five million coins that were response that were responsible for the attack get destroyed somehow then you know that well at the maximum that you can have is like 10 attacks before half the East gets destroyed and at that point no one's ever no one's going to be interested in staking in any Financial setup ever again right so but like this is part of why I'm really into you know security deposits and penalties and flashing and all these things even though other a lot of other people are not like I just like this aspect that it basically lets you kind of put a cap on the number of times the thing breaks basically okay yeah I mean there are so many things we could discuss because a part of me does Wonder now also about this proliferation of derivatives and how that introduces new ways for people to profit by destroying the price of ether but instead of let's go instead of going down that rabbit hole I actually want to ask you more about your criticisms of defy what are your main criticisms and concerns hmm I think one big one is just that a lot of people are underestimating smart contract risk and so like I remember even a year ago like there were people on Twitter I think it was making the case that you know hey if you have dollars in a regular bank accounts then you're making maybe two percent interest and that assumes you know like some kind of fixed deposit whatever and if it's variable then it's even less um and it but if you put your dollars into a compounds and you're getting four percent well why the hell would anyone choose two percent over four percent clearly four percent is better or even if if you put your dollars in die literally four percent back when it was four percent clearly four percent is better and my response was well four percent is only better than two percent if those systems are exactly the same in every other way right and in fact for the four percent system to be better than the two percent system you basically need the four percent system to have less than a two percent chance a year of breaking right because if the four percent system has a five percent chance a year of breaking then it becomes negative one percent and so I feel like there's a lot of people that are just not fully taking this into account in some of their calculations and you know they might think that oh okay it's been safe for a while it's been safe for a while and these projects are audited and I think a lot of this D5 projects really have like done a great job of auditing themselves and just doing a way better job of that and learning from the mistakes of the Dow and all of those things but at the same time you know are we safe enough that we can promise a chance of breaking of less than two percent a year I don't I don't think we can get there yet right so like that's one thing and so I think uh and if the main takeaway from that criticism I guess is that Defy is still fine but like don't act like it's a place where you should advocate for a lot of regular people to put uh to put their life savings into now there are of course places where you know CFI and as in the traditional banking system has risks too right and like there's a lot of people who are because of their specific contacts like their money might get seized or like their local currency might get hyperinflated or all these things and so like if you're in one of those situations where the the risks of the centralized kind of stuff is uh greater than two percent a year from you then you know by all means get into D5 and it's safer um but or at least when I say defy in this case I mean single coins right get into stable coins in this paper um but like if you're just in a defy to get you know four percent interest instead of two percent interest then like that's probably not something you should be doing so that's one thing the other thing is that there are a lot sometimes D5 things happening that are not very sustainable right so like one big example of this is like yield farming right so like this is big this big hot trends that we've been seeing recently and you can also get these really high interest rates that was like 20 30 to 100 plus percent annually but the problem is that these interest rates are ultimately uh they're paid for by rewards explicitly provided by whatever protocol was uh is it is uh doing the lending right like they're either provided by compound or they're provided by whoever else like I forget what the acronyms are these days and those guys are not going to just keep on printing coins for people to to entice people to get into their ecosystems forever right it's a short-term thing and like once the enticements disappear you can use the waste of the yield it's like drop back down very close to zero percent so it's not a that's not something that could make D5 break but it definitely is a sign that like we should not necessarily Beach reading a kind of temporary advantages that we have now as reasons or as things that we should be pushing in front of out in front of the entire world as like reasons why everyone should get into D5 because if you push them out to the entire world then by the time people start getting into D5 these kind of temporary advantages are not going to be there anymore well so I want to ask you how it makes you feel that that like defy right now and yields in particular kind of the main things that ethereum is either used for at least known for or it's kind of you know what people are talking about when it comes to ethereum and before that icos which I know you also at the time of the Ico craze you tweeted um critically about those and the you know all those things have been the major use cases of ethereum so far so how does it make you feel to see that your creation is being used for those things and and a two-part question and what can you do to steer things more in a direction of how you'd like to see ethereum being used I definitely think that those things aren't the only use cases and I definitely you know my just keep kind of discovering people using ethereum for you know lots of other things like there's people that just to use es for payments there's people that use um ease to uh just you know move money from one country to another there's even people using ease for in-person payments and I even used each to pay at a restaurant in London a few months ago so they and then you know you have prediction markets um like Omen which is great and then there's order which is uh coming out so at the end of the month so there's a lot a lot of uh ethereum applications coming out that I'm definitely excited about um and I'm also it just excited by the fact that like in some of the non-etherium communities that I'm uh kind of close to where people are increasingly just starting to pay attention to ethereum so it's one of the things I tweeted recently is um there was this article about um it was this a Nigerian person that was uh basically describing a proposal for a new uh spelling system before I think it was the um Igbo and like one other out of language that's common in Nigeria um and what I read through that article I saw at the end of the article um there was an ether donation option and there was a comment box where the this was one of those kind of post comments that go on directly on the ethereum blockchain sort of things right so that's one example and then another example I just saw again sub in the rationalistic community as people were just starting to link link to some of these Omen prediction markets more and more right so like I mean I think these are anecdotal right I mean by and large at the moment it's defying before that it was Isis I'm not trying to say it's not used for these other things but how does it make you feel that it is a little bit yeah I guess like what like my goal is to kind of Empower all of these other use cases that you know if we like um and I guess hope that each that these kind of more hypey use cases are all like they might be big individually but there are but just because they're on so unsustainable individually the only each last for like one or two years um so uh you know it is a it's definitely a long game right like I feel like the ratio of uh like things that I'm excited about to or just like Financial speculating things has definitely improved between the 2017 and 2020 right so you know in 2017 there was this big Ico craze but in there are also kind of off in the corner a couple of people using ethereum for well I mean what was it back then like there was auger and Audra had like a couple of dozen users and like maybe there were people trying to make a doubt and there were people just using East for payments so in that in 2017 maker didn't even exist yet or at least it wasn't Don chain it was just a project right and in 2020 icos kind of did their room and bust and they've collapsed them but now we have defy and we have yield farming and like I'm definitely not expecting you know yield farming to be a multi-billion dollar industry two years from now um I mean unless of course you count staking as yield farming like staging technically has yield but like whatever it'll be it'll be a much more kind of subdued and boring thing like that's the prediction I'm happy to make but I think kind of the more interesting use cases of ethereum are are going to stay in they're only going to grow stronger so that's my hope in terms of like what we can do to help realize that hope and I think one thing is to just help some of these other applications that kind of advertise themselves and they're going to get more attention and get out in the community is one thing and it's one thing that we've definitely been trying to do aside from that like just aside from me is the kind of deliberate efforts too and if either help these applications develop or kind of improve these applications you know social status and there's definitely a limit to how much we can do so and what do you think is the most optimal way for D5 projects to distribute their tokens yeah this is a tough question right because like I recognize the challenge that these projects are in right because um if you're going to launch with a token you have to distribute the token um and if you have to distribute the token somehow and in 2009 the cool thing was proof of work and proven work was very nice and Democratic but now you know we yeah we hate proof of work and proof of work is like neither Democratic nor necessary then in 2017 that's like you know if you want to distribute your coins you sell your coins and now icos are not tip anymore so like what do you you know then is it also been 18 to 19 we had air drops and like I mean the problem with air jobs of course is that you get nothing for them and people and it's not clear how effective they are and actually kind of creating interest for your ecosystem I.E grant that there is the genuine challenge here and that's a big part of why I'm not willing to just go all out and criticizing some of these projects right I mean there's a twofold challenge right one part of the twofold challenge is basically that's like the economics of building anything cyber um are often very screwed up basically because you're building something that has a zero marginal cost right you're building something where it's um you know there's a lot of costs involved in just building out everything else at the beginning but then once you've built something then the cost of like Distributing each additional unit of like ability to participate is close to free but the problem is that if you just make your pro your thing close to free then like how do you pay for additional development and this was like one of the big problems of just the whole internet and launching a token was the second of one way of kind of finally being able to break out of that trap and now and so of course people want to launch tokens and then if you don't do the token around then like what can you do well you can apply to the CRM validation and like maybe the ethereum validation will give you a 250 000 Grant which is already much better than three years ago or would have given you a ten thousand dollar Grant um like there's still this kind of difference between like the scale of thing that people want to build and the scale of financing that you know you can support that way so yeah and I I definitely understand that these project teams are facing south challenges and that we don't have uh and they're great solutions to direct them towards so yield farming is the or liquidity mining or whatever it is is definitely a one of these paths that people have tried and I think I like some level of that kind of distribution is definitely okay like I think uh some level of this idea that you know if you have a project or some system and that system has a fee in it then like refunding that the in-protocol tokens basically distributes protocol tokens to your users and that's really nice and wonderful like there's a level of that which is legitimate like I think it becomes illegitimate when basically you're refunding people more money to use the protocols and then they're spending to use the protocol and so people end up just like dunking their coins and getting money out without actually like using the protocol and I think like in the long run a project to do that out what's going to happen is that people are just going to like professionalize farming and they're going to say hey give us our coins and or give us your coins and we'll just like keep on sticking your coins into all of these projects that are offering rewards and like we're not actually going to be part of their communities because why should we yeah and so yeah like that's kind of the equilibrium that I think will happen which is part of why I'm comfortable kind of criticizing extreme liquidity farming as they're being unsustainable like there's some level of it which I think there's some level of liquidity farming which is fine there's some level of ear drops which is fine I mean I'm looking forward to per person air jobs as well um I'm even looking forward to sales with per person cash given I mean da icos could still be done or even just kind of things that bootstrap into being da ORS from day one are also interesting and this whole kind of like distribute coins directly to developers thing is interesting I mean handshake I kind of did did something like that with part of their distribution model and I know like even just the concept of developer free Minds in general is kind of that but like the problem is coming up with something in that direction that's good is that you need a governance mechanism in the governance mechanisms are hard we'll keep going we'll keep figuring out better things another big trend on defy the these last few months really is Bitcoin on ethereum it's been skyrocketing and at the moment of recording it's about 160 million dollars worth of bitcoin is on ethereum what do you think is the significance of this trend and where do you think it could go I am I think that there's just a lot of what is to like both bones and have the conveniences of ethereum D5 like these Bitcoin on ethereum projects satisfy that need I mean I think in the medium term you could even see it you know Bitcoin on ethereum getting into Roll-Ups and then we have like another Bitcoin a hyperscalable layer 2 protocol so I think it's a combination of like DFI demand and just Demand right especially kind of going further into the future for just some of ethereum's other conveniences so where will this go I don't know I mean at this point there's definitely demand there's definitely more and more people who are interested in the kind of straddling the line between the big win and ethereum like kind of ecosystems both in terms of communities as we've kind of seen on Twitter and other places and in terms of just the what they use right Bitcoin on ethereum one thing that could happen is that some of these people are just realized that like hey why you know piran ethereum they might not just use East as an asset um another thing that could happen is that there's just more and more demand for this and ethereum becomes kind of the primary place where Bitcoin activity happens um and then if that happens like one of the challenges and one of my worries with these Bridges is that basically the bridges are all right now trusted right so like the problem is that Bitcoin like the ethereum blockchain can run smart contracts to verify the Bitcoin blockchain but Bitcoin doesn't really have this kind of advanced smart contract capability and so you can't have Bitcoin addresses that verify the ethereum blockchain and like all you can have is either single signatures or multi-cigs and so the problem is that if you have one of these multi-cigs and you start having you know 557 000 Bitcoins inside one of these multisigs then there might be an incentive for that team to run away and that starts becoming more and more of a systemic risk right I guess one of the ways of thinking about this is that like a lot of Bitcoin people are very excited about liquid but liquid is ultimately a permission Consortium chain uh to use the Swanson term for it I just started just about using that term to poke people um it's the permission Consortium chain it's trusted and ultimately uh there is a committee of people who have the ability to basically take the coins out and uh pretty much take the coins for themselves and so if you're willing to take that trade-off well why not just instead take that trade off with the ethereum network um essentially because the ethereum network already has like so much stuff on it like that's where I see some of the kind of the psychology of this being then you know if it gets much bigger then you do have this systemic risk issue and then the question is well how does the systemic risk end up getting resolved right one [Music] um possibility of course is that we start moving to these kind of collateralized Bitcoin on these things like tbtc network but the problem with that is that if you start going to like 557 000 Bitcoin Bitcoins on ethereum then you need a huge amount amount of East like you need literally like half of all East basically being collateral for those coins another approach um that I don't think anyone's talked about before is that if like a substantial portion of Bitcoin ends up being on ethereum then what happens if Bitcoin miners start taking matters into their own hands and Bitcoin miners basically pre-commit and they say we're going to soft Fork away like we're going to invalidate any chain that includes transactions that illegally withdraw from these um from these multi-cigs without the permission of whoever actually owns those coins based on what happens on the ethereum side right so what what if Bitcoin miners start enforcing the rule that withdrawals from the bridge actually like are only valid if they're valid according to the rules in this in the contracts on the ethereum side and if you do that then like basically you would end up making a kind of the Bitcoin chain really tightly coupled to the ethereum chain and that would be if a really like if you start doing that then like even a lot of Bitcoin side security concerns just start start becoming much less and that would be just an interesting future to explore even theoretically but like this is all kind of going extreme in One Direction right the other direction of course is that this just all remains a fairly minor and kind of Niche interest of people and that you know there's just I don't know it keeps on it it keeps on being there and there's an activity keeps on happening but it's kind of the bulk of ethereum activity continues to be in other pastures I mean that's the more boring side and like don't let the facts that I spent you know five minutes talking about the exciting side in one minute talking about the boring side uh make you think that I think the exciting side has a five times higher chance of happening than the boring side yeah no it's not it's just five times more exciting right so you know there's a big chance that the the boring thing will just happening that's fine I mean these are all just experiments that have some probability that's like individually a low probability of becoming really interesting and big but kind of on the whole there's always something that ends up making a big difference let's switch to talking about how the crypto space has become kind of part of the geopolitical balance of power I would say in the last couple years and one of the pieces of news that involves ethereum is that China's blockchain service network is being built to interact with the public ethereum blockchain and I wondered what your feelings were about that it's being compared to how China's bite dance has The Tick Tock version which is the version used outside of China but as we've seen in the last few years China obviously has been perpetrating these human rights abuses you know with a concentration camps of the uyghurs it's been using its economic power to censor organizations like the NBA or the World Health Organization their concerns about data privacy and security for users of apps like Tick Tock is there any risk to users of ethereum who connect to BSN notes I definitely don't see how like the BSN would have the ability to kind of break the ethereum network and I'm unless this is all somehow you know crazy five four dimensional chess um a kind like a front for some kind of 51 attack but I see that chance as being very unlikely like the the somewhat more realistic concern of course is that you know there's nodes that are spy nodes and they'll like inform the Chinese government of what IP addresses are sending what transactions and like that's not just the Chinese government concern of course there's something there's a you know the U.S governments and like you don't even have to go into conspiracy theories there's chain analysis the company which is known to be working with us law enforcement and like it's in their economic interest to work with other people's law enforcement too ethereum users should definitely be operating under the assumption that kind of at Network level there's a lot of spy nodes going around you know if they want privacy they should basically combine blockchain level privacy with things like tornado.cash plot or some of the better things that are coming out with a network level privacy like you know if you have a transaction to send that needs privacy and just like hop on a VPN or whatever um or or doesn't have to be young could be tour could be any of this um any of these things no that that's definitely in like one aspect so that um people should definitely be kind of thinking about of course the other kind of geopolitical aspects of this is that you know blockchains are potentially a kind of the one in of environment where applications from one of all of these different places around the world can just have come onto the chain without and you know they're not going to just get immediately blocked by like whatever country doesn't have happens to not like them at that point in time that's interesting like I mean I definitely think that like the whole kind of Splinter net Trend that we're starting that we're seeing with um you know obviously it started with kind of the Chinese firewall for for a long time and then uh you know now these kind of potential concerns about the U.S Banning Tech talk and then India Banning 50 Chinese applications and then you know Russia doing in its thing in LTE a couple of people in the EU interested in doing their thing like I definitely think that that would kind of trend is very harmful and it's potentially like really risks uh and like destroying a lot of the kind of brightness and good that I think comes out of the internet um just as a a way for the world to come to uh to come together without that coming together having to be intermediated by you know all of these politicians with big guns and it may be uh you know and of course the original internet hang out in a lot of ways has just failed to live up to that promise right because especially because a lot of activity has just moved to these kind of centralized corporate platforms and the blockchain space just it has a chance of remaining the one part of the internet that's not that which is interesting and could have a lot of complicated consequences I mean back to China I have learned no idea like what people are going to end up using the like the BSN to kind of to build on on ethereum it's still like very early and not clear I mean like historically what what's like there hasn't even like been much kind of institutionally sanctioned publishing uh activity at all so far right to just because like and it's definitely been more kind of private chain oriented but in a lot of ways kind of the global mood of of the crypto space has shifted from uh private change to public change and so that's one of those places where you have to like pretty much either split off or adapt so we'll see and I I definitely hear like see that like the spaces and like entering dicey territory in some ways but you know at the same time this is literally it's a space um which was uh founded with um a basically a link to a news article that was criticizing a big a big Financial bailout so like you know if if you're afraid of diciness then what the hell did you think you're getting into um in that regard I actually wanted to ask also about some of these other phenomena that we're seeing with China's dcep it's digital Yuan rolling out and a lot of people say that this could be China's play to reduce the global Reliance on the US dollar meanwhile we've also got the upcoming Libra which through Facebook and all of the different Facebook platforms will have a larger Target user base than the population of China and then on top of that we've also got the Central Bank digital currencies from other countries that will probably be rolling out and meanwhile at the same time we've also got decentralized cryptocurrencies so when you kind of look at all of these different things that are either waiting in the wings or already coming on stage where do you think these Trends will go yeah so I think there's different ways to look at Central Bank additional currencies but I mean there's first of all kind of the macroeconomic ways of looking at them and just thinking about you know what are they like what they end up displacing commercial Banks um and all of those issues way to think about the look at it as um also just from like a private people interview which is something that a lot of people in the crypto space kind of care about and of course um you know nobody's expecting dcet to be anywhere remotely privacy preserving kind of in the way that encrypted people would would like and that's probably not not going to be true of uh cbdc's in general um but at the same time the other thing that's happening is basically this kind of change in like what the government's role is with respect to the monetary system and it's it feels almost like a push toward kind of government as International platform right so like this is something that like for example Estonia has been kind of trying to do for the last decade right you know you have your e-residency and you can kind of be an Estonian and you can be part of this Estonian e-community even if you've never once uh set foot and it's still any other country um and so they kind of talk excitedly about how you know this is the future of government as a platform and essential big digital currencies might end up being the first big kind of mainstreaming of government as a platform you could imagine you know things like DCP being used outside of China no I mean I think like China in particular will will have uh kind of more challenges doing that than a lot of other countries just because of you know all of the trust issues the politics and all of that but but at the same time like it's especially when you look into Central Bank digital currencies more broadly like it's something that you could imagine like governments creating digital currencies even specifically with the goal of being of them being used in a broader context right and so you could even imagine you know places like Switzerland saying hey we're going to create a digital coin and we're going to just create this bit um basically use this to expand our influence on the global stage um and this could end up being like a way for countries to make this kind of political power push um and in terms of the consequences of this I mean jurisdictional competition is definitely a great in a lot of ways and it could easily like give access um to people who live in like not very competent jurisdictions like basically access to access to Services provided by go by kind of international an old governments and international entities that are that are much kind of higher in competence uh so I'm much more confident not much more incompetent so you know it'll be a interesting to see I guess it'll be and then the other thing that'll be interesting to see is like the extents to which it's possible for these digital currencies to interoperate with public chains right so like could you have a decentralized exchange between a cbdc and ethereum and maybe you could right because ultimately the number of things you need to have to create a decentralized exchange is not that high you just need the ability for the ethereum side to be able to verify transactions that are happening on the other side and if you can do that then you can jump in exchange between the two systems even trust mostly right and I mean potentially you could even do it in a way that's like very privacy preserving and so like on the C on the cbdc side it just looks like another transaction and then there's part contracts on the ethereum side that kind of ensure that everything happens correctly so once you have decentralized exchanges between these systems then suddenly you have this kind of much more liquid kind of Global Financial environments which would also be interesting to see definitely one of the biggest black eyes for ethereum has been the indictment of head of Special Projects Virgil Griffith for allegedly helping the North Korean regime evade sanctions Virgil was one of the highest ranking people within the ethereum foundation and you knew he was going to go to North Korea beforehand and even urged him to enjoy himself while he was there did it not occur to you or anyone at the foundation that his going there might end up harming the foundation's reputation online I think especially given that he was just going as a as an individual and he was kind of very clear on that multiple points I guess you know the big thing is that you know the ethereum combination definitely has a kind of For Better or For Worse culture of respecting its members autonomy basically and I mean you could see that in a lot of ways I mean you can see that in you know Foundation developers arguing with each other on Twitter you can see that with a virtual you know independently deciding that it would be cool to check out North Koreans and you know seeing well you know what they're watching conferences are up to and and just people working on a lot of independent things so I think like that's a culture that's definitely done and a lot more good than uh than harm for the foundation and and I definitely don't think that there's that many people that make think you know ethereum Foundation bad because you know Virgil did this North Korea trip obviously that's been my own my own general impression right that it's the in terms of the news that's kind of happened once and been quite a down after that like I guess the con the in the long-term consequences of all of that whole trip in general just seem like okay you know he went once and then there was another conference and he is like obviously not able to go or not able to go and like I forgot it might have even been canceled because of the virus and then in the future realistically it's not gonna go to any of those either the things that they'll do with blockchains are the things that the oldie was watching I think regardless of um like you know Hoops who pops over for a visit for a couple of days um well but actually I wanted to ask so just beyond the foundation or what the government says about what virtual did I just want to ask from the perspective of ethereum's reputation as being you know the unicorns and rainbows cryptocurrency I mean doing anything with or for the what is the most brutal regime on the planet is as Alex clanced you know the human rights Foundation pointed out the least Cypher Punk thing anyone could do so just from that perspective alone did it ever occur to either you or anyone within ethereum that it might not be a good idea for virtual to do that and I think there there's definitely people who are opposed to it from the beginning and uh and or is definitely people who were fine with it from uh from the beginning I mean I guess oh no and this is definitely one of those questions where like it's it's hard to be certain um kind of after the fact and it's even be hard even harder to be a certain ahead of time like I definitely think that like this kind of view that you know because a country's government does something bad means that you know you have to kind of completely completely um kind of ostracize the country and you can't even take one trip to a blockchain conference like is it even necessarily clear that that's true I don't know um so I don't know I mean I don't I definitely don't kind of claim certainty that I was um that it was the right choice but and I think uh also saying that it just going out to a different surgery different jurisdictions and and um including the unfriend the unfriendly ones and kind of giving them my uh taking a chance to listen to them is kind of outright about saying I think like that opinion is also a bit a bit too extreme to be able to say confidently uh so you know I I don't think he listened to this podcast episode I did with a human rights activist and North Korean Defector Yen me park but I will send it to you because in it she talks about what it was like to live under that regime and um it's really truly just a brutal dictatorship and it's just a country that has um you know definitely I mean I'm definitely aware there's there's lots of very terrible things happening in North Korea like I'm not denying any of those things like all right well on a related note I wanted to ask also about Stephen nerioff A technologist and lawyer who helped ethereum with its crowd sale he was charged with extortion of a company that was trying to hold an Ico in late 2017 and between this and Virgil I wonder do you feel ethereum in general needs to do a better job of vetting the people who become involved with the foundation or other core members of the project Stephen is definitely a separate case like ethereum before about 2015 like there's there's definitely you know this founding team and the founding team has a lot of characters that today I definitely don't approve of and at the time I had no idea how to even like teleport good people good people from bad people um and pretty much everyone seemed reasonable to me and so like at the time I definitely didn't have the ability to kind of detect the problems in someone like Stephen nerioff and I think since then the ethereum foundation has gotten much better um since then like a lot of the kind of characters that that caused us a lot of damage at the beginning we've uh successfully distanced ourselves from and I think kind of more recently we have a team that in general are very happy with and and I'm definitely not willing to allow kind of Virgil to be put into into the bad character bucket just because he uh was uh you know more geopolitically open-minded than than a lot of other people like I'm I'm very happy to kind of burn reputation points to defending him to some extent there he is like no and that's definitely not the same thing as like what Stephen did which involves like huge amounts of like fraud and behaving and I think definitely variable like ways that that made women around very uncomfortable at the very least and all of those things like doing that you're that's a shitty character man and like I'm definitely happy I'm better at that I think the hearing Foundation is better at detecting him than it was at detecting a lot of other people Virgil's still a friend and I'm looking forward to him no longer being in um house I confinement soon over the years the ethereum foundation has also come under Fire for being unusually opaque which is seemingly at odds with the purported transparency of the blockchain world I I don't know if it doesn't seem to me the foundation has made much more effort to become more transparent there continues to be no org chart there are a lot of people involved in the foundation who have no title but have a lot of influence do you have plans to address this situation or are you comfortable with this I definitely would have to dispute the charge that the ethereum delegation has sort of increased incredibly opaque organization like I think I mean first of all there's all of these set of bi-weekly a kind of very frequent updates from each of the individual teams on you know the clients and like all the software and these visual projects that they're working on if there's all of these developer calls that are public uh I mean we very frequently publish information about what our finances are and regarding org charts I think I mean the challenge there is just the ethereum foundation's organization is definitely kind of not conventional in a lot of ways and so it's hard to communicate that right and it's like the formal chart is not even necessarily going to reflect the underlying reality of how people interact with each other like I think forget I remember like something like a year ago I think it was um I think it was virtual that published a kind of an actual chart of like basically who and who talks to whom in the ethereum foundation oh and base and that chart was basically just like automatically generated from the results of giving people surveys and that ended up just being a much more accurate description of like who does what an easier in validation than you know any kind of description of the formal structure could have been and was that made public hmm it's not I I don't remember that's I know this is something that I'll probably have to work up but and I guess like the larger point is that like there's a lot of people kind of complaining about lack of transparency but the thing that I don't see as much as just specific items of things that they want to be transparent about like in terms of just outputs of the ethereum foundation I feel like we try hard to be transparent and we publish blog post detailing our grants we publish blog posts detailing or like all the different project teams and what they've been working on manila published like fairly regularly what the ethereum foundations financial situation is and all of these things so if people could just say in kind of more specific and explicit terms like here is one thing that I don't know that I would like to know and that's definitely something that I think would definitely help me and help us a lot on Twitter Ann Connolly who's blockchain faculty at Singularity University asked are you concerned about the lack of diversity in ethereum particularly in development and she asked if that could also potentially impact the success of ethereum in the long run I definitely feel like we've tried hard to be a diver to be a diverse in a lot of ways and even just trying hard to like nurture communities in a lot of different countries is probably the the one biggest example and we know we have a lot of uh different kinds of people on kind of different layers of our team you know we have and a lot of people from the us and we have ayak who is um our executive director and she has been like kind of pushing in a different perspective and like focusing on inclusion and a lot of these other things like we've had some teams in Europe some teams in Asia some team are increasingly a couple of people based in India so on that Dimension there's definitely a lot of things that we've kind of tried to do uh I mean I'm sure that there's a kind of entire Community kind of communities and sub communities that we've just kind of completely failed to kind of Reach Out reach out to and integrate with and last year we've tried uh um just to get into the African Community more for example um but you know even still like there's there is a lot that we're missing I'm sure the challenge there is just that like any organizations in any community's eyes are ultimately kind of limited um and so like if you think there's groups of people that the ethereum ecosystem has been ignoring then that's something that I'm sure once again you know we'd be very kind of happy to hear about and it's something we always we always appreciate getting help in I mean there's also just a kind of currents that we have to deal with inter or just in terms of you know what kinds of people by default sort of get interested in crypto by themselves right like crypto tends to be if you know heavily kind of us focused heavily focused on like wealthier people in the um in the United States especially um you know like a very kind of very particular demographics that are kind of interested in like computer science and monetary Theory and all of these things so you know there are groups that have tried to kind of make ethereum relevant for other communities like there's you know all of these different exchanges in different countries that just try to support people you know using East as a way of moving money around I mean to give a more dicey example there's like the stuff that amine has done around sex workers um which has you know definitely far kind of far away from the kind of the kinds of communities that's crypto typically reaches out to you know even those sex worker communities definitely have a lot like a lot of problems around just getting discriminated against in a whole bunch of ways [Music] um yes it means all right so yeah and I guess we've been trying um we always welcome pointers on like who we can be uh who we're missing and who we can reach out to better so here we are five years after the launch of ethereum where would you like to see ethereum go in the next five years getting ethereum 2.0 done is really important um yeah hopefully before the end of the next five years I'm not getting ethereum to the point where like that list of applications I mentioned earlier and of the things that I'm excited about people using ethereum for um would actually is something that like lots and lots of people use ethereum for and where ethereum is something that is just a regular part of like people's lives in a lot of different communities and a lot of different contexts and isn't just about like something buying for ethereum people yeah and I think getting this technology to that point and just getting to the point where you you actually have like lots of people from in lots of places from around the world deriving value from ethereum yeah and then just getting both of those two things done I think would be a great place to be and do you have any general predictions about crypto that you want to make about the next five years hmm I don't know and I think well there's things that I can say so like one thing that I can say is that um and if the research side of the crypto space has definitely already made a kind of very sharp move away from being like hey you know let's uh like think in very abstract terms and let's figure out the just what things exist in the first place to just okay we know exactly what can be done and what can't be done let's keep just making improvements to the things that we know that we can do and like a lot of ethereum research has moved into that second category already um a lot of uh ethereum research um you know around things like shorting proof of stakes neural knowledge proofs like all of these things hasn't already moved into that kind of more incremental category and I think five years from now we'll be even further there like I think right now we're in kind of that transition from you know research abstract research to development and optimization and I think five years from now will be thoroughly in a kind of optimization phase I'm generally expecting that crypto will just kind of continue with the long march to just being more normal and being more just kind of a part of people's lives that everyone just expects to exist and that'll be a good change in a lot of ways great let's hope so because currently my friends think what I do is kind of weird but anyway so where can people learn more about you and ethereum um ethereum.org Perfect all right well thank you so much for coming on Unchained thank you
