not a dividend it's a tale of two funds now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet generally speaking air drops are kind of pointless anyways um unnamed trading firms who are very involved as the ultimate pump d5 protocols are the antidote to this problem all right hello everybody welcome to the chopping block every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day we've got a special guest list today let me start with intros so first we've got tom the d5 maven and master of memes next up there's robert the crypto connoisseur and captain of compound then we've got taroun the gigabrain and gran puba at gauntlet and our special guest today we've got balogi srinivasan the bitcoin brainiac and then myself i received the head height man of dragonfly um so i just want to say the the four of us are early stage investors in crypto but i want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice legal advice or for that matter political advice welcome to the show it's been a while since i wanted to get you on here but you told me the first time i invited you that uh you were busy writing a book and that you weren't you didn't want to deal with any media i i grant i think it was july 4th that you that you finally released the book right yeah that's right yep and and how's that experience been now coming up for air after getting a book out i know that that's probably a harrowing experience to to get all the way to the finish line how does it feel to be on the other side yeah no it's good well i mean the thing is i kind of uh i think of it as v1 um like i think of this like normally like an app is considered very dynamic and a book is considered static and it's shipped and so and i think there are multiple additions second edition and third edition etc so in the same way i think of this as v1 of this book app and i'm you know planning on shipping actually much more i may have 50 left to right frankly in some ways so um and you know as i was discussing with you taking a little bit of a distance from it then coming back and rereading it and thinking you know processing some of the early feedback and and so and so forth is very helpful uh because i'm gonna factor it into like a problem and solution kind of like reframe and add way more flesh on the bones of certain things but yeah it's good it's good i think i think the reception has been quite good i think network state if you just queried that in quotes network state on twitter has achieved mimetic inception so to speak i think you know like it's it's out there people are kind of thinking of this as a concept to note something that people have talked about for a long time so i think it's kind of right time right place you know this is honestly what i think all of this crazy d5 machinery will fund this is the actual like productive asset at the end of the day on the ground in the air or on the ground which is this will be the financing for startup societies and the way i kind of think about it is i think i mentioned this analogy to you on the phone you guys are seeing like a tornado like whirling through like the midwest and it takes like a little house and it goes whoosh and it rolls it up into the air you guys are seeing right so i i often think of crypto as a space that's building the economy you know wall street first main street last so if you imagine that tornado whirling in reverse right so you start in the air with the digital gold and then you're building out this whole d5 wall street financial speculation economy and now we're getting web3 infrastructure in the very last frame of the movie it goes flick like this with the wrist and with these billions and billions of dollars in the cloud goes like this and all the buildings build out on main street right because those are actually all just f of g of h of x for this massive composable infrastructure here the financing is there you can pull it in from around the world and it's just like a few bucks to just go and print it out in physical space right and that is actually kind of how i think about this entire machine that we've built can actually now be pointed at financing things in the physical world and uh you know it's not like uh you know people talk about municipal bonds it's like municipal equity you know you just go like this and then you build it okay as much where i can say but that's it's it's i mean the the book is full of a lot of futuristic concepts it's interesting though the the just because you and i have had conversations over the years so just right away background i used to work for biology back at 21 which became earn.com acquired by coinbase yeah five years ago six years ago there abouts five years ago that's right five years ago so i i i've i've heard so many of these concepts in kind of these early gestation of these ideas until they were formalized in in this book um in a way although you are obviously somebody who lives at the frontier um intellectually but writing a book is also a very old school way to express ideas so i have to ask like why did you write a book of all things of all the futuristic crazy things that you could have done why a book well i'm you know i'm pragmatic enough to make certain concessions to reality or what have you right and you know the thing is it's kind of like if you actually think about coinbase itself okay when coinbase first came out or or you know the centralized exchanges first came out i don't know if you guys remembered this but it was considered heresy to a have password reset rather than fully custodial everything b this is bitcoin why are you doing bank integration right c this is bitcoin why are you buying with dollars for fiat right and i think sometimes you have something which is uh like a bad hybrid of the old and the new like enterprise blockchain is like a bad hybrid which had all the bad aspects of enterprise and all the technical complexity social complexity of enterprise the technical complexity of blockchain just didn't work didn't have the incentives where i was trying to do blockchains without tokens but sometimes you have a good hybrid you know a fertile hybrid etc and and i kind of think that something like what i've done we'll see if it works but you know in some ways my my biggest concession to the old world is just having an amazon page for the book right that shows it's like actually like a marked thing it's like a time stamp release it's not just a continuous flow of tweets or people have to put together it's a shelling point for people to refer to and now that is actually like an installed base where i can just push more and more and more and more content into and maybe that widens and it's like 700 pages and you know all kinds of crazy stuff in there by the end okay but it's like okay just go to that and you'll download the whole thing right the 2021 2022 2023 2024 edition that can push 50 pages 100 pages of update every year right so kind of thinking of a book as like in the old school way as a shelling point that you can refer people to but having some hybrid with a new school concept being able to update it this is all kind of obvious stuff in a sense like even in the 2010 you know early 2010s or whatever when the ipad first came out al gore actually was kind of a pioneer in this space he he actually you know leaving aside you know whatever else i know people like don't like al gore but i respect him actually as a technologist because he did like interactive book stuff and so forth you go back and look at what he did with like in an inconvenient truth truth yeah yeah yeah he had he had kind of he was kind of doing some interesting stuff with like is like one of the first interactive textbook like things and so on it's actually still pretty fresh looking but at the time it was just a little too early it was ahead of its time um you know people weren't paying for content on the internet all that type stuff but i think it's actually worth revisiting that now that you know after covid we've had the digital flipping where the internet is first and the physical is now secondary go ahead i want to give somebody else a mic so go i'll go on you know all right i'll ask the first question here so based on that model you just explained you know one of the use cases i can see is you could possess an nft that gives you access to all of the current editions that come out and you could you know sell or transfer the nft and there could be you know some market for it but like you know you could basically identify the ownership of the rights to all future editions in some like very crypto native way have you thought about you know alternate models that go off of the web two rails and come on to web three rails you know can people pay you know for the book and crypto you know like and how do you track that ownership and those rights is it just amazon as a platform you know what what's going through your head um great question so so we did a issue like commemorative nft for the book right and that's kind of like a marker right like basically you pay 10 bucks for the book and we issue i think a pretty cool nft we did that through openc and so on but that was not meant to actually be a speculative asset and uh i mean it maybe it could be or whatever but it was it was actually it was not meant to be that was kind of just meant to be a marker i am maybe let me let me give a thought that i'm having which is that writing a book in some sense so a lot of people in crypto are already familiar with your ideas you know you you make the rounds obviously you're very you're very well known thinker within the world of crypto in a way it it occurs it seems to me like writing a book it's almost like you know uh somebody who wrote one of the consensus protocols for somebody who worked on casper and decided to write up an academic paper and submit it to an academic journal right in a way it's kind of crossing a chasm to a different kind of a different kind of audience and a different kind of status game that's very different from the one that gets played in you know the ethereum researching community and so in that way it's like look if you want to make your ideas legible to a broader audience outside of crypto and the people who are already fairly disposed to agree with you then you need to make them legible in a format like a book amazon page you know clean uh table of contents and blah blah blah because otherwise you're you're speaking to people who already broadly agree with you that's definitely part of it and but i think robert's question was on crypto native mechanisms but basically yeah haseeb i think um i mean the other thing is also the networks.com boom you can just remember that right that is memorable that fits in fits in the head like you know i can't read you know all of somebody's tweets if you point me at their twitter i can read their most recent things and they're not going to recapitulate everything that they said there right and so this is sort of like the v3 like you know v1 is everybody writes books and they're disaggregated v2 is they have these tweets and you know they get uploaded or commented on and you have like these kind of distilled nuggets and the v3 is a rebundling and actually something i think is underrated that we're going to see a lot of is uh the rebundling of social content you know sort of like uh you know uh you go from albums to mp3s to spotify playlists the rebundling actually does add value you can see some examples of this for example with niv drawers calendar the shrug calendar i'm not sure if you guys have seen that right is just taking tweets which are public and free but putting them back together in a new and interesting way actually does add value many establishment periodicals as you know a lot of political coverage is effectively you know just like you know sports sports articles are recycles of the box score and financial articles or recycles of the ticker symbols many political articles are just wrappers around tweets right and so the concept of kind of taking social content and then re-aggregating an interesting way i actually think we'll see much more of especially as the back ends open up with like crypto social media but actually actually you know robert to answer your question i think um and maybe you know this is maybe this is like the the next cycle or whatever of crypto i have always only been interested in crypto and even software as a tool to like advance us right you know basically to to get to you know the uh the the promised land of life extension and of you know advanced technology stuff there's folks who love the charts and they love the you know the finance aspect of it and so on and i'm fine with that but i i wanted to actually write this and then add crypto things if and when it made sense to help people do things like you know ens login for the book app of subsequent versions so you can save your space or there's things like that that will do but i didn't want to start with having financial things driving it i wanted to put them in if and when it made sense and again i'm not against other people who love that stuff right but i think of this very much as like a horse as opposed to or an engine as opposed to like the destination of the car or whatever you know okay go ahead i had one quick question related to that so the definition of the book is actually sort of this long compound sentence and and also you also you reference the fact that britannica also does the same you know kind of long compound sentence that was kind of funny uh so of those kind of each clause you know i guess there's two that are directly related crypto right the integrated cryptocurrency and this notion of consensual government limited by social smart contract what actually tarun before before we get to that question can you just read that entire definition well read the short one first because i actually have the informal sentence read the informal sentence so otherwise it seems like i'm totally unreasonable see at the top yeah uh okay yeah yeah a network state is a highly aligned online community with capacity for collective action that crowdfunds territory around the world and eventually gains diplomatic recognition from pre-existing it's a long sentence but it's not it parses and you it's like a not you know every adjective there let me just kind of analyze that and the reason is um you know you guys are all tweeters and so you know that people will pick over every you know syllable or whatever you know i know it's a syllable but whatever uh so a network state is a highly aligned online community as opposed to typical online communities that have no alignment okay or very minimal line with a capacity for collective action again that's a very high bar right yeah like the you know if you if you just go and most doubts most discords it's like herding cats they're there for the air drops and stuff there's capacity for individual like gain that's what they care about but not for collective action and sacrifice working towards something one way i think about if you think about twitter itself imagine an nba game where every player just saw their own score but there was no team score right how many dunks how many points whatever but there was no literally the sum was not shown right that's what twitter is where everybody has their own stats right they have their own followers or likes or blah blah blah but what they do not have is any team score for their ostensible faction which means that you have soap opera like betrayals and all kinds of stupid stuff happening where people who think they're actually you know perhaps they made themselves think they're advancing some ideological cause but you know like the tribalism is it's not it's in a very primitive way it's not like the organized and systematic um you know quote tribalism of an actual team right where there's boundaries to the team there's hierarchy there's organization there's division of labor it is the sort of animalistic tribalism of like an informal group right it's not like a scalable sort of thing it's not a it's not a group that goes out to win right that's what i mean a capacity for collective action like a startup is just completely different from like a group of randos on twitter then the crowdfunds territory around the world why do i include that well the physicality look i'm a huge digital person i do think remote first etc but one of the concepts i talk about in the book you know the least popular word in the world but which i think is one of the most important words in the world you know what that is re-centralization okay why is recentralization ridiculously unpopular as a word because both centralization and decentralization proponents don't like it in different ways okay why the centralization ones will be like what do you mean you know new boss same as the old pause and so will the decentralization points they'll both say that that's actually bad right but if you actually look at it uh recentralization what that would mean is consensual recentralization in the same way that you go album to mp3 to playlist there's many more analogies that are like that right you have newspaper you break it out into articles you rebundle into a twitter feed when you actually look at what human behavior is they want that legibility they want the discoverability they want some order reimposed on the chaos but that initial order is actually not suitable for them so you break and then you reassemble and these are like historical cycles that because the internet we're seeing happen much faster and the thing is the reason i say recentralization is an important word is that aspect of crowdfunding territory around the world we have now gone remote first right all of us i don't even know where your locations are but it's probably not you know the same rooms probably five different cities right this is actually kind of our community okay but um we could take pieces of this social graph and then actually have them you know you could have crypto towns and villages we have the resources now as a community to start doing this and now everybody's got something in common when you walk down the street you know that person right wow who could imagine what a concept right like in an apartment building imagine that you actually knew the person who was like 30 feet this way and 30 feet that way and they weren't like a total cipher or you know anonymous person to you like the crowdfunding of a territory around the world is like the one of the apotheosis of the capacity for collective action because you're not just upvoting something at the same time you're crowdfunding something and you're collectively moving there okay and the last bit eventually gains diplomatic recognition of pre-existing states so just like you know clayton christensen had this term disruptive innovation and that got taken by people and they used it in a way that you know he didn't want he wanted submission be like a low end innovation that comes in and then it kind of goes to the high end but people just use it as like something that comes in and just wins or whatever right necessarily it's how words work if you want the specific definition of a network state it's one that has diplomatic recognition by this definition nothing is yet a network state in this definition the reason i use that is you might say why would you know some crypto person who's all you know like independent blah blah blah why would you want diplomatic recognition well i argue it's actually very similar to the reason that you want to be able to trade cryptocurrency for fiat currency it is almost exactly the same in fact it is the crypto country fiat country interface okay diplomatic recognition is you've generated these new crypto countries for the old system to sort of acknowledge their legitimate is diplomatic recognition once you have that actually lots of things become possible deals become possible other things but another way of thinking about it is i know it's a funny way of putting it but i put it in the book this way diplomatic recognition is a non-binding commitment to not invade okay for example like the u.s diplomatically recognized iraq that's why i say it's a non-binding commitment to not invade it did invade okay right but it's an international incident if you know like you go and quote invade a sovereign country russia invades ukraine it's an international incident right by contrast if it's just a bunch of guys on you know sea land or liberland which is not diplomatically recognized by anybody that is not a sovereign and no other government will care it is not a diplomatic incident it's a bunch of delusional people on a barge or whatever whatever right so their diplomatic defense is actually very low and it's not just about you and what army it's about you and what diplomacy it's you and what nation right you and one country backing you a lot of libertarian types get this wrong and so just to say the reason that this definition is long that lengthy one is meant to sort of preemptively address many different kinds of failure modes things that people have tried and failed things that people will throw at you and be like haha you're so impractical you didn't think of this didn't you you know and all these different you know things that like the the folks will throw that's why the definition the second definition is long okay go ahead it's yours let me let me try to push up against some of the some of the boundaries in this in this kind of core thesis you have okay so one of the things that you mentioned so i'll just pick pieces of the of the long version right so network status social network moral innovation a sense of national consciousness a recognized founder capacity for collective action an integrated cryptocurrency a consensual government limited by social smart contract an in-person level of civility yes i i'm jumping around jumping around um i think most crypto people if you just take the description thus far they will nod their heads and say oh yeah yeah this sounds a lot like crypto like i totally all these things are clicking in my head um and then you say uh an archipelago of crowdfunded physical territories and this this is one of the central concepts in the network state that differentiates it from a lot of the people who talk about the the radical concepts within crypto that enable different kinds of governance and blah blah so i guess i guess the first way to push up against this concept is why why is it not enough to have a community that is large potent ideologically aligned and is still potentially in a position to present to nation states or to a nation state as a voting bloc as a very strongly aligned group of people why do you need to go and you know if i compare for example um like the democratic party as an institution which is very powerful compared to like you know the panama one of them seems much more much more powerful to me than the other although one of them is is diplomatically recognized has land et cetera um so how how do you think about that why do you think there's such an important state transition that you need diplomatic recognition and crowdsourced land well so the derek airport is interesting example because it does control territory arguably right there it can repaint streets like it can you know there are like blue governors and stuff they can do executive orders you know there's there's more contestation within the u.s state capacity has declined in many ways but there certainly are times you know when political parties can animate and control state controlled territory and whatnot but picture is worth a thousand words and so if you zoom in on this right you know i intentionally did a few different things with this basically it's black and white it is a lo-fi mock-up well i'll just okay there we go good so this is basically a what i call the census census dashboard of a network state now do you guys know i mentioned this in the book but maybe you're aware of it or not do you know the census is actually called out specifically as something to do in the u.s constitution the post office in the constitution the census is in the constitution the thing about this visual here is you're seeing lots of nodes around the world they are connected together via the internet and their cumulative population and income in real estate is quite substantial and here's the thing you can now start benchmarking something like this versus what we typically think of as a state right you think of the population of a country you think of its annual tax revenue and you think of its physical footprint even if it's a distributed state i might say a decentralized state okay it is still got many of the aspects that we think of as a state and if you actually go to for example the map of indonesia so to be clear biology what you're picturing here is almost like the predecessor to a network state where right now you basically have the network yeah this is the network archipelago without the physical land yeah this is network archipelago right so and just like an archipelago like is an island kind of thing okay so this is a map of southeast asia okay and uh you can see there's individual i mean they're all blue or whatever but if you zoom in like indonesia for example if you looked at it from space without knowing where the ethnic groups are you would not be able to guess the boundaries of indonesia okay um like you know like look at brene or look at uh you know malaysia like the boundaries of it there's like national boundaries you see that boundary on like uh the large island in the middle there indonesia is like a bunch of little pieces of land separated by ocean right what if there were a little piece of land separated by internet that's the concept of the network archipelago but at that point still you know that people people are landowners in their respective states but they don't have any monopoly over violence which is one of the you know what one of the prototypical features of actually having a stage sure everybody in the network in the network archipelago is still subject to the laws of the country they're in they might have collective bargaining power as a group much like i would argue like like a another you know kind of a civil society institution but it's a civil society institution that effectively is multinational yeah so the thing is that basically um i think there's many many levels you can get to and i actually identify four waypoints okay so those are um startup society network union network archipelago network state okay um strap society is just you're just one person with a dream okay it's like sitting at the laptop cracking his knuckles one person but you have ambitions of something bigger okay um a network union is a the second step that's a digital collective capable of collective action right it is uh it's like a highly disciplined dao for example but it's actually something that thinks of itself just even saying that they've got a sense of national consciousness or this sense of collective you knowness they don't have to initially become a state just like not every small business has to go public or what have you many of them in fact will just stay as network unions guilds would be like this many nft communities you can think of as being like this okay i think many pre-existing uh subreddits could eventually become network union-like and i think the interface will determine um like the kinds of things network union can do but it's collective action with the treasury you can at a minimum think of it as a facebook group with a cryptocurrency linked together and it's like a serious online community it doesn't just do upvotes and stuff it does collective actions it has money et cetera okay so the network union is a huge step above a simple facebook group because you can do things together right you can find somebody a job you can crowdfund their business you can um you know like promote their new project blah blah all those things you can do okay then step three network archipelago now you're crowdfunding territory okay and importantly by the way and i include examples of this in the book as you sort of go up the ladder here there's some kinds of collective societies that you can do with a purely digital only approach okay um for example uh i mentioned like the cancel proof culture okay if you say the problem with society and everybody has a concept of the problem society i call this the one commandment what your differentiation is from society at large if your visual of the problem with society is people get canceled if that's the single biggest problem in your view to solve you could build a network union that is for example a guild of let's say it's a graphic designers okay and uh this guild 99 of the time they're just sharing figma files they're talking with each other you know tricks of the trade blah blah one percent of the time they're getting somebody there is is getting hit online they pop in they invoke article five an attack on one is an attack on all you know that's a nato you know kind of thing i think it's article five right basically uh they invoke that attack on one is attacking all and this beehive of all the designers comes out and is posting memes you know how dare you you know siv roman is some right like uh you know this is a roman citizen how dare you attack them and that that's just a value proposition right there the cancellation insurance in a sense is built into the community kind of spirit you're a dues-paying member of this guild it will defend you and there's probably also by the way some rule of law around this right when you come in or that person comes in and says they've been attacked right then there's some education process oh did you strike first right was it like you say some stupid slur for no reason blah blah blah right and you have actually some like written law as to what the penalty is crucially by the way if somebody said a stupid slur then maybe the penalty is okay you have to go and give 100 bucks it's not the ruination of their life forever and ever and so you can figure out what the what the scale of it is if it's like 15 years ago and it's being brought to the present day as if it's this thing right so that community that digital network union starts to re-establish law written law as opposed to an emotional lord of the fly style reaction where everything is based on the passions of the mob at that time versus being like okay did they do x then i look at the law and it says if x then why we agreed on it in the abstract it's rule of law not just how much do we dislike or like this person at this time right that's what rule of law means it means you take away the passions of the mob and you actually put that into some kind of code right so a network union actually already can do a lot of interesting things just a purely digital thing but why do you need the physical well there's a lot of things i mean we're still physical creatures right so i mentioned for example keto kosher as one example and i've got like dozens dozens of more examples you know i mentioned digital sabbath uh just to go through a few these keto kosher would be uh network union that decides we want to basically try to eliminate sugar from the diet you know what you can do all kinds of will power type stuff atomic habits type stuff online but you know it's actually way easier you know you just want to make one decision to like move to a community okay and then the healthy living is just taken for care for you right you might have to actually literally drive a few miles to get out of that community and go back into the den of iniquity where you know high fructose corn syrup is mixed with everything okay once you actually have some physical boundaries in this example okay have you guys seen the obesity gift by the way the best epidemic gift no okay most people haven't actually seen this i realized and once you see this you're like okay actually this is like a way more serious problem than than people even realized okay so here you go wait one one one quick question actually it you know what you described actually reminds me a lot of like how the freemasons sort of like you know if they were in the internet are you saying like the freemasons would be sort of the network union if we i i was actually gonna say that the catholic church is probably the first network state i was actually gonna ask like i remember the keto kosher thing from the book and you sort of talk about the fact that like you know the most successful um you know early us colonies were the religious ones not the ones that were you know founded for just you know purely merchantile reasons i'm curious like what you think the first network state is going to be because a lot of the stuff like i agree you know there's a fan base around it there's a community but like people are not so high affinity so fervent about it right versus maybe something like religion or your ethnicity which tends to be kind of where nation states come from like like what do you think is the thing that people are going to be so passionate about as to go through all this energy upgrade their lives to like start this start this thing so the reason i mentioned keto is it actually is a pretty big thing i mean like our keto like the how many product without looking how many people do you think are in our keto like the reddit subreddit for keto 10 million 5 million 3.2 million people okay all right right order medicine that's kind of a lot of people yeah i mean definitely popular but like the the the level of passion around is what i'm curious about right like roblox is huge but yeah so let me let me i want to argue this point with you actually so first of all look at this gif right i don't know if you guys have ever seen this gif this is the fattening of america and actually the camera ends in like 2013 okay where it's already like this creeping epidemic and you know how much fatter people have gotten like since then it's like insane okay people actually think this might be partially like a virus or some pathogen just like ulcers were caused by h pylori as sort of a cryptic pathogen for a long time and maybe that's contributing to obesity or something is where the the diet is adding to it or it's um you know pallatable snack food who knows point is people are really getting fat in the us and around the world this is like a big thing and that's upstream of diabetes and that's upstream of you know covered mortality and blah blah blah all these things you know aesthetics of course all those things are kind of just downstream of being a fatso right and i know because i was a fatso just like a few years ago or whatever and you know like like i see been hitting the gym or whatever you know recently right the uh my point is basically that uh something like keto is actually totalizing why every single meal you need to be keto every single thing you put in your mouth has to be keto right it is actually something which passes sergey brin's toothbrush test of you need to use it twice a day moreover it's not just something you need to use to estate you need the community to support you because unless you are hunting and gathering everything yourself you have to spend enormous effort does this have sugar in it does this have sugar in it what you'd like to do is get collective benefit and essentially enforce a boundary around that community where the snack wells are stopped at the door you know like those things are interdicted it's literally like border control you know customs takes care of it for you that's scalable right so i actually picked that for a reason because it's actually something where if you think about a big part of religion on a practical daily basis it's dietary prohibitions you can't drink alcohol kosher itself is obviously a religious thing and so and so forth right and crucially you know if you look at religion it's down and to the right many forms of traditional religion you know what's up in to the right is the are keto community so all of those things kind of you know net into something like this these kinds of internet movements that i think would be totalizing and then once you get that one commandment of like you know sugar bad keto good you actually get derivations do you guys know what a cgm is continuous glucose monitor yeah my wife has one um so continuous glucose monitors basically it's one of these patches generally that you put on your body and um you can like i think it's like bluetooth uh you just scan it and then you can uh basically read your glucose levels throughout the day so something generally the diabetics historically have used but now increasingly healthy people are just like i want to know my glucose levels all day long and so you can import them into apps you can analyze them and so you know people people get obsessed and it's much better than pricking your finger that's right many times that's right that's exactly right and and so the key thing about this the reason i think this is a you know how they're saying i think it's dixon saying like what nerds do on the weekend everybody else will do in 10 years right nerds are working on you know tech people palm pilots and then 10 years later everybody had an iphone 20 years later everybody in the world has a smartphone right so the cgm is really important because we know more about what's going on on the other side of the world in budapest or in bangalore than what's going in our own bodies okay like all of this machine learning type stuff should be trained on the most important like measurements like the dashboard that you should be looking at every time you get up in the morning is that some stupid news article on something of no consequence to you but like what are your readouts right like that's actually the news you can use that's the most important stuff you care most about that nobody else cares about that as much as you do right this is the same way that your corporate dashboard this is a broader concept but i think the morning newspaper will be is being replaced by the morning dashboard that's actually like the news is the worst thing you should be looking at in the morning because that's like everybody what everybody else cares about the dashboard is what you care about you are driving it is the dashboard your company is it's on portfolio it's every all the things which have leverage next time and the most important of which is your body right so the cgm i think is a piece of that where it's taking metrics off of you and then it's putting them there and now you're actually seeing it you're tracking it across time why do i mention this because it's downstream of that keto premise right once you say that carbs bad then you get to cgm good then you get to everybody universal cgm good then you get to oh now we can collect stats across the community and so on and so forth and this is an example of how like a moral innovation when you actually when it goes to 100 percent a derivation from it goes 200 a derivative of derivation goes to 100 and so on and you start actually building the technology to fit that moral innovation right rather than being idiosyncratic if you actually go back into history this is very common the the relationship between moral progress and technological progress uh you know for example once you can say that uh you know the the earth goes around the sun rather than vice versa you can get better star charts and eventually you can get satellites okay once you can say that oh actually uh man and monkeys have a common ancestor that opens up in the fullness of time evolutionary genetics and speaking speaking of moral progress because i think that's also it's also a very important vector in this book that we haven't talked about so yes the network state is is partially about a prediction about the way in which the future will unfurl and the way that different kinds of states will emerge um but it's also advocacy in some sense and so part a big part of the book is devoted toward your i think the way vitalik describes it is your mega politics which is a the the the encapsulation is this tripartite um chart that you have of nyt ccp ccp btc um describe for us briefly what is this tri i don't know what you call it the the trilemma between nyt cc tripolar triangle triple triangle and and incorporating to that why is it not just that the network states will exist but why it is good that network states will exist just to put a bow on your previous thing you asked why physical i'll just go to this just uh you ask why physical certain kinds of societal innovations can only be implemented physically and then certain more kinds can only be implemented if you have legal or diplomatic recognition so that's why physical so rather than remaining fully digital okay to come to this basically as i mentioned at the beginning i'm going to factor this a little bit more into problem and solution right and like the book meaning i want to factor it like this where the problem is the state of the world as i see it is we are headed for what i call american anarchy and chinese control and by american anarchy what i think is going to happen and what i sort of foresee and i put a bunch of evidence in the book i literally this is one of the things where i want to do the the next version where i have like 200 references and all kinds of graphs and charts on this particular thing okay but if you just bear with me i kind of think that so i have to be political here because it's just going to be you know i mentioned this book you just talked about large humans you have to be political okay it's in the book so if you think about what happened with let's say occupy wall street in the early 2010s people might have thought that the big left movement was going to be economic that was actually kind of like a head fake and actually it turned out to be cultural with what people now call bookness it's uh you know it's cancellation and me too blm all this type of stuff okay and with the right if you looked at the last several years you might think that the big right movement was going to be like uh culturally nationalist and so on i'm not saying there's no that's zero but i actually think that's going to be in the fullness of time ahead fake and the true energy is going to be economic right in the sense of ultra bitcoin maximalism crypto anarchy etc okay and the reason for this is that uh so that head fake of you know faking economic left and actually going cultural left faking cultural right and actually going economic right i think that's an important thing where that last step economic right the way i sort of think about it is you can look in lots and lots of like republican primaries and so on you start to see them signaling maximalism right bitcoin maximalism why because if like wokeness is sort of like ultra democracy maximalism is like ultra capitalism in a sense and then well capital is like wokeness plus a form of capitalism and bitcoin maximalism is like capitalism plus with the pleb thing it's like a form of ultra democracy right so both them are these weird just to explain what i mean the wokeness is like you know it's supposed to appeal to large movements of people then it captures institutions that has huge amounts of money so it's like this democracy plus capitalism fusion bitcoin maximum obviously started with a new form of capital bitcoin itself but now recently with a whole sort of pleb ideology it is uh if you know people who are watching this may know what that is but it's like essentially though it's usually not very phrased very explicitly all who hold bitcoin are equal and because bitcoin is the best they are better than all who do not hold bitcoin right that's roughly the pleb ideology you're not supposed to ask how much bitcoin somebody had how early they were all of that you know now you're born again when you buy btc and you have even 100 bucks and you yell at people online you're a pleb you're a maximalist okay now the thing about this is if you go and look at it people use terms like immaculate conception you know for for talking about like the the the blockchain they call it the genesis block you know satoshi is like sort of treated like this jesus there's there's in the same way that people have talked about wokeness as being like a christian influence type of thing tom hollins talked about this noah smith yarvin was one of the earliest you know actually uh john mcwhorter has a whole book on this blah blah a lot of people have talked about that where you have aspects of like original sin and uh you know we're you know we'll all be damned if we if we do this the elect all these kinds of premises there's aspects of christianity that have gone to maximalism you know you see people for example they tweet the scene of jesus throwing the money changers out of the temple damn [ __ ] coiners you know throw them out right and so bits and pieces of this sort of christian eschatology have sort of split and made their ways into wokeness and maximalism and like the republican party doesn't have that the democrat party actually those are both actually downstream of these these forces right these are forces that are like a fusion of democracy and capitalism plus pieces of christianity that are lying around you know christianity itself people don't believe in it anymore but it's like you know they're saying the god-shaped hole right the the ruins of christianity that are current western civilization those myths stay around and they still have some purchase on people and they get reanimated in these forms okay and i do think that maximalist versus woke is going to be like the new communist versus nazi except this time it's the left that's racially obsessed and the right that's economically obsessed and that conflict communist versus nazi was stalingrad in the 20th century that was the most insane conflict of the early 20th century and you saw that building over years decades that was just a smash and like that kind of determined the outcome in many ways of you know world war ii that was like the climactic conflict right i do think something like that is coming i don't know exactly what form that takes i do think these are the two forces i think it probably happens sometime around the time the u.s government is basically broke and it's printed the money and it's coming for people's money and so it's the conflict between the like totally unstoppable force of the us government and the irresistible object of bitcoin and maximalism and i can sort of see that coming like that's this this sort of god or damarun this ragnarok this armageddon whatever you want to call it i i do see that coming so it it sounds like you're you're framing sure so you're framing you're framing the power of basically bitcoin maximalism i know that you are not a bitcoin maximalist and i don't think you're particularly sympathetic to bitcoin maximalism what is the middle way that you are advocating that is not either you know either of these polls right so so so there's a there's actually ac it's really like i think of there's being three polls right so like this is like a fourth so you know the thing is that quote as a person of color and so there's aspects of wokeness that of course you want equal treatment under the law that's why it's actually a very complicated thing to discuss it because there's a whole continuum of folks who have good intentions all the way over here right and then it gets to this insane point of like just you know all the stuff we see online but but there's a there's a kernel of like yeah of course you want equal treatment under the law duh right like that's you know that's just you know common sense and you know civil liberties and so on and so forth but it gets distorted and inverted on the end over here into something that's like a you know there's a huge difference between a for example an economic progressive and a communist between a conservative and a nazi between a a liberal and awoke and between a libertarian and a maximalist right once once you get to that corner things that were previously premises like tolerance for example get inverted and turn into intolerance right or you go like in the libertarian corner and um you know non-aggression principle everybody can transact oh actually let's stick the sec on these quote pointers or whatever right it starts to be something where the ideology gets curled and distorted on itself and you know what people have talked about is so-called horseshoe theory you know the political compass and biology because this is a crypto show try to point out the overlap of the political compass and crypto well we are we are now a crypto politics crossover show to so you know well that's the thing is the problem is like you may not be interested in politics but politics is interested in you very true um and you know i think it's lenin saying right so this is the political compass okay and uh there is um a post here that she thought was actually pretty good very roughly speaking top left communist top right uh nazi or nationalist um or really you actually could argue top middle is not see top right is like pinochet okay but let's say top left communist top middle nazi top right you know like like a pinochet bottom left woke bottom right crypto anarchist or maximalist i'm talking about the corners by the way not not the center the very corners okay and what you kind of get is you have pathologies that when you push each to the corner you get a pathology for example um top right take for example slavery the top right slavery slavery top left communism is slavery okay lower left drug addiction is slavery lower right debt is slavery okay you can actually have bad versions of things where there's you know like drug addiction you're you're no longer yourself you're kind of enslaved to this drug dealer or what have you in when you go into the total liberty of the lower left you can actually end up in a bad place when you go to the communism the workers paradise of the upper left well you know the the gulag the white sea labor canal that wasn't the workers paradise they weren't getting any days off okay so communism ends with slavery and of course debt you can you know do voluntary economic interactions between people and in something that's very similar to like debt slavery right and so and then of course the top right is the obvious one point is that there's like pathological cases where if you take some principle to its extremes you end up in this anti-human bad spot you go off the map right and one thing that people have conceptualized a lot you know top left communist top right nazi and people say okay those loop together and they become the same thing and in fact there's this great movie called the soviet story okay which actually shows lots of communist and nazi propaganda you know like uh posters and how they actually really resembled each other why because they were actually recruiting from the same population you know hitler's whole thing was that he wasn't just a nationalist he was a national socialist he had like crossover appeal and tried to pull some of the disaffected folks you know the national socialist german workers party he devoted two of the four words to that and the soviets you know under stalin went to like soviet nationalism they appealed to the right and they weren't just communists they were like a fusion of leftism and rightism okay so propaganda posters all this type of stuff look very similar and so that's why people talk about so-called horseshoe theory where the far left and far right become the same but there are new things in the world and we're so uh vaccinated against especially nazism and fascism but also communism to some extent that what happens is you get a push in the other direction right it's like you know the gerardian founding murder you've got these total black holes that nobody wants to be a nazi or a communist and so well those are bad so what's good the total opposite of that right the lower left corner is good it's antifa because it's not fascist and the lower right corner you're probably seeing more and more folks call themselves like um like communism disrespecter or something like that on twitter why because who would be a communist even the lower left you know some of them will actually put a hammer and sickle but most of them don't really really endorse the gulag okay so now what happens there's actually a different kind of crossover and that is not totalitarianism it is anarchy okay the lower left and lower right where do they cross over well the bulk says everyone is equal we are all equal and the maximus will say you ain't the boss of me and you put those together and even though those vectors you know they've obviously got a left and a right flavor to them you know vectors can cancel on some axes and some on other axes and so these ideological vectors while they cancel in some ways they sum on one axis and that axis is anarchy it is the absence of legitimate leaders is absence of legitimate hierarchies it is america is both institutionally racist and it's irredeemably leftist right it's the deep state and it is the racist state blah blah and so you sum that up and what people can quote shake hands on is the complete illegitimacy of all institutions and that leads you to american anarchy that's the energy that i see unfortunately okay let me pause there go ahead so okay actually it's a good time to pause because we're we are running up on time and there is more that i want to talk about so let's so let's let's take that well hold on hold on let's let's take that as a a broad preview of the book i would strongly recommend whether or not you agree with the vision that biology presents it's one that you need to grapple with especially if you're in this industry so what is the best way for people to find read consume the network state and what's coming up for the book sure so find where you consume go to thenetworkstate.com um go and subscribe there uh you will get notified as new versions and stuff come out or you can just go and refresh the site um we're gonna do a hardcover gonna do an audible and uh you know like i may be wrong on all of my stuff by the way of course i could be wrong and one of the things i actually want to point out take pains to point out is you do not need to agree with me on all or even most or any of this you don't need to agree with me on problem to agree on solution for example with um like i think of network states and startup societies as a response to the chaos i see coming in america and the crackdown i see coming in china okay i see both of these as bad things that are coming that will justify themselves with reference to each other okay the disorder of america will be justified with well at least we aren't china and china's massive digital totalitarianism crackdown that i see coming which is i mean obvious uh you know but like it's actually becoming somewhere people are actually leaving china now because of it right that crackdown is um something that will be justified as well at least we aren't anarchic like where america is okay that's a really terrible vice to be put in where that's the you know assumed you know you must be a or b and so that other option of uh you know what is the other option the recentralized center right people who actually group together with others of like mind where you can't just listen to a politician and just buy into what they're saying because their campaign promises are non-binding a startup society or network state you can see how those campaign promises manifest in reality you can tour it you can go there you can see if it's amenable if it's worth the subscription and if you don't like it you can leave and so it's disciplined by exit and by pragmatism okay and that i think is you know people becoming the change they want to see because people will disagree with this anarchy and control thing in many different and incompatible ways but we can basically you know embrace what i think of as polystatism not just polynomial or polytheism okay so answer is go to the networks.com get that we will have an audible we'll have a hardcover we'll have more stuff all free go check it out oh by the way it is despite giving it away all free do you see my tweet on this where uh like uh it's a wall street journal bestseller even despite giving it away all free i laughed when i saw that because i hadn't actually checked um and the nyt bestseller list by the way is fake do you know you guys know that the nyt bestsellers is fake it's editorial content the wall street journal one is actually the one that's based on actual stats anyway go ahead okay good to know um so one of so okay we are technically a crypto show and so i want to try to bring it back to crypto in the end so you are well known as being one of the let's say one of the elder statesmen of the crypto community uh it's been it's been well it's been um a very interesting four years you've been through an entire cycle now and you've seen we've all seen an enormous amount of folly a lot of you know irrational exuberance that has kind of fallen fallen back to reality um but also a lot of experiments around governance some some in the spirit of coming because some of the radical ideas that you that you describe in the network state and most of them have not succeeded right even things like prediction markets even things like um the idea of creating coins that represent some kind of claim over some smaller group or some smaller nation those those have largely failed to hold hold roots or really become big phenomena where do you think people have gone wrong so far most it seems that most of the things that have worked in crypto are basically layer ones very simple d5 kind of some of the stuff that you said early on that's like look i i like that it's there it's not really my thing that seems to be most of what's worked and then nfts and gaming this this kind of stuff that's less about political organization and more about you know people just speculating having fun buying things that are cool um why do you think that isn't where do you think people have gone wrong what would be your what would be your recommendation to somebody who who's hearing this message and says okay i want to do better let me talk about something that we've talked about 10 years ago even before crypto was even a thing before we were through any public cycles or whatever okay there's a amazon link that i put there all all viewers of this podcast should go and get this book and at least browse this okay it's an academic book by carlotta perez technological revolutions and financial capital okay this will make you this will give you a different perspective because it goes through the past and it shows that almost every single build you know whether you think about railroads other aspects of the industrial revolution there's like this very common thing it looks like the gartner hype cycle okay this is it's almost like the way that humans innovate okay technology trigger huge excitement financial spike all kinds of money goes in crash because you know most of those projects can't live up to where their you know they're speculated to be and natural selection event and then out of that rubble come like one amazon and one google and one facebook or something like that that pay for all of the other stuff plus more okay you know for example the dot-com bubble is one that um people know existed but you know some of the folks here were around for that i was i was pretty young at that time but the dot-com bubble was like this it was bigger arguably i don't know if you actually look at the numbers in terms of relative percentage but there was a site called fuckedcompany.com that just documented all the stuff and everything was obviously moronic think about webvan how stupid that was there was this thing you know people made fun of it lol you're going to get your groceries delivered at home cosmo oh yeah you're going to just hit click a button and get something delivered to you in a big city how about the the q-cat that was completely moronic that you were going to scan a bar code no normal human being would ever do that of course 10 or 20 years later we have instacart and we have ubereats and we have lots of qr code scanning stuff but you needed a whole technology build out to get there almost every stupid concept during web 1.0 um during that dot-com boom did eventually work 5 or 10 or 15 or 20 years later but the only ones that survived and they did so you know with with you know great resourcefulness were those that sort of were able to deal with this bandwidth constrained and suddenly capital constrained environment amazon yahoo google it only accepted search queries and returned back blue links you know netflix did not allow streaming at that time all those things were built for that environment and they managed to like make it through the meteor event okay and so it whether it's a dot-com bubble whether it's railroads this is just kind of how this stuff happens and if you have the long lens on history you're like okay i'm dispassionate about this now i understand this is coming i have my emotions out of it and i know there will be a natural selection event and let me just pick the winners that come out of this let me pause there uh then i can say i do think there are some winners by the way i would i would disagree with you that everything is not working i think ens is a huge hit um and that's being kind of quietly working and that's a very important piece of infrastructure that's going to come there's a there's an article that we wrote called or actually that john stokes were called the billion user table that's at the networks.com that i think is uh is is good on that um i think all this defy infrastructure the composability even if it was used for financial speculation much like during the first.com bubble i you know during the first bubble for example eyeballs that was totally moronic obviously in retrospect in the mid early 2000s okay everybody knew eyeballs had been discredited okay eyeballs are just meaning attention to your site obviously eyeballs aren't money haha stupid.com didn't have the the epithet of tech bro or whatever then but they would have used it uh like ah these dot com idiots are so stupid blah blah but do you know how eyeballs actually became valuable is once you once people realized it wasn't the same as just offline ads where you showed the same ad to everybody but you had targeted ads personalized ads the entire google machine that came out in 2004 it was like oh my god i can't believe you can make so much money on the internet even in 2002 you know the new york times salzburg was just disinformation the agency ran about google in 2002 you know what they printed they said google's toughest searches for a business model okay now they were still pattern matching all the dot-coms failing onto google at that time google's toughest searches for a business model and this was like the sun tzu thing you know where when you're strong appear weak and when you're weak appear strong google wanted to appear weak because they didn't want microsoft to hit them okay so they intentionally were like oh yeah you know you just gotta figure out how to make money on this [ __ ] later in their s1 in 2004 when they were forced to disclose they're making something like 300 400 just that year alone okay google was just destroying it even in 2002. so their search wasn't for a business model not at all right point is it took a long time for people to have the perceptions catching up with reality even in 2013 okay all right there's an article that was published saying facebook will never make a significant profit okay 2013. and then what happens is it it goes from this will never work you know all you guys are stupid and delusional you're all losing money etc and there's like a tiny tiny but where the the messaging has to kind of pause and stop and then do you know what it's going to become threat to democracy okay the next cycle is when crypto becomes a threat to democracy quote unquote in in you know the distortion because it'll all work okay we are so biology we are up on time but i want to ask you one final question to close this out so today we have startup states we don't yet have network archipelagos we don't have network space what is your over under median date we see the first network archipelago and when do we see the first network state arguably you have some i mean you've got things that are pieces near this i mean i i don't want to give a time frame and the reason i don't well let me put it like this okay i mean i will give one kind of time frame which is let's call it a goal but not a prediction right uh because if you go to the networks dot com front slash dashboard well so if you go to thenetworks.com dashboard this is like a tracker of startup societies and we actually have 23 of them that we're seeing already okay um and uh they've actually raised a fair amount of venture capital collectively it's about 180 million 200 million collectively which is more than people think right this space is happening it is like crypto in 2013 from a venture capital standpoint in terms of how much has gone in okay and so can we get from 20 something sharp societies to a thousand i think we can it's actually harder to go from zero to one than from 20 to a thousand right like you know we have to prove out the business model we need to each of these have a very simple business model in theory which is society as a service right you just pay and you have a membership right that's a very well understood business model it's like sas okay arr et cetera and uh if that works if we can get from twenty to a thousand sub-societies and uh you know so on over the next decade i do think that if we can get to a thousand sub-societies we might be able to get the first diplomatically recognized network state in like ten years or so but that's a goal right it's not a prediction it's a goal uh just to give you some precedence for that why is that not completely crazy well think about the dot tv and dot co domains those are deals with tuvalu and columbia respectively sovereigns do domain deals they get hard cash for it okay um look at the wyoming dow law that's effectively an interface between a sovereign and the ethereum network look at the el salvador bitcoin law or the central african republic that's an interface between the sovereign and the bitcoin network right um they say the theorem so between wyoming and the ethereum network between el salvador and the bitcoin network and uh so so we have precedence for states sovereigns interacting with you know companies with currencies look at you know the nevada and tesla's geiger factory look at amazon hq2 right we have started to see sovereigns ponying up to the negotiating table right and doing deals because more and more individuals more and more small groups are getting comparable to sovereignty right the level of power inequality in the world has actually been dropping the level of individual you know ability to accumulate capital has been rising and this is actually back to the future the mid 20th century was actually aberrant in this fashion so answer is if we can get to a thousand star societies i think we can get a network state and that's a goal it's a funnel but let's see what happens so to close it out biology we have the chopping block challenge for you are you ready for this in exactly six words or less tell us your favorite crypto asset and your least favorite crypto asset you only have six words you can think on it for a few seconds bitcoin ethereum 5050. wait which one's your favorite which one's your least favorite oh sorry i just said 50 50. so you split wait so you're splitting down the middle between bitcoin and each being your favorite no no what i mean i mean it's basically like i i i so not financial advice right like goes out saying not financial advice etc but if like gun to my head you know someone is like okay you know what's what portfolio blah blah i'm like 50 50 bitcoin ethereum is uh like it's not a bad bet okay why because both those have massive communities they're not going away they have you know serious use cases i think both immutability and programmability are obviously valuable but they're also obviously difficult to have in the same chain you know they're like i don't know the twitter and facebook of the space the microsoft and apple of the space whatever like those those are there there's tons of other really great coins and stuff whatever i could talk about but i actually don't uh this thing is i i am pro the space as a whole if you guys notice i'm not like a crypto tribalist on twitter or what have you i'm pro the space as a whole i'm pro individual founders and i'm pro entrepreneurs and i'm pro developers and engineers and individuals around the world who are using these platforms and so i i kind of don't want to like quote pick favorites or whatever right i also don't want people to be like oh my god biology said to get this coin it's now down eighty percent look at that that this is your point in doing that could you possibly do better than that 5050 i think you absolutely could do i think that that's probably like a pretty good safe portfolio i think so well while we do have to wrap that did not sound at all like investment advice so thanks for sharing that with our listeners at the end of the day although i know that you're you're you're a controversial figure i know some people love you some people hate you you're clearly one of the most much more i believe in the former category i believe i haven't taken a tally but i assume so we thank you very much for coming on and anybody go read the network state it's an important book thank you biology as always for for sharing your wisdom thanks everybody all right that's a wrap see you guys
