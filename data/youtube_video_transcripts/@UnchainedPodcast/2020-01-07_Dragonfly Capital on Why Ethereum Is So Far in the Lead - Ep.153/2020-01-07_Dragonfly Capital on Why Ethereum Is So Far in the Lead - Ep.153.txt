guests are hasib Qureshi and Alex Pak managing partners of dragonfly Capital welcome has Eve and Alex hey Laura thanks for having us yeah thank you why don't we start with each of you giving your background and how you came to become managing partners at dragonfly Capital Alex why don't we start with you sure thanks so dragonfly capital is a global crypto venture fund were based in San Francisco and Beijing we launched about two years ago that's founded by myself and my partner both on and cjoynt about a year later so my brief background is I've been in venture capital most of my career I started at a thin tech firm in Hong Kong then I was a partner at angellist then joined the venture arm of Bain Capital the hunt for billion-dollar private equity firm in SF where I sort help them build out their early stage investing and started their a crypto investing practice and just to flesh out the Asia side of our story my third partner is Bo he's one of the early pioneers and leaders of the internet industry in China founded one of the first China focused internet VCS invested in some of the large Chinese internet companies and he's also one of the early investors and many of the the big blockchain businesses that are out of Asia like the exchange okx and as he joined us a few months ago yeah so my background just real briefly before I joined dragonfly I was at metastable capital which is a another crypto hedge fund that's run by an evolved account and then before that I was doing a lot of stuff in crypto I was sort of I was working on a defy and a stable coin project as an entrepreneur I worked for a little while at 21 now calm which got acquired by coinbase and then before that I was at Airbnb is a software engineer so I've had a pretty varied background and then in my previous life before I ever got an attack I used to be a professional poker player and all that kind of gives me a pretty different set of perspectives on what's going on in crypto I think relative to most people who come from more traditional VC backgrounds yeah for sure and see why I should really wanted to ask you a lot about this um you know use kind of doing is when you were 15 so like how how'd that happen in a TAS I understand I think you became like one of the top ten in the world or something at some point and you were teaching it and yeah tell us that story and and just out of curiosity also how if if at all that experience affects the way that you invest in crypto totally so I'll give like a super abridged version so I was as 16 when I started playing poker and I was like I think it's really actually surprisingly analogous to like these really really young crypto traders who made a bunch of money speculating I think every generation has like its hustle for like young really smart people who don't want to go down the beaten path and I think like a decade ago it was online poker and then maybe five years after that it was like fantasy sports or something and then now it seems to be like crypto trading where I was just I was I was young I was bored I felt like I really wanted more of a challenge then kind of what you know sort of academia are just kind of going down this normal beaten path laid out for me we're at the time I was in college and I was studying philosophy and I just you know I nothing seemed as compelling as just this intellectual challenge of playing poker and making money and I think you know now this so many years later having come into crypto one it helps me understand a lot of the dynamics behind you know a lot of these like speculative manias like online poker had many elements of that especially after Chris Moneymaker and this big online poker boom that happened around like 2007 to 2010 but then at the same time a lot of the skills that you need to have as a professional poker player around thinking about risk thinking about psychology thinking about game theory thinking about you know how you know different competitive dynamics not just between people but between you know in crypto obviously you think between protocols a lot of that kind of thinking and and the other thing too is thinking probabilistically you know all that stuff I think has been really really valuable and not just evaluating crypto projects but in you know becoming a good investor so all these things are I think is super related and it's part of the reason why we see a lot of X poker people make their way into crypto so funny enough I've met a lot of people from my past as a poker player who are now you know some of the some of the biggest names in crypto so there's a lot of overlap we who are some of the others would I know any of them uh-huh sue Haas who was a professional poker player before he's the Hausa fly yeah yeah who else there's a Doug Polk who's like a big he's a kind of a big contact crater there are a few others I you know honestly like so many people have reached out to me and told me like oh yeah I used to play poker professionally back in the day but who weren't heard like quite on my radar back when I was a poker player but there but I've run - oh yeah just remembering some names like cow pig and you know a bunch of other random folks a lot of people who are dabbling in 2017 but Eva even some now who are still in the game that's super interesting I feel like maybe I could do a show on that like I don't know lessons it could be like I can already think of it as like a listicle you know ten ways that poker can make you a better crypto traders I could live on that for a long time anyway um okay so well listen why don't we actually then just go back you know Alex when you were talking about how you and Bo connected like you know you were already investing in crypto stuff when you were at Bain so why did you decide to start this new fund as opposed to you know a continuing investing through Bain yeah I had a much much more traditional path into crypto I suppose then then Hassid with poker so I've been doing it professionally as opposed as a VC since maybe 2014 at generalist big funds the problem is it's very you know crypto I think is a new asset class and it has resemblances to older asset classes probably the most similarities to to venture capital and likes in tech investing but it's it's only like somewhat like venture it's actually there are many ways in which it's way different there's many ways you know there's liquidity and like the trading aspect of these tokens there's the extraordinary deep technology and then there most importantly for me is the global aspect to crypto which is that you know most of the usage of crypto today is overseas outside the US primarily in Asia actually probably anywhere from sixty to eighty percent of all crypto usage I think you know in a very rough sense is in Asia so and that's where I got turned on to crypto I was at a VC firm in Hong Kong before that you know I I sort of played around with with Bitcoin and in college and but I just felt like it had it was very it wasn't for me like I was not the end user or anyone around me sort of Western affluent affluence we're not the end user for crypto currencies and when I went to Asia to Hong Kong you know I saw a lot of consumers and end-users who for whom crypto is solves a real problem people who are underbanked or unbanked and so forth so for me you know Bain Capital Ventures we don't really do that much on the venture side outside of outside of the US so I've spent a bunch of my time trying to learn about what's going on in Asia and that's how I connected with my now partner bo and yeah it just became sort of apparent that to build the sort of global firm I wanted to build I have to go I'd have to do it myself and start this new franchise so dragon flies portfolio includes a pretty big range of companies you've got companies and defy others doing hardware there's some exchanges protocols stable coins analytics firms custody etc what's your strategy for choosing investments like you know how do you feel like this space is going to develop and and how do you choose investments within that yeah so we are sort of overriding mission is we're looking to sort of build this global ecosystem and invest in the leading participants in the crypto economy across what they're doing and try to be relatively agnostic about things like geography and even asset type I think it's quite probably the biggest mistakes I made actually by far the biggest mistakes I made as a venture capitalist was just in crypto was just ignoring you know like ignoring a theorem or something because I felt like we couldn't do tokens even though I met Vitalik years ago during the during the pre-sale in Hong Kong and many VCS have this story so I think having no blinders on is very important generally the biggest trend that we see and that sort of guides our strategy is that in the Western world is where most of the technology is most of the deep cryptography most of the actual commits and people that are building the the really core layer when protocols and so forth come out of the West and so we primarily invest in you know layer 1 tokens d-phi products very deep technologies that come out of and the West is sort of a I mean it's you know where's a theorem based right it's could be California could be Boston like Toronto Israel yeah Berlin of course and then in the East is where a lot of the adoption is so we primarily invest in you know exchanges trading firms and sort of trading platforms and wallets and and a lot of the thought of the end user products that come out of a come out of Asia Greater China area and are you just trying to pick kind of like one company in each of those areas so I don't think we thank you so much in terms of one company from each area it's really hard to draw a strict analogy between what we do and traditional VC because they think you know a lot of traditional VC kind of comes out of looking backwards through history of you know 30 to 50 years of investing in these particular industries and seeing okay what what did it look like when the winners played out you know what sort of what sort of companies what sort of business models what sort of categories were they that actually succeeded and so if you look at crypto and if you assume that crypto is a different asset class and therefore it has different behavior and value accretes to protocols differently which i think is at this point pretty obvious then it's pretty hard to say well probably we should invest the same way that VC's invest so the you know so notions like you know you should only invest in one company in each category well it might be there like what what is a category is a category a layer one well then in that case like you know Bitcoin might be your only investment and you wouldn't touch aetherium or is a category you know trading well they're trading in China they're trading and you know the u.s. is trading in different different products and so it's it's pretty hard to draw clear boundaries without really having the foresight to know how is it how is this market gonna play out how are how are these spaces going to get partition in the future so I think the hardest part about being a crypto investor in that sense is keeping your mind open to being changed very rapidly about what ends up becoming valuable you know we fundamentally believe that there's going to be you know Bitcoin isn't the only thing that's gonna succeed in the space there are going to be other investments that succeed you know at least in the in the rough order of magnitude as a Bitcoin or aetherium they might look very different from a Bitcoin or aetherium and it's way too early to call now and say you know what are the patterns of how how those investments are going to play out so we try to remain agnostic and we try to also let our mind to be change year-over-year and not get stuck on any particular paradigm so if you were you know if you were back in 2016 or 2017 and you were like okay great this is how you know value gets created in crypto you'd be totally unequipped to invest in the landscape today because crypto just looks completely different than it did two or three years ago and I suspect it two or three years from now we'll see the same level of transformation just because the space moves so quickly yeah I literally feel like every year there's like a new trend or two um one other thing I was curious about with you your strategy is so at least like when you initially raised your first 100 million in the fall of 2018 or I think that's your only raise you said you and invest in three types of assets crypto native funds to centralize protocols and applications and then pick-and-shovel tech startups that build bridges between the decentralized and centralized worlds but for the first one crypto native funds like I would just was confused like why would you invest in other funds or like more to the point why would your LPS invest in you in order to invest in those other funds like are they just kind of paying fees twice or like I kind of didn't understand that part yeah so part of our strategy in our core part of our strategy is is fund a fund in the beginning but we do it as VCS with a long term approach so actually this oddly enough this approaches is quite a bit more common in crypto than in other types of investing I did it at Bain Capital we invested in several fund several the same funds and then Sequoia founders fund Bessemer USV in Treece and Horowitz they all had investments in about three to four or more different crypto funds and I think still today most of them do so for us the thinking was it's a frontier asset class and industry there's a lot going on around the world there's a lot of different categories and our goal is to get our LPS sort single diversified exposure to what is happening in crypto and along the way to be part of this global ecosystem of information flows and deal flow and things like that to make sure you know what's going on the space at all times and so forth at investing co investing with funds investing alongside them you know we're investors in paradigm and poly chain and meta stable and a few others that just made perfect sense because fund managers and investors they're their core part of the ecosystem actually they're probably more important almost in the ecosystem of crypto than they are in traditional venture there's no boards and there's there's like governance and they're staking and so investors are sort of they're doing more work than typical investing and they're sort of part of the ecosystem overall and do you also buy things kind of as basic I guess I would say as like Bitcoin and etherium as well to give your investors exposure to that or because I know that was it thing with some funds early on by don't even know if you know people if you guys do that anymore so we do yeah so we do buy just like you know public liquid crypto assets because I mean ultimately as investors are our goal is to give our LPS the best you know and sort of highest value exposure to crypto and it's a question that we constantly ask ourselves of where does value accrue you know and so it might well be that value accrues to like companies that are building on top of a theorem or on top of Bitcoin or on top of Tasos or Hager and or any one of these publicly traded assets but it's very clear I mean two things one is that it's really not obvious where value accrues and as an investor you need to make it like you know only investing in second layer protocols or businesses is ultimately a bet that that's where value is going to crew and so if you think it's gonna crew to the underlying protocol instead then sometimes you might say like well you know these guys are building on top of Tasos but I think it's really tasers gonna capture the value not this this project but then second is that most of these protocols they really actually still look like venture bets in the sense that you know they it might look like okay there's been a lot of price appreciation and these things are really grown but it's pretty clear that most of these things and you know depending on who you ask I would definitely put Bitcoin in this basket there's still very binary bets in the sense that either these things work they become what they say they're going to become such as digital gold or the world computer or whatever or they basically don't work and you know that it becomes sort of a wash and so you know Bitcoin right now is like a call option on this digital gold thing aetherium is a call option on it winning the support contract platform for the world and smart contracts being a thing all these things still have that very very asymmetric return profile and so I think for us we we constantly ask ourselves the question of what do we think is the best investment given where things are today and sometimes we're more bullish on particular venture deals and sometimes we're more bullish on the underlying protocols so it really depends so since this is the first episode of 2020 um we're just gonna go through kind of all the really big things themes in crypto so let's start with Bitcoin from your perspective as investors how do you see Bitcoin and you know for at this moment in time what investable opportunities do you see related to Bitcoin and well let's just start there so I think Bitcoin it's been it's been pretty hard but you know as investors when we look at Bitcoin there there are two questions you need to ask yourself so one is is Bitcoin itself undervalued or overvalued in a way that I can detect right now and if so how much do I think it's I think that's the case and the second is what about the Bitcoin ecosystem what about things like lightning what about things like liquid or other businesses that are built on top of Bitcoin so for the latter businesses built on top of that coin I think it's been pretty hard to see any successes so far Bitcoin is sort of the the perfect example of you know Joel monegros famous protocols thesis that Bitcoin basically eats everything on top anything that anything besides basically exchanges would just purely facilitate trading and speculation anything besides that just has totally failed to capture any value so when we look at Bitcoin the question that we always ask ourselves is you know is it better if we think Bitcoin is if we're both trying Bitcoin which we are to just invest in Bitcoin or to invest in proxies for the growth of Bitcoin which might be eventual companies that are building on top of Bitcoin and so far I think that this has been pretty resounding ly in favor of Bitcoin itself and I think I'd say yeah we're pretty bullish on Bitcoin especially at Isis that we see today although this might not come out for a couple weeks in which case maybe the price has changed yeah I would I would classify the centralized businesses that are sort of in the trading and Fiat on-ramp space as kind of the Bitcoin ecosystem so much more broadly actually than his sieve does we sort of talking about the decentralized applications I think trading and speculation and store of value transfer is is that is the application of Bitcoin today and it's the latest stage of all the of all the use cases in crypto today by far so for us what interests us most is yeah how are we how are people going to get their first Bitcoin where are they going to trade it and things like that and that's thriving I mean that's an enormous industry and it's uh it's actually a fairly large percentage of in terms of market cap mining and the biggest exchanges it's a fairly large percentage of the overall Bitcoin market cap at this point and what do you think about lightning you know there's been a lot of talk about that but I don't know if it's really taken off the way people expected especially in recent months that looks like it's actually kind of decreased in activity although I did read something saying that there's a lot of unaccounted for activity that's private do you think it has taken off I mean I think you answered your own question there is that lightning clearly hasn't taken off if it has we all we all would know it you know there wouldn't be any question of whether there's never a question if something has taken off the only question is why it hasn't so I you know I I've never been a bull on lightning I think for a couple years I've been like the annoying friend who's always like yeah I don't think this thing is gonna work I don't think it's gonna go anywhere for a few reasons one is that I think it's not a hard explanation that like you know Bitcoin clearly most of the reason why people want it is to hold it not to transact for small amounts of money so you know lightning in and of itself it just isn't really serving this like big wellspring of demand for for sending Bitcoin to your friends but then second over and above that I just think like the the lightning model as just as a mechanism for payments just isn't economically sustainable like the the fees that are getting paid out to Lightning nodes that actually wrap payments are just not enough for them to want to lock up Bitcoin on this thing when they can they can basically get better yields elsewhere the fees that are being paid on lightning are miniscule and so that that really prevents it from growing and creating this flywheel because it's just so capital intensive so I think you know early on it was easy to be ideological about these things now that there are a bunch of competing ways to pay people using crypto it's it's hard to just kind of ride or die on ideology so I think it sounds a lot more plausible to me that if people want to pay each other with Bitcoin in a decentralized way it might end up happening you know like on the tokenized Bitcoin on some other mechanism that is just much more capital efficient and doesn't require huge Bitcoin holders to lock up tons of capital and create this network of you know I I just don't see how that works in the limit without incentives really coming into play Oh interesting well so since a lot of layer 2 development on Bitcoin has you know or people have said that that will basically be lightning if you don't think lightning it will take off then what do you think will happen in Bitcoin I think Bitcoin will continue to be what it is which is you know oh you know overwhelmingly today like all of the side chain and the you know like things like RSK and you know any any augmentations on top of Bitcoin have really been tiny ornaments on top of what the real market is the real market is I want to buy and hold Bitcoin because I see it as a digital store of value that overwhelmingly is is I think what the coin is going to is going to be used for and that sort of use case actually is totally fine with the state of Bitcoin clearing today and maybe it gets augmented with things like liquid for you know cross exchange transfers and things like that but I don't expect the coin to actually change that much except in relatively minor ways through its its technological roadmap of just making things more efficient at the margin and maybe marginally more private yeah I think the idea that Bitcoin would ever be a medium of exchange has always been a bit of a libertarian pipe dream yeah well we there there was that period in 2014 when all those retailers started accepting it but then like nobody was funding it we still have people today saying that they're gonna get retailers to accept Bitcoin and people are gonna spend their Bitcoin so I don't know I thought we learned that lesson years ago but maybe I'm wrong they accept gold at this point for copper and silver for that and as I see what did you just say I just said that's the power of ideology you know like I'm in a way like I'm glad those people are there because they are the people who are propelling Bitcoin forward you know like Bitcoin Bitcoin would not be where it is today without its religious acolytes who are like yeah you know what I still believe that Bitcoin is gonna be used for payments and I'm glad they're trying but I I don't think they're I don't think they're right I don't think it's gonna work but if without those people there all we have left are like the rationalists we'll just like you know basically we'll leave the room the most at the first sight of danger so it takes all kinds sohe Steve I know that at one point you also said that you thought a Syrian would clearly beep Bitcoin and that later you had to revise your thesis so can you explain why it was that you used it like it's very likely clearly beep Bitcoin yeah I didn't even know that yeah yeah well so this was very very early when I first got into crypto so you know I I know about Bitcoin for a long time just like you know it's one of those things like your friends used to buy drugs or you know just whatever right like it's it was sort of on the periphery of my attention and then when I first started getting into space full time you learn about Bitcoin which is like this thing that doesn't really do very much it's got this terrible scripting language and it's got all these weird edge cases and like backported things then there's aetherium which like can do anything and it's like got this awesome welcoming community and I'm like okay there's no way that this like curmudgeonly old thing is gonna win over this like new shiny thing that could do strictly more right which i think is a very common belief by developers who come into crypto and see these two things as like open source projects but the reality of course that bitcoin is a lot more than just an open source project and at the time I just didn't really grasp that and this was around the time you know the ICO boom was just like really kicking off and there was all this momentum behind aetherium and it really took me it honestly didn't take me that long to like really realize what it was that I didn't understand about what made Bitcoin so powerful is that in a way the fact that it's the fact that it's so static the fact that it doesn't change is a large part of what makes Bitcoin so valuable and it's a property that aetherium cannot emulate because aetherium is trying to be a different thing it's not trying to be digital gold it's not trying to be this unalterable vision of you know 21 million deflationary bla bla bla store of value if you're trying to be something else and so it cannot out that coin bit coin and so after I think after you know there was this moment when people thought about oh crap like there might be a flippin egg like etherium might actually become more valuable than Bitcoin I think after the the deflation of the ICO bubble when if your IAM dropped from 1200 down to you know some $100 I think that was kind of like you know there's this line in the wire that I think it I think it's Omar who says if you if you aim at the King you best not miss and I think that that was sort of the nail in the coffin for aetherium that aetherium once it once it aimed at Bitcoin and missed I think like it's sort of the game is over Bitcoin Bitcoin kind of wins and I think it's it's pretty hard for anybody at this point to de throw in Bitcoin as being the claimant to what will be the digital store value or the digital gold it's sort of like you can eventually find a shiny or metal than gold like maybe platinum or something else is shiny I've no idea if it is but it's sort of too late you know gold has already been just you know impressed into all of our minds as being somehow the most gold that anything can be and I think that's kind of happened to pick one interesting so we're gonna discuss a little bit more about aetherium but also really big projects including Libre China and more on dragonfly's area of expertise in Asia but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible today's episode is brought to you by Kraken Kraken is the best exchange in the world for buying and selling

back to my conversation with his team Qureshi and Alex pack of dragonfly capital as it we're still a ways off from aetherium 2.0 launching with full capability and yeah I feel like there's this smart contract platform race that's about to really get started with all these aetherium killers coming online so how do you think that whole thing will shake out like what do you think is the likelihood that theory will lose its lead and if the theorem does get killed what do you think will kill it so that's a that's a really big question and I the way you framed that was that there was a battle coming up and I think a lot of people thought that that battle was coming up six months ago when a lot of the earlier folks were launching such as Tasos and Hal garand and hash graph so actually where to my mind were like halfway through that battle and everybody every soldier that's come up to line has just gotten decapitated so far so already I think we we know more than we did six months ago of why a theorem is so far in the lead and we know more about how much harder it's gonna be for somebody to dethrone etherium so you know we early on I think you know six nine months ago I really strongly believe that overwhelming likelihood was that theorem was not gonna make it that they just had too much technical debt their road map was way too long you know people were not gonna wait until 2022 or whatever for a theorem 2.0 to get there and the the pent-up demand for using spawn contracts we're just gonna mean that whoever got there first whoever really offered a high-throughput decentralized blockchain we're just gonna win the day and that you know that was like aetherium is like ms-dos and these guys are you know somebody else is like the actual technology that we'll end up using and the probabilities now I think have updated to now being that aetherium is the favorite to to retain its lead and there are a few reasons for that one I think is that there's one is that if theorem has just really shored up its roadmap a lot there's a lot more clarity now on how to actually get there which doesn't mean any faster of a timeline but it does literally mean the more time that we wait the closer a theorem is to launching and all that time you know the longer we wait but you know every day that passes that a theorem doesn't get the throned it's more likely a theorem wins second thing is that it's become really clear one of the really dominant applications for crypto is defy and that wasn't really that obvious a year ago but it's become much more obvious today and the thing about defy is that defy when it's only working on aetherium and defy has a huge network effect meaning that it's very hard to spin up a fledgling defy EP system on a chain that doesn't have other assets doesn't have interoperability with other chains and doesn't have high quality collateral so if you're trying to build a defy ecosystem on z/os for example you can try and there and there and there is like a small D FICO system on eros but the problem is like Neos doesn't have a lot of stable coins you know enos itself isn't as high-quality collateral as eath it's just not as liquid it's not as it's not just it's more volatile and at the end of the day those network effects just like really keep eath walked in as being the home for defy and most of defy doesn't require super hard core scalability because you know mostly applications today you know if you're taking out a giant CEP on maker you don't need 500 TPS in order to do that so and the last thing has really been almost all the startups that we have seen that are not building their own chains are building on a theorem so very few companies are making bets you know there are a few things at the margin that are saying okay we're gonna build on polka dot and be a relay or we're gonna integrate with a real a chain or we're building on cosmos SDK we want to be part of the cosmos ecosystem but almost everybody else is building on aetherium because it's just the only game in town it's you know to quote a famous bank robber people build on a theorem because that's where the money is and so if you're building a product that needs to integrate with money you have to go build on ethereum so it's it's very possible that if somebody brings their own distribution so you know like a telegram although you know telegram has sown problems as we've seen with recent regulation you know I really didn't know what to think if telegram were to come in to crypto and bring with it a huge new ecosystem of developers and same with Libra the Libra would if it were to launch in a way that allowed external developers to build stuff they would just be bringing a huge growing of the pie in terms of the number of developers and entrepreneurs who'd be building on top of them but if you're only targeting crypto developers today it's just really really hard to stand out as a smart contract platform so I think there are a lot of platforms that are launching soon that have better designs and have better architectures and will and will come out to market with a much more scalable product but the thing they're really gonna have to prove them is just how do they win developers how do they win the hearts and minds of people who right now like the best developer experiences and all the other things they want to enter it with they live in one place and that's at their him well I have a question for you because you made a strong case for like how if you were building a defy DAP you would want to do that on aetherium but let's say that I wanted to build some kind of crypto gaming something rather where throughput really was important then would somebody like that who you know maybe couldn't really tap into the network effect of defy would that that person have a different incentive when it came to choosing blockchains to develop on absolutely I think that's one of the things that we've seen change start to specialize on and a lot of chains have really tried to brand themselves actually as like we're friendly for gaming we're friendly for high-throughput use cases the problem is that you know those things one they don't really seem to generate network effects right so if there's a game that has really really high throughput on let's say ayios or let's say Algar and right those that might be a great platform for that game but that game isn't necessarily gonna attract a lot of other users isn't a Sara Lee gonna try a lot of other assets isn't gonna attract a lot of other applications because so far at least what we've seen with the games that they're not particularly interoperable so and the other thing is that if theorem is is getting really really close to developing a more robust layer two story of how you can develop high throughput applications but just you know on layer two getting security from layer 1 so you know companies like matter Labs with their ZK roll-ups approach or optimistic with optimistic roll-ups these things are moving ahead really rapidly so I think a lot of people see ok well if I just wait and then you know once these things already I can just deploy in aetherium and you know benefit from the fact that I don't need to onboard my user into a whole new blockchain that they've never heard of I can I can do it all within the a theater ecosystem okay so out of curiosity then like how do you I mean your investors so are you you know more trying to invest in things building on aetherium or are you still looking at investing things that may compete with aetherium well it to be clear we invest in a lot of platforms that compete with aetherium so what I'm what I'm saying there is not that I think if he was definitely gonna win what I'm saying there is that the the theorems lead has grown a lot but there's a lot of game left to be played right like three years until aetherium fully launches if you're into quenelle with smart contracts in I think what's a reasonable timeline two to three years that's a long time and if we see a a blocking platform really get product market fit before then which you know beyond just what we see today which is like crypto native speculation I think you could see a very very rapid transition outside of etherium to something else being the dominant platform but it could also well be that if theorem sort of stays the way it is as like the defy chain where if you want to do sort of crypto native speculation or take out loans or do this kind of stuff all of that stuff happens on theorem but the other big use cases for blockchain such as gaming or such as you know like stos or something like that might happen on a totally different chain so you might see a splintering of applications across chains I think it's really early to say there's a natural effect that things want to be together things want to be interoperable you know things want to live in the same ecosystem but if the platform's like if the applications require super high throughput and properties that a theorem can't give it then the mages go elsewhere so we have we have a lot of investments actually in platforms that are competitive with the etherium and I think they're really awesome and I think they have a really good fighting chance but I think you know they know they're fighting a driver not right now and that juggernaut has grown stronger in the last last six months and the one major exception to this story is the geographic factor there are some regions especially China really where usage I think may in fact be fractured and the dominant global smart contract platform loses to a regional competitor and this is because of cultural issues language issues which is actually bigger than you might expect and you know just sort of government nationalist influence China is very publicly advocated for using Chinese technology infrastructure we see this with Alibaba cloud displacing AWS and things like that and that influences where corporates and all sorts of parties decide to build on top of in the smart contract universe yeah so or talk about China in a little bit but actually I want to talk about Libra first cuz he did mention Libra and I actually wanted to ask you you know so the launch of Libra seems somewhat imminent I don't think we have an actual timeframe but maybe I don't know in the next year or so and they did already launch a test net for developers so I'm just curious to know first of all why don't we just talk about this aspect first how do you think that Libra will affect existing stable coin projects and you know how does the launch of Libra or how will the launch of Libra affect your investment strategy when it comes to stable coins that's a super difficult question to answer because I think honestly we know surprisingly little about how the Libra is going to play out if if the Libra actually does launch in what form it's going to launch is a very open question right now so you know to my mind I I think the likelihood that the Libra launch is in the way that we are originally imagining with like you know basically a network that looks like what they described in the initial white paper and all the documents that they that they first published earlier this earlier in 2019 I think there's almost no way that we see exactly that the amount of pushback they've received from regulators around the world but it's you know especially in Congress in the US I think it's very likely that we see either some regulatory district a categorization that gives regulators a lot more oversight over the Libra than what they were originally expecting to get and you know ultimately you you just can't really expect being a player on the size of Facebook to be able to sneak in through some kind of loophole and essentially offer an entirely new currency or entirely new you know whatever you want to call it ETF or or whatever notion you want to apply to what exactly the Libra is without you know being subject to really really stringent regulations so if we assume that what the Libra is going to launch is actually a smart contract platform that does have this stable coin that pretty much anybody can acquire on the on the underlying Libra platform you know calibra might have AML qia but the underlying Libra chain allows anybody to send and receive libras I think that's like massive massive massive change to the landscape of what crypto ends up looking like it has a huge huge consequence for sale but I think that universe is like long on I think there's no way the Libra launches and looks like that if the Libra does launch I imagine it's probably fairly neutered it probably is closed off to various jurisdictions and I would also guess that the ability for people to write arbitrary smart contracts and like really do the kinds of things that we expect of in crypto of like people to build decentralized companies and decentralized products that can basically do whatever they want I expect that to be very limited if Libra actually launches in a big way so I think it's pretty hard to prognosticate right now given how little we know but you know no matter what Libra will have a big impact just hard to know exactly what that looks like Alex did you want to add something sure yeah I think two years to the second part of your question you know we only invest in decentralized stable coins I don't think there's a great economic model for investors in Fiat back stable coins and actually it's really more of a feature to increase usage of something else like training for BitFenix and tether or usage of a payment platform like Calibra and Libra and I doubt that Libra especially in its in its form that naseeb describes predicts I doubt it will compete much with decentralized table coins it's it's probably not that going to be that censorship resistant but I think certainly it will on board a ton of new users and wallets into crypto and this is this is particularly important because crypto is as much a social revolution as a technical run and just like trading on the internet with eBay it requires people to change their trust model which could take you know a few months a few years or decades sometimes writing that's not inconceivable and Libra helps speed that along significantly if it gets traction and out of curiosity you know because you were talking about how Libra will probably launch quite differently from how it was originally envisioned and you know it might be more neutered do you know if any developers who are interested in building on Libra I know that they're they've had a lot of interest in their attendant of what it's called like their developer bootcamp or some some kind of some kind of startup school type thing for Libra I know they've been running those sorts of things and I know they've received a lot of interest but I wouldn't read too much into like the the Libra test net and the code as being any indication of when they're actually gonna launch a monetary network you know like the the it's very clear that the regulatory go to market for Libra is happening in parallel to the technical go to market and their technical go to market is awesome and fantastic and I've in all the respect in the world for what they're doing on the protocol front but the regulatory front is there they're not gonna be ready within a year like there's almost no way because they just have there's so many unanswered questions and I don't think I'm gonna get the green light from any major country to to launch in their jurisdiction within a year like these things like this don't move that fast hmm well and then also I was wondering would you invest in something that was building on the Libra Network or would you be nervous to do so you know for I don't know regulatory reasons or because there's a sort of general anti-facebook bias from a lot of regulators overall I think for us we'd want to see you do to see more clarity around what the Libra is going to be you know I think there's actually decent money at this point that the Libra just gets shuttered completely and I think a lot of that also depends on who wins in the 2020 election might might really really influence the outcome of Facebook but there are realities like Facebook has just so many things on their mind right now that you know if as this antitrust probe increases in seriousness and again like a change of party in in the white house might really really change the dynamics of how that antitrust investigation goes Facebook just might say like look we are we're not in a position to want to like bring down more scrutiny on ourselves we're just gonna play nice and like to shut this thing down quietly so I think there's a lot of there's just a lot of uncertainty on where this thing plays out so it'd be hard to invest right now on in somebody building on top of Libra unless they were sufficiently agnostic to where they were gonna build on and they're like okay well you know if Leo's not there we'll build on something else but somebody who's going all-in on Libra I think right now is it's a tough time to make that bet all right so now let's switch to Asia I'm sort of going chronologically you know Bitcoin then aetherium then Libra then China because the things have happened broadly in crypto but when we just start with a kind of broad question which is I'm just curious and I ask this of all the various crypto people who kind of work in both Asia and the West but how would you characterize the differences between crypto in Asia versus in the West sure Asia is even more fast-paced and frenetic than the West when it comes to crypto things are changing so so radically and the reason is because it's where the it's where the true crypto users are it's where the action is happening the most organic early users of crypto assets they've always been in Asia it's very ripe for adoption of Kryptos digital finance applications I mean you never this the sort of confluence of widespread internet adoption and smartphone penetration that's even higher than it is in the u.s. in many ways rising incomes new middle class but very low financial of the economy a lot of people under underbanked a lot of limited access to global financial products and capital markets this means there's there's so much pent-up demand for crypto and unfortunately you know unfortunately most of the core technology is still not in Asia or however you want to you want to make of that it just has it so happens crypto is very the technology that underpins it used to be quite obscure right there's not many cryptographers there's there are like a handful of zero knowledge proof researchers in the whole world before crypto blew up and now that really none of them were in China or Asia they were in you know big universities or cryptography centers on the west so a projects in that space tend to be a lot rougher but there's just way more innovation and an experimentation I should say platform tokens like BnB really all got their start in Asia sort of corporate coins innovations on how you do like how an exchange operates giving it back to their customers the intima fication of Finance sort of the financialization of games is all happening in in Asia so really all the stuff that is like to how users will interact with crypto is getting their start it's getting its start in Asia that's yeah that's really interesting because I I definitely feel like the lower level stuff tends to be more Western but that yeah when it comes to people actually using this rather than just speculating or hoarding it does feel like Asia's a little bit ahead um one thing that I was wondering is so obviously now you know you guys do have this office in Beijing so now that she's and ping came out all in favor of vlog chain but its blockchain not Bitcoin or crypto I'm curious to know how that's affected your investment strategy like am i right in assuming that the kinds of efforts that china is interested in are not the kinds that would be open to investment from you know dragonfly capital I think that's that's broadly correct but it's it's a little different than how it's well actually so so what's happening in Asia I think is playing is what's been playing out in the u.s. actually for the last five years in crypto 2 but on a hyper scale in many ways she's you know speech on October 24th it was one of the greatest endorsements and sort of implicit allocation of resources to an early stage technology in a very long time maybe ever and so you have this rush of like government-related entities and banks and corporations that are racing to show how innovative they are with blockchain and that they understand it you have massive education campaigns every university is going to have a blockchain class that's great I think high level but yeah the Chinese vision for crypto is very different from our vision and but it's not it's not just a Chinese vision it this happened in the u.s. to where the first time people in suits interacted with crypto in the US government agencies and big corporations they all got it wrong they all said blockchain not Bitcoin they were into enterprise and private blockchains things that weren't super disruptive that felt safe to them to play around with in their innovation labs and same thing is happening in China today you know just on a couple years this and you know it takes a while to play out like a lot of these proof of concepts that are going on in like Boeing and Goldman sent JP Morgan things like that they're they're taking four or five years to you know for their bosses to realize that it's a dead end and they should stop doing this so I think that's that exact thing will play automation and there'll be a multi-year period where there's this frenzy around enterprise use cases and then you know the technology the best tech always wins eventually if it's massively better so they'll come around to it eventually Oh what do you think what they don't want to add oh go ahead yeah one thing I want to add just kind of for color is that you know one of the one of the knock-on effects of what's going on in China is just you know yes there's sort of this miss applied enthusiasm about blockchain not Bitcoin but but there's also like a normalization of a lot of the stuff that's going on in crypto that so far has been very pushed underground and kind of has these negative associations that now suddenly has kind of come into the daylight so one you have a much larger pipeline of just young smart students and engineers and entrepreneurs who are now learning about blockchain and crypto and are sort of set on that path where it's now sort of much more normalized to be studying the stuff and to be in the space actually so one of our one of our junior partners Mia she was recounting a story of how you know she's been encrypted out for a few years and her grandparents just had basically no idea what crypto was other than that they heard Bitcoin and they associated with being a scam and so they were kind of vaguely embarrassed of what their daughter was doing and then after President Xi's speech they were just like there was a call we get it now and it was like really you get it now I don't think you get it they're like no no it's great what you're doing is like for the future of China and it's awesome and so just little things like that you know they sound they sound silly but they really do add up in just sort of completing the picture of what what makes the space healthy in a certain region and we think that that's kind of probably what will be the biggest knock-on effect of of what happened in China well I actually want to ask about what Alex kind of implied at the end of his answer where he was sort of saying that oh you know eventually they'll realize like these enterprise block chains are you know not gonna work out and and so he kind of seemed to imply that they'll turn to public lock chains but I'm just thinking about you know like dcep that's kind of that I mean that's the stable coin right so in a way if people have something that's you know stable and usable you know I I don't know how like part of me is like is that just gonna kill that Chinese crypto projects do you know what I mean well maybe maybe I can take a crack at that so I think so dcep I mean I wouldn't even call dcep a stable point like literally DCP doesn't use a blockchain it uses UTX OS and private keys but it's not a blockchain it's just a central bank digital currency the you know III totally care what you're saying in that like well maybe that means they just throw the whole thing off and they realize script I was useless I think the claim that that Alex and I want to make is even stronger than that is that like the the real value of blockchains is in coordination and it's in permissionless innovation and we think that eventually wins out because it is valuable because it creates more valuable businesses it creates more value for more possibilities of trade and free access and in the long run that wins because it's just better for human beings right so if you know we believe that eventually there will be experimentation along the lines of public law chains because of course there will like beat up people people always want to push the frontier forward and people always want to try out things that they think might become more economically valuable and if we're right that public blockchain is produce more value and something for some intrinsic reason over these private enterprise gated block chains then they'll win and if we're wrong about that and they don't they aren't actually more valuable then probably this whole enterprise is doomed and the only thing that mattered was Bitcoin and all this like smart contract and permissionless you know finance and innovation in blah blah blah if all this stuff is totally wrong then you know may a couple we got it wrong but we think this the rules apply just as much in China as they do anywhere else and ultimately public blog chains will you know they'll find the value in it because entrepreneurs will find the value in it well but one question about that is I feel like you know with the internet a lot of people were like oh this is gonna kind of open up China but here we are now in this you know era where you know they kind of basically just have their own internet so do you think that they really will you know turn to public blockchains because what if they're just like yeah we're gonna have like public Chinese blockchains and you know people will just interact in China or transact with in China with each other I mean it's like it's like you know such a huge market that they could kind of exist in that world and not realize that it's you know that it's like limited which i think is basically how the how they interact on the internet now they're you know they like don't miss Google and Twitter so I first of all I completely agree with that and I think what you're pointing at is a real question that I don't think we have a strong answer to of will it be a global single platform that unites you know everybody who uses a public blockchain or will it be you know there's like aetherium for like a bunch of people and there's like this other one for the you know this country and another one for this country probably you know it's it's too early to say and it's hard to know the answer to that and it also you know it could well be that it could go either way and it's a super path dependent on you know where is it that like right now if you look today at aetherium right ethereal ocol ization for china is just abysmal you know a lot of the a lot of the services that you think are like okay well this is defy anybody can use this around the world like they don't even have Chinese you eyes like literally people and trying to need to know English in order to interact with a lot of these things so there's a there's a there's a degree to which like it might just be as simple as look these guys just built products for China and everybody in China or anybody who can speak Chinese can use these products and that's why they want and it wasn't some intrinsic deep reason why the whole world needs to get connected is just that public blog trains are awesome because permissionless innovation is awesome and you guys just didn't build the right tools for these peoples are gonna go where there are tools you know so I don't know I think it's early to say but I I totally see to your point that it really could go either way at this point alright so we're gonna actually switch topics because since this is the first episode of 2020 I want to look forward but one thing that I wanted asked about was 2019 kind of saw the beginning of this revival and dowse but that's you know that's kind of like a governance area and I just wondered is that one of those trends that like doesn't really lend itself to investing you know and or if if that's not the case then how do you invest in something in a trend like that so I think dows I really hesitate to think of dows as like a trend or like a specific thing because people means so many different things by dows you know like is maker Dowell one of the dowels like is it when you think about dows do you think about on chain governance is that in the category of downs or do you think like Moloch Dow or do you think things like Nexus mutual you know dowels on the whole really which really just kind of breaks down to on chain governance in some sense if you want to be sufficiently general about it clearly that's a trend that's growing and I think like there are a lot of things that are investable in that category but then there are you know like the sort of much more speculative much more cyberpunk types of dials like Moloch Dow or things that things that look like it and they're I just think we you know we'd haven't really seen anything of meaningful scale you know the last meaningful scale Dow Dow you know like sort of emblematic dowse was the Dow and since then I think everything just been really tiny you know and and in a sense like you know people people knock on the down the down was actually like a pretty straightforward you know it made sense as an idea like okay it's like decentralize venture firm all right that kind of makes sense let's see how it goes it didn't go well you know and I think the it remains to be seen like what are the things that Dalles will do better than you know other forms of other forms of firms and I we haven't gotten an answer to that yet and so I think people are people are kind of jumping the gun things like well Dallas should exist because they're dows and dows are awesome and I think those are cool they're like super interesting but I also want to know the answer of like what do they do better than other firms and so if you can if I see something that answers that question for me that I'm gonna happily invest yeah I think you know governance is a very obvious ly good use case for crypto I mean the purpose of governance is to govern shared resources and shared value and so now you have a digital native value you can have digital native governance over those things but it's really an innovation on what a company is and what an equity right that's what it that's what it Dow is but you know investing in companies quote-unquote that's not an investment thesis so it's an underlying tool that enables your new forms of companies you still need to figure out which company to invest in this is I mean same thing with icos right it's or startups I mean just because like not all utility took or whatever all tokens fact 99% of tokens are garbage just like 99% of unfiltered startups are garbage and they don't make sense it's like why are using a token things like that and we're gonna have the same question with dowse hopefully it's not as frenzied as with icos where there's just like thousands of dolls and they know the tokens for them go up but it might be it very well might be but uh you know just like with icos and tokens there will be some great use cases and new innovative things enabled by the underlying governance Tec so his Eve I saw that you wrote one of those essays for coin desk and one of the things that you mentioned was about how you think identity is like one of the next steps necessary for the space but I also wondered again like with Jo is is that an investable area is that something that you can make money from that's a that's a good question I think I to clarify I think identity is a is important to getting to the next step of credit right getting credit on the blockchain and that said I don't know how far away that step is and I suspect it's pretty far like I would be very surprised if anybody does there's a really really good shot at identity in 2020 because it's intrinsically really hard and there's just a lot of other low-hanging fruit before that's the next thing that we need to crack that said you know isn't is identity investable like if I see a credible enough approach to it yes but identity is also to some degree what makes it really hard is that it's a public good you know it's like it's like pure infrastructure in the deepest sense and I think a lot of times you know in 2017 I think a lot of people got into their heads this really really nefarious mean that infrastructure is magically investable you know like the for some reason if you have infrastructure and it's valuable you can make money off it and in general that's like obviously not true and there are some exceptions to that that are really interesting like aetherium or Bitcoin like that's super interesting that you can invest in this public good and make money but in general that's not the case and you should you know you should be surprised when that actually is the case that public goods do end up becoming investable so something like an identity provider it's just really really hard to find the right business model for something like that because it requires people willing to pay for supplying that identity and that equus isn't it doesn't exist yet so I think it would be really really hard but if I saw the right entrepreneur and the right go to market I think it could be really really interesting all right so to wrap up why don't we have you guys each give a prediction for 2020 and also I'm just curious to know what you think will be the first killer app for crypto so to question someone all right I think Alex goes first and also what you think the first killer app will be in crypto okay let's see I think the first killer app is already here it's very clearly trading and ha telling story value assets now that's not a sec same answer as possible but you know and then defy is is the is the higher-level version of that so once you have an asset you seek to use it as collateral like house you know owning a house or owning art is only the first thing you do with it or owning gold then use it as collateral for other things and that foot you know defy projects like maker Dow or compound do and so we're seeing this sort of systemic building out of this early use case of figuring out how to collateralized or you know digital native store values and that might take a very long time but it's already here I mean it's already Kryptos a couple hundred billion dollar business so it's already here it's growing what do you think it will take it will take for those to go mainstream mainstream there's a few things one you do need more scalability to go very mainstream defy projects tend to be the most high that like economically efficient uses of block chains today because you could you could put a lot of value through each in a transaction but it's not it's not infinitely scalable so you need better solutions to layer 1 and layer 2 and then to I think it's just about having more endpoints and building out the UX and build it not just UX but building out the security and the tooling to make sure people trust that these defy prod Jax you know they won't get hacked immediately or things like that same with Bitcoin right I mean the first few years there were math like it was very questionable whether you should know much of your assets in in Bitcoin like it easily could be for you know hacked or something at a fundamental level so I think that's gonna have to happen to the etherium dphi ecosystem all right and in prediction for 2020 let's see I think one one thing that's interesting in the we follow the exchange landscape quite a bit because exchanges are sort of the closest things to crypto native companies they're very centralized today you know they look like they don't they're not run on block chains or anything like that but but they're as close to the future of a decentralized you know Tomas company as you get and so I think one thing about the exchange landscape is they're morphing very aggressively into basically like financial portals and quasi banks and they're basically becoming the distribution channel for all crypto products and they have all the users and so they're aggressively building out bank let you know you could take a loans out you could have deposits and do custody from from your exchange but you can also you know use a Dex you can you'll be able to use a lot more dphi products in the coming months games and all the other applications as well you know once these decentralized applications take off I think you know barring a big growth of you know like Calibra or telegram like a big new distribution channel coming in from the old world these exchanges are gonna actually look a lot more like portals from the Internet era than than just a traditional you know exchange like the New York Stock Exchange okay has seem killer app in 2020 prediction so killer app I would say is almost without a doubt stable coins so in some sense like the Libra kind of made it clear that there's there you know people are actually already terrified that there's certain that could be this stable coin thing is just going to take over the world what I think is a little bit premature but I think is directionally correct so stable cars I think will be huge and will probably be the first really widespread killer app of crypto and then prediction for 2020 I would say 2020 is probably the year that we're going to see synthetics synthetic assets really really start to take off aside from the US dollar so right now you know the biggest synthetic asset that we have is make it out and that produces a synthetic US dollar but I think there's going to be a lot more synthetic assets that get created and more creativity around distribution where essentially you know at some point in the future one of my big theses about crypto is that you know the internet did a lot to disrupt many many different markets but the one thing that really did not touch is finance finance is basically the same before and after the internet but crypto is sort of going to do to finance what the internet did to all those other industries and a lot of that is you know this vision that some random person anywhere in the world can open a mobile phone and buy a synthetic asset of whatever it is that they want so if I'm you know some random guy in Africa or in Tunisia or China I can just get on my phone I can you know deposit some money and then I can buy a synthetic exposure to the S&P 500 or a Treasury bond or you know Netflix talk or whatever it is that I want so you know finance getting completely democratizing and disaggregated by the blockchain that I think will begin in 2020 yeah I I had like a funny thing happened to me the other day where I was walking down the street I passed by a bank and I I like I don't even know what I was thinking I just wasn't thinking anything but I just heard this voice in my head like that's not gonna be here in five years whoa like like what like like like I wasn't intentionally thinking that thought but it just popped in my head and I got the vision of you know like Virgin Records and like Blockbuster and burn snow or not Borderers like and it was just so funny that it just like popped in my mind and I was like maybe not exactly five but definitely 10 yeah yeah five to five is a bit aggressive but yeah I think it's clear the right buster I mean I would privacy concern the side I would love to just put a camera outside some of these bent and like who goes into banks anymore I just want to talk to these people and figure out what they're doing from a customer development they're older definitely yeah yeah sure anyway okay well this has been a great conversation where can people learn more about each of you and dragonfly hello see what okay yeah you can you can find me on Twitter I'm at haci HOAs Seb you can learn more about dragonfly at DCP capital we put up a bunch of research and blog posts just kind of analyzing the space from different angles yeah I'm bummed I didn't get to ask you about any of your blog post there were so many good ones I'll just link to them in the show notes you guys were simple but I've talked about some of them on the on my other show before anyway so people have heard about some of your cool blog posts great yell at me afterwards if you don't like them Alex do you want to share your Twitter oh
