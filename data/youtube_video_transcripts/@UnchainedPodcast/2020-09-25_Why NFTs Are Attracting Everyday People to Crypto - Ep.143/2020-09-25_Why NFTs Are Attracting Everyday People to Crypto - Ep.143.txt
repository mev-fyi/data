laura nice to see you again thanks again for having me everyone's been talking about nfts or non-fungible tokens this week for those in the audience who aren't sure what those are if you remember crypto kitties which were unique collectible digital cast and i still think they exist that's just one example jake can you define what a non-fungible token is and then we can dive into why there's so much chatter about them now absolutely i mean the simple definition of a non-fungible token is a token that represents a unique asset we're used to cryptocurrencies where we have many units that are all worth the same like if i had one ether laura and you had one ether those are you know those are the same value but if i had one cryptokitty and you had another cryptokitty they actually might be valued totally differently your cryptokitty might be really scarce and valuable in my crypto kitty might be you know run of the mill in common and so non-fungible tokens they really represent this this uh this uh acid class of unique assets that's out there and so what's been going on with them recently why has there been so much chatter well you know as someone who's been watching this space for for a very very long time for from the really the very beginning uh when rare pepe uh images were started to be traded on counterparty it seems like about a million years ago that was a long time ago it was before cryptokitties i think what's what's actually happening is that the the space of non-fungible assets is maturing a little bit and what we've seen is actually a little bit of interesting early conversion of digital creators who are creating art and collectibles and other kinds of nft assets and they're starting to trade them on marketplaces and the volume on these marketplaces uh is going up a bit and um related to that i think investors have matured a little bit in their thinking about the nft space and they've started to position and make investments uh venture style mostly so far uh in companies that are that are in the nft space and it's been very exciting yeah and there's even a little bit of the yield farming thing going on with nfts so i think that's another reason people are getting excited because even though the craze has died down from the fever pitch i still see people interested in it um but you actually wrote a really interesting blog post about nfts and you had like another definition that you gave which is you said that nfts were liquid intellectual property for digital content so what do you mean by that yeah so this is exactly um you know what i've been sort of saying is like most people have so far brushed off the nft spaces you know people trading funny pictures on you know on blockchains um and if you sort of thought experiment a little bit and you and you start to understand a little bit of uh kind of the financial use cases that nfts enable you start to realize that if you take this view of nfts as strong ownership of digital content um things get quite interesting and the first thing to observe is that there's just like a lot of different kinds of digital content certainly there's art certainly there's collectibles but there's also 3d models or metaverse assets there's also stock photography there's also blog posts that people write and and then monetize through syndication there's music on which artists earn royalty there's movies which get distributed on platforms like netflix and so on and so forth and if you start to count up the number of digital objects on the internet and in the world you actually start piling up quite an asset class of of objects and if you start to think of nfts as being kind of a very fitting technology to denote ownership of these objects to denote the royalty streams of these objects then you start to get away from a little bit of the speculative aspects like oh i buy a cryptokitty i'm gonna you know flip it to somebody else later and you start to get into the more fundamentally valued aspects of of non-fungible assets which is like hey maybe i'll own the revenue stream to taylor song the taylor swift song or album or something like that or uh maybe i'll own the movie rights to a certain like digital character that i'll be able to license out and when you take that view of nfts as liquid intellectual property what you start to realize is that most intellectual property doesn't live on secondary markets today it's kind of a liquid and what blockchain enables is the liquidity of these markets and so the reason that i'm super excited about nfts as an investor is i think that we're about to unlock a whole lot of value that previously has been in these non-traded like paper rights but is about to get a lot more digital so i have so many questions about what you said but before we get into those i do just want to make one comment which is i noticed in your blog post that you had a chart of different kinds of content and one of them said written content and underwritten it was like movies and videos and i was like what about articles and ebooks as a writer i just had to point out that you missed right there because i would not call videos and movies written content and um and also like even just knowing your example when you mention blog posts i was like there are professional writers too who like make a living writing um but anyway okay so we were talking you were talking about nfts from the creator's perspective but i wanted to ask also so right now as a consumer i already have you know multiple libraries of music that i can tap like you know music i can stream from apple or spotify or pandora soundcloud etc or you know i can go on to these different stock photography sites or whatever so what's in it for the end consumer like what would get them to make a switch well because it basically um democratizes the ownership in uh in this kind of content right so if if you think about a stock photography site today like getty images or shutter stock or something like that i mean you're talking about a private business right that is facilitating a marketplace between stock photographers and purchasers of stock photography like designers or making websites and and so on and so forth and this marketplace model is exactly the thing that blockchain technology in my opinion was really born to uh to disrupt and and what basically what can happen is we can replace that proprietary provisioning of the marketplace with a decentralized smart contract based system which is exactly what uh marketplaces like like recently wearable uh have done and we can give the ownership and the governance of that system to the community of people who are participants in that marketplace and that's a really really powerful value proposition that blockchains in general i think give to the world interesting okay but but like how would that work exactly because so you know i'm as i'm sure you're well aware it's very easy to create a screenshot of a piece of digital visual art like if i go on the crypto kitty site i can just create a screenshot of a cryptokitty same with a photo i can pirate a song or a movie uh there you know i know writers get upset i get upset if people make copies of my articles or try to get a pdf of an ebook or whatever so how would creators of nfts protects against copies and actually make money from these so-called non-fungible tokens when it's so easy to create a copy of them yeah so so again i i think like when when someone purchases uh an nft and maybe that's not like totally true today but i do think this is exactly where uh the space is headed they're not buying the image in my opinion what they're buying is the intellectual property rights the image and so if you think about the mona lisa the mona lisa lives in the louvre in france and paris um it's worth 800 million dollars but of course i can go online and download a picture of the mona lisa and put it on my wall that doesn't mean that i can resell that picture for 800 million dollars um so why is it that the mona lisa is worth that much but but a copy is not well in that case this is physical art right and it it sits in a museum and people go to that museum every day you know millions of people go every year and of course they all pay to see the mona lisa so the mona lisa has a has a revenue stream right that could be that could be valued and figured out um how you enforce that in the digital realm becomes a really interesting question and i and i think um i i think that that existing law and property rights are perfectly acceptable ways of enforcing um you know enforcing the the the actual legal rights of these works now what's super interesting is that projects like aragon are working on this idea of a global digital jurisdiction and global on-chain dispute resolution if you've ever seen aragon court if you've seen aragon agreements those speak to how we might be able to ensure and enforce off-chain property rights in the future using blockchain technology also so the short answer is short term i think it's just we're gonna allow creators to give the purchaser of their nft legal property rights and in the long term those property rights might actually be enforced on change wow okay there's just so much to unpack there um so we're gonna but let's let's take a commercial break first so first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible inter blockchain communication will be launching on cosmos soon join hack atom 5 the two-week cosmos virtual hackathon where you can play with inter-blockchain communication before it is launched and be amongst the winners of a 50 dollar prize pool valued in adam hack adam five coming soon to a dev post near you this october visit five dot hackathon dot org that's f i v e dot h a c k a t o m dot o r g back to my conversation with jake brookman so [Laughter] i have interviewed uh lisa luis quinday of aragon i you know understand how that works i find it super fascinating but i would imagine that for this sort of digital jurisdiction to have any kind of teeth would be that they would need to get sign on from actual physical jurisdictions like the physical jurisdiction where the mona lisa exists so you know i don't know if they can just sort of like claim that they have this jurisdiction right and so i just imagine that let's say i mean actually the mona lisa isn't a great example but let's start with like some of the because there's been like these different crypto art things i've been seeing that there are these auctions and they're selling actually for a fair bit of money like you know 7 thousand bucks or higher which you know for something that can be copied and spread everywhere all over the internet at him a little bit like why would you pay so i don't know anyway the point is especially in this case where you don't know if the legal um you know if the jurisdiction will will honor uh kind of this idea that you are the one who owns this so how do you guys plan to uh kind of get around that issue i mean i think look again we're we're super early and you know to be totally honest like no uh nft platform has yet gotten to the point where they're actually integrating legal rights but i actually don't think it's that um it's that unlikely i think like you know you basically kind of agreed on the jurisdiction where the creator is is operating and uh where the buyer is operating and you kind of agree to the set of rules and i think you'll find that um they're definitely um kind of default property rights that will come into effect in those jurisdiction uh in that jurisdiction but but more specifically i think what you really want is the creator and this is probably going to be facilitated by the platform um just like we have an open source today you'll sort of choose a license and this license will say things like um hey i give the buyer the right to resell this work or modify this work or you know sell the rights this work to a movie or another artist or creator might might opt to not do that they might say like this work is provided as is but you know you have strong ownership of it you have the right to lend it to to make a return on it um you know to to create a royalty stream for yourself on it but i don't want you to modify it right and all of those kinds of property rights um might just be enumerated in a legal contract and there's actually um a number of precedents in blockchain today where people are combining legal jurisdictions and uh and sort of traditional entities and contracts together with tokens if you if you if you're curious on that topic check out what open law is doing with the lao unchained dao venture funds there also have been icos where by purchasing tokens you're also signing a legal agreement in a certain jurisdiction and the same kind of kind of legal and uh legal technology can be applied to to nfts it's just we we need a company in the market to do that and i think that will happen uh fairly soon yeah i think the question of whether or not those agreements will be um enforced as they are written it probably comes down to the courts but i am not a legal person so there's a lawyer watching this who's like laura got that wrong let me know um so just to go back to some earlier comments you made you were talking about you know this ability to um have fractional ownership and governance by communities so um you know you you gave some examples but like where do you think this could go in the future well like i said i mean i think that um the core value proposition that blockchain technology gives to marketplaces is is it removes the middleman and removes this sort of proprietary need to extract profit from the marketplace and um you know and and what it can do is it can redirect that uh ownership of marketplace to the community and using blockchain and also in a very efficient way so you know i always like to say like you can buy someone's attention by paying them money but it's very hard to like buy their loyalty the way that you buy people's loyalty is you give them you know you make them a partner you give them equity in the firm and i think what these um what liquidity mining has shown recently in d5 and what volume mining uh which is what wearable an nft marketplace has really been the first uh project to to showcase in the market like i don't know what volume mining is oh sure um so so when wearable launched they decided to launch by the way they're an nft marketplace for people who don't know that's right wearable is an nfc marketplace which was the first nft marketplace to launch with a governance token and when you um when you transact in the marketplace when you either make a purchase or make a sale as a creator you're also dropped tokens in a weekly airdrop and it's not that you're just getting paid for transacting on the platform which is what i was referring to as volume mining it's also that you're becoming a partial owner of the platform you uh by holding the token you get governance rights in the you know in the voting system um in the future you might be able to pay commission fees with this token you might be able to um stake it and do things like that um uh in future use cases right so so this idea of like community ownership of the platform i think is a very strong value proposition for users and participants and you also wrote in your blog post about something about how fractionalized tokens can be traded crowdfunded and incorporated into other financialization schemes to manage risk i didn't know what that meant was that like using them as collateral or what you know what are some examples absolutely so once you recognize or if you recognize that nfts are you know a financial asset class then you start to realize that you need financial infrastructure to manage this financial asset class just like you do in fungible tokens and what does that look like well it looks like in you know d5 nft crossovers for example there's a company called the neftify where you can deposit uh your nft and get a loan against that collateral because someone actually values that nft um another example is uh fractionalizing ownership in an nft there's a cool project called arc.gallery and they created this thing called wrapped crypto punk so imagine laura you see a crypto funk is a kind of blockchain collectible and imagine you see one and it's like too expensive it's like five thousand dollars what you could do is you could start a crowdfunding page with your friends and as soon as you crowdfund five thousand dollars you all of you together go and buy the crypto punk and you can co-own it together and the way that you own a cone it is you get an erc 20 token that represent partial ownership in the collectible all right so so if you contribute like 1 000 out of 5 000 you'll earn or you'll own 20 uh you know of the asset um and so those are two examples of financialization schemes uh that you could apply to this new asset class and then once you do own that um that 20 of the crypto punk then what can you do with it you can like license it to be used in a video or something and make money that way or well so this is where you know philosophically um i've been thinking a lot about like what what are the implications of you know uh fractionalization uh but generally speaking that means that if you like whatever uh decision that that the owners of the asset collectively make like let's say that you and i co-own an asset and we want to like sell it well that means that the proceeds of that sale will go proportionately to us proportionately to our ownership of it okay okay so it's just about owning and selling buying and selling yeah but there could be like other you know there could be other decisions that um that we might want to make as as asset holders right we might a museum might come to us and say jake laura will you um lend us your crypto punk to put on uh display in an art show and we might say yes but you know but you have to pay us ten dollars or something you know for the privilege of doing that and again we we we will split that revenue stream uh between us okay two dollars a piece [Laughter] so there are a few nfts that are also combining with d5 which is pretty interesting like avagochis which are a combination of ave the lending platform and tamagotchis which are these digital pets and um the avogoti will actually earn interest and then wearable has this like why nft which is like an nft based insurance cover underwritten by nexus i actually didn't fully really understand that but can you just talk a little bit about this trend and where you think what they're calling nft phi where you think it could go yeah well so so i love the idea of avagachi um because it's precisely this way of combining this really like fun um you know very grassroots very art artsy and cutesy and like collectibles focused side of the blockchain space with the much more serious um kind of financial uh application side of of the blockchain space and like the one thing i take away from all these like efforts that look a little bit cute today is that it educates a larger number of people about finance finance historically has always been you know something in the realm of you know academia and and and industry and and these days with the advent of the internet and especially with the advent of blockchain we're being like a lot more social about finance um finances spreading like if you've been reading about like how the younger generations have been trading on robin hood right and so when i look at avagache i think this is like a great way of starting to educate you know younger folks about what finance is and how it could be used as a tool so avogadro is you know combination of collectibles and on-chain uh lending there's also a project recently called meme uh where you would you take a a token and you earn these things called pineapples and then you can redeem the pineapples for rare limited edition artworks that they've created which is very interesting um you know and there's a ton of thinking about like nfts is a generally less liquid acid class than fungibles how do we make them more liquid right and this area of nft phi or nft times d5 whatever you want to call it you know it is doing a lot of work to to make that asset class more liquid and sort of more accessible to users all right well we're going to have to see where this goes it's definitely an interesting trend i don't know how um how much i believe it's going to take off but we'll see i i could see it happening maybe in gaming as a creator i'm definitely interested um but yeah i just as you can tell i have a lot of questions yeah go ahead can i give you an idea i'm going to make a bold prediction and my bold prediction is that there's a very good chance that the nft space can get on par with with what's happening in d5 let me tell you why i think that um if you've been following zapper zapper is sort of the premier wallet for defy opportunities that's out there in um like recently on twitter they published their august numbers um from their website and what those numbers showed is that they had about 20 000 daily active users and about 300 000 monthly active users and most people were kind of surprised they were like we thought you know there's like a hundred thousand users in d5 we thought maybe there's 200 000 you know monthly users of d5 but we did not think 300 000 and of course it doesn't it doesn't count everybody there's probably a bit more now if you take a look at um wearable uh wearable has been doing really well lately with the token they've got a lot of attention over the last couple of weeks these guys are doing about a hundred thousand uh monthly active users in the last month and so and that doesn't even count all of the other marketplaces for for nfts it doesn't count you know super air and maker's place and known origin and mint base and everything else and what you start to get a sense of is that um attention wise there's not a lot of growth that might have to happen in nfts for the number of people and nfts to get on par with the number of people in d5 and that's kind of an amazing fact that probably most people you know don't don't don't quite um don't quite realize and i'll tell you why i think that is i think that's because this idea of you know trading digital art or collectibles is it's a very um natural idea to people who aren't naturally tech and finance focused so if you go look at the d5 people they're all putting the y token into the z token into the x pool into that thing and i love doing that like i'm a finance nerd but most people they don't have the slightest idea of how to do that but if you tell them hey you could go on online and buy a piece of piece of art that's actually a very natural thing for them to do and so i think the nft space is building a lot of customer affinity and early mainstream adoption that defy just won't do as quickly huh that's that's fascinating i i can yeah i'll say your theory sounds plausible clearly this is a space i need to explore a little bit more because i was a little bit confused this week i was like why is this all taking off what's going on um but also i spent the last weekend at the beach so maybe maybe it just wasn't on twitter enough um anyway all right well this has been so fun uh thanks for coming on unconfirmed yeah thank you for having me laura don't forget next up is the weekly news recap stick around for this week in crypto after this short break how much in fees are you paying for

thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap first headline national banks can hold stable coin reserves big news regarding fiat back stable coins such as usdc and tether on monday the office of the controller of the currency said that federal chartered banks can hold the reserves for such coins although stablecoin issuers have been using u.s banks for years the regulatory environment surrounding such use has been murky the occ guidance has now made it clear that federally regulated banks should feel comfortable providing this to stablecoin issuers as long as they are backed on a 101 basis with fiat currencies publishing concurrently that securities and exchange commission released a statement from its fin hub unit which focuses on digital assets noting that certain stable coins might not be securities under federal law but each case would be decided on quote a facts and circumstances determination presumably fiat back stable coins are not securities but from previous cases such as base coin slash basis algorithmic ones could be next headline is the uniswap token a security in the latest twist to the uniswap sushi swap saga una swap went live with its token uni last week immediately crypto lawyers began saying they believe uni looks like an unregistered security first it was airdropped and airdrops quote may not spare you from securities regulation according to a 2017 coin center blog post which niraj agrawal its communications officer felt compelled to tweet out the night of the uniswap airdrop second as the price has shot up people may be interested in obtaining uni with the expectation of a profit rather than to utilize the network and the value of uni could be influenced by the efforts of an identifiable party uniswap and that would trigger the final prong of the so-called howie test which determines whether or not an investment contract is a security greg lisa a partner at huggin levels hogan levels he works on a case involving ether delta a crypto exchange that built itself is decentralized but which the sec determined was not said to the block quote this really looks like a blimp crash it can be seen from a mile away the biggest question is when not whether the sec and other regulators or law enforcement are going to say slash do something about this on a related note two bipartisan bills introduced to congress this week could clarify how the sec and the commodities futures trading commission handle tokens since tokyo can sometimes start out as securities but evolve into commodities once their networks are sufficiently decentralized one bill called the securities clarity act would explicitly define sec jurisdiction to token pre-sales as coin center puts it quote a non-security is being sold the future decentralized token but it comes with a contractual promise from the issuer which is the promise to build the token network as specified so that tokens will actually do something of value in the future the second bill proposes a way for the cftc to regulate us-based crypto exchanges and would give crypto exchanges the option to register as a digital commodity exchange or dce and any pre-sale tokens meaning those that started out as securities could only be traded on the cftc registered exchanges but only after the network is live a token is sold to the public there and at that point it would lose its security status next headline high gas fees have forced unilogan to shut down unilog and co-founder alex vandesant announced that the dap onboarding solution is closing up shop due to high gas fees on ethereum with the cost of onboarding a new user soaring to over 130 on some days although the provider considered a pivot to a layer 2 d5 focused wallet it would have required an almost total restart of the project unilogan has decided instead to return its remaining cash to investors adding that even if gas prices were to improve and it's uncover lessened it still can't imagine a way forward because ethereum's high gas fees do not appear to be a temporary problem in related news a progress report on eip 1559 ethereum improvement proposal 1559 which promises a significant change to ethereum's fee market was posted on wednesday first proposed by ethereum creator vitalik buterin in 2019 the transaction pricing mechanism for eip-1559 would offer a quote fixed per block network fee that is burned and dynamically expands and contracts block sizes to deal with transient congestion the main concern is that since eip1559 could stretch blocks up to three times their current size any denial of service attack could now be three times as effective next up analytics roundup dune analytics secures 2 million dollars in funding dragonfly capital led a seed funding round in ethereum centric analytics platform dune analytics which enables people to create their own charts and dashboards and share them with others for those of you who haven't yet tried duna analytics i highly recommend this resource which a lot of my own sources use to explain things to me next up in the roundup block native announces mempool explorer calling it a missing link in the ecosystem block native unveiled mempool explorer on wednesday which enables people to for instance detect when more than ten thousand dollars of liquidity moves into or out of a specific protocol or to find out when someone's smart contract is party to a pending transaction and more if you recall the story by dan robinson a paradigm about the ten thousand dollars that he tried to rescue from a smart contract but could not because a bot spotted his rescue attempt in the mempool and stole the money first that helps in explaining how this tool could be useful next defy roundup maker dow will not compensate victims of march's flash crash after initially deciding in early april to refund washed out investors from march's black thursday crash on tuesday larger mkr holders dominated a vote and decided against making whole those same investors who lost a cumulative 8.33 million dollars only 38 unique votes votes were cast the equivalent of 8.7 percent of all mkr token holders participants were incentivized to vote against any compensation because additional printing of mkr would dilute the value of their holdings tptc is now live the tbtc network which launched earlier this year but quickly pulled the plug has relaunched quote with unprecedented security measures in place allowing users to deposit and redeem bitcoin in d5 without intermediaries users can now exchange btc for tbtc which is an erc20 token for use on d5 platforms at a one-to-one ratio quote each tbtc is fully backed and matched by at least one bitcoin held in reserve yam looks forward after relaunch after a wild three-day launch and then crash in august last friday defy token yam relaunched by monday it had its first rebase with 571 thousand dollars in yusd added to its treasury next headline a new alternative to buy back and burn in a blog post joel monegro of placeholder capital examines the common buyback and burn model and points out that though this model works for currencies it has pitfalls particularly for governance tokens he writes quote when it comes to capital assets like governance tokens issuance is key to capitalization and burning can get in the way of growing fundamental value he defines currency as an asset whose value comes from exchange such as to consumer goods or to services however an asset used for governance or equity participation is capital he cites mkr and zrx as examples of networks that generate income and eth but then redistribute value via their governance tokens he says if you draw an analogy to buybacks in equities world stock buybacks typically do not result in shares being destroyed they tend to be held by the company as treasury shares and just reduce the number of outstanding shares on the flip side issuance is how a crypto network such as a dow or a protocol can obtain the resources it needs to scale he says quote this is why tools like mining proof of stake and liquidity rewards can work so well there's far more upside to smart issuance than there is in clutching to scarcity he then proposes a balancer smart pool balancer is one of those automated market makers and he proposes a smart poll that would be ten percent eth and 90 of a capital token that could function as what he calls quote an automatic buyback machine token issuance pool and liquidity provider since it would automatically rebounce rebalance by selling excess eth or the capital token to retain a specific ratio and that would function as a buyback his post gets even more in the weeds than this hopefully i haven't lost you all but it's definitely worth checking out for creative ways to provide liquidity in a token next headline how to value the wi-fi token the wi-fi token which governs yearn or y-earn was launched with the disclaimer that the token itself quote has zero value however investors disagreed with that initial assessment and fyi limited to only 30 000 tokens has reached a price as high as forty four thousand dollars since its launch but how should such a wide-ranging crypto network be valued the newly formed mechanism capital did a deep dive into potential valuation methods first dismissing the usefulness of total value locked which is a common metrics metric as well as price to earnings ratio the article then makes a case for two future oriented valuation models forward price to earning and discounted cash flow it presents base conservative and aggressive forecasts for the price of wi-fi with the bare case being for a token that's worth fifteen thousand eight hundred dollars and the aggressive case for a much higher three price token fifteen thousand five hundred dollars fun bits jack dorsey to speak friday at the oslo freedom forum i realize this is somewhat last minute but if you are listening
