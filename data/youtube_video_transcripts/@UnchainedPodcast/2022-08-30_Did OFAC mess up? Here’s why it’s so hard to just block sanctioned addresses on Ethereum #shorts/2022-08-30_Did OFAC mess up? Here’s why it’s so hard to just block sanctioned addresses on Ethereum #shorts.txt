even the first option you mentioned kind of quote unquote just blocking the addresses even that is technically far from trivial because what what is relatively easy is kind of to see if you see a transaction you can relatively easy see it has a from and it has a two however the two can very well be a smart contract and and you don't know what this contract will do and it's absolutely not trivial to figure out in advance what this contract will do so it's possible that you see kind of the promise fine the two is fine but then the two is a contract and it executes some complicated logic and it calls another contract and calls another contract and eventually this other contract then finally calls or sends money to to a sanctioned address
