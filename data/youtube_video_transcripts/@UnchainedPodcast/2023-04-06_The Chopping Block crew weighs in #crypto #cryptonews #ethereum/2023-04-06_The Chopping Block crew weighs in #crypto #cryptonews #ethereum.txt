whole thing is very odd and I have to imagine also a lot of these attackers are probably you know basically the equivalent of script kitties who are like living in Russia or something and they're like 14 years old and they just live on etherscan and they found some vulnerability and then once you do the hack like you can follow all the steps like okay first find it from tornado and then make sure you use a VPN and blah blah blah then you have the money and now once you have the money like there's no guide for like how to get the money out there's no guide for like how to deal with like wow everyone on the Internet is trying to get in contact with me what should I say to them what should I not say to them how do I avoid getting unmasked and you know I I have to imagine that that's where a lot of these hackers fall apart is not before the hack but after the hack like after the hack is done you know More Money More Problems like now you have to suddenly deal with the fact that you have 170 million dollars on your hands and like the entire world coming after you
