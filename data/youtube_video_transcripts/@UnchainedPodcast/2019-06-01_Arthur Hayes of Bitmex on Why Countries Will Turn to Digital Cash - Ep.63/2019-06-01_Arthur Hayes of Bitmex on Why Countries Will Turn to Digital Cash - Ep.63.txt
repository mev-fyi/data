sponsor by appreciate appreciate is building most valuable relationships on earth in each episode of Unchained ppreciate recognizes an individual or group and crypto for an achievement because kindness is contagious whoo and crypto will be recognized today stay tuned to find out I'm recording today from the coin desk consensus conference in New York City and my guest is Arthur Hays co-founder and CEO of bit Mex welcome Arthur thanks for having me what does bit mix do we are a crypto coin trading platform and essentially we give retail investors access to the financial markets using crypto Bitcoin right now and financial products but you don't actually trade Bitcoin itself right correct so you can't actually buy and sell physical Bitcoin on our platform you can't send us US dollars or some other fiat currency to buy Bitcoin or in northern point you can't change Bitcoin into ether or another coin as well so we are purely a contract based exchange trading derivatives and how does it work exactly I buy some Bitcoin I sign it tip it max you put in cold storage then what happens then you're basically credited with margin on the platform and each contract has a initial margin which is the minimum amount of cash you need to put up to trade that contract and then you're allowed to trade and your profit and loss is also denominated in Bitcoin and I know that there's leverage so how does that work I can trade with like 100x leverage correct so we have leverage specified in the contract details there isn't actually anyone borrowing or lending money on the platform it's purely synthetic so it's when long versus short so once I puts that 1% the other side puts that 1% then bit max's moves the variation margin or the pl between lungs and shorts so I don't even fully understand what that means when you sort of maybe speak in a more kind of every day sure so let's say that we made a bet $100 a notional bet but each of us only put up one dollar against this bet now the bit Max's role is we're sort of like the judge and we set the rules of the game we ensure that there's fair play on the platform and as the underlying price moves on which we bet we move the profit and loss between you and I Oh interesting okay and why 100x leverage because it's great because you know everyone knows 100x it's a nice round number I'd say very few people actually use the full hundred X leverage it's more of a headline number the average is about eight and a half times levered last time I checked but the good thing about it is you can place very short-term trades and potentially profit pretty quickly and on the downside your losses is limited to what you have put in so unlike treating traditional CFDs or maybe trading on margin on a equity brokerage account you actually in the traditional world put up your whole collateral base against any treats that you do so remember when the Swiss National Bank moved their peg there are actually people who were underwater to their brokers and their brokers had to suing them in court true recover those assets no a bit max even if a trade goes wildly against you the maximum you can lose is what you put in and so someone else explained this to me I interviewed Chelsea peril of Kraken so it's that if I have let's say you know 100 dollars and then I want to bet 10x or something like that if it drops what what percentage does that have to drop for me to go look what they did so on 100x leverage it would be a half a percent no obviously if you trade with less leverage that buffer between what you initially put in and where we stopped you out is greater but the maintenance margin on our most popular product the Bitcoin you install our perpetual swap is what as a half a percent so you put up 1% if the price moves against you by a half a percent then we liquidate your position okay okay yeah so that's how the losses get limited and you said that only very few people actually leverage 100 acts like what percent of people actually love her to that amount I don't have the full history a full breakdown but just on an average basis in the in the pool it's about eight and a half times leverage but people use 100 X 4 is usually either one they're trading on a very small size and they're trying to learn the platform or they're saying hey I think in the next 8 10 or 20 minutes the price of Bitcoin is going to go up I'll put a small amount on 100 X and I so almost like a small call option and if it hits yeah I'm gonna you know make some good return on equity but if my bet is wrong then I only lose a little bit interesting I wonder what would make anybody think that they could know what's gonna happen to the price of Bitcoin in the next 10 or 20 minutes I don't know I mean people have their own strategies that have charting indicators they have the change of how the order book up is and offers are stacked so you know there are there are systems some work some don't but you know with the study and care some people actually are able to on average make money interesting and what's your trading volume so in remain Oh last month in April we did about 3 billion US dollars a day on average on our platform so we have the most liquid platform in the world well and how does that how do those numbers compare to like you know a year ago or at some point in the past so year-on-year between 2016 and 2017 our volume went up about eighty-five hundred percent well and that was just all these retail investors coming in that we saw like during the ICO craze yeah absolutely so you know we're primarily a North Asian platform in terms of where our customers come from and obviously you have you know especially in Korea Japan these places where retail investors have really taken to the crypto markets and our driving volume interesting and you also recently launched these first your first options products what are these products and what enables you to launch them now so in Asia it will use least in Hong Kong where you know most of us are from the Asia the retail warrants market is very vibrant so what a warrant is is essentially say an investment bank will issue a call option on let's say $0.10 and as a buyer as a regional investor you can only buy this product you can't go next short so that the bank will issue the warrant and they'll make a market on the stock exchange for this particular warrant in this particular option now this is probably the most popular product that trades in Hong Kong Korea and Japan and you know we are a retail house you know we're very Asia focused so contrast to some of the other option ality products that are out there we wanted to focus on our core constituency so we launched these what we call them ups and downs so up for up side profit contract down for downside profit contract so it's in the form of a hundred and ten percent call option that expires in one week and a 90 percent put option with a 50 percent barrier knockout that expires in one week okay so I don't fully understand this so call option put option knock out barrier what are these terms so a call option basically means you have the right but not the obligation to participate over a certain level so let's say price of Bitcoin is ten thousand and the strike is eleven thousand by the end of the week so you pay a premium because essentially if the price goes over 11,000 you get exposure from eleven thousand to where it settles but you can't get liquidated on this position so let's say that the price goes from ten thousand to five thousand and it settles in the money at twelve thousand you paid your premium in full you would not get stopped out if these spot price moves against you and that's why this optionality comes at a price and why some people like to trade options rather than what we call the the Delta one product which is a futures contract or a swap contract okay that's one where you get liquidated if it does go down to four hundred okay so what's your vision of the full suite of products that you would like to offer and what needs to happen to be able to offer you to them so our goal as a company as the largest exchange in the world so we have a long way to go but you know we really want to make bit Mex a household name for treating of financial products in the crypto fear but we think the crypto sphere is going to eclipse the trading volume and other asset classes as you know bitcoin maybe it's not Bitcoin with all these coins gain value they're useful they do things and we have a whole ecosystem and people purely trade on a digital basis in this sort of framework and so we want to offer the full suite of financial products you would find in traditional finance in crypto so we've started out with you know speculative futures and swaps and options now that we've just launched our first volatility product we want to start helping people save so you know a big problem today is that interest rates globally are very low but asset prices food housing all these things keep going up so savers they need somewhere to put their money to earn a good yield so that they can provide for themselves now one way to do this in the structured product world is let's bitcoin is most volatile liquid asset in the world right now so traditionally in the equities space you could walk into your bank and they would sell you a product and that gives you a yield because what you're actually doing is you're selling volatility now a very volatile stock might be a thirty to forty percent annualized volatility now a bitcoin we're talking in you know 100 hundred twenty percent ain't no as volatility over the last few months so you can get very good yield pickup by selling Bitcoin volatility and that's earn income on your Bitcoin in Bitcoin which is very hard to do is to earn money on Bitcoin that is relatively safe right unsecured lending in Bitcoin not usually the best idea as many people have found out but you know so we're working on this the savings component to help people save and crypto one thing that we want to eat that we'll be rolling out later this year is the ability to use Bitcoin as collateral to trade single stock equity futures not single-stock equities so imagine you're sitting in a country where do you want to invest in Facebook and you know use this this product every day but you're not that wealthy so you don't have you don't have private banker is offering you a foreign brokerage account or you just don't meet the minimums to to start trading into the United States what we can do is we can use your Bitcoin and allow you to trade very small amounts of stock with no leverage fully collateralized and so you can actually participate in some of the blue chip companies that you use every day even though you don't have direct access into the US stock market so we hopefully will have this product out q3 or q4 of this year it's really interesting but the way that works is when you see fully collateralized so I want to buy you know some let's say a share of Facebook I don't know what it do you know where the price is maybe $100 I'm not sure okay it's a hundred so then I have to put $100 worth of Bitcoin up for as collateral but and then if the price of Facebook falls then what happens so the bitcoin is collateralized we will take that Bitcoin converted in to a dollar credit so you no longer have Bitcoin exposure the corniest dollar price exposure you don't have a synthetic US dollar can it exists on on the pit mechs platform you use these synthetic dollars to then purchase a swap contract from the entity that we'll be using for this product and this swap contract basically tracks a share of Facebook plus any dividends or corporate actions so you'll actually receive the total return of the stock not just the price appreciation as if you were holding a share of stock but you actually hold a derivative wow that's that's really interesting and I just wanted to go back also to the savings you were saying that you were going to offer people interest on the Bitcoin that they put up so how do you manage that how do you make that happen so initially that will be will be working with on a wholesale basis so there are there are very various companies around the world that do this in the traditional equity space and now we're moving into crypto now because you have volatility that we can buy as a platform because we're selling it on this the other end on this retail product we can on a wholesale basis structure a deal whereby we give somebody say I don't know 1% a week income on a fully fully collateralized Bitcoin notional that they provide to us and now this platform will have clients and they will repackage that and then they will sell this savings product on on to that interesting so just to go back to the recent options products that you you started offering those came about because you had the liquidy that you needed to offer them as far as I understand from what I read so in order to offer these other products that you're mentioning like what how how much how does the space need to develop further in order to be able to offer those it's really just about structuring at the end of the day and putting in place the proper legal entities working with the right companies to push these out to the market it's really it's just it's boxes arrows and lawyers at the end of the day as a banker we're all very familiar with okay and why not do a more typical crypto exchange where you're actually just trading the assets well if you look at the traditional world an FX trading for example derivatives trade 3 to 4 maybe if you differ iliyan dollars a day or something something crazy and amount of derivatives that trade in the FX markets versus this the spot market and so when you're actually not constrained by moving assets between counterparties you actually can do many more things and you have in my opinion you have a much more defensible business and you have the ability to actually charge money for things I think that spot trading of crypto will tend to zero in terms of the fees because at the end of the day it's a commodity it's a commoditized product if you look at banks on the wholesale basis treating cash effects is not that profitable but the derivatives on top of that is insanely profitable and so we we want to move into a derivative space better defensible business it's our wheelhouse in terms of risk management and where we come from in our past professions maybe this is what we're seeing play out with Robin Hood announcing that they're gonna for services that will be competitive to coin basis and coin based as you know offers or charges somewhat high fees so maybe that's what's happening there so one other thing I wanted to ask you about was the leverage trading you said or I've seen that other people say that the kind of lever trading you offer is more like gambling what do you say to them well it's it's not like gambling because there is not a predetermined notion that you will lose money so but you walk into a casino and you play a certain game you know with a hundred percent certainty that you will lose money over time in that game now in our particular situation number one that Mex in our main markets is not making the market it's a two sided market place there's buyers and their sellers so it's essentially like a pair mutual pool of people treating against each other it's more like a game of poker and we take a slight rake or trading commission from matching trades so technically speaking it is not gambling because you don't know that you're going to lose money the second you step onto the platform all right and who are your customers and how they evolved over time its retail it's still a retail at for Mom and I think you know while there's a lot of hype about them dozen banks getting into crypto they're not there yet you do have a smattering of some of the more smaller prop shops who basically managed just to partner's money so they don't have outside LPS which makes it easier to do things but the end of the day what drives crypto is retail traders it's people who you know like the volatility they they like the stories the personalities the press price appreciation and then the falls so it's it's still a very retail phenomenon they're the ones driving the volume they're the ones who are reddit and telegram and all these other places talking about crypto it the banks the hedge funds gets through investors they're just not involved yet and why do you primarily focus on Asia I was writing out this one from in terms of my career for the Russian I've been in Hong Kong for ten years but at the other day I think Bitcoin itself you know Western context say us Western Europe the not really presented that big of a value proposition for people because things work maybe don't work the best but you know you can use a credit card you can get open a bank account you can you know go on your etrade or Scottrade or whatever account and trade in the most liquid retail stock market in the world you can buy so options you can do all these these nice things in this context you move to Asia Latin Africa these markets where you have your you know very low baking presence but you have a thirst for people who want to trade we want to get involved in financial products so when you have something that comes online which is you know a 24/7 market low barriers in terms of amount of capital that was required to enter the market you really have something that people don't have and so when they can trade however they want trade financial products that then they don't get in the traditional sense trade something else other than over overvalued equities and property which in a lot of developing markets you know when you get some money what do you do you go and buy an apartment now as you know our apartment prices relative to median income are very very high especially in and you know China for example or Hong Kong where I spend most of my time so any chance that the population can actually buy and sell something other than stocks and property they gravitate toward so that's why I think that Asia and some other developing markets cuz we really gonna see the sole of crypto developed interesting one other thing I want to ask you about was I feel like some people say that the crypto world in Asia is different from that of the West do you think that's true and if so what trends do you see in that regard absolutely I think the crypto world and in the West is obviously very VC dominated the types of people who were involved you know there's obviously the early movers and they're very eccentric in the way they are but you know you come to New York everyone knows what crypto is because the financial center you know and the valley those type of people who are involved but in Asia it's very organic it's very its raw it's you know people just trying to make a living Trading crypto new projects there's no VC funding to be had because there are no VCS maybe outside of China that are that that are that active or that forward-thinking to invest in these sort of things because most of the money is from tycoons or families they know property why buy a building I know my cap rate I'm gonna make this percent a relatively low risk and if you tell them well invest in this crypto startup that may go to zero pretty quickly they don't really have that risk appetite so it has to have been a very grassroots movement from the get-go there's no DCG or that there's been Boucher isn't finishing like a big force out there that's that's a new that's a new thing they they're primarily active instead of instead of China but you know if you're talking to three years ago in terms of who was around to help jumpstart things these guys weren't there and any of the brand name West West Coast US VC outfits we're definitely not investing in Korean Chinese Japanese then you name it Asian country crypto startups so interesting so how so you're saying that the those startups out there they're getting funded how so like through icos and you just built a real business and made money so there wasn't you know either either you you built a product that the market wanted or you failed rather you know if you come to the US and Western Europe you can build a shitty product but you can keep raising ABCDE right maybe IPO and then dump the on the retail like that's the that's the model so you really don't actually have to build a real business over here might be successful yeah I won't name names but there's a company over thinking about maybe I went through a network of its and still raised a ton of money but didn't gain water traction what's your background how did you come to launch pit max so I used to be an ETF trader in Hong Kong I started out at which bank and then I moved to city and around May of 2013 I got called to my boss's office and I was fired you know job cuts so I had a lot of time on my hands and I really wanted to do something different because I could recognize that there's a secular decline in what you can do at the bank you know there weren't the you know what traders making ten million dollars a year anymore you're lucky if you never to the crisis after the crisis you know if you management you're lucky to make one to two million dollars and you're busting your ass and dealing with all the politics and I was like well I need to do something different and so you know I happened I've heard about Bitcoin and earlier in the year when it went to 250 and then so I started researching or the white paper and then obviously because I'm a trader I said well what what are the financial products out there to trade how does what's the exchange ecosystem like and I stumbled upon an exchange called IC bit which was I think the first futures platform that launched in 2011 her chest I'm not really sure but they they had a Bitcoin US dollar futures contract and myself and a lot of other people who have come to actually meet in real life over the years we were trading heavily on this on this contract so as well this is a very inefficient market the strategies that I used to employ at the investment bank are definitely still relevant in this market and you know over the next like six months I became a little dissatisfied with the progress that that platform was making and I thought well I know if I want to make a real business out of being a crypto being a trader is very difficult to do profitably over a long stretch of time so I need to build a real business out of this and so I thought well I know derivatives and I reached out to my network I found my other two co-founders Ben dealer and Sam Reid Ben as a background in hft technology Sam is a more full stack web developer cloud architect and we came together I pitched them this idea for a derivatives only platform in crypto and we started in 2014 and you know we've been we've been doing this for four years now and what were your revenues last year I think we were in Bloomberg I think it's somewhere around 80 something million dollars that we that we made last year doing quite well yes it's uh it's we've caught the wave and I'm you know very fortunate that we got involved and we did and we've built a platform that people actually like trading on how does that feel to just create something out of nothing and have it be so successful especially kind of early in the crypto wave yeah I think it's gratifying more so than the money to hear people come up to you and say like you know they loved your platform that they trade on it every day or people who have changed their lives in terms of what they've been able to make because they've been trading crypto and successfully and I like doing right by our clients is the first thing they want to make sure that we run a fair and honest platform because you don't want to be if you want to come to consensus and walk around and feel proud about what you've built and you don't want people trying to come up to you saying you stole money from them or it's not the other thing you want people to come up to shake your hand and say I really appreciate what you've what you've put out there so I think that's something that we really appreciate when people come up to us and talk to us about the platform that's great and I think something else that's really interesting about your businesses that I've heard you say that you make money even when the market is going down can you talk about how that works so essentially we match trade so for every long is a short so whether or not that market goes up or down as long as there's trades we take Commissioner on that now you know obviously and Bitcoin in most assets it just it's a staircase up in an elevator down so when things go down obviously people all the things that they were told about Bitcoin of why they shouldn't get involved those thoughts are ringing in their head like oh it's a scam and we lose all my money my wife and my partner said this say my coworker said you're an idiot for getting involved and all this emotion this makes them panic so and it's everyone rushing for the exit at the same time that generates all this volatility and obviously the more volatile the market the more trades that happen on the platform so you know on intensely down days we usually do the best in terms of trading volume on the platform oh wow and what are your fees um on what's popular product we can take in that five basis points great so in a moment we're going to talk about the Bitcoin price and bit Mex is really well done research reports but first a quick break to tell you about our fabulous sponsors blockchain warehouse is an international blockchain accelerator offering a wide range of token sail advisory services to promising blockchain based ventures

listeners to nominate a friend to get props in a future episode of unchained just go to ppreciate org slash recognize that's pre sheet or such recognition CEO of bit max you've predicted that bitcoin will hit fifty thousand dollars by year's end why do you think that i like big round numbers so people talk about those number one number two right if we go by last year we went from 1,000 to twenty thousand at the peak so but a 20x uptick if you know if really this whole narrative of traditional players get dipping their toes in a crypto people putting 1 million five million dollars into this space and obviously as a marginal buyer that should live prices and i don't think we we have the potential to appreciate as fast as we did last year so I chose a round number of you know 5x of 10,000 50,000 Oh interesting okay so okay so it's not like based on any kind of prognostication around like how much institutional money will come in or I have no idea at the end of the day and no one anyone who claims they do you know have them trade for a while and I probably was all their money so you know I'm in the game of expected value not in being right or wrong at a particular price target okay and I want to hear about the year of 2017 from your perspective this is actually a question I'm asking a number of people because I think it was such a pivotal year and you have this unique vantage point of having been in Asia and also at bit Mex which you know as we were just talking about how such high volumes so what did the Year look like from from your point of view and how did things change I think it was the start of the year was amazing because we had hit a thousand dollars which was a massive milestone for the industry we have broken started in about 2015 or we have broken through $300 which was a massive resistance point and two clips at the thousand dollar mark we thought okay Ramos back to the high of mt.gox which was in 2013 yeah late 2013 and so as a psychological number for bitcoins you have gotten back above water versus 2013 was as everyone was ecstatic and then you know right after that you had all of the project stations from the PBOC trying to calm down the market and then the fever of buying in China so no I just thought you know maybe we'll get to 2,000 3,000 by the interview because you know a thousand was such it was so hard to get to a thousand and so usually you'll spend some time consolidating before your the market ratchets higher but what actually happened is that you know the media finally took a notice to crypto and they started to publicize what was happening in this space and sort of this awareness building of oh holy like big poins back to her it was it didn't die is not full of a bunch of criminals and scammers there might actually be something here and that really started the positive momentum of 2017 in that you know conferences started you know feeling getting filled attendee levels were up you have major financial media outlets basically doing a crypto story every day I remember back in 2013-2014 if Bloomberg Wall Street Journal of New York Times wrote one article about BIC what everyone was like holy they just wrote an article about Bitcoin we'd be talking about it for like a week and now you have essentially you know a crypto section on most of these online properties where you know you're talking about all sorts of things related to mining and crypto trading icos all this sort of stuff so that that started it then we had the ICO boom everyone thought I caught on to this method of raising money and and that further fueled the attention that was coming to this space and and then took us into the summer of 2017 now obviously we had the issue surrounding the soft fork and the creation of Bitcoin cash and this contentious moment of how are we going to solve scaling and we'll segue get activated and so the market thought okay well it's the major hindrance to us moving even higher I think around 3000 or something at that point I never was oh my god if if Bitcoin heart Forks like what's gonna happen people are gonna know what to do like you log on to your your your trading account like you know some newbie how do they know which Bitcoin to buy and everyone's like oh my god if we have two things named Bitcoin it's like the end of the world and that was proven false we had a heart for Bitcoin casters created Bitcoin was there and trading farms on both rows and so that that fear vaporized and so then we moved higher again and even as regulators try to tame this market with their words there was just too much attention and people were feeling - positive about the different narratives that had fallen and impediments - why the corner any other crypto point couldn't move higher so as we moved into the fall you know these roadblocks just keep kept getting chipped away and then we had the Segway 2x debacle and where was that call that  coin 2x and at the last minute the miners pulled in about-face and said actually no we're not gonna support this and that was another roadblock removed from Bitcoin way higher and then I think the coup de Grasse for 2017 was the see me and CBOE futures launch the fact that they would stake the reputation of their exchange to do this product meant that people really thought there was something here that they're willing to go through all of the reputational issues associated with Bitcoin when you're talking very conservative finance institutions for the largest exchange in the world to launch a futures product in terms of sentiment was a was a game changer that's what took us to 20,000 and as everything in trading buy the rumor sell the fact right after that you know we fell about 50% down into 10,000 so I think 2017 was a year of straw man narratives that had been many people's minds of why Bitcoin couldn't move higher where there was a you know catharsis around this level we move past it and people you know there's no reasons why you wouldn't own Bitcoin if you know these different narratives were proven not to matter interesting it I like it I agree well with a lot of what you said your company releases a lot of really well done research reports in crypto and they really go into you know kind of a deep level of detail and it's so it's a level of research that I wouldn't say is really necessary for someone that does the kind of trading that is available on your site so why do you even publish them at all I mean a bit max we want to create a brand of being thought leaders of being correct of actually educating rather than just giving sound bytes and so when I think of why a lot of people trade with a particular investment bank because they had excellent research I pay a lot of money personal money for particular financial offers because they write it thoughtful insightful research and I want bit max to be known as a brand where we support intellectual curiosity intellectual honesty and I think a lot of what is written in the crypto space is trash and so we wanted to actually go into the details I mean I know a lot of people are too busy to read a thousand two thousand word paper on something related to crypto but if you actually wanna understand what you're trading if you actually want to make informed decisions you need to put in the time and so we want to give people all the tools that if they do want to invest in themselves and educate themselves they can find true and correct information presented and a well-thought-out matter and so that's why we've created this research property that's great I definitely agree with everything you said there I was just just in my panel at consensus and we were talking about how like people buy things that they don't understand and as journalists a lot of people because we all already know it like we assume that the reader already knows it but you know they don't and I agree that if you're gonna buy anything in this space you should definitely know what you're buying and you also you have a lot of really salty opinions in the crypto space and I wanted to find out what you think is one of your more controversial opinions maybe I think some people were not happy with our public stance against hard forks came out very strongly against like all hard Forks are just know I think that's what we were what we didn't like is that people were forcing the technical work onto the exchanges rather than building a good tech stock taking the time to make something good and then coming to say to the market saying hey we're doing an airdrop here's this new coin and and we want the exchange to support it but when you hack together some code really quick and then expect every exchange to you know run around like headless chickens getting their back-end ready and their wallets ready to support you I guess felt that that was a very bad precedent to set to set and that's why we came out so strongly against it because at the end of the day what we don't want to happen is for customers to lose money because the exchanges were not prepared enough to deal with a new iteration of a coin with different block chains and all these different things that make it very difficult to keep customers funds safe because another day we don't want to end up ever having an event where we lose customer funds because we weren't able to properly prepare for a new coin and is that what are you talking about like Bitcoin gold and Bitcoin is not okay yeah so what does happen like if I am trading on bit mix and I've given you you know like five bitcoins or something and then Bitcoin gold comes out what happens at that moment can I not get those back alright so we've made a very public stance in that you know if you have Bitcoin in the platform we will give you back Bitcoin you are not entitled to get any of these other coins should they happen we encourage people to withdraw their money split their coins and then come back to the platform now there's a very interesting derivative trades around these these different Forks because our futures contract will settle on on Bitcoin but if you hold a portion of your Bitcoin does not need it for the margin off off the platform you can essentially receive it's almost like ex-dividend event so if you you know say the futures contract is trading at par or the same value as the spot index I can buy Bitcoin before the hard work happens put a portion of that a bit Mex is margin sell the futures contract at at par take my Bitcoin in my own wallet now when the the ex-dividend or the the fork happens I I split my coins and I receive essentially this income from this coin because it'll have a nonzero value I sell that for more Bitcoin and now a futures contract should also dip in price relative to the index to reflect the dividend that was just paid so we saw is the futures contract maybe a few weeks before would be trading at power or premium to the spot index but right before the heart fork happened the futures contract would go into a deep discount in some cases and so this is a very profitable basis trade to put on for people who you know thought a bit about what was happening and the implications of splitting coins and how people would hedge so let's say that some of them something up and the market negative reacted to this particular heart fort you didn't want to be hedged so people would over hedge with futures contracts with the cause i'ma treated a discount but if you put on this trade a little bit in advance of that you could take advantage of what we call the basis moving it to a discount okay so I don't know if I fully understand that I think what you're saying though is that like basically you can make money from both you can you can do a kind of trade where you both get the let's say it's Bitcoin gold but as well you also benefit from the margin tree that you've done correctly okay wow that's really interesting do you know how many like what percentage of your users figured that out not really sure but you know we published I think I published a play-by-play of this trade in one of the the crypto trigger digests and you know it happened it firstly happened with a Bitcoin cache and then subsequently for the other Forks that happen or later in the year this same trade worked again and the best part about this trade was even after it was announced that the the fork would happen and you knew the date the futures contract would not reflect that's in the basis she could actually wait to certain of when the event was happening put the trade on at par and then still make a profit it's amazing how inefficient the Bitcoin market is well yeah this frame may not work like in a year or something correct okay interesting you have also said that you said that you foresee a battle between true decentralized cryptocurrencies and digital fiat currencies how do you see that fight playing out I want to say it's a battle I think they're going to coexist so a I think of coins well that coin when I say a digital society needs digital cash we're moving into the digital age digital cache is needed and so government's will respond because from a from a policy perspective banks commercial banks don't always follow the direction of the central bank or the government it's very inefficient that the government has to rely on commercial banks to issue currency effectively and make loans because maybe the government wants to target a particular group of people or assets to provide credit to but the banks don't want to do that right so why should the government of the central bank issue currency directly to the people and have the commercial banks operate nodes on this essentially private blockchain and so I think that is what we're going to move to as a system where we all have an app loans and our credit and what we spend is directly everything's monitored by the government think attacks every single financial transaction and you exactly what you spend your money on and they can shut you out from the financial system if you don't behave and we're seeing a semblance of this starting in China with sesame credit where people are being blocked from buying flights or insurance or anything else because maybe they have said something that is not in agreement with the central government or even one of their friends has said something and so I think other governments are going to look to this and you know in in effect China is already almost to the point where everything is digital cash because of WeChat pay but obviously we type a is a a private company and I think the PBOC what we know that PBOC is working on a you know electronic rim and B so you'll see a country like China or Russia or one of these you know developing countries who have massive issues with what is said at the top with actually what policy is implemented from the commercial banks it makes sense of them that issue currency directly to the people and completely control everything and cut the banks out of all these other actions that they do against the wishes of the government and so you will have a wallet in the future where all of your financial transactions will be in an electronic fiat currency now obviously many people want to have financial privacy and/or they want interoperability between different domiciles and that's where I think crypto will fit in or Bitcoin you know some coin will be that medium where people who want financial privacy or who want to make a payment to someone that isn't recorded by the government will use one of these systems so I do not think that it will replace electronic for yet but rather they'll serve two different purposes interesting so then we will have certain coins that are kind of like what's the word adversarial to governments and then syriza diverse areas serve a different because they serve a different function and then but then we're also gonna have these sort of like surveillance coins I guess I might call them but do you see the surveillance coin model taking off in a place like the u.s. I really don't I think it'll be a it'll be a fight but at the end of the day the US government controls the issuance of money if they all of a sudden to say now everyone must get if they pull in India so India last year Modi basically said I want to digitize the Indian financial system and they've roll up the system I think it's called add par which is they put biometric data in a centralized database for something like 1 billion people and so what he's trying to do is basically move in there which is very cash for the economy very inefficient there's no oversight in terms of what taxes are paid or not paid to a digital world and overnight he said in one month time these bills are now worthless and you must tender them to the bank and bring this money into the banking system and now we want people to use digital payments I remember my my squash coaches is Indian and he was complaining that no the he had to go to the consulate and turn in his passport and get this electronic version because they're trying to move everything to an electronic basis so they can track it better now this is very disruptive to the Indian economy and the effects of it are still being felt many older and poor people who didn't have access to queue in line all day and you know forgo income to tend to their money now found they had stacks of of worthless paper and they're in their bed so the u.s. in America and countries if they really want to ram shot this down the throats of the people will just do it and at the end of the day what's it's convenient enough for middle-income people to pay all their bills using an app the convenience will trump any of this notion of financial freedom huh interesting I still I still feel like the way that our political system works there will be a big brouhaha if some of this stuff goes down here so I can't imagine it like people like just rolling over and allowing it to happen well I mean people post all the data on Facebook and they see what happened and that was a voluntary situation so I'm sure people if it's convenient if it's with the government though it's like a little bit different like yeah at the end of the day if you go to China it's extremely convenient WeChat pay and you literally do not use cash for anything whether you're at buying a piece of watermelon on the street or buying a drink at a bar no one's using cash anymore no ones you've been using credit cards or any sort of plastic it's a QR code it's WeChat pay and so this is the future of digital payments and when you experience this convenience you will wonder why do we have to deal with credit cards and cash and all these these different things from a convenience perspective yeah I agree with you in the convenience perspective what I am not certain about is that China doesn't have the same kind of press that we do here in the US so I feel like maybe the Chinese are not aware about the kind of privacy issues of using WeChat whereas like I feel like in the US because of the role that the press play is people might have more awareness but you're right that so far they've they've been happy to sign away all their privacy rights but there's more awareness now so who knows hopefully we'll see we will see which are positioned better to capitalize on the growth of the crypto space institutional players that are entering crypto now like the goldmans and the intercontinental exchanges or pure crypto businesses I think that will succeed relative what their expectations are so obviously a bank in a finance institution looks at crypto when they see ok can I bring on a hundred million US dollar a year business onto my onto my bank and I may be a staff 510 people in this desk that is as a management decision ok that's that's a decently profitable desk now if they've seen the asset appreciation the interest from their clients from their employees for this new this new space maybe they make a view that okay well maybe this asset class is going to be a thing and I'm going to invest some time and money kind of overcoming some of the issues in the crypto space from a financial institution perspective now from you know a pure crypto business those players getting involved is great because a lot of the problem without a pure crypto businesses is they rely on some way shape or form some form of liquidity and the cost of that business is essentially the hedging costs or the transaction fees are all these sort of things that are baked into that product that they were trading the more liquidity in the market that cheaper it becomes for them to offer their service the more people they can hit with a very low price point and so I think it's sort of they'll help each other in that in that respect and they'll both achieve the goals for their constituencies yeah I interviewed when Cisco saw reserves a bow and he was telling me about how in a previous business of his that they did not see competitors as hurting them at all and in fact they just saw their business grow and grow because it created like a category like people began to recognize you know they might have been the first movers but that once all these competitors came in then suddenly like people recognized that this was a legitimate thing to do was Bank online I also want to ask you about it ICO is what problems you currently see with IC OS and how do you think I SEOs can be revived so I think most ICS are dark and the bigger problem what I've seen happen is I actually fully support the premise that someone should be able to put my website at the corner ether address people will voluntarily give them funds and receive a token in a project that will be used in in some way shape or form but what is what this is morphed into is essentially another way of private block funding people through their people are using these saft agreements sale simple agreement for a future tokens yes so this has become a very popular document and essentially what you have is all the same players are gues investing in these new technology projects and instead of a series a you just do a massive staff and collect ten million dollars like you don't actually need to do a public sale you've gotten the money it's not it's not intuitive and so that everything that really goes against what the ICO is good at and the way I see this correcting is right now you have way too much paper out there relative to product that's being built or organic demand in the secondary as people as a you know the rank-and-file traders keep buying these shitty deals and seeing the price underperform almost immediately versus their ICO price they're gonna be less reticent to purchase into whatever the small public round is of these what's you know majority is saft raised issuance and so as that happens these VCS are going to see immediate market or market losses on these agreements that they put in place now for a traditional VC they don't really have a mark to market because their investments don't really get any liquidity or any real objective price only every like once one or two years when they do another round now if it you're going to your LPS interesting a holy I'm down 30% on all these different positions they're gonna say no this token let's go back to doing what we usually do because the token the eyes one of the good things about ICO is is it gives transparency to what the project is actually work worth relatively quickly and that will not go bode well for most VC firms who in general you know matters are pretty bad at investing money they lose money they take their two-and-twenty or whatever but once it's being shown that one month after they've signed this aft coins trading it's down then they'll be reticent to put money into these things where the liquidity event is so immediate and is down and that will scare them away from I think this saft style investing and I SEOs will move back to building a community organically trying to get people to donate money to a project that they really believe in because the founding team is in - time and effort building a real product meaning that you think it should go the realm of not selling to accredited investors but to retail investors again I think that that is that I think that is accomplishing something revolutionary but what about the regulatory issues cuz the reason why they are shifting is because there's concern about regulators coming in I think that there's going to be more and more regulators who will be ico friendly because at the end of the day there are jobs to be had in in this field and the service right a law firm accountants all these sort of people are making a lot of money on this I see oh well not the coverage no not the government but some governments this may be very us centric context when you say ISO regulations but you have places like Japan South Korea who are enacting ico bills they're putting in place ok here's you know what we think is not super up about an ICO if you abide by these guidelines we're okay with it whereas when you move this certain other countries you know they're just like sitting there like with no it was - on - mines do we regulate this out of existence in our territory or we become business friendly because we want the jobs and we want the lawyers and everyone else to get paid off all this so I think there's that that Tut that the tug and governments usually who are much smaller in terms of the amount of population they command who have to create new industries for their people will think let's bring this type of thing to our jurisdiction and these these essentially you can provide them cover because I think that the whole point of a nice ero is that anyone with an internet connection in an address and a wallet I put up a website see they're gonna do something and see if the market wants to contribute to their product that I think is powerful yeah and we are seeing the smaller jurisdictions like Singapore and Malta and Gibraltar and stuff be welcoming so we'll see how that plays out I read that you don't personally own any crypto is that still true correct yes so that's interesting why because I'm already very long crypto as a industry because of my ownership stake my position at bit Mex so as a risk risk management you don't need to layer risk on risk and so for every day people would you recommend that they trade crypto or that they buy an Codel it depends on the amount of effort that they're willing to invest in this if you just want to you know dip your toes in see what's going on buy a very very very small amount of you know whatever few coins that you think are worthy of your investment put them away forget the bottom for five to ten years early they'd be worth zero or a lot for those who want to invest in learning about the crypto markets I would say yes trait but don't think that you're just gonna watch a chart or you know you're gonna log on to your account and all of a sudden you're gonna start making money immediately just because you you heard your friend down the street or you saw his Lambo because he's been training you know Bitcoin and coins very very profitably the last few years that you're going to do that without putting in the time and the effort to learn a new craft because you do have to if you want to be a full-time trader you need to be in all the chat rooms the reddit reading talking to people it's a full-time job and so I don't want to disabuse people that people think it's easy to make money in crypto maybe you get a few wins but if you want to create a real income stream out of this and lower the volatility your earnings you actually have to do the work we're in this phase right now where there's kind of a number of technical obstacles that need to be overcome like around scaling and maybe these you know transitions to from proof of work to proof of stake what technical changes do you see coming that you're either most interested in or that you're most doubtful of or that you think are most exciting I guess I don't we spend too much time looking at the super technical aspects of relevant Locke can be had number one I don't have that sort of background to fully understand what is going on on that on that front but I think that obviously everyone recognizes that if we want to build a new financial services system in this crypto sphere that you know bitcoins you slow theorems to slow all these and there's different ways of doing that and some people building completely new ways consensus algorithms me the work people they won't but I have it I don't really have a particular thing that I'm super excited about but I know that there's very smart people working on this and that the best thing about this is there's a huge FedEx reward for someone who can solve the issue where can people get in touch with you and learn more about your work we have a blog that bit Mex comm where we have our research and my crypto digests and obviously our main website for people who can who are lawfully allowed to trade on bit Mex WWF XCOM right which is not American it's right all right great well
