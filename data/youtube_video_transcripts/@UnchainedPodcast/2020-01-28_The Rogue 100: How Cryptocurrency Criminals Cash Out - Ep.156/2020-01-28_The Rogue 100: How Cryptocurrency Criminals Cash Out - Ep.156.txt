hey Laura thanks for having us you're in the middle of releasing your big 2020 crypto crime report and it's been making waves Congrats why don't we just start with a brief description of what chain Ellis's does overall and then I why don't you talk about what the crypto crime report is and how that fits into your overall work so searching on Isis is the blockchain analysis company we provide compliance and investigation software to the world's leading institutions including government agencies financial institutions and cryptocurrency businesses essentially we're empowering everyone to prevent money laundering and comply with regulations to ensure that there can be a fair and open marketplace for cryptocurrencies and that really entails us mapping how cryptocurrencies are used in the real world and understanding the different use cases from the legitimate use cases to the illicit uses of cryptocurrency the 2020 cryptochrome report is really about mapping out how different actors are abusing cryptocurrencies to further their aims and we unpack different types of money laundering hacks scams and other types of illicit activity to give everyone an idea about how much is going on what trends are changing but also to put that in context of how is this related to the overall cryptocurrency economy so big picture what trends are you seeing in crypto crime now especially compared to previous eras in crypto so I think we we essentially like to track the different types of activity that are consistent across the different years and we we've definitely touched on this year we're really focused on what is the actual money laundering schemes that are enabling this type of criminal and illicit activity so we have focused a lot of this report at least primarily on you know what is financial crime how are criminals taking their proceeds from you know whether it be scams whether it be hacks into exchanges or ransomware and how actually are they moving then out of cryptocurrency into the traditional financial ecosystem and that's why we've spent quite a lot of this report and been able really for the first time to map out how those different types of actors are taking different steps to move from cryptocurrency into traditional finance okay so before we go a little bit into more detail I also wanted you to define crime for the purposes of your report you know you name some things like ransomware and how and scams and stuff but could you kind of give I guess a list or maybe not a list but you know just identify which transactions you're calling criminal and also which cryptocurrencies you're tracking because I imagine you can't track all of them sure so in this in this piece of research that we'll talk about is it's really about where cryptocurrency has actually been directly used to perpetrate a crime so for that we're thinking about terrorist financing has someone actually raised in a public campaign the financing for an act of terror has some cryptocurrency being stolen from one of the exchanges and in a hack we also identify something like ransomware where the crime is that someone has had a computer locked and the payment and the extortion is paid in encrypted currency the majority of the activity that we track in this report is Bitcoin but it but it also extends to other other different cryptocurrencies they'll be we track around 50 different crypto currencies and actually whether it's in the report or in the background research we're really looking at all of those different cryptocurrencies to see what types of illicit activity is occurring on those block chains and when you say it's mostly in Bitcoin is that because that's what's primarily used or because that's where you have the best analytics so we focus our analytics on where the majority of the economic activity is and so our best analytics is in Bitcoin but it is also the predominant way that people are moving value across the world whether it's for legitimate purposes but also for the illicit uses and we also see that the most liquid markets and some of the amounts of money that we're talking in this report are you know fairly large sums into the billions of dollars and there you need you need the market that it that has the most liquidity and that has meant that you know bitcoin is still really predominant in the world of illicit activity in cryptocurrencies and when I asked you for you know which types of activity you would count as criminal you didn't mention dark net market activity where I believe mineiro is quite popular is that also included so yes we we also do track that we have still in the dark net markets there's there's actually not a lot of activity beyond Bitcoin so the the dark net markets are definitely evolving in their business models and how they store cryptocurrency that typically if they want to be able to access a large audience of buyers the vendors themselves are still accepting Bitcoin because that's where the majority of users are still comfortable to spend their cryptocurrency alright so now let's dive into some of the finer details of the report as you mentioned the money laundering aspect is kind of a linchpin of these crimes since obviously the crime isn't really complete until they have the money and Fiat which they can use more easily so how are these criminals generally cashing out of their crypto nowadays we have been aware for quite some time of this money laundering infrastructure that has been that has been growing and becoming more sleek I guess and we wanted to for the first time take that take that on for this report and so we've known about it for quite some time but this is our first attempt to slake let's try and quantify the numbers what what is actually happening at scale and what is flowing through these this laundering infrastructure and so that really inspired this money laundering section which which was recently released and will be fully released when the full crime report comes out and that was a really intensive process that started with let's just look at where the illicit funds are flowing to based on the the distribution of deposit addresses that are receiving those illicit funds and we noticed that there was a really high concentration of illicit funds going to a small number of deposit addresses which was something that was kind of weird and we so it confirmed some suspicions that we had that there's a few you know bad actors that are you know potentially in the business of laundering money at scale and so we we kind of um merged that with some other research we had been doing on OTC brokers that we have been that have been a part of past investigations and we found that actually many of the OTC brokers that we've identified independently are in our were identified as being those large deposit addresses that were receiving illicit funds on a few exchanges and so this kind of allowed us to paint a really really compelling picture that there are that this laundering infrastructure exists where there's illicit money that is flowing through the network and it's going to a very few number of kind of endpoints and that was that was kind of really interesting for us to be able to see for the first time from a data perspective yeah so before we get more into those OTC brokers one thing that I noticed when I looked at this section of the report is that there's a graph showing that part the percentage of cash outs via what you were defining as risky services which I believe were I think like mixers and that kind of thing decreased dramatically in 2017 and while cashing out via exchanges actually went up during that period and that was surprising me because I feel like you know in these more recent years regulatory scrutiny of exchanges has actually increased so I was curious you know to know why you thought that percentage of cashing out the exchanges had to grown yeah well one of the main risky services that was prior to that decline that you see in the graph was btc-e actually so when that shut down you know the whole ecosystem kind of changed so that was a major that was a major offering for a lot of illicit funds back then and so that money had to go someplace else because those risky services shut down and where did it go and we found that the by and large the biggest answer to that was to you know as to certain exchanges that we need to you know finance and OB and predominantly I think it was around 52% went to those two exchanges and so that was that was evidence for us that that money had that formerly went to btc-e is now going to these other exchanges oh oh interesting and it was just out of curiosity why was btc-e categorized as your risky service as opposed to an exchange well the the administrators are are currently facing indictments and so there's a lot of evidence as to why we would want to classify it as risky but ya know yeah I guess like during that period when people were using it that was before the indictment said that's why you know what I'm saying like at that time yeah yeah essentially the way in which BC was operated was you know without the types of compliance processes and actually the some of the operators on the on the site and even the site itself was you know there are claims that they were knowingly laundering the proceeds of crime right like the amount Cox hack money yeah so okay so one other thing and this actually wasn't in your report but I was just curious because the report shows like percentages of where the illicit Bitcoin has been going but I was also wondering in absolute numbers is the amount of Bitcoin associated with criminal activity going up are going down and and there's so many ways to look at it because it's like percentage and then numbers of Bitcoin but then also in dollar amounts I was curious to know if it was going up or down the amount of the amount of cryptocurrency involved in absolute terms has gone up from twenty eighteen to twenty nineteen and it's gone up four because we've like we've talked about we've identified some major scams that have contributed to those numbers such as the plus token scam which was a multi-billion dollar scam and that was unique to 2019 so in absolute terms the amount of illicit activity went up between between 27 2018 and 2019 okay right of course so one other thing is you know as you named these two exchanges finance and finance and Hobie that received more than half of all the illicit Bitcoin both of those exchanges are subject to know your customer regulations so how can they be receiving so much of this illicit Bitcoin so when it comes to the exact mechanics we we want to be really clear that the the OTC market is where these proceeds are going to so you can think of it as there is an over-the-counter market where people are selling and buying large batches of cryptocurrency and those OTC brokers are customers of those exchanges and what some of these actors might be doing is they might be it might be that they are facing counterparties that they don't really know so the key weakness in the system is that the OTC brokers are not necessarily checking sources of funds or they might be you know actually rogue actors that are you know accepting cryptocurrency or bids for cryptocurrency that are at large discounts to the the actual price and then they they are customers of those exchanges and what what can happen is that the exchanges themselves need to be able to put pressure on their OTC customers to say you know what types of controls are you putting in place what what is your procedure to know who your counterparties are because the exchange themselves may have even like identified who the OTC brokers are and got comfortable with that but then they need to understand who is that OTC broker being able to do business with and are they one of these sort of rogue actors or are they actually trying to do the right thing and one other thing I was curious about is you know this goes back to my question about how you're defining what is illicit activity I imagine you know let's say that I perpetrate a hack and I get some Bitcoin from the hack I would imagine that you know a lot of these hackers are trying to obfuscate what happens to those bitcoins before they cash out so when you as channel assists are tracking this you know how confident can you be let's say that they're using a mixer or something like that that you know did for you does that does the trail kind of go cold at that point or like can you still follow funds even through some of the things that they might try to do to obfuscate the trail yeah so I think what what's important to realize is that every single transaction is public and when you are talking about sort of the much larger sums of money it's a lot more difficult to make that trail go really cold even if you are potentially using mixing services and the like so I think that the the types of source of funds and being able to identify when when some criminal activity happens and where those proceeds have gone yeah we are able that in in most instances to be able to follow that through you know even when there's the use of many different obvious Gatien transactions something like that all right so let's dive a little bit more into who these OTC brokers are that you're talking about using you know Finance and we'll be are they kind of yeah III imagine it could range from anything like maybe a more active local Bitcoin style person to something more professional so can you kind of describe what their business looks like and also what kind of kyc they do typically require so the OTC brokers that were named on the list that we've been investigating have been like I said a part on our radar for quite some time we only mostly have our eyes on what's going on on the blockchain so we are really limited in our assessments of some of these users based on what we can actually see on the blockchain but when you combine that with some of our you know really rigorous professionals investigators who have been do running investigations and have been looking into for example hacked funds for quite some times they're not just looking at hacked funds this year but they've been following hacked funds Solon funds for many years and they've seen some of these individuals coming up time and again some of these OTC brokers and then when you pair that with blockchain analytics so are they receiving you know large rounded amounts consistently over time you can start to paint a picture of what type of business this this person is and then you can start to say that is an OTC broker that is likely an OTC broker and so it's really a combination of many different things and you're certainly right that there's a spectrum that we've that we've identified in this process and you also have this list that you call the rogue 100 of OTC brokers what does that mean describe who that group is those are the groups those are the 100 that have come up over the years that we've been running these investigations that we felt confident enough to put on this list and it was just kind of like a happy coincidence that it equaled to be around 100 and I mean I don't know if you want to call it a happy coincidence or not but so we we're out there are certainly more that could qualify for the list and there are some that we might want to like think about again but the the list that we've seen time and again and is around this size and they've like I said before they've been a part of past investigations they've come up time and again and and times when we've been tracking stolen money these are these are brokers that aren't just connected with one one instance of illicit activity but many multiple over many over a few years and so like I said it's really about painting a picture of what this individual or group of individuals likely is based on our investigations and blockchain level activity that we can you know of course like track over we can track all the transactions coming into those deposit addresses and one thing that you say about this rogue 100 is that none of them operate on Finance why do you think that is I think that we focused our investigation on just basically we compiled a list of individuals that just happen to come up in past investigations many of them were on Hobie and I don't know exactly why that is yet however it's um it's a phenomenon that I think will continue to learn more about it as we start to push this question of like what does an OTC broker look like what is their process of doing kyc on exchanges and what is the light what what are exchanges supposed to be doing to monitor these OTC brokers but it just kind of happens that those were the primary kind of centers of where our investigations fell and as you mentioned you know a large portion of them 70 out of the 100 use Hobie and so you know what does that say to you about what kind of kyc practices will be has or that they're kind of you know pressuring their OTC brokers to have I honestly don't know what hobby is doing for their kyc of these OTC brokers I tried to engage with them and it didn't amount to anything so I think you can speculate what the how they're managing these K why's the KYC of or how they're onboarding these customers but I I truly don't know what the process looks like at this point in time alright and one other thing is that you also described the transaction activity of this rogue 100 and it's kind of interesting well first of all why don't you just describe what their transactions do look like there's not there's not a defined set of transactions so there's - there's a distinction that I do want to make that comes out in the report we've we in the in the money-laundering section of the crime report we tried to look at OTC brokers in two distinct ways one was can we programmatically systematically through blockchain analytics alone find OTC brokers and/or find the the the kind of the off-ramps of the these illicit funds and that is what you see kind of in the first part of the chart where we're looking at all the illicit funds and that's when we kind of make the realization that they flow to a few number of very large accounts on Finance and hobby and that but we that is not enough to for us to say okay those are all OTC brokers they could just be you know really high power users or they could just you know not be doing kyc adequately but then the second way is through this list of 100 that's come up through investigations through kind of a long time of curating the specialized list of of I know quote bad actors and so for the first one you know you can kind of paint a picture of what their transaction activity looks like just by it's just it's really about volume they're just doing so much volume of of not just illicit activity but also other types of activity and so that is kind of a more scalable way to to analyze through blockchain you know heuristics where the illicit funds are going to but the other one which is the more tailored list it's all over the place there's not one set like kind of checklist of criteria to get yourself on that list it's about painting a picture which is often what you'll hear law enforcement says when they're when they're prosecuting a money-laundering case it's if you ask if you ask someone on law enforcement like how what's how much money laundering is there happening you know in the world right now they would laugh at you because you can't quantify that it's about painting a picture and making a case for what what should be on this wrote 100 lists and that's so these are definitely much more tailored much less kind of systematic and but they have you know come up in past investigations and have been tied to hacked funds and just oftentimes do a lot of volume as well yeah well one other thing that I thought was interesting was that you showed that they transact with each other fairly often and you say that one of the reasons could be to try to full blockchain analysis software to essentially make it look as if money laundering is a much smaller proportion of their overall business and it really is is that it did I kind of understand that correctly from the report yes yeah that's that's something that we noticed that was extremely interesting and but yeah we've that's also not super new we've noticed it throughout the year as well but it could I mean I guess like on the other side to argue it is known that OTC traders do trade a lot amongst themselves so I guess so it's hard it's hard to really say yeah it's definitely really hard to say for sure and I think that's well that's one of the major issues with identifying money laundering at scale it's because there are other reasons why they could be trading with each other but we know we know that this is at least an incentive incentive for them to trade with each other and we know about that there's a possibility that you can take a premium so there's the incentives that are really there so you can if you take a um you state if you take if you're an OTC broker and you take hacked funds for example you're gonna take it out of premium so you're gonna get crypto at a lower price than you would pay for at face value so this incentives are really there to move this money between the brokers all right well what do you think could be done to help stop criminals from cashing out of their illicit Lee gotten crypto so I think the first step is really to shine some transparency on this issue and say that yep both in the exchange market and in the OTC market there needs to be an increased focus on being able to identify no pretty close to actually real-time where the source of funds are coming from and so from the exchanges you know they need they need to look at their compliance gaps and say do we know who these notes you see brokers are are we do we have procedures to make sure that they're actually facing counterparties that we're happy with them facing a lot of the OTC market around the world is you know totally legitimate activity that is about allowing people to get large amounts of liquidity in and out of cryptocurrency but you know as we said there is this there is this rogue 100 list of where there's a concentration of illicit activity and both the OTC market and the exchange market needs to come together and and sort of say where who are all of these OTC brokers and do they have procedures in place to make sure that they're not selling large amounts of of crypto currency that all the pursuits of crime alright so in a moment we're gonna discuss the plus token Ponzi scheme exchange hacks ransomware and terrorism financing but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible today's episode is brought to you by Kraken Kraken is the

fruit-trees comm /keep crypto clean back to my conversation with jonathan levin and kim grauer of chain alice's you guys analyzed the plus token scam and concluded that that could be driving down the price of Bitcoin so for listeners who don't know much about this why don't you first just describe what plus token is sure so plus token was a major Ponzi scheme that has been unfolding throughout 2019 and I'm sure you are familiar with what a Ponzi scheme is but it was definitely the most successful Ponzi scheme using crypto currencies and you know rivaling some of the biggest ones just globally or period the end and so plus token was particularly interesting because or you know is mid 2019 we started to hear that you know some people had been arrested in relation to this scam and then you know right out the gate we we decided that we wanted to be following this and following it was certainly you know a certain unfortunate individuals full-time job for a few weeks and it took it took a very large amount of effort to trace these funds and so we had been just following it for quite some time and then we started to wonder about its relation on price because you know we have a team of economists and that's kind of always what people are asking is what is the impact of this on price and not on price and so that's that's kind of what was just a bunch of curious people who decided that we had this great investigation to to analyze more so how did the scammers try to cash out I mean first of all how much did they raise again you get different estimates I think the public number that was cited in the in the legal documents or around three billion we traced two billion to the to the plus token wallets and so how did they try to cash out it was a massive investigation it was um they they move the funds through through you know thousands hundreds hundreds of thousands of intermediary wallets they utilized mixers or they utilize coin joins and they eventually wound up at at home OB mostly and so eventually you guys did try to conduct an analysis of what the impact of cashing out of this plus token scam was happening on the Bitcoin price so how did you do that and what did you conclude it was a extremely difficult process because it's hard to one of the things that you do with the econometrics that we employed as you try and you know get rid of all the background noise and try to just kind of isolate the cause and effect and so that was that's the first thing that's extremely hard to do and so we looked we ended up with using a lot of order book data and found that there shortly after the huge amount of plus token funds wound about hoby there was an statistically significant change in the volatility of price on Hobie and so we monitored that and then that was connected that was the thing that was connected with the price decline so it was a combination of monitoring watching the on chain activity to Hobie then looking at the volatility on that exchange and then seeing how that volatility impacted the price and in that analysis was it also that kind of the the movement of the price happened first on Hobie sorry though the price change happened after the plus token funds arrived at the exchange right right but what I'm saying is so with the price worldwide you know dropped once the funds arrived on Hobie was it also because I I imagine that you know you can sort of see where the price is dropping first and was it dropping first on Hobie we actually did not observe that we weren't we we just looked at the price on Hobie and the the nature of the way that these exchanges are so highly connected is even if you look at you know forty minute level data it still kind of very quickly also is going to be happening on Finance or on you know other other major exchanges there's a it's actually like really efficient how the price moves in tandem across different exchanges at least on the order books okay um well so while we're talking about exchanges let's also talk about exchange hacks 20:19 saw the greatest number of hacks but it was actually the third highest when it came to the total values stolen so from those two pieces of information I couldn't decide if that meant that exchanges were getting better at security or if it was just because the prices had gone down so what's your take on what's going on with exchanges yeah it was it was really interesting to see that there was the most hacks last year especially we were struggling with what the narrative was because in you know 2018 they had that coin check hack and they just far and away had the most not in terms of amount hacked and so we were what's the narrative here and just to know it's really hard to draw a out right trend when we're looking at you know 11 hacks up from I think eight or something so how to what extent is that random to end what extent is that a real trend but I think our conclusion was that was that exchanges are getting better at potentially mitigating the the severity of a hack because the average and median hacked went down from last year so even though there's there were more hacks there it seems to be that the way that exchanges are handling and managing their funds is is better because that average and median amount hacked is going down all right and so when hackers hack from an exchange I could imagine it would be kind of hard for them to cash out so how are they what what are they doing with their pilfered funds the hackers the stolen funds in in 2019 were largely sent to exchanges and the just one one word on definitions when we were talking about stolen funds at scale we're not we weren't just looking at exchange hacks so we're also looking at other types of exploits that was that you know were the resulted in funds being stolen from for various reasons whereas the exchange hacks were a very specific group of 11 and that we looked at now the stolen funds is what we reported on in terms of the exposure and so those are going to kind of a variety of places and I think like let me just refresh my memory most like I said most of them are going to exchanges but you also see some hosted wallets you see some unidentified services even some even some stolen funds are going to other illicit services so it's a wide variety of destinations but like I said still far and away most of them are going to exchanges oh interesting I you know the reason why I said I thought it would be difficult is because I believe you know a lot of the different exchanges are in contact with each other and you know when a hack happens they you know are happy to help each other out and say oh you know we're not going to let you know people who are associated with this hack cash out here so is it just that you know I guess certain exchanges just aren't in touch with the wider group or something and that's how these hackers can can launder their funds from exchanges stolen from exchanges I think that the way that the way that those sort of groups work is you know fairly you know fairly informal and and and a lot of the exchanges do participate in that but that only really applies if someone moves directly the stolen funds directly to one of the other exchanges you know the the reason that we sort of are used to track these types of crimes is that there is an increase in the level of sophistication of how many transactions are going in between the your actual theft and the cash out point and there can be hundreds if not thousands and there can be also mixers in between the original hack and the cash out point and that's very hard for the exchanges to coordinate without using Chan Alice's as you know someone to notify them that something has changed that these funds are actually being cashed out okay yeah right that makes sense because yeah the more I guess hops there are in between the more it's hard to say you know we're not going to let you use our service well so one thing I wanted to ask what also was the Lazarus group which you call a cyber criminal syndicate linked to the North Korean government I that this group also came up in a previous episode I did on why North Korea is so interested in cryptocurrency but you say that their operations have become more advanced how so we found that their operations have become more advanced simply in the way that they move funds after they've they've done a hack so you can see in the report that we we present you with a bird's-eye view of two investigations and one of them is or one of the Birdseye views is from last year or the year before last 2018 and you can see that they're really just exploiting lo que YC exchanges albeit there's a lot of transactions that are happening before they will hit the exchange it's actually kind of a relatively simple process to follow whereas this year the exchange the ones that we did track were we're adapting with the with the times and they were they used a lot more the investigations were a lot more complex and required you know an understanding of coin joint wallets for example for example and it was just the way that the investigation occurred or the way that the funds moved that signified to us that you know this group is adapting and how they're moving funds after they're stolen to exit ramps and it was really interesting to see that it was also so elaborate how they did one of them which he walked us through which was the hack of the Singapore based exchange dragon axe can you describe what they did there the dragon X case was really interesting because typically it it was just a very advanced way of hacking into dragon axe they created a shell company called World bit bot and they even made a fake product that the dragon X employees could demo that had malware on it and so just that whole scheme was also another sign that it was really that their methods have been becoming more elaborate I guess more creative you might say and so they then all you had to do was install that now or from that fake product and it happened to be on a computer that had access to the private keys and then we were contacted by dragon ax and were able to run the investigation and we you know do a really good job in the report of showing exactly what that invest to look like and how the funds were more moved through through lots of intermediary wallets to exit ramps yeah and one thing that I found so fascinating was just the website for that faint company it was really so believable and yeah and and I have to also say I like for listeners who can tell one of my other except sessions in addition to crypto is North Korea and you know for a country that paints the US as the enemy like the whole thing was written in what looks like pretty perfect English so it was like okay like they even have North Koreans now who speak good English but anyway so yeah I just I was pretty floored when I watched that um but one other thing that you said here about that hackers like Lazarus is that one of their behaviors that's changing is that they're moving their illicit funds to exchanges more quickly than they did in 2018 and I was curious to know you know why you thought that but then also how you can even track that because of the you know greater obligation that they build into their movements yeah we that was also another really interesting thing so the the chart that you're referring to is the one that shows the number of days since the hack occur between the hack occurring and when you're cashing out your funds and we looked in this specific chart at Lazarus hack in 2019 a Lazarus hack in 2018 and to unknown groups and the one the I can't say for sure why I think that they're cashing out their funds faster it would just be speculation like we've said a few times we're a blockchain analytics firm so we can see what's happening on the blockchain I think that you would speculate that I think that there's a few reasons that would determine why they would choose to cash out one would be maybe there's it's related to the price is there something happening with the price that would make it a good time to suddenly cash out or do you just need the money in that moment or are you were you just waiting to evade detection kind of the media to die out so that you feel as though it's a safe time for you to move the funds to to an off-ramp so I don't I think one of those three reasons might explain why why the cashing out happened so much quicker but I think that potentially you know the the role of mixers and the more advanced and more sophistication that we've been seeing might also contribute to why the funds are moving more quickly to offer amps yeah and I actually thought that maybe they were moving more quickly to off ramps because the longer they stay in crypto the the it just like the crime remains incomplete right they don't actually benefit from it until they can turn it into Fiat and so the longer they it stays in crypto the higher chance is that like perhaps maybe they can never cash out if somehow you know those funds you know I don't know what would happen but but somehow if you know they get blocked from from cashing it out whereas like the more quickly they can move then that's the last time law enforcement has to to do anything um yeah I think that's an argument for sure yeah and one other thing I want to ask so yeah just at the end of this you made a few recommendations like what would you say law enforcement and exchanges should do if hackers are moving more quickly from crypto to Fiat yeah so what we have seen is that obviously crypto is global from the outset and some of these exchanges are based in jurisdictions all over the world particularly when it comes to something like North Korea that's something that the whole world is is interested in understanding how those how they are moving money so there are what they call financial intelligence units so every every country has a financial intelligence unit which is going to be in the u.s. that's going to be FinCEN which is the financial crime in for Network which is really the financial crime regulator in most countries and they have been very successful with other types of crime like this like business email compromise where companies are scammed into sending international wires to criminal accounts they've been really successful in sharing information rapidly across borders to be able to freeze those assets at those exchanges I think that one thing that you'll see over this year is that if I use around the world as they have needed under you know new regulations to actually stand up crypto currency regulation teams and understand what the nature of these crimes are and and understand how this money is being moved you know there needs to be coordination between the exchanges and the financial intelligence units to really be able to share information quickly and allow some of these accounts to be frozen under actual legal requests so that this can actually be a process where exchanges are working together formally with their local regulator to to be able to mitigate these types of risks I think the the other thing is just going to improve is that in general the types of compliance requirements for exchanges around the world have increased and that is going to help you know have better compliance policies and procedures some of these exchanges so that they can minimize the number of places that these funds can be cashed out all right let's also no talk about ransomware which is one of those crimes that actually affects non crypto people and sort of gets them roped into our world so how would you define ransomware and one thing that I actually wasn't sure about for reading the report and even googling a little bit is all ransomware crypto related or is it possible for ransomware to depend to demand pain another form of money so ransomware is a crime that essentially is a piece of computer software that encrypts a device and blocks access to a file system or a computer and demands a ransom in order to unlock that machine so in in this world we've seen a number of very high-profile cases of hospitals schools and other types of critical infrastructure being affected where whole computer systems are actually locked and they can't be used by those businesses or hospitals and they are demanded to pay some ransom in order to unlock them and bring those systems back online so we've seen you know very high-profile cases we've seen you know major businesses affected we've seen for example like Travelex was affected as we've seen the city of New Orleans declare a state of emergency we've seen hospitals and other types of things so all of these high-profile targets are definitely raising an awareness about how ransomware is being spread mmm the vast majority if not all ransomware when it comes to encrypting computer devices is definitely linked with a cryptocurrency ransom the other types of extortion that do exist today may not so kidnapping and other types of extortion schemes and sextortion schemes actually some of that does use cryptocurrency and some of that still uses other forms of payment oh well so the computer ones without was really enabled by cryptocurrency so ransomware did pre-exists cryptocurrency which is kind of an important thing to know you know the original the original form of ransomware sort of the first known grants were was distributed on a floppy disk in 1989 and that was the demand was to send a sort of check or some sort of money order to a Pio box in Panama so that was the first and it was actually interestingly targeted at scientists who were researching aids so I mentioned this when I interviewed you before now that okay I recall and so you know it does ransomware and an extortion in general definitely as a crime pre-exists cryptocurrency it happens to me today that the most efficient way to move money internationally in a irreversible manner is with cryptocurrency and therefore cryptocurrency can be used pretty effectively especially when it comes to encrypting computer systems oh my gosh all right well what trends did you guys see with ransomware in 2019 we we looked at just the aggregate numbers but I think what we wanted to highlight the most was the growth of was of ransomware as a service and we have been more aware of this phenomena where an individual can purchase the services of a person who has you know written or owns ransomware and that was a phenomenon that was really particularly scary for us to kind of start investigating and you can you can really use blockchain analytics to follow those funds you for example we identify in our report ransomware service strain that we've identified where you can see that the vendor and the perpetrator both getting paid out as there's kind of a splitting after the after the payment is received by this ransomware strain and so I think that's probably biggest thing that we wanted to highlight from the report is the growth of ransomware a service yeah like even when I just saw that term in your report I was like what you know just the idea that that exists was crazy to me but anyway well what do you recommend businesses do to protect themselves from ransomware so I think that the protection is sort of outside of our wheelhouse but you know making sure that there are backups to systems making sure that software updates and software is patched and really like understanding you're proactive cyber security posture is something that a lot of institutions are investing in I think one thing to flag and something that we've noticed is that the actual crime needs to be D stigmatized because we're seeing you're under reporting of ransomware attacks where businesses are scared or hospitals or or even people themselves are scared to report these crimes because it's sort of embarrassing that you know one of these attacks has gone through and managed to attack their systems and really what we find is that the more reporting that there is we can really help with that and one of the things that I've seen over the last year is we've really worked with some of the insurance companies who are providing cyber insurance to businesses and and actually then you know the policy can actually cover some sort of ransom payment and then we've managed to connect our law enforcement customers who are investigating either one of these rounds might as the service providers or one of the ransomware authors themselves and we've managed to really provide new information between the sort of affected businesses the law enforcement agencies and the insurer to actually help build a better case and find out who are the people behind these ransomware campaigns and I think that the more that then people are able to report this ransomware the more we will be able to you know take it on as a threat where we're following the money and and finding out who are these types of perpetrators and what are the connections between the different strains and and actors who are perpetrating these crimes all right so last section that we'll discuss before we go is the terrorism financing aspect of report what are you guys seeing there in terms of cryptocurrency being used for terrorism financing we saw we trades we traced um a few campaigns over the years so this in 2019 we focused on one campaign that where we noticed that there the takeaway was that there was an increasing sophistication in the way that these organizations were we're using crypto currencies and so these are you know public campaigns where someone will say you know donate to this address and so that's how we get our entire information and looking at the campaign in 2018 versus 2019 though Canada this campaign was much more successful in raising more funds in a shorter period of time and they used more advanced wallet softwares and so we've just seen this narrative continue in this in this type of crime as well where you know criminals are increasing their sophistication and their use of crypto currencies however the amounts are small so can you just say what those amounts are but also explain like in your report you say even though the amounts are small that should not be dismissed and so why is that yeah the amounts are extremely small tens of thousands of dollars but still the takeaway is that this is this is extremely important because it doesn't take a large amount of money to you know carry out a terrorist attack so even a small amount of money like this is something that you need to pay attention to and that needs to be on law enforcement radar and to the extent that you know we can get our hold of this information and quickly attribute it in our software service and then you know Oh trace those funds it's extremely important because of just the low cost that it that was required to carry out a terrorist attack and you mentioned how they're the ways that they're soliciting financing are getting more sophisticated so what are they doing now though campaign that we saw was I mean it's the way that they're going about it is they're you know you'll have a you'll have a you'll advertise that you have a cryptocurrency website through you know various types of advertising and then the donors will come to that publicly listed address the sophisticated part comes in for what type of wallet software are you using and then you know how do you how successful are you are your advertising campaigns and raising more money in a shorter period of time and what types of services are you using after the fact those are all the different types of things that allow us to say that this these attacks have become more sophisticated and but but just notably just how compared to the previous year which was you know a longer campaign which raised you know a similar amount of money to a campaign that was much shorter that raised a comparable amount yeah well for one of these groups aqb you mentioned that they have moved to receiving donations via unique addresses generated for each donor yeah and I was curious about that because like then I guess I didn't know how you could then track the funds like how did you know even which addresses you know were used for the terrorist financing thing we yeah we have a variety of heuristics that we use to track funds and that can connect addresses to each other through you know there's a lot of different ways but most importantly and crucially is that we you know investigators who are experts in this field who are kind of on studying this day-to-day who are able to provide us with addresses that we can connect together through these investigations and allow us to go beyond just what we see on the blockchain to paint a stronger picture of what's going on so the experts in the in the field have been really crucial to allowing us to successfully write this section on terrorism financing I see and so generally where do you think the trend could go when it comes to cryptocurrency being used in terrorism financing so I think that there's a really important point that we're making here which is that actually when we when it's when it comes to an issue like terrorist financing it's really important to have real expertise and you know one of the things that we were seeing is that there are like consistent donors across some of these campaigns that definitely helped us identify different wallets that were involved but we also see sort of some some bad press in the public domain that some misinformation about sort of other terrorist financing campaigns in cryptocurrency which are not done by experts just by looking at the public blockchain and making incorrect inferences that you know a terrorist financing campaign was actually not well described and they took a an address from a in exchange in in Gaza and said that that whole exchange was terrorist financing and you think it's we think it's really important to correct that type of misinformation and and actually use experts that understands the connections between different groups of people and the definitions of what is considered actually terrorist financing according to the US law and and we take it very seriously about you know when we are actually going to label and and identify these types of campaigns when it comes to the actual actors themselves I think that it's clear that there is now an understanding and a know and a public awareness that these types of public campaigns are possible to do and I think when it comes to different types of terrorist organizations that actually are in desperate needs of funds you will see more experimentation you will see some more of these campaigns fortunately you know we have experts on hand we work very closely with our law enforcement partners and our exchange partners to to identify this type of activity really quickly and make sure that yeah these campaigns can be ineffective when it comes to raising funds alright so we've gone through pretty much most of the report that has already been published but there's still a little bit that is yet to come out can you give listeners a sense of what the last section or sections will be about and when those will be released the last the last few sections are going to be on darknet marketplaces and scamming and those are you know below section two sections to many of us dark net markets well you should it should be coming out soon and what we'll be discussing there is just overall trends and some you know case studies as well whereas with scams we really you know focus on what's happened with Plus tokens more and maybe some other Ponzi scams as well and so it's a full data rich deep dive into each of these sections and definitely them probably them one is some of the most data rich sections that we have okay great well I look forward to reaching to reading them where can people learn more about you to and to analysis so you can go
