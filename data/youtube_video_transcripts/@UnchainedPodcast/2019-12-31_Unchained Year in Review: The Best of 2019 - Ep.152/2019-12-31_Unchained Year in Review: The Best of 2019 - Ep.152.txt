actually more a collection of the clips that are most representative of what crypto was about this year out of about 50 interviews only 12 made it in and I was pained to leave so many good conversations on the cutting room floor however the moments chosen do tell a story about the year 2019 which I call the year things got geopolitical probably my only regret is that none of the clips about dows lend themselves well to this episode however years from now after we've got global staple coins paying around the world at a high transactions per second rate the crypto community has made peace with US regulators and more of our lives seems to take place in the borderless digital world I do wonder if then we will find an ironic or coincidental that dows were burbling up right around this time anyway on to the first clip 2019 started off with a fair bit of anxiety in the Theorem community the leading smart contract platform which had fuelled the 2017 crypto mania was facing the launch of numerous potential competitors an insecurity over whether it would retain its number-one status led to the emergence of aetherium maximalism that was the context from my live podcast interview with Vitaly booter in in New York City at Columbia Journalism school my alma mater which I began like this I'm gonna jump right into questions normally in journalism if you're an editor they say you should give your comments to writers in what's called a nice sandwich mm-hmm and you can apply that concept to two interviews but unfortunately on how to dispense with the nice parts in the beginning because I really want to get to the meat of the conversation we have a very limited time so my first question it's kind of like a question that's actually for you and for the audience and actually what we're gonna do to tee up the questions we're gonna play a video and it's video I think you've probably seen it and some some may have seen it but for those who haven't it's a video of Fred Wilson at Union Square Ventures in conversation with two charging of multi coin capital the multi coin capital summit and I think Fred's view here is representative of a lot of people's that it's not just his opinion but you can see he is kind of a lot of emotion about where if the rain is right now and we do down a lot for our companies a theory it needs that right we know that Vitalik is not yo bucolic is an evangelist he's a brilliant computer scientist but like aetherium should be more like a company right like today like you look at what eos is doing and you look what her theorem is doing it's like you know if a theorem was doing what es was doing it they'd be crushing it but they're not and they don't have enough money they don't have enough developers they don't you know they're not there they're go to market strategy is non-existent like they're not behaving like a company and it if the of all of us who own etherium code metallic and say you know look this thing you got going in switzerland it's not working fire these [ __ ] who don't know what the hell they're doing and put somebody great in there who want to help you build this thing into a monster like that's what we would do I don't know how to do that like how do you damn there's no mechanism to do that that's that's painful just sitting there holding the acid just watching them whittle it at the value away and you're like god damn it you know I know what to do here you know just look at it every great company has done this just do that and they don't do it and it's hard to get them to listen right because first of all who do you have to convince right in this case like maybe it's metallic but there's a whole decentralized group of developers etc that need to be convinced and like this is exactly kind of the question that we're trying to think of it well if they think that whole group thinks that they're killing it then they then they got their head up their ass okay they're not killing it they're blowing it what I want is I want the town like to give us near response to what he's saying in this video yeah I mean I guess first of all like if Bitcoin was run like a business would it have succeeded and I feel like we kind of into it if we know the answer so it like it's definitely a structure that works for some things but like blockchains and cryptocurrency and all those all of those things that come with that package is just fundamentally kind of so much more and kind of so different from a traditional company or or a software product so I'm really not at all sure that like that kind of of model is anywhere close to the right model and so in terms of like what our model is right like we've definitely had these discussions inside of the foundation and there's definitely been people from time to time that just said yeah we need to go in with guns blazing and fire those bastards and then you know get their 40 people in and like stick them in the middle of some NIMBYs you'll be in Silicon Valley and get them to pay $10,000 a month of rents get him to work for 16 hours every day rah-rah-rah six months and like we got aetherium 3.0 man no I mean the young like I would say rather that in Bitcoin succeeded in large part because it adopted a model that's very very different from that and we've been adopting a model that's very different from that though I mean at the same time look one of the things that we did is for the our 2.0 strategy right we have this approach where you know the foundation is not the thing in the middle that's building everything the foundation is it is being a hub for pois'd for things that need a hub like for example writing out a hub and spell writing out the spec and specifying you bring it's a completion but then the work on making 2.0 implementations is you know distributed among you know prismatic labs and white house and consensus and these other companies and know these cutter companies internally can be enough structure in very different ways and the you know some of them could be it could be even based in one place um in another place they might have different kinds of people and ends really if even a all of them succeed then you know if you're at least the software implementations of a theorem 2.0 exist and it's developed and from a scaling point of view you know like how some of our community members in public have said even if if you're iam 2.0 has never developed there is a theorem one point X there ZK roll up there's channels there's plasma and yeah but and so you were you were kind of taking issue with his framing of you know yeah like I guess the point I'm trying to make is that there like there is a kind of focused and deep approach to doing things and there is a broad approach to doing things and we definitely are explicitly taking the broad approach to doing things and I'd argue it's like a very good one for things like Bitcoin in etherium regulatory difficulties were also a big theme throughout this year SEC Commissioner Hester purse had a pragmatic view on the benefits and downsides of regulation plus even talked about how the US could do better last summer I interviewed Chang Peng Jarrell who's the CEO of Finance amazing episode of you guys not listen to this I asked him a ton of questions about regulation and he really pushed back at me and he's pretty theme or his company frankly is famous for a regulatory arbitrage and something that was kind of funny that he's said to me I mean honestly so much of the episode frankly was funny with a we were Taiwan regulation but um I know were to do I know exactly you know but he he's definitely he has strong opinions and they really came through but one of the things he said was that he yeah like I mean I don't remember what phrasing he was what he said she said like Oh things like SEC these disclosures are sort of like theater and and basically said you know I would rather look at the information coming through telegram groups and what are people saying and you know and he was kind of implying that like the information that you can get online about these crypto assets is like even better and so it's just curious to know because I I know that you I think 10 have the view that information is like kind of the main reason that regulation is important well I mean I think that that that point is an interesting one and one that we often forget at the SEC so at the SEC we often think well if we don't have a rule place people are just gonna buy stuff and they're not going to even ask for any information and that's pretty ridiculous because I mean yes there is a group of people who are willing to give their money on on a hope in a dream and a little title called crypto and nothing more but I think especially as the space is maturing people are saying wait a minute I gave you know I invested money in this project and now I have nothing so if I'm going to invest in another project I'm gonna ask a bunch of questions and I think that's a very healthy attitude to cultivate in people which is no don't give your money to anyone without asking a ton of questions and being quite sure that you know who that person is what they're planning to spend the money on and what you're entitled to and return for your investment and so you know I think we've got to remember that there is really sort of a natural inclination on the part of people to seek out information when they need it and I think that's kind of what that point was going to and so especially in a space like this where you've got people who are I mean this is a brutal space where people are willing to rip each other to shreds telly to say that each other's projects are terrible say that you know some someone will say oh this this projects complete fraud you know there's a lot of good conversation it's sometimes a little bit you know I can't even listen to some of it because I can't I can't Miette my sec phone doesn't allow me to listen to those podcasts because the language is too bad but the bottom line is you know people are out there and they're they're talking about this stuff and I think that's a really healthy way to get information out there so you know I don't totally discount that point yes the reason the sec sort of the the reason for the SE c--'s existence is to get disclosure a good disclosure out there to investors and i think that's a really important role but i also don't kid myself that absent our involvement it won't happen at all I sometimes talk to some of the different developers and I maybe you're not surprised but it surprises me and times two here kind of the different workarounds they're doing really to try to avoid any kind of enforcement action from the US or Italy specifically just this one regulator and when I listen to them I really think oh this does not sound good it sounds like they're doing a lot of work to avoid this situation and you know I know you guys walk this fine line of wanting to protect investors but not stifle innovation so I'm curious to know kind of like how would you grade how far how well the u.s. is doing so far and how do you think the US regulators can do better well I that is I think that's a great point that you make and it's it's sort of more subtle point which is that a lot of resources are expended and just trying to figure out how you can be compliant with our rules and so I think I hear that and I think wow that's it's it's sad to me that that those resources can't be spent in a more productive way i under you know we again we have this rule book in place so that so that's a consequence of it but it also makes me want to say come talk to us tell us where the pain points are and tell us you know what we could change so that you wouldn't have to engage in effort that ultimately you don't think is serving investors and so how would I grade how we've done I you know I'm not I don't think we've done a tremendously great job and it's not because you know there are a lot of people at the SEC who are working extremely hard and trying to get this right and they are thinking about our mission which is protecting investors facilitating capital formation and maintaining fair orderly and efficient markets and so that's what's driving people but because you know to go back to a point I made earlier we're just not great at accommodating innovation so I I think we do need to think about ways that we can make it easier for people to get relief so they can move forward with with projects in a way that they're comfortable they're not going to run into an enforcement action speaking of enforcement actions kick sacrificed itself to challenge the way the SEC has been applying the Howey test to digital tokens while kicks defiance of the SEC did not work out for it in the end his announcement of defend crypto doric on my show certainly captured a historical moment in the tense tango between the crypto community and the SEC I think this is a first for the podcast but we are announcing news today on the show Ted why don't you tell everyone Kix plans yeah so first of all thanks for for having us so just a bit of background we've been in the corrupted industry for quite some time now we launched our own cryptocurrency Kin back in 2017 the Kaneko system continues to grow there's over 40 apps where you can earn and spend can live today and in the last month over a million people have earned again and over 300,000 people have spent Kent making can where the most used cryptocurrencies in the world so that's been great that's been really exciting but the continued challenge for us has been the lack of clarity on the regulatory side and so over the last year and a half we've also been working with the SEC you know they first reached out to us three days after our token sale then and they started to ask us for some comments and some meetings and then you know some subpoenas and then formal testimony and just trying to work with them to understand crypto to create that clear guidance we all need and after spending 18 months in over five million dollars trying to work with them I just continue to be super frustrated a bit the lack of clarity and so you know it's originally felt important to us and not just for us but for the whole industry like we need clarity here because this is really starting to hurt our business and so we've put together defend crypto org and what that is is it's saying the only way we're going to get clarity is if somebody goes to court and so we are prepared to do that you know we need a new how we test and that new how we test is going to come from a ruling in a core case we have great facts we have great circumstances we have a great team great and so we're in a unique position to create this clarity not just for us but for everybody else and so we've created an account with coinless custody to make sure the funds are available too because these things are expensive and we put five million dollars of Bitcoin ether and kin into that coinbase custody account but we've also opened up contributions for any other project or in a individual who's frustrated with the current status of clarity and of regulation to contribute alongside to make sure there's the funding there to create the clarity we all need I chose this clip from my podcast with Glenn while and Santiago Siri which was recorded before Libra was announced because this theme of the nation-state being mismatched to our lives ended up being a big theme for the year as we saw at the beginning of the space race over the first global staple coin yeah I mean I think there's a general problem of sort of the formalism that governs our lives like nations stayed in the corporation in whatever like not really matching the society that we actually live in and I think yeah I think many of our problems and not just the like fake news or whatever but all sorts of things come from the fact that like we don't have instituted formal institutions that are sufficiently responsive to the social reality that we're actually living the nation's they disorder inna big crisis especially since the last election in America were a lot of questioning and has been put on the role that Facebook played because of the suspicion there was a foreign power interfering with the election in the most powerful election in the world the principle of the nation-state is based on non-domestic intervention since the peace of westphalia in the 17th century is this basic rule that keeps an equilibrium of power that achieves art a certain piece that you don't mess with my domestic affairs and I won't mess with your domestic affairs when you have a foreign influence being suspicious of exploiting this technology called Facebook and that has actually everyone voting every day but the problem of Facebook is that it's a fake kind of because it's surveys based on the idea of satisfying Facebook's profit needs because it's at the end of the day an advertising company Facebook surveying people but we're voting with every like we're actually giving a preference now these dislikes only satisfy this advertising based business model and it turns out that whether we want it or not now it's breaking the very principle of non domestic intervention and Mark Zuckerberg being called to testify in Congress and explain what's going on now you know Facebook has been an influence factor in elections anywhere in the world in the Arab Spring in in many many environments the the fascinating thing in political terms what's happening right now is that now not even the US is protected from what it has created so the nation-state is no longer in place when Facebook's Libra launched the mission was to Bank the unbanked by the time I interviewed Libra co-creator and chief economist Christian kattiline II regulators were breathing down Facebook's neck calling into question how effectively Libra would be able to do that actually from Mark Zuckerberg testimony it wasn't totally clear to me if it was impossible but just from the way he answered his questions that seemed like it might be possible to create an anima swalot but you're saying that every single wallet will be K by seed so there will be you know non-custodial wallets on the public chain and you know what's important to consider though is that many of the essentially all of the on and off ramps the authorized resellers and exchanges that are authorized will essentially apply kyc AML and there's a new framework that the Association is working on to really kind of describe all of this different aspects ok so then I'm sure you've heard this question before but so if if that's the case then how how will that affect your goal of thanking me unbanked who maybe in many cases don't have really strong their identity verification yeah and you know that this is where it's really great that there are founding members that are really active from an NGO perspective in regions where that's exactly the problem you describe I think over time the Opie's really to lift up kyc and identity standards maybe even in collaboration with international organizations that can help you let's say you're working in a refugee camp or in a condition where you do need a trusted intermediary that could be a global NGO to certify that this person actually should be allowed on the network you know going back to the broader problem of last mile issues this is not something that we can solve in one single swoop it will take time and especially on the unbanked I think the promises in regions were you already have wide smartphone penetration and people may be using you know the the classic $30 Android device and they have access to data that's where you can start you do need often that in combination with strong identity you know some regions I've made good progress on this if you think about India others are lagging behind but it will be you know it will be a long-term effort and I think there's among the founding members many of them feel this problem of identity because they're operating many different countries often they have to deal with cash and so I think you will see the the Financial Inclusion piece advance especially together with with broader broader infrastructure run identity and kyc again it wasn't one up and overnight but I think the NGOs can play a major role in in really identifying solutions that that feel both the void from you know people that come without strong identification but also without excluding them completely from the network and this is where you know did the public chain allowing for small cash like transactions could be quite quite meaningful so then I just want to talk about this tension of like how much it is that Libre really will help the unbanked like let's say that I'm in India and I'm having to convert from rupees to buy Libre I pay a little fees I pay some fees I lose a little in the exchange rate but then later when I want to use that money then again I'm going to pay some fees and lose something exchange rate to convert back to rupees so in what scenarios would it make sense for somebody to buy Libra would it literally be just if they're sending money somewhere abroad so of course it starts with the receiving and sending of money so think about the remittance use case but then over time I think this is where the founding members and the broader set of initial participants in the Association is really important you could imagine all sort of new use cases so maybe you receive the remittance through your telco operator and that telco operator is part of the Libra Association and so now you can use it to buy airtime to spend it as mobile money or maybe you know the the partner of the Association that you're relying on is a merchant a merchant that is active in that region and now you can take your remittance and spend it and exchange it for goods and services removing those last mile frictions I think it's something that again will take a long period of time but it's really important for ensuring that not only you're cutting and reducing fees on the sending the the you know value from A to B but also in what can you do once you've received it how much friction are you now incurring in a specific region an important feature here of the design is that there's an incentive for different private entities and exchanges and other intermediaries to come in and fill that gap so when you look at the reserve the reserve will interface with a group of authorized resellers that will make a market for Libra and essentially these will be the entities that will capture and transmit market demand do you need more coins you need less coins essentially do we need to mint and burn at the reserve level they will be able to charge a small spread and similarly they will be interfacing with exchanges including some of the crypto ones for example and these exchanges will also be able to charge a small fee now the good thing about the spread is that if I see someone in my region charging to I have a spread maybe that's a big opportunity for me to come in and compete with them and so over time the the competitive forces on on and off ramps hopefully would drive people to be very creative and entrepreneurial and allow all sort of on and off ramps to develop I think there's an opportunity here and you know other startups in the crypto space I've tried this before but there's massive friction different types of on and off ramps where if you do have kyc you can really examples or some other endpoint to become a way where consumers can come in and out of the network after Facebook's Libra announcement China gotten gear with both an overall blockchain initiative and with planning the rollout of its new digital currency and payment system but because these efforts will be private blockchains similar to intranets as opposed to the internet for China it raises the question of whether the Chinese will be satisfied with these private blockchains or if they will become curious about Bitcoin Martin Champa and Devi Wan discussed this and other topics related to China's blockchain efforts Alex Gladstein of the human rights foundation came on my other podcast unconfirmed and he said that he thought that all of this will end up being a blunder for she's and ping because he basically said that you know to learn about blockchain you end up learning about Bitcoin and the Chinese will be more attracted to Bitcoin than they will to the digital yuan and you know I kind of brought up oh well you know in the past people had said that they thought that the internet would open up China and obviously that hasn't really happened and you read these articles where Chinese people are just like I'm happy with it or not I have they're like who cares about Google and Facebook and you know whatever so you know do you think but but Alex was saying that money is a different thing so do you agree with Alex that this could end up being kind of like a gateway to Bitcoin and if so like do you think that that will have some kind of effect on the power that the Chinese Communist Party has on China so I think this blossom blossom from see definitely help like just this generic just a Bitcoin awareness because blotching impact Qantas are two concepts they're interrelated and it's very hard to isolate one from each other and like we can see from all this a recent education and material released by CCP and so they actually have to prefer so light so they actually have to refer to the history of like blush hand and then we mentioned Bitcoin because traditionally like in my past few years like the narrative around Bitcoin amount just that average Chinese is like Bitcoin is a scam and like crypto is a scam and I think a list like this kind of a narrative like can be eliminated but like we have to keep in mind that the average Chinese citizen so and then also by Chinese culture is very prompt to authoritarian statement so I think if the message from why the Chinese Communist Party is okay blushin is good digital remain be ascared I think most of the average like citizen will just prompt in to this Chinese version digital currency but like probably not Bitcoin and it might be in the very long turn when like the Chinese economy like like probably meltdown and then people are not happy with their current living just that situation things like that I think whenever there's a potential sovereign Fiat crisis I think that can be a just a cognitive like awaken moment like for the local Chinese and so they might be considered okay so probably Bitcoin is actually the plan B like the other thing to keep in mind is Bitcoin is already very expensive like in the eyes of life like any newcomer of this side so just like any Chinese citizen so like who's new to digital currency or like cryptocurrency like the average annual household income back in China is about so it's about ten thousand US dollar every year so whoever is new to Bitcoin in China and I think 99.9% of the chance that like he or she will not think so like he or she will basically think Bitcoin is already too expensive and then it is a too volatile and so while I should buy into Bitcoin and then just instead like so instead of like probably buying to stock and decides probably stick with my current just a daily Bremen B activity right and so I think there's a huge gap and just say there's a huge leeway before the Chinese citizen eventually consider a Bitcoin as like a soror value yeah I think that's right and there's also the fact that China's government has cracked down so much on crypto currency exchanges made it difficult to buy Bitcoin in China you can still do it through through some peer-to-peer methods but but it's not terribly easy and many of the ways to buy it might appear quite shady for an average Chinese person but I think it could actually you know this push to blockchain might actually backfire in another way which is that this is a very new technology that that is mostly unproven for for most of the applications and if there's too much investment in it and too much of an idea that you know that the top leader has said we need to apply it so we're gonna apply it whether it makes sense or not it could actually lower Chinese growth and make things less efficient by trying to jam blockchain into areas where it doesn't make sense especially if they're not willing to decentralize and and use it as the technology was originally intended so it's very hard now to be in China and be a blockchain skeptic which i think is an important viewpoint that needs to be there in these discussions but Noah that kind of article would now get censored because you're you're disagreeing with with the top leader and I think that's a bit that's a big problem I would definitely agree with that oh my gosh that's that's a hugely important point in a moment I'll have more on

calm that's KRA que en dot-com back to unchained best of 2019 although I recorded this interview with Emily Parker of long hash before Xi Jinping's blockchain announcement this part of our interview is still relevant to that question of whether or not the blockchain push in China could get the Chinese interested in Bitcoin you mentioned right before the commercial break that you see some parallels to the book that you wrote which I'll just read out the title for people now I know who my comrades are voices from the internet underground and as you mentioned it talks about how the Internet is changing life in China Cuba and Russia so what parallels are you seeing to the development of crypto and the Internet in China yeah so that's I mean that very question is exactly what got me interested in cryptocurrency it was kind of like are there parallels here and I think there are a lot of parallels that in the way that the internet and cryptocurrency are developing in China I mean I think you know the biggest parallel on the most macro level is that you know these are two examples of a decentralized technology that is very difficult for governments to control this is true of the Internet and this is true of Bitcoin you know and I think with the internet you know there are a lot of opinions about the Internet in China I think right now a lot of people in the West or you know see it in a very negative light oh it's so censored it's so restricted nothing is happening there I don't really agree with that I mean I think yes there is a lot of censorship but I also think that there is also a lot of innovation and there's a lot happening on the Chinese internet and there's a lot more happening there than ever would have happened in the period before the internet and I think the Internet in China has had a huge impact on just like a lot of people's individual lives so the other thing about the internet and I've sort of been saying this for years and I continue to say this despite censorship despite restrictions it is just not possible for any government really to completely control the flow of information on the Internet it's just not it's a decentralized phenomenon and it is not possible to completely shut it down and I think that's very true of cryptocurrency as well you know and I think I don't think the Chinese government attempted to completely shut down cryptocurrency but even if they had I think it would be incredibly difficult you know so I think what in some ways you can also compare kind of the way that authorities look at the internet and look at crypto um I think in both cases you know for example Facebook Twitter these are all these are all blocked in China but you know with a little bit of effort you can get to them it's not like so hard I mean you you have a you get a virtual private network or whatever but I think what the goal was was to kind of like raise the barrier to entry right it wasn't to like completely snuff all these things out it was to say like okay it's we're just gonna make it a little bit harder for you to do this and this it's the same holds true for cryptocurrency it's not like China was saying we don't you know we want to get rid of Bitcoin entirely they were just they were raising the threshold you know they were saying like okay if you want to like you need to kind of know a little more you need to make a little bit more of an effort because it was kind of at the point where like just anybody was kind of getting involved in this in this market so I think in both cases you know in China if you want to go you know see Twitter if you want to go trade Bitcoin you can but it's just a little bit harder you know you kind of have to try a little bit harder so but I think you know it's it's just it's a very interesting phenomenon because I think you know when trying to crack down on cryptocurrency or on exchanges in icos specifically you know there was kind of this feeling like okay is this is this is this the end game you know like Bitcoin in theory right it's supposed to be able to survive any kind of government repression but China was so important I mean China was such an important market and I think there were questions at the time like can point survive this you know and not only did Bitcoin survive I mean it thrived right I mean that was kind of like can we kind of entered a bull market you know so so I think that was just sort of like a really strong example of like no government can can can kind of no government can kill Bitcoin no one government can kill Bitcoin you know and I think that's true of the Internet as well sandrov row surprised me with her contrarian view on regulation in the US I definitely did the podcast version of whatever a double-take is when we recorded this this is completely different from what like Fred Wilson of US v is saying and Jeremy lair of circle and there are a lot of people I mean obviously you can look at the kick lawsuit with the SEC I mean there's so so it seems like you feel like there's enough of a recognition that the u.s. is falling behind that things are gonna like radically change that they're gonna be leading cuz right now there they are quite yeah I would say like laggards maybe and yeah so I'm not telling you it's gonna happen tomorrow it's not I'm not gonna tell you it's going to happen even in a month but I see a momentum change that is different than the last five years and I do actually feel really badly for all of those people who have been knocking on the doors of Congress of you know regulators and basically hitting their heads up against a wall for quite a while yeah and sometimes life is about timing and I'm being very plain speaking here and I know there will be people who family disagree with me and I think that's wonderful disagree with me let's have this discourse because frankly I think that the u.s. is waking up we've got noise around the presidential 2020 elections but I will tell you based on the conversations that I am having with people on the ground who make the laws they are looking for the tweaks in the laws that they can make to create an environment where there is innovation and there are guidelines for crypto and this is where I want to also emphasize to people when I say this again and again because I feel like the community forgets this legislators write the laws regulators do not regulators oversee and enforce the laws so if you went a lot changed you need to go and speak to the legislators otherwise yes you are then talking to the regulators about oversight and enforcement and I just sometimes feel that people forget this fundamental fact and they rail on regulators on things that they cannot do which is change laws right and so I think we need to have a very sort of frank conversation about what the community needs from the legislators versus what the regulator's are doing and here's the other thing and again I'm going to give you another controversial wine which I know people will not be happy about to hear but I actually think their strength in the fragmentation that is the u.s. think about the US regulatory environment I no surprise there strengthen this okay we I'm sorry what do you think yes their strength in this believe it or not really okay yes okay but we do need to guide this in a way that works for the crypto and blockchain community all right but wait wait how is that how can there be strengthen that I mean like okay you can even look at a coin base which has I can't even remember the amount it's like some astronomical amount of VC money they've raised and they still don't have licenses in all 50 states yes that is true okay so there are strengths in having different bodies be responsible for different aspects of the financial system and not have it be concentrated in one centralized body in my mind that's no different than a distributed network of bodies who are responsible for different things so for example the SCC being responsible for X FINRA being extra sponsible for Y and you know IRS you know CFTC etc etc are being responsible for different things that actually in my mind is not a bad thing hold on before you know people start getting really upset here's the issue here's the issue what is and where does crypto and digital assets it the problem is it doesn't have a home with one it actually looks like it's got homes with all of them right and there's almost a power play and maybe turf war going on about who controls or who's going to regulate crypto that to me is the problem and frankly I think there probably needs to be an overall and convening body that coordinates with all of these different and I'm being very practical here you're not gonna get the SEC to step off or the CFTC to step off or any of the other agencies to just step off they're not they're not going to they've already stake their ground right in many ways so how do you get this to work on my mind you get this to work by having an overarching convening body who will then coordinate across all of these you know major institutions I'm talking at the federal level here and coordinate this across and have that be the convening body that ultimately works with those agencies allows them the power that they already have in their viven jurisdictions but then also that this convening body is the coordinator to make sure that there are sensible rules around digital assets because let's face it one digital asset versus another how can have different profiles and this is the constant challenge that we have and I know there are people working on token taxonomy and standardization or sorry standards and and definition setting and I think those things are very good and we need that but ultimately digital assets shape shift and that's very uncomfortable for people like all of a sudden it can be a utility and a security and it could actually be payments on money what do you do with that leave you as you embrace it we just have to figure out how to make that work how long did it take you for you know to get the Bitcoin futures launched like from the time that you proposed it within CM e to the time of launch I think we had the kernel of idea back in what 2000 I want to say late 14 or 15 early 15 and the pricing products came out we announced it at consensus at 2000 may 2016 and then we launched it in December November December 2016 and then with the futures o knowing that the priority index and then by the way I'll let you guys in on something which I'm enough yours out where we can talk about this but um I remember I think it was coined as 2017 I was right before I left the firm because I left seeing me in July of 2017 and we had already you know written the specs and we were going through with a whole bunch of people around what that would look like in potential traders and we're working on with a design of it and then what it would you know how the mechanics would work and how people would get connected because there's a whole host of things that need to happen for this thing to trade and I do remember at one point we were organized a meeting with through to the top I think 10 to 12 trading houses who would do this crypto and you know it's all the lot of the famous names you can think of now in early in the early days who would have traded this potentially and I remember we like convened this meeting and we were like do not tell people because it was during consensus and we're like do not tell people we don't want people get crashing this keep this under wraps and I will tell you I was so proud of all of the traders nobody said a word the meeting happened and it was great we went over the specs we talked about the problems of physical versus none you know cash shuttled us dollar basis risk like it was a very it was a really great conversation it was a very constructive conversation and we got good feedback and I will say I was singularly shocked I was I swore somebody would leak it and no one did maybe what Sondra was referring to was the eminently practical views of congressman Patrick McHenry who seems to be a Bitcoin believer but also understands the roles that central bank digital currencies and Libra could also play in the digital currency ecosystem let's switch to central bank digital currency and Libra the People's Bank of China is going to be releasing its own digital currency and there was a note that some RPC analysts published where they said quote if US regulators ultimately dismiss Libra and decide not to draft regulation to encourage crypto innovation in the US China's central bank digital currency may be strategically positioned to become the de facto global digital currency in emerging economies largely through a leap a WeChat UnionPay and other messaging and payment apps what do you think would be best positioned to compete with its Chinese central bank digital currency a USD central bank digital currency or an app based one such as Libra or telegrams cryptocurrency or a completely decentralized one such as Bitcoin or something else well okay let me start by saying this I think Libra has opened people's a lot of new people's eyes about the value of cryptocurrency Libra is not cryptocurrency however and we need to stop lumping it together with very real very important projects that are out there like Bitcoin and so and that's not to bash Facebook or or the Libra project but but the distinction between a a wholly new financial and event invention like Bitcoin I think that has enormous long-term value enormous long-term value and like many things Bitcoin is that it's such a very early stage relative to the rest of human invention and so how Bitcoin will be used we don't know in 20 years what Bitcoin looks like I don't I'm not I don't know the capacity to predict but I do think it will be of enormous value and utility when it comes to that when it comes to the question of a US dollar a digitized US dollar I think that is a reasonable next step for our central bank your interview with the the Federal Reserve's chief economist was quite instructive because it exposes the the fact that to the public that the Federal Reserve is contemplating and is trying to understand digital currency and their appropriate role is as a dollar as a store of value and international trade so I think there's enormous value there I think as an American I would like to have bonds to Ally pay and we should not allow the Chinese to write the rules of the road of international finance and we therefore have to have a more competitive mindset about ensuring that there is international commerce using a system that is not Chinese based after all the hand-wringing about Libra and China's new digital currency it was pretty amusing to interview David Anil fato an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of st. Louis who had a pretty surprising attitude to these potential threats to the global reserve status of the US dollar since we've been talking about the US dollar I did want to bring up this letter that was recently sent by house representatives French Hill and Bill Foster to Jerome Powell the chair of the Federal Reserve and they stated quote we are concerned that the primacy of the US dollar could be in long-term jeopardy from wide adoption of digital fiat currencies the letter notes that 40 countries are looking and develop into developing digital currencies it cites the soon-to-be-released digital yuan in China and it concludes by asking Chairman Powell if the Fed is looking into additional US dollar how it plans to respond to competing digital fiat currencies what the Fed would need from Congress for the development of a dollar etc what did you think of the letter and do you think they're right to be concerned about the long-term primacy of the USD no I don't think they should be concerned about it I mean the US dollar is if anything solidified its its hold as the primary currency in the world since the 2008 financial crisis there's been a lot of regulations passed worldwide Basel 3 for example that if Safilo solidified the the the the role of the US dollar is a regulatory object so I don't think I'd be too concerned about that but even I have to say this even even if it was true I mean who cares really I mean most countries most countries don't have a world reserve currency I mean it's like Canada for example seems to be a perfectly respectable country to live in and nobody wants to hold Canadian dollars except for Canadians and when I whenever I visit Canada it seems like a very nice place to visit people are prosperous and happy and you know so at the end of the day I don't even think it's a huge deal in the sense that you know the wealth of a nation is determined by it by its people it's human capital its productivity the opportunities it offers and and this whether or not the US dollar is a is the world's global currency is actually kind of just peripheral it's kind of like a an exorbitant privilege as they say for the United States because it gets to export dollars for goods and services and and that's kind of a nice benefit they have in some sense but I mean it's not critical for the well-being of a nation my interview with youngmee park is the episode i would recommend if you could only listen to one show this year the funny thing is that I almost didn't do it because it seemed a little too far afield from crota currency however a last-minute cancellation and the shocking news of virgil Griffiths arrest for allegedly helping the North Korean government evade sanctions led me to feature her on the show and it turned out to be the clearest illustration of the benefits of decentralization and censorship resistance that the cryptic community often talks about while the clip I've selected is more directly connected to what virgil did if you missed this episode I urge you to go back and listen to the whole thing because you need to hear the entirety of it to understand what I mean when I say that it demonstrates the importance of decentralization and censorship resistance earlier when you said cryptocurrency could help people in oppressed regimes I mean I think obviously that's true if they have access to the Internet but in North Korea where they don't I think it would be quite difficult for anybody who's not part of the regime to benefit that cryptocurrency conference that he was in he was absolutely benefiting the regime not the people obviously didn't go there to empower the people here and there to empower the dictatorship the people who can only attend that cryptocurrency a conference is the ischium happily who who's trying to become hackers who trained to do all the deliver activities and who want every intention to want the regime to say he didn't go home like you know you know commoners conference here everyone could attend so you know he just went there to attend over the dictator and try the entire division so that yeah that's at the end but that's bad cook occurrence like conference she wasn't like so much any conference yeah yeah I'm so glad you said this because people on Twitter seemed to think that he could have interacted with everyday North Koreans and I you know I'm not an expert on North Korea but I have read so many books on it and I was like what I was like I don't think you guys how this place works because he would be in a prison camp right now if he did that know you he might get shot so you know all Ranger got got tortured and to death the American poor he was a student Yeah right from version like Harlem and there's a South Korean who went to Qumran like a mountain the tourists and they're all teachers out there you cannot pass that line and she did and they shot her right on the spot oh my god people truly believe that they can't go to North Korea I'm it everyday life why don't they dare to try it it's a harm a kingdom not because it's the information is only controlled for North Koreans North Korean regime controls the information both ways they control what most people can hear about the rest of the world and they control the information day why we can't know about those young people even outside or outsiders we can't know so when you even go there as a tourist you cannot describe all I could take a bike you know hiking around and like go anywhere you want or like you know there's a backpack traveling that you doing the Southeast Asia you have to be review of guides all the time otherwise you can you know you become a trader incentive prison camps like what Otto Otto Laimbeer did yeah yeah and all he did was taking a poster or something yeah I was a crime can you believe that that you took his life for I mean if North Korea has a got to treat a white person white American that way can you imagine what that you are doing to North Koreans who doesn't have voice for not visible in the rest of the world that is if that's a brutality they do with a white person from America like yeah that heard a North Korean and are going through is something beyond our our in our comprehension yeah and and just to be you know to ask a finer point on this because I also saw people in Twitter saying things like you know King shion's hurt the citizens of these countries more than they hurt the leaders so you know yeah and he was one of the things that the Department of Justice charged him with was helping the North Korean regime of vanes evade sanctions so if he actually had done that what effect do you think that would have would that help so North Korean people or hurt them so I have so when I was young I said it was like this right North Korea had a great famine it was a month made a femine the regime chose to starve us so more than even like over three million people died not in Pyongyang but the people were like in us in the hospital cause in the in the northern part that was a lot of people you know seeing that the bodies on the streets everyday life for me I never thought that was not unusual that I had to be shocked and Investigation Bureau I was unstable affected North Koreans are average three to four inch shorter than South Koreans even we were same people because of the malnutrition and so just malnutrition when we were there they were gathering to study children and they get some just foreigners to come and see and they get mean on food from some junior chef I don't know you mentor other countries there's so much cash and medical aid all of this and they say use us as like a toys and show them and that record is coming they all take it to Pyongyang so those eight there's money does the right person per day you spend doesn't come to us that goes to North Korean elite people so if don't aid helped why did I escape and became a special slave and in great pain China the first thing when I arrived in China and after getting my mom raped and they said you have to be sold and get raped and and then say if you don't like it you can go back North Korea my mother asked me what the did I wanna do is she asked him an idea that you want to go back what you don't wanna do one thing made me to change my mind was when I for the first time so a trash bin in China I didn't know what it was but the lady told me that's the way are you throw away things that you don't want I was so shocked like how how much did you have things to throw away this country I never did it a trash can in my not like in my life in North Korea there's not to throw away North Korea and people like in North Korea if they really get benefited by all this international aid in the knowledge to be dying in those mind is when I was exactly North Korea South Korea all these like issues Hyundai or the state groups when the kingdom he want another to surprised he gave millions of dollars in the billions of dollars money and the food cash and every part of research that he could the gathered in South Korea and the international could be helped non came to the most of all on people I got and it all went to the region so good so people are now keep arguing the function is it hurting everyday life there's no way we can be heard and why we are already now there is no where people can suffer more than what we are suffering right now and those things that we keep smokin regime only only penicillin regime and how is our so hard as people understand computer science and economics all of these things if you do the thing that the dictator doesn't want diamond to you are bringing if you want to give the thing that the killer wants that you are benefiting him merchants dictator wants without the passion to be listed that means it is definitely benefiting him and we don't want the benefit a dictator right I'm going to end this episode with a clip from my conversation with Alex Gladstein of the human rights foundation who is an incredible explainer of the political power of decentralized money and I think it's a great big picture note to end on after all the big geopolitical moves we saw in crypto throughout the year how would you describe a healthy relationship between money and state well this might sound radical but I think in a hundred years people will look back in time I didn't think that it was kind of crazy that there was a total monopoly on money by governments whether it was democratic democracies or dictatorships I think that a healthier relationship is is probably something like where there's a separation of powers and I'll add some color to that in the same way that political power we now think of or at least I hope most to your listeners think of tyranny or dictatorship as like a backwards idea backwards concept and that democracy rule by the people is a more fair and just system and it provides checks on power checks on arbitrary power right then we have information right so I would also hope that your listeners would would maybe consider that the open Internet where anyone can permissionless lee access information is a better system of information than what we've had previously which was sort of like ivory tower and government controlled information right so decentralizing political power and decentralizing information I think it's been really very progressive positive forces for Humanity I want to make the same case for money I think that money needs to be decentralized I think that people need to be able to be more involved in the creation and distribution of money and that technology like Bitcoin allows that in the same way that technology like the the printing press or the internet allowed for the distribution and decentralization of information and that technology like democracy and voting sort of decentralized you know political power away from tyranny that's my sort of I guess radical idea I really believe that an open financial system will be just as healthy for the world as an open political system and as an open information system that's it 2019 in nutshell what do you think did my pick some up the
