[Music] hi everyone welcome to unchained your no hype resource for all things crypto i'm your host laura shin a journalist with over two decades of experience i started covering crypto six years ago and as a senior editor of forbes was the first mainstream media reporter to cover cryptocurrency full-time this is the january 7th 2022 episode of unchained with the crypto.com app you can buy earn and spend crypto in one place download and get 25 with the code laura link in the description tired of your exchange taking 25 of your staking profits the avato blockchain computer allows you to stake ethereum and other crypto at home and keep 100 of the rewards go to ava.do today's guest is maria shen partner at electric capital welcome maria thank you it's so nice to be here electric capital released its annual developer report on developer ecosystems in crypto this week what are the big takeaways about the current state of open source development in crypto and web3 yeah i think first of all 2021 was just a year of so many all-time highs first of all there's an all-time high in monthly developers right now we're standing at over 18 000 monthly developers across all of web3 and that's up 75 from last year and the other really amazing all-time high that was so good to see was that many developers are now joining like there are more developers that joined in 2021 than any prior year in in this industry's history of really more than 10 years so in 2021 34 391 so over 34 000 developers joined the sector last year which is up from about 20 000 newcomers in 2020. um and right now we're averaging about 3000 new developers that contribute to something in web 3 each month and i think a really important caveat here is all the data we look at is open source developers and so this obviously it doesn't include closed source developers a lot of this means that you know for people working at coinbase or for a lot of the exchanges for a lot of games that are closed sourced it's really uh that's not counted in these numbers so these numbers really are um an undercounting of the number of developers that are in the web3 space now yeah you know something that was fascinating to me about the report is you have a graph the increase in new monthly active developers and since january 2021 it's been a 75 increase um it's yeah been almost 8 000 new monthly active developers and so when you look at that graph it almost looks like a ball that bounced up into the right and i was just wondering what do you think was the catalyst in january 2021 that brought in so many new developers this past year yeah one of the things that we've seen is that developers if you look at kind of price charts and the way that developers move prices will [Music] once prices start spiking you'll see more developers coming into the space and so that's definitely part of what we've seen especially for new developers that come in the number of new developers that come in closely follows kind of the total crypto price charts and so as prices go up more new developers join but what's really really surprising and amazing to see is that when prices do come down developers actually stick around so you saw that in the last cycle in 2017 and 2018 where by 2018 you know you had prices fall more than 80 percent but developers really stayed flat through 2018 2019 2020 and in 2021 you have this huge influx of new developers coming in and that's really driving a lot of the growth yeah something that was so remarkable was more than 60 percent of monthly active developers started in 2021 yeah yeah yeah exactly and and yeah and about 45 uh full-time developers so full-time developers are the ones who commit 10 times 10 days or more in a month so these are developers that are really very regularly contributing and working in web 3 and you know they really account for most of the commits as well so there's definitely a lot of growth there too a lot of the growth also back to your other question is through the new developers joining through d5 ethereum has um you know garnered a lot of growth as well they've gained more than a thousand monthly active developers over 2021 and what's been really interesting to see this time around is that there are very healthy new emerging platforms beyond bitcoin and ethereum that are emerging as well um i'm just glancing at my notes here and it looks like for polka dots solana near finance smart chain avalanche and terra they're growing faster than ethereum at that same stage in history and so you know you're definitely seeing a lot of fast-growing layer ones emerging as well a lot of developers working at those ecosystems yeah before we actually dive further into that competition let's actually just talk a little bit about ethereum because when you look at the charts of all these developer ecosystems ethereum really stands out like literally it's this dot that's kind of far away from everything else yes yeah so explain what it is that that signifies yeah so ethereum it has almost three times the number of developers in their ecosystem as the next competitor as kind of the next leading ecosystem and what's really workable is the growth that it's still seeing um given that it already has more than 4 000 monthly active developers in its ecosystem that it's it's still really growing at that fast rate one of the really fascinating things we saw this time around is we usually like to track the top 200 projects by network value and look at developers working within that and so you can see that every single year the top 200 um developers are are kind of you know increasing they're they're they're more developers joining but over time a lot of them do drop off versus something like ethereum that does continue to grow or bitcoin that has been really holding steady and now they have over 600 monthly active developers it i think it really speaks to the you know the persistence and the sustained and healthy growth of of ethereum and bitcoin yeah some one of the stats that jumped out at me was that ethereum draws 20 to 25 percent of all developers that's yeah come to web3 so clearly it's still got staying power and the other thing is kind of that point that you made earlier that even when there are these like long bear markets that the developers who started during those bull runs at least for ethereum they really stick around for quite a long time so yeah you know you brought up bitcoin that for a long time was the second largest ecosystem this was the first year that it no longer is so what do you think that shift signifies yeah well it actually turns out that as we gathered more data that i think polka dot was above bitcoin last year as well but generally so so this is the first year where bitcoin has kind of fallen to the fifth largest ecosystem and you see a lot of uh you know you see polka dot and cosmos and obviously ethereum and some others surpassing it you know i i do wonder how important that is bitcoin is you know bitcoin the network itself is extremely mature at this point um i think the number of adjustments or code changes that need to change are are minimal and i think it's it's like a very robust and very mature chain and so that rate of growth is going to be a little bit slower than some of these smart contract layer one platforms that you see that being said um you do see something like stacks which is a smart contract platform built on top of bitcoin still gaining quite a bit of developers as well because more developers are joining and building applications on these chains and do you think that's just because when it comes to smart contracts it's just basically more complex and there's you know kind of like a bigger quote-unquote design space as they call it and so that would be a reason why there would be more developers that are trying to build on smart contract platforms rather than on something like ether on bitcoin which is more focused in one area i think it's it's really it speaks to the applications that are being built you know ethereum when it was first envisioned was seen as this amazing touring complete uh platform where you can start building applications much much easier than you could before and you you do see the effects of that in the number of developers as well where a lot of developers are building defy applications a lot of developers are building games and nft platforms um a lot of dows are forming up on these smart contract platforms and so as a result there are just more developers working on them okay great so in a moment we're going to talk a little bit more about the coins that are in that top tier as well as the ones in the level below competing at that level but first a quick word

get 25 with the code laura link in the description back to my conversation with maria so as we mentioned the list does not go you know ethereum than bitcoin and i i guess it didn't last year either but um one thing that stuck out at me was that polka dot and cosmos were in that top five and they're both kind of these interoperability chains i was curious for your thoughts on you know if that fact of like you know what what kind of chain they're trying to be what kind of network they're trying to be is a factor in drawing in new developers yeah absolutely i think for cosmos and for polka dot a lot of projects are launching to be interoperable with other projects that are in that ecosystem actually same with ethereum as well i think this year we we looked at developers in terms of primary developers and also also cross-chain developers and that was specifically really for the epm compatible chain so this would be ethereum virtual machine compatible chains where you can actually take the code that you have on ethereum existing solidity code and and be able to deploy that on another chain and and have that be able to work very well and so you do see that ecosystems that are evm compatible have a lot of traction as well because of the ease with which developers can switch over and can start deploying code and a lot of these evm compatible chains also you see start bootstrapping where where they have a lot of cross-chain developers in the beginning but then eventually have their own primary developers overtake that and so that's that's one of the things that you've seen this year as well and so one other chain i want to call out from that top five is solana because as far as i'm aware at least not that long ago a significant portion of its ecosystem did work in closed source and so i wondered if you thought maybe that ecosystem in particular maybe was slightly more under counted than some of the others or do you feel that that's just the case for all of them that's going to be the case for for solana for avalanche for terra really for a lot of this eco layer one ecosystems for flow especially as well there's going to be a lot of close source development happening on these chains that are not reflected in these numbers i think overall though looking at open source development is a very good way to seeing where the trend lines are happening and of course a lot of very important projects are open source and and have huge communities contributing to them as well so now let's talk about that next tier below the top five i noticed here we've got some popular chains but yeah maybe not obviously amongst that top tier uh the ones i've noticed here are near uh which i think as a former sponsor of my show cardano binance smart chain polygon and kusama what takeaways do you see kind of in that segment of those ecosystems yeah i i think one of the really interesting things that you see there is for a lot of these layer one ecosystems that are really breaking out and gaining a lot of growth that it took them a long time to develop that growth and it was really a slow and steady effort so if you look at across you know really across all of these right across avalanche terra and flow and near polygon and el grande cardano taizos icp phantom stacks a lot of them took um i'm just glancing at this chart over here they took you know close to two years or sometimes more than two years to attract more than 100 developers into their ecosystem and so what we're seeing is really that slow and steady development that's been happening you know in in prior years in 2018 and 2019 and 2020 really paying off as more people are joining these communities today and so earlier when you were talking about how some chains are growing faster than ethereum was at a similar stage in its life what do you think is the significance of that well i think there's two two things that are very significant here one is that it really does again speak to how remarkable ethereum is because when you think about ethereum you know five years back the whole the entire size of the crypto industry and the number of developers we had we're just much much smaller than what we have today of course on the flip side there are fewer choices for developers and fewer places they could go but that being said the fact that ethereum was able to command so many developers early on is really incredible and of course now we are seeing you know the chains that are that have more uh at least full-time developers than ethereum at the same point in time include polka dot and binance smart chain solana near avalanche and terra and so these chains a are just showing remarkable growth then b are also operating in a much larger developer ecosystem than ethereum had at that same point in time as well and so you know i i think not to discount their growth because not every chain is is exceeding in that way but but definitely it it really speaks to how far we've come i think as a whole crypto community or as a web 3 community to see the number of developers that are joining and how quickly people are joining today and so one other segment you looked at was d5 developer activity what are you seeing there yeah so d5 grew quite a bit predictably right now there's about 2.5 000 so 2500 diverse monthly active developers in d5 and about 500 new developers contribute to a project in d5 every single month so extremely healthy development there as well and so one thing that you kind of had a little notice about in your report was that you did not assess nft's gaming or dows why not yeah yeah that's a really important point to touch on um and part of it is because if you look at an nft collection you know a lot of it is deploying a contract um and that's really most of the code um and so the num the amount of code that's written is is is sometimes very minimal for something like gaming the a lot of the code is actually going to be closed source because the gaming mechanics themselves you know may not actually be crypto related but the economics within the team or within the game maybe and so in a lot of these cases developer activity may not actually be the right lens through which to look at growth and and to look at traction in these ecosystems and so one of the things that we're really excited about is um is gathering community signals and really thinking of kind of novel ways that we can measure the traction and the progress of the community growth for uh defy and or for nfts for gaming and for dows and so that's another report that we're hoping to publish later in 2022. and so will that be looking at things like social media is that what you mean by community or like the discord or yeah i think discord will be a huge part of it but if you think about you know for example anecdotally the growth of four-day yacht club or any of these nft collections where seemingly overnight you can have 30 000 people 50 000 people you know in a discord chat together that's a really remarkable statement that you can you can make around the community and how fast that it grows and so there are some questions there around you know exactly how fast is that growth right how long does it take for them to attain those kinds of numbers it could be something like how many messages are being sent per day what are people talking about i think the the kind of amazing thing with web3 is so much of this data is out here in the open and we're looking at an industry that has almost uh has more than two trillion dollars in network value at this point and a lot of it is open source a lot of it is communities that are building together out in the open you know on discord making governance decisions together and so all of those signals um are things that we want to look at to to to better represent nfts and gaming than just looking at developer data in general across all of crypto d5 nfts gaming etc etc what trends or ecosystems or developer activity or whatever metrics it is that you um are interested in what what will you be watching for this coming year yeah i think the really interesting data point that we started looking at this year is around retention it's really great when these new developers join but there's also a question of how long they stay and how sticky they are and you know whether they're going to stay through these different market cycles that we're likely going to see and again for an ecosystem like ethereum you see full-time developers with more than 30 retention even three years in which which is really really remarkable and so how does that look across different layer ones um that are seeing a lot of growth right now when you know when the market is doing really well and what kind of retention numbers are we going to see going forward i think that's definitely one thing that's that's interesting to look at and i think community is really going to increasingly become [Music] an important metric as well you know one of the dreams of web 3 is that everything can be more democratic and can be community owned with more transparent decisions and more transparent building and so you know that's almost baked the community aspect is baked into the dna of web3 and so to make data and metrics around that to measure how healthy that is to measure how distributed things may be so you know geographically how distributed are you how distributed is your community how distributed are your voting decisions i think all of these are are really interesting metrics that um we're going to take a look at next perfect all right well where can people learn more about you and your work oh um well i am on twitter at maria shen and the developer report um can be found either there or of course you should take a look at electriccapital.com for anyone who wants to reach out to us directly you can email info info at electriccapital.com and everyone on the team will be able to see that and answer all your questions great thanks so much for coming on unchained of course thank you so much for having me don't forget next up is the weekly news recap thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap [Music] bitcoin dropped to 42k here are two reasons why bitcoin fell by roughly 10 on wednesday dropping from a high of just over 47 000 to below 42 500 before settling in around the mid 43 thousands for the rest of the week the crash led to 322.86 million dollars in bitcoin liquidations between wednesday and thursday afternoon the largest such liquidation event by over 100 million dollars since december 3rd when over 615 million dollars was washed away in 24 hours the slump coincided with two negative events for bitcoin first the network's hash rate or the amount of computing power securing it took a hit on wednesday when kazakhstan shut down internet access across the country due to unrest over spiking energy prices according to cambridge center for alternative finance as of july 2021 kazakhstan accounted for roughly 18.1 percent of mining power in the world with the internet off in kazakhstan data compiled by the block's larry cermak shows that bitcoin's hash rate fell approximately 12 percent after kazakhstan's internet went down data from btc.com shows similar results with major pools like f2 pool and pull and via btc each losing hash rate between 12 to 19 percent as of recording time it remains unclear when or if kazakhstan's internet access will return the second negative event for bitcoin was that on january 4th bitcoin's dominance a statistic that tracks bitcoin's market share compared to the entire crypto industry reached 39.38 marking just a three percentage point difference between the all-time low of btc dominance that occurred back in early 2018. with bitcoin's latest dip ethereum is roughly 50 percent away from flipping btc as the largest crypto asset on the market despite the bearish outlook for bitcoin in terms of liquidations hashrate and dominance not every headline was negative a recent goldman sachs client note dated january 4th expressed optimism for the largest cryptocurrency and cited the possibility that bitcoin could hit 100 000 if it were to command a healthy percentage of the store of value market the goldman sachs note comes just after the firm reported that btc was among the best performing assets of 2021. speaking of bitcoin the block reports that a congressional subcommittee is preparing a hearing on bitcoin's environmental impact the block cites three sources with knowledge of the matter who say that the oversight and investigations subcommittee of the house energy and commerce committee is starting to build a group of witnesses to speak on the energy usage of proof-of-work crypto validation cryptocrime hit an all-time high in 2021 according to chain alice's a leading blockchain analytics firm cryptocrime spiked to an all-time high of 14 billion dollars in 2021. this is a 79 increase upon 2020 when only 7.8 billion dollars worth of transactions were deemed illicit however as chainalysis is careful to point out an all-time high and crime value is a bit of a misnomer crucially chain analysis reports that total cryptocurrency transaction volume grew by 567 percent in the last year while illicit transactions only grew by 79 this discrepancy and growth led to an all-time low of 0.15 of all cryptocurrency transactions deemed illicit in years past this number has been between point six two and three point three seven percent the cftc brings enforcement action against poly market on january third the commodities futures trading commission announced a settlement with poly market a d5 predictions protocol and disclosure a previous sponsor of my shows and ordered them to pay a 1.4 million dollar penalty poly market is a predictions market built on polygon that allows users to bet yes or no on certain events via smart contracts using usdc according to the cftc polymarket has run over 900 such events since its inception including markets on whether donald trump would be elected president in 2020 or whether eth would be over 2 500 by july 2021 in its order the cftc said that poly market offered quote off-exchange event-based binary options contracts while failing to obtain designation as a designated contract market or dcm or registration as a swap execution facility in addition to the fine poly market will also begin to wind down non-compliant operations by late january collins belton founding partner at brookwood pc called the cftc order the most relevant and telling regulatory actions for d5 founders and investors yet belton says the order is significant because it highlights the importance of having a decentralized front end wrote belton cftc highlights how poly market users are functionally entirely dependent on their front end to access the smart contracts despite non-custodial wallets he added if your front end is the only means of accessing your platform regulators have a strong incentive to bring you under their regulatory ambit open openc is worth more than a quarter of ebay openc the largest nft marketplace by volume by a factor of 3.7 announced a series c funding round of 300 million dollars valuing the company at 13.3 billion dollars co2 and paradigm led the latest round the announcement comes roughly six months after open seas series b which valued the company at 1.5 billion dollars meaning open seas value increased nine times in less than a year in addition openc is in talks to acquire dharma a digital wallet provider and an all stock deal worth between 110 million and 130 million according to axios open seas busy week comes as the marketplace's sales are booming for example daily nft sales volume across all nft marketplaces cost 200 million dollars only 10 times in history data from richard chen's dune analytics page shows that openc breached 200 million dollars four times in a row this week speaking of nft sales the board api club project had an incredibly noteworthy week data from crypto slam an nft data provider that raised nine point million dollars this week in a seed round backed by mark cuban and animoca shows that this week the board api club became the fourth nft collection to generate 1 billion dollars in sales even more impressively board api club and mutant api club a derivative of the board ape collection accounted for roughly 20 of all nft sales over the past seven days while no other project even crossed six percent the massive spike in bayc nfts occurred during a week when the nft project generated a number of headlines for example the wrapper eminem became a board ape holder or hodler a rare serum which essentially acts as an upgrade for a bayc nft sold for 5.8 million dollars in eth and lastly 1.9 million dollars worth of board ape nfts were frozen on openc after an owner had his private keys stolen which garnered quite a few memes on twitter 30 institutions ask permission to enter the d5 space on wednesday 30 institutions including coin shares celsius and winter mute were granted access to ave arc a permissioned deployment of ave ii ave arc was first announced back in june of 2021 by ave founder stani kulachav ave arc allows institutional players to join the crypto fray where yields range from 0.01 to 8.66 annual percentage yield on digital asset deposits a far cry from the yield found in the traditional financial world defy represents a powerful wave of financial innovation including transparency liquidity and programmability and it's been inaccessible to traditional financial institutions for far too long said stanley kulachav founder and ceo of ave the launch of ave arc allows these institutions to participate in defy in a compliant way for the very first time each of the arc participant must be whitelisted by fireblocks a new york-based cryptocustodian which will require entities to undergo rigorous customer identification processes that will be run per fat f guidelines or financial action task force guidelines fire blocks was approved by the community in november and is the only entity that can whitelist new entities for entry into ave arc more whitelisters should be coming as evidenced by ceba a swiss bank recently proposing itself for a whitelister role via ave's governance forum speaking of ave founder stani kulichov said the d5 protocol is developing a mobile wallet samsung has entered the metaverse samsung electronics announced on sunday that its latest iteration of tvs would offer customers direct integration with nfts where users can discover purchase and trade digital art through the micro led neoq led and the frame tvs on thursday samsung took an even larger step into the world of web 3. the electronics company announced that it is opening a flagship store called 837x in decentraland time for fun vids lynxdow wants to buy a golf course lynxdao successfully sold out a collection of nfts this week raising 10.5 million dollars for the express purpose of buying a golf course much like constitution dow launched its governance token a link style token dubbed lynx is soon to come according to mike dudas a founder of the block and link style project lead the nft sales saw two tiers of nfts sold leisure membership and global membership leisure membership to nft left holders with perks like the right to purchase a membership at the first physical link style club discounts on tee times and discord access global memberships received all the same benefits plus the right to an extra membership and extra governance rights thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about maria electric capital and their developer report check out the show notes for this
