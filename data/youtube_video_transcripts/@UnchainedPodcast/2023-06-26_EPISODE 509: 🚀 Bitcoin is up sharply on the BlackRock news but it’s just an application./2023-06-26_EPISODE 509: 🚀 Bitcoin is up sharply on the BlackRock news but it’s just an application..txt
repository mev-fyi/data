we don't think the odds of like this can get approved they're like 70 like we think the grayscale victory like the odds are still stacked against BlackRock um my colleague Eric Bell Tunis and I are roughly around 50 50 we think maybe which is way higher than most other people in the Trad five space but that said like I said the coinbase allegations are around completely separate Securities they're not accusing them of fraud so I could make I would make the argument that like they're not worried about their Bitcoin custody program and why would BlackRock choose uh coinbase they already have a partnership with coinbase they use them for pricing algorithms they input on their side unlike products they have like Aladdin um and also I believe they they it was about a year ago that they announced a partnership with BlackRock coinbase and BlackRock so they're also like institutional clients of BlackRock um they'll use they use coinbase to get access to the crypto market so I I assume it's for custody and other things like that trading perhaps um so there's already a built-in partnership between BlackRock and coinbase
