much for having me laura i'm a big fan of the podcast so um it's really an honor to be here great to have you why don't you tell us the story of how you got into crypto and came to found openc sure i i got intro or introduced into crypto in 2017 and followed bitcoin peripherally um before that but i suppose i was a little bit of a late adopter although sometimes people now nowadays uh 2017 maybe it's considered early i don't know uh that's when i really fell down the crypto rabbit hole at probably a pretty traditional path there's a lot of people in silicon valley at the time i started reading all the white papers going all the meetups at the time you could go to in-person meetups which was a lot of fun and just got really excited about the long-term vision of crypto and in particular very excited about crypto going beyond just financial technology so most of the applications at that time were around capital formation in the form of icos or financial products exchanges but i was interested in um sort of what was called i think at the time the tech thesis around crypto which was how does this actually influence kind of the underpinnings of the internet in a much broader way than just transforming finance so that was really what excited me about the technology and i've heard you say before that so as far as i understand you entered yc with a different crypto idea and then cryptokitties came along and i and that was kind of how you came upon this path of founding openc and what was curious to me about that was that you know at the time of cryptokitties most use cases for crypto war financial so what was it about nfts that made you um think that they would eventually become mainstream and become a really popular use case yeah i think at the time um you know my co-founder alex and i we were really looking for just fun projects we knew we wanted to do something in crypto and we were just looking around to see what was the most exciting thing to work on and you know part of it was a bit of naiveness on my part i hadn't been really that involved in the gaming ecosystem so i hadn't realized how cool online games had gotten uh maybe if i if i already knew that i would have thought that cryptokitties was as cool as it was but i just thought you know a digital cat breeding game was fun and and interesting and you know the fact that these things were selling for hundreds of thousands of dollars certainly raised some eyebrows and then you know the deeper you go down the rabbit hole you realize that what's magical about these nfts is not just sort of them in isolation right if you think about cryptokitties technically you could build the cryptokitties application in isolation without a blockchain right there's there's nothing that it really relies on the blockchain but the sort of effects of the ecosystem around cryptokitties so at the time people were building applications on top of cryptokitties so one of the folks who actually currently works at openc built kitty hats which is a way to accessorize your cryptokitties with a hat you really couldn't build that type of application without some form of you know true digital ownership of the asset and the ability to kind of move it from just the cryptokitties website onto an external marketplace or onto some other game and that was a really fascinating concept to me was this idea that you could have this new type of digital ownership that would allow for a lot more creative use cases than what you see with traditional digital assets and since nfts are still something that people are wrapping their minds around can you just answer the simple basic question of what is an nft as many probably know nft stands for non-fungible token and the way i like to think about nfts is they're sort of a digital item with some of the things we that are really nice about physical items so when you own a physical item you can kind of do whatever you want with that thing right if i own a cup i could give it to a friend of mine i could throw it in the trash go and put it for sale on ebay uh go and put it for sale on craigslist right there's there's lots of different opportunities for things i could do because i really own that item right i have full property rights over now contrast that to a traditional digital item think about your twitter handle or if you play any online games think about you know an item that you've earned inside of a game if i told you you know you go and sell your twitter handle on ebay pretty difficult to do right you don't really have the same property rights over those digital items that you take for granted in the physical world so nfts kind of layer on those property rights to digital assets in a really interesting way that in isolation again you know maybe they look just like regular digital items usable inside of a game but with an ecosystem around it with lots of marketplaces with virtual worlds where you can go and take these items then they start to look very different and and much more interesting in our opinion than just a you know a regular digital item so you've been interested in nfts for years and you've been working in the space for a few years why is it do you think that nfts finally took off in the last few months i i think it was a combination of things and the most important of which was really the the build up of a lot of hard work over the last roughly three or four years um depends how far back you want to go i guess you could go back to the origins of bitcoin if you really want to trace it chasing that far back um but really the last three years there's just been a lot of uh activity and a lot of building in the nft space so it started with cryptokitties it started with projects like crypto punks as well um but from there there was so much developer early developer interest that um all of the tooling around nfts got a lot better so wallets improved metamask really improved their support for nfts and also for fungible currencies marketplaces like our own emerged and allowed anyone to kind of create an nft and immediately start trading it art platforms emerged that were specifically dedicated to bringing artists on board to create nfts and building more of a curated experience um fiat on ramps onto crypto started getting a little bit better so you had that that build up of infrastructure such that today when you kind of dive head first into nft space there's just so much to explore actually just to rattle off a few other things there's nft index funds where you can take your nfts and put them in and sort of turn them into our new york 20 that can be traded there's collateralized loans on nfcs there's all this really cool stuff and then i would say there were a few things that really poured fuel on the fire uh for for the nft space and kind of accelerated that inflection and you know some of them were these really big sales i think you covered the four million dollar beeple sale you know i think you had a large part in really uh bringing awareness to this space and a lot of artists i think really took note of this idea that you could have a real business as a digital artist um that was something that you know didn't really exist as a as a career opportunity in a real way so those types of events really led people to take note of this space another example is nba top shot which worked with the nba to build an nft trading card game i think that really accelerated the space forward so in my opinion it wasn't one silver bullet it was a lot of things kind of coming online and really the accumulation of a lot of hard work from a lot of different people yeah i know personally for me that people i know in my personal life who definitely don't have a crypto background were texting me about nba top shot uh so i thought oh this is something that's catching the attention of non-crypto people and so who is creating nfts i know it's a very diverse group of people and um and who are the buyers sure on the creator side very diverse yeah so we have everyone from game companies that are building nfts into games so great examples of that include decentraland so decentraland is a virtual world project where you can own land inside of the world as an nft and then if you own that land you can build stuff on top of it even more exciting is that after you've built something on your land you can bring in nfts from the art world and you can people have created museums inside of decentralized so crypto voxels is another example of this so there's this whole gaming ecosystem that flies a little more under the radar i would say relative to the stuff that's happening in the like creator influencer musician side of things but i think is actually really exciting and really important to push the space forward and then the other folks who are creating nfts really anyone can go and create an nfc i was telling someone the other day that i created an ft where if you bought the nft you could get 45 minutes of advice for me on how to build a crypto startup and surprisingly people actually bought it so you know the sky's the limit in terms of of what you want what you might want to sell as an nft it's really uh we've seen some pretty strange things now uh there are more and more influential folks creating nft so rob gronkowski three famous football player who recently launched a trading card a set of trading cards on openc kings of leon so musicians and and really everyone's sort of tiptoeing into it and trying it out so that's on the on the creation side on the buyer side i would say that um traditionally it has been folks who are deeper into the crypto ecosystem already so maybe they own a bit of eth and are excited about the vision of web 3 and therefore you know checked out a web 3 game and you know want to participate in it so sort of at the intersection of crypto enthusiasts gamers technologists those types of folks what's exciting to your point around nba top shot is that that's really expanded dramatically in the last six months so as you said now there are folks who haven't even heard of crypto or aren't familiar with it who are just fans of the nba or fans of a particular creator and want to support them in some way and those types of folks are starting to get involved as well obviously there have been a number of sales that have had eye-popping sales tags attached to them and i was wondering do you think that we're currently in a bubble with nfts that's a good question um i think it's hard to quantify the nft bubble right because with cryptocurrency bubbles you can point to the price of ether you can say like price of ether is too high or something like that right with nfts it's not just about like the price right so you know there was the 69 million dollar sale of the beeple art but you know it wasn't because the purchaser thought of that as an investment necessarily it was more sort of a cultural moment and if you listen to interviews with him it's really interesting to hear him talk about why he made that purchase he was really solidifying digital art as a category so i do think that like all new technology there's sort of this wave of exuberance and excitement and then the excitement kind of dies down that being said i think if you look deep into the nft space you realize that there's there's all of this excitement there's all of this volume and all these transactions happening on a very um you know hard to use uh user experience and for the most part some applications have made this easier but they do cut corners in terms of giving people sort of the full nft experience um and so i think there's so much that we can do to really make the experience better that i am optimistic that maybe even if you know excitement sort of cools down a little bit that we're really just at day zero for nfts i am extremely confident that the design space for nfts is just going to get wider and wider and more and more exciting there's always this sort of local maxima a little bit of a correction and then things kind of progress from there yeah i will have to agree with you on that and i'm sure you know more about this than i do but from what i've been hearing there's just a lot more coming from a lot of new players so on that note how do you see the nft ecosystem evolving what do you think will end up being the biggest categories in which are some categories that are kind of quiet or small now but that you expect to become much bigger well i think the category that has really resonated with people for good reason is this idea this really simple concept that as a creator and a lot of people are creative everyone's creative and in some way in my opinion that as a creator you can create content and have a direct relationship with the person who's supporting you right so contrast that to instagram right where you're uploading your photos to instagram or your content to instagram and instagram's business model is not gonna reward you directly for the things that you upload you're gonna you know basically be kind of subject to their platform and their advertising based business model and you know typically you don't earn um much from that relationship with with that company so that's a powerful idea right the idea that anyone who's creative can create content and distribute it to people who want to support them and i think that's going to get more and more powerful as we lower the barriers to entry for blockchain so for example today on ethereum in order to do a transaction you're typically paying 50 in gas imagine if it was only less than a cent in gas well you could have people buy things for 50 cents and you know at that point you know anyone who wants to contribute to their favorite artist can really easily do so in a way that you know you're not necessarily expecting a ton from it but you do kind of feel like you have a stake and you could resell the nft later down the road and so it's a very interesting kind of hybrid model between you're not exactly investing in that person but you are you know contributing to them in a meaningful way that and there's some sort of upside as opposed to a pure patreon type model where you're just pure donation based so i think that that use case is really powerful because it's so simple um it doesn't require going and creating a new game or creating a super sophisticated experience it's something that can resonate with a lot of people that said i do think that over time what i'm excited about is more and more utility being added to the nfts so as opposed to just being a pure collectible having some use case whether that's a ticket to an event um an item inside of a game access to a closed group um i think the sky's the limit in term you know there was my use case where you you get uh 45 minutes of my time i think you know those types of things are super interesting as well so i would say the general theme is greater and greater utility and if i was going to point to a couple categories i would say gaming is is extremely exciting and event ticketing is is also extremely exciting and i think we'll definitely see continued innovation in the gaming space i think this year yeah i agree with that i've been keeping an eye on the gaming thing but i agree with you that because of the fees on ethereum right now it's probably not going to take off quite yet but you're right that there are new solutions in the works where it could be right on the cusp of major growth so i don't know if any of the examples that you just gave fall into the category of what i'm going to ask about but you wrote this amazing nft bible and one of the topics that you covered was the programmability of nfts and you even gave some examples but i actually didn't know what some of these terms meant like you talked about forging crafting the two i couldn't figure out were redeeming and random generation um but yeah can you just talk a little bit more about what you think is possible with the programmability of nfts and defines some of those other examples one of the interesting things um to mention about nfts is what is the sort of most generic nft possible well really all it is is it's who owns this unique serial code right so who owns id cryptokitty id number one two three four five and then the ability for the owner to transfer it to someone else right that's really all that's baked into an nft is who owns it and the permission to transfer but on top of that you can layer all sorts of other things right so you could um you can program into the smart contract that you know you take a cryptokitty and a godson chain card and you put you you like send them to the same address and then suddenly another nft pops out right something creative like that um so that's actually i think i was referring to what i was referring to forging right a game mechanic where basically you take uh different sort of raw materials and create uh something new from them very underexplored in the nfc space uh largely because of gas costs i think if we're speaking primarily about gaming it's very interesting because you could create games that you know involve assets from all sorts of different places cryptokitties uh trading cards decentralian land and create new assets from them and the game developer doesn't have to have a relationship with you which is those companies because they're just nfts at the end of the day they all look the same that's one example of sort of a creative programmability use case randomization the idea there is can you create nfts that are more randomly generated so um and there have been a number of projects in this space but there's a lot of excitement and you know some controversy over loot boxes but could you create on-chain transactions that randomly generate a set of nfts there has been uh some some work in that area as well and then what did you mean when you referenced loot boxes um yeah so loot boxes are basically in games you'll have these boxes that you can open that randomly give you items inside of the game let's actually oh just one last question i wanted to ask about nfts we've been talking about ownership i do know that there's kind of some questions around what exactly it is that people own when they own an nft what would you say it is that they do own um well it differs so uh in the base case so let's take cryptokitties for example when you buy a cryptokitty um you own the cryptokitty but that doesn't like give you the rights to go and sell shirts with the cryptokitty on it right you don't own the rights to the cryptokitty unless they change something about how they're yeah the copyright yeah that's that's not what they're selling now someone else could come along and say you know make a contract a legal contract that or you know terms that says when you buy this nft you do get the rights right totally legitimate thing to do the point here being that all all the nft is opinionated about is just it says who owns the serial code and that serial code can represent anything right it could represent real rights it could not um it's really up to whoever issued the nft and it's also up to that to people respecting those rights you know for example here's another here's another interesting example we've had folks um tokenize physical assets they they took uh bottles of wine and they turned them into nfts right and so they said okay this nft represents this bottle one you can kind of cash it in and get the physical asset if you want and then these things can be traded around and used in the d5 ecosystems there's all these really exciting things that you can do once you've turned them into an nft you're still relying on that party to respect that you can go and get the physical bottle one like if they go out of business or run away then that's not going to work like similarly in games yeah and similarly in games right you're sort of respecting that the cryptokitties game is going to stick around now where it gets interesting is you can create nfts that sort of don't have reliance on any single party right so this is what a lot of folks are starting to do in the art space they're creating an nft and then they're representing the metadata for that nft so the metadata is the image the name description all the like attributes of that nft they're putting that on a decentralized file storage system and so there it's sort of just as unstoppable as the nft ownership itself it's basically there permanently on this decentralized system and so it doesn't really rely on a game website to be available or you know in the case of the wine for the company selling the wine to exist it's just out there right and that's pretty interesting because those types of nfts you can imagine them persisting for centuries uh or decades and so that's kind of an interesting um thing that's happening as well yeah one thing that i found interesting was the bloomberg columnist matt levine called nft's tradable ostentation and i've heard other people talk about it as like bragging rights what do you think of what do you think of those characterizations i think it's i think that is certainly applicable to some types of nfts i think the the best example is um crypto punks so crypto punks was started actually before cryptokitties it was really the most well i guess people would debate me there was also rare pepes and things like that but one of the most og um crypto projects for those of you who aren't familiar with it there are basically these 10 thousand uh crypto punks um they you know they're pretty simple kind of art pieces uh they each have you know different characteristics there's sort of alien punks and zombie punks and different hats and things like that and back in 2017 they were given away for free so you could just go and you could go on the crypto punks website and you could submit a blockchain transaction and claim one for a long time there were there was a very small group of people who were enthusiastic about cryptic punks and every now and again you know one would trade for 100 maybe maybe a thousand dollars not a lot of activity outside of sort of the the core nft enthusiast um but what's happened is that that owning a crypto punk has really become symbolic in some ways of either you spent a lot of money on that crypto funk um or you were very early in the space right so a lot of people have them as their twitter handles um they're sort of this cryptocultural significance to owning a crypto punk to the point where now if you look at crypto punks um one was sold not too long ago for eight million dollars so they've sort of become and you know frequently they're they're valued at you know the million dollar range i think the cheapest one is 10 or 20 grand um and so they've sort of become this candidate for a real digital antique that has gone far beyond i think if you ask the folks who created kryptofox they had no idea that this would be happening three years later and they've you know sort of taken on a life of their own in the culture of crypto and even you know more broadly than crypto in the general tech scene um so it's been really interesting to see that project evolve and so i think to your original question i do think in these certain circumstances you know i don't think that that sort of dynamic is going to apply to all nfts some nfts are just useful in some circumstances they they really have taken on this very cultural significance that's you know similar to owning a physical piece of art all right this is so much great information about nfts and yet we have not discussed openc so in a moment we will do that but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible today's episode is sponsored by ey blockchain ernst young is committed to supporting

way to think about it is an ebay for nfts where you can go and you can buy and sell pretty much any nft that um that's on ethereum and we're actually expanding to other blockchains as well and so we allow for a variety of sale mechanisms so you can go and you can auction your nft off to the highest bidder you can do what's called a dutch auction where you start at a specific price and it declines or you can just do a fixed price listing we have bidding we have all these different sale mechanisms for nfts and then the last thing i would say is that openc has become sort of a source of truth for nfts we've been around for quite a long time we index all of the nfts that are out there on the blockchain meaning that we allow you to explore and search and discover all of them and so that's sort of another role that openc has been playing in the ecosystem since nfts can be bought and sold on multiple platforms how do you expect to maintain openc's position as the biggest marketplace what would you say is it's moat yeah i would say we're very focused on the on improving the customer experience so we you know we're not as you know opinionated about having a lot of lockdown under our platform we're super happy if people go and experience other nft websites and you know we think that at the moment it's really a rising tide lifting all boats um but i i will say that we we are laser focused on making our uh customers happy and we do have a long way to go there i think there's a lot of ux that needs to be improved about blockchain experiences in general and openc in particular but we we do see ourselves establishing a real brand and trust with our customers such that they can really reliably come onto openc get the best prices discover the things that they might want to purchase um and and have a really great experience around nfts and you know frankly i think users don't necessarily want to constantly be you know moving around between tons of different confusing user experiences they want something that they can rely on so we really aim to have opencv be that reliable source of both nft data and the ability to trade nfts as well and in terms of appealing to creators how do you compete against the marketplaces that are focused on specific verticals for instance if i'm a visual artist why would i use openc over something like super rare great question i think um the way we see it is um there's certainly an exciting role in for for more curated marketplaces like super rare but there's also it's important for people to have the ability to just create an nft and sell it to people you know regardless of whether they've been accepted into a specific platform or a specific more curated set of artists um and so i think we're not trying to be uh we don't think of ourselves as competitors to something like super air we actually think we're quite symbiotic with super rare folks can buy uh nfts on super air and sell them on openc if they so desire but uh you know we do have an open minting platform that allows anyone to come and create an nft and sell it and you know i think the benefits of ours are we have a nice set of features there so we recently made some optimizations where you can mint uh without having to pay the gas up front and sort of offloading it to the first purchase and then we've added a bunch of really interesting um additions to that so the ability to add unlockable content to an nft adding different properties and traits so we find that a lot of people find that that those that feature set is uh is really great for getting something off the ground yeah and the unlockable content is just specific content that only the buyer will know or have access to did i get that right yeah and so how does openc make its money we currently take a transaction fee so um on successful sales we take two and a half percent and for the minting where the cost of minting is offloaded to the first transaction is it the buyer paying that or the creator in that scenario the the buyer pays the gas cost uh that's separate from the um fee that openc takes but yeah the buyer pays the gas cost in that certain sense but i will note that even if you minted it with a regular system where you where you actually did pay the gas cost the buyer would also pay the gas costs to transfer it so um the buyer is kind of paying the gas costs in either circumstance and so over time what do you expect to be open c's largest source of growth or which of the categories do you expect will be one of the biggest ones for you well i i think we've always seen openc as a very general platform so um you know my hope is that we don't just become a marketplace specifically for say art or a marketplace specifically just for gaming i really hope that the use cases and diversity of nfts continues to expand and that we sort of become this really horizontal marketplace that can support all sorts of different use cases um but i do think that you know there are certainly some of those use cases that i think will take off earlier rather than others and the ones i would definitely point to are number one gaming so we're seeing a ton of activity there especially given that um we're expanding across a multiple blockchains now um and then art i think is going to be there our art and sort of creator slash collectibles is going to continue to be a really exciting use case as well and is that because those change hands a little bit more often than some of the other categories or i would have thought that maybe a bigger category for you would be one where uh the items do change hands more frequently because then you would get a cut of each of those sales i think in gaming what we've witnessed is that depending on the game um the lower value assets do change hands relatively frequently the higher value assets not as much obviously and that's a good point about art is that you know if you look at super rare for example most of their sales are primary sales not secondary sales but there are these really you know occasionally very large secondary sales so it's a little bit of a different dynamic but in the gaming space um you know our sense is that you can recreate once you have lower transaction costs you can really create a robust economy where you know you can have millions of people participating at 50 cents to buy their first item from the secondary market but then you can also have the prosumer cohort that's more interested in purchasing things at a higher value and maybe those the velocity and the frequency with which those things change hand just a little bit lower i guess i just realized that either way even if something doesn't change hands frequently if it's higher value then if your fee is based on a percentage you'll still get a hefty fee for those so then it's like less about the frequency do you have stats on how much money people tend to be making with openc and i'm sure it probably differs across category but i'm interested to know those numbers yeah it's hard to say exactly how much money people or i i don't have um uh aggregate statistics that i could that i'd be able to rely on um that being said in terms of just general stats um so last month we did around 148 million dollars in gross merchandise volume um that was up from about 98 million in february and then just 8 million in january so as you can see there's been really crazy growth of the space of the last little while and then um you know i think for if you take sort of an example set of digital artists i was actually just talking to um a class from the fashion institute of technology here in new york over zoom and um someone apparently had gone and just gotten really really deep in the nft space last year and made 25 grand from just selling their their digital art and uh you know use that to pay student loans which is really awesome to see so there's stories like that um there's you know now these sort of up-and-coming digital artists who occasionally are leaving their day jobs and you know deciding to devote their full time to this which wouldn't necessarily advise to do unless you know that you're gonna be successful at it but uh you know it is becoming this really really interesting opportunity where artists can directly monetize their work and people who want to support those artists can you know contribute really easily so whether that's for sort of viewed from an investment angle or more of just a support angle i think it's it's just a completely different um dynamic than you know again what you would see on existing digital platforms and i heard you say on a different podcast that you've been getting a lot of inbound but um that conversation with the fit class makes it sound like are you also trying to do things to draw in non-crypto creators to this space yeah well most of our um recent launches with bigger creators influencers athletes musicians have been from people reaching out to us being interested i think all the nft platforms are just seeing this really giant wave of of excitement and curiosity and in some cases confusion around what nfts are so we're certainly seeing that we've probably done a lot less outbound um outreach than some of the more art targeted platforms um just because we're more focused on building our sort of horizontal platform then going specifically and trying to target um artists but um you know it's certainly a lot of fun to you know have those sorts of conversations with younger people who are who are like learning about it and it's always great to get kind of feedback on what are the questions that people have and what are the like sources of confusion and you recently launched open c drops which are these collaborations with some bigger name creators do you have any numbers that you can share and how successful those have been we launched a few pretty uh exciting um drops recently so one was with um rob gronkowski i believe he did one and a half million in trading card sales and i think a total of three or four million uh secondary sales as well we did a launch with an artist named kevin abosh um who i believe sold five million recently uh and then we've done a whole set of um folks from sean mendes on music side to athletes um so lots of early experiments and a lot of excitement around it um recently we also did the snl auction so the snl team actually auctioned off their video of nfts as an nft um so that was a lot of fun so yeah we've been doing all sorts of stuff yeah that was a great video i did mention it on the podcast hopefully people watch that um so as you mentioned openc plans on integrating these some layer two solutions plus other block chains uh the two layer two solutions i know about are polygon and immutable x and then some of the blockchains are flow and tazos how do you decide which other blockchains or which layer twos to support in general for any application developer there there are these pretty interesting tradeoffs right so if you look at i'm not saying that uh one solution is better than the other it's just that they come with different uh pros and cons on one side you have layer two block chains or evm compatible blockchains that look a lot like ethereum and the nice thing about those is that you can use all of the existing ethereum infrastructure right so it's a lot easier for application developers to support which means that there could be more assets deployed on them and then for users they don't necessarily have to learn a new wallet they can use metamask which in my opinion has some really great tooling um and pretty easily connect to one of these other blockchains so that's on on one side um those are kind of the benefits of being and then are you saying and so are you saying that that would apply to tasos and flow that's one side and then tasos and flow are sort of on the other side where um is not evm compatible so you bring your own yeah they have their own wallet and they've done an amazing job of sort of abstracting away some of the blockchain components of the application to make it really easy for uh someone who's not familiar with crypto to buy their first item and then taseo similarly right you have your own their own wallet ecosystem around it as well so there's there's pros and cons right with with those with that approach they can fix a lot of the broken things about ethereum right there's a lot of things i think ethereum probably would have done differently if they could start over um some highly technical things that just make the ethereum blockchain kind of interesting to work with uh particularly around programming languages how the accounts work those types of things so that's the nice thing about starting fresh but of course the con is that you're not sort of immediately interoperable with the existing infrastructure so we we sort of balance those two approaches um we've built our systems in such a way that we can support everything eventually but of course there's going to be more of a heavier lift around the things that are less compatible with ethereum and we sort of evaluate things based on how much activity and how much demand is there from from users at the end of the day oh okay so so for flo and tazos what tipped it over to you guys adopting that was it demand just like you know there are so many blockchains that are competing with ethereum so it you know i guess flow makes sense simply because of nba top shot and because it's pretty focused on the nft space tazo's you know has a number of other competitors so uh and i should mention jesus is definitely a previous sponsor of my show and may even be a current sponsor um anyway so yeah how how did you pick amongst the constellation of blockchains that are vying for that space to be clear we haven't launched either of those yet right so we're still um in the development phases um uh and we're not at all opposed to integrating other blockchains as well we take a very you know blockchain agnostic approach what we liked about flow is obviously you know they've been great partners with us from the beginning and they launched um cheese wizards and they used they relied heavily on openc as a secondary marketplace for that game that was sort of their second game we just have a very good relationship with them we're i'm frankly really excited about some of the decisions that they made on the technical side around how they architected flow i think they really put a lot of thought into security a lot of thought into um how applications are developed on flow those types of things taso similarly we've had a great relationship with them for a long time and we're excited about some of the early art projects that are coming to fruition on ontasos our belief is that we're going to live in a very multi-chain world over the next coming years and it's not just gonna be a single chain that dominates everything it'll be a bit messy i think for a while um with a lot of competition on kind of the layer one and layer two space um probably some consolidation um eventually but um i think application developers in my opinion need to be prepared for a world where there are a lot of different blockchains and there's some probably going to be some user confusion about that as well and for the layer twos does using layer twos fragment nft liquidity that's a good question i would say it depends um what we're seeing mostly with layer twos today is that nfts will launch on layer twos and then be tradable in the layer two environment and then if folks want to bring them to layer one they they can but they don't necessarily have to so actually i think layer twos um because they're lower gas costs and higher throughput actually improve liquidity uh for particularly for decentralized marketplaces while maintaining interoperability with with the main chain so i actually think they're gonna really help marketplaces get to the next level i actually i think that's really interesting point and you're right that especially for gaming as we discussed because you know as you mentioned you're going to be launching with immutable x and so we would probably see gaming take off more with a chain that can handle high throughput for nfts um and so for openc you know a lot of creators are excited about uh being able to create an nft where the secondary sales will give royalties back and so when artists collaborate how easy is it for them to have the revenue split directly in the smart contract for all future sales yeah great question so um it it is something that's evolving over time there are a variety of approaches um so there's sort of um one approach which is try to be very heavy-handed and and bake the royalty into the nft itself and say like you know you can't transfer this nft unless you pay this sale fee that approach for the most part i think people have moved away from the new approaches is to say okay the nfc can kind of broadcast what should be the secondary sale fee and marketplaces can respect that and if the marketplace doesn't respect that well then maybe you don't really want to use a marketplace that doesn't respect the secondary sale fees right um so that there's a new standard sort of evolving around that idea because one thing to keep in mind is um unless you're extremely heavy-handed it is difficult to enforce secondary sale fees at you know at an extreme level so for example let's say that i wanted to sell you um my piece of crypto art and i didn't want to give the artist their cut right well i could just sell you it for a dollar or like a very low amount give that very small cut and then just you could send me money on venmo or something right um so there's always sort of workarounds for getting around those types of um fees and so in my opinion i think you know it'll sort of be a collaboration where marketplaces decide you know we're we're going to respect these fees and our if you use our marketplace we'll respect them but you know it's not so heavy-handed that you're that you can't you know transfer it freely as well because i do think that it's important that people can transfer nfts to whoever they want um without without some sort of weird restrictions on having to to pay um a certain amount just for a transfer um so it's a i think it's an evolving thing that uh will require some some sort of coordination between the different parties involved that's interesting yeah because i you know i think the reason that creators are excited about this face is because of the royalty aspect um so you know kind of speaking of ways in which the space can be maybe not so positive for creators there are a number of nfts obviously that are being minted by the people who don't have the right to mint those nfts and i was curious on the openc platform what percentage of the nfts minted there fall in that category unfortunately i'm not sure what percentage it is but i can tell you how we and other folks deal with those sorts of circumstances and it is an increasing percentage i would say or not an increasing percentage but an increasing number right so as the number of nfts grows and more and more people start minting there's of course there's a number of things that happen one there's more opportunity for fraud so for example someone could since you can create an nft you know they can create a nft that looks identical to a cryptokitty and try to sell it to someone so that's something that happens um every now and then um on our platform and then of course there's this issue of taking content from existing sources that they don't own and and uploading those as nfts in both of those scenarios the way that we think about it is yes you have created an nft and in some ways it is a legitimate nft um but openc does not care to display that on our site uh so we're not gonna display a fraudulent cryptokitty because it would confuse our buyers right and uh similarly we're not gonna display copyrighted content because that's you know against the law what's very interesting is that you could in theory create sort of a silk road type experience around nfts where you can sell these like knockoff nfts now i don't know how much demand there would be for something like that but the interesting thing about it is that openc's not the only platform out there so we're not the gatekeepers um we're not like twitter where we can kind of completely shut down people's accounts but we do have policies in place around what types of things we allow people to uh surface on our platform and so how is it typically that creators usually figure out that their work has been minted into an nft without their consent so we have a flagging system on an on openc where if you notice something that you know is is suspect or if you're the artist who created it you can flag it and then our we have folks who um look through those reports and de-list that um content and then so if there's been somebody who already purchased that then what happens at that point yeah and those sorts of circumstances so we do the there we have a relatively sophisticated system around this um anything that has been created on openc that has not been explicitly verified by openc has a warning attached to it right so if for example cryptokitties we know the cryptokitties contract we know if something is a cryptocurrency we even have a little blue check mark next to it that says this is indeed a cryptokitty and so we don't show that warning but for anything that you know is just uploaded by someone and linked to then uh we we do show that warning and the onus is on on the buyer in that circumstance um so sort of do your own research when it comes to unverified um items frankly because we don't have the bandwidth to look through all of the content that comes to openc um but we also ensure that unverified content is not going to show up in places where users might make the mistake and think it's something that has been verified so our feed is a lot more tailored to the top content on openc as opposed to just anything that has been listed so if i buy an nft and then later on it's flagged as something that you know was um a copyrighted material that the creator did not have the right to mint then i don't get refunded my money or anything like that it's it's just you know i didn't do my research unless the creator decides to refund you your money um then that's correct yeah and then what happens to that token it's just that it cannot be listed on openc that's right yeah the token um so if it's copyrighted content the token will sort of appear as a square black square on your profile that says you know unfortunately this item was delisted um but you know you if there is another marketplace out there that doesn't you know have an objection to that content or you know does want to support that nft you it's still in your wallet technically and is there any kind of goldilocks version of openc um doing some vetting in a form that's decentralized because i feel like the current system it's probably more negative for creators the way it's currently done because it means that whoever wants to steal their work and mint it is you know can basically just do that and then um you know they don't really suffer major consequences so is there any kind of decentralized version of this where an open c has some kind of token and then there's a decentralized network of people who do some vetting about what gets minted on the platform rather than catching people after the fact yeah well um not aware of any decentralized uh version i mean there have been i guess there's two angles um one is sort of the token curated registry idea which has been around for a long time which is basically like a group of people that would vet content before it gets minted um so that's certainly an interesting idea i don't know how yeah it's possible that something like that could scale in fact maybe it's an interesting startup idea um now what i will say is that that doesn't that doesn't prevent people from just you know deploying a smart contract and minting to that smart contract and having it show up on openc in some capacity um and i will say i'll also say that uh you know it's not just after the after it's been bought that we have this flagging system right if you identify something before it's even on sale um you know we can take it down and then and additionally we'll be putting better measures in place to auto detect this stuff through basic machine learning and sort of image comparison those types of things um so i don't think i think there's a lot of sort of low hanging fruit improvements we can make before um necessitating sort of something more extreme but i'm in full support of you know a more creative solution where it's like incentivization and stuff um i think sometimes those types of things are compelling other times they're hard to actually pull off in practice recently there was a story that matthew hickey of hacker house introduced what he called the zero day collection which included an asset that he described as quote highly collectible hacker artwork and it was basically a cyber security exploit that he meant it as an nft and the day after open c took it down what factors went into making that decision i i don't know the exact um i wasn't as involved in the exact decision around that one but you know our sense was that it was um you know in violation of kind of terms of service and in the sense that like you know it was sort of selling something that we didn't feel like comfortable supporting right yeah i don't know the exact um reasons but it was a little about outside of the territory of things that we felt comfortable with and earlier we were talking about fractionalized nfts and there has been some suggestion that those could be considered securities do you have an opinion on that or any insight well we yeah we don't trade fractionalized nfts on our platform um i um am not an expert on on that i'm not convinced that in circumstances where it's a fractional version of a pure collectible that it would necessarily be a security but um you know we tend to um stay out of the like you know currency fungible world and more oriented towards these sort of unique one-of-a-kind assets so let's now um talk again kind of about where nfts are going as we've discussed there's it's very like it's a space where creators really can play and yet in order to kind of build this world where nfts are a huge thing there are a lot of standards that still need to be set so what do you see as some of the um issues that need to still be decided upon when it comes to nfts i think one area of opportunity in my opinion is around the metadata for nfts so today um you know it's it's pretty basic right you can um have an image a name a description of your nft but you can't necessarily broadcast to the world that this nft is for example an event ticket right if you could broadcast that to the world wouldn't be that hard to do it's just creating some sort of standard around it then you know open c could kind of pick it up in a different way and you know support it more natively on our platform such that you know maybe the sorting and filtering and searching is different um or if you broadcast into the world that this is a game item you know maybe uh games could sort of pick that up and incorporate them in their game more interestingly right so um there's sort of this open question around you know you have a cryptokitty and let's say you wanted to create a game where you're like you know battling those cryptokitties inside of decentraland how how can you broadcast what that cryptokitty should look like in a different context right is it through like a you know more advanced uh sort of set of 3d models or you know i think there's just a lot of opportunity for richer metadata to have that kind of metaverse type ecosystem where things can really move between different types of experiences so i think that's an opportunity and yeah the other one we touched on was was the royalty standard i think we talked a little bit about that but for the royalty one it didn't seem like you thought there should be a standard way to handle that or or do you what's your opinion on that oh i think there should be a standard i just um think that it should be more of a standard that broadcasts what the royalty should be and then marketplaces can opt in to that to the fee as opposed to trying to bake it into the the nft smart contract itself um if that makes sense so i i think that primarily for technical reasons um because if you bake it into the nft themselves then you restrict the transferability of the nft wait why is that well let's say that you um said that like whenever this nft is transferred um you have to pay or let's let's say that you somehow sort of enforce there's a five percent fee every time it gets sold right what happens if i just want to gift you an nft there's not going to be a fee on that and i could gift you an nft and you could pay me 500 through venmo right um so you it's hard to get around those sorts of scenarios okay it's so funny because in other conversations that i've had um yeah i think the creators but even someone like mark cuban is you know very excited about that and then it just seems like you're just saying people aren't going to pay it they're just going to figure out other ways to hit him well no no i i told sorry yeah i think i'm giving off the wrong uh impression i i think that man is really a technical issue i actually at a high level i think there should be a standard for royalties and i think they in the majority of scenarios they will marketplaces will respect those standards and uh pay royalties to the creators uh so i think i was diving a little bit too too much into the weeds on on the technical side that's that's sort of my high level view i just think that the one thing i would say is that there are a few double devil in the details around how you actually enforce that but i think that for the most part it will be enforced through social consensus of marketplaces and i think it's a great opportunity for creators i think creators will uh be able to sell their work and monetize the secondary sales i think that is one of the big unlocks and uh it's all it's happening today on openc for example and it's happening on other platforms um and it'll continue to happen um there there are some coordination challenges around having every marketplace sort of use the same fee system but i think it's solvable now that nfts are more in the public eye there's been pushback on environmental issues does openc plano address that in any way to appeal to the mainstream world the biggest thing we're doing today is we're moving over from proof-of-work blockchains to proof-of-stake blockchains and we're actually first movers in this category i think will be one of the first applications to really have a significant multi-chain push away from uh ethereum and not not entirely away from ethereum but onto these more scalable versions of ethereum that aren't proof of work based um and and you know i would say that it's interesting that's um number one it's a challenge for the whole blockchain space it's not just nfcs number two it's already happening not just for environmental reasons but for pure scalability reasons so i think it's this inevitable shift um that is you know already starting to happen and going to kind of increase uh in velocity over in the coming years yeah i think it's it's just more noticeable with the nfts because it's drawn in this non-crypto crowd yeah so um you're right that it's an issue across the space but the nfts for whatever reason have been the catalyst for a lot of criticism in that regard so i recognize you may not be able to reveal who is working on creating nfts with openc but what would you say is next for openc and maybe you can give some hints about what's coming down the pike sure um well well one thing we're really excited about uh is launching our first foray into a multitune ecosystem as i mentioned and so we have some alpha experiences there and are going to be launching things relatively soon as a full experience on the on the core platform so we're super excited about that we do have a few launches in the pipeline of different content but we do like to keep that a surprise for our users working with more and more athletes musicians these types of folks on launching exciting nfts you know i think we'll always just be focused on really improving the core platform so trying to listen to what our users are saying make it a much more friendly experience for people who are new to the space i think openc is a little bit intimidating for the casual user at the moment so we're making a lot of steps into better onboarding and making nfcs friendlier to people who don't understand the technology yet so you know those are some of the things that we have in the pipeline great and where can people learn more about you and openc uh you can follow openc on twitter the handles openc at openc and then
