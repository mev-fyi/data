not a dividend It's A Tale of Two fun now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet generally speaking airdrops are kind of pointless anyways um my name's trading firms who are very involved I like to have the ultimate D5 Protocols are the antidote to this problem hello everybody Welcome to chopping block every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry insiders perspective on the crypto topics of the day so first up we've got Tom the D5 Maven and master of memes next we've got Robert crypto connoisseur and captain of compound today we've got Laura the CEO of the show and you've got myself I'm haseeb I'm the head hype man of dragonfly so we're early stage investors in crypto but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice legal advice or even life advice please see choppingblock.xyz for more disclosures so happy Chapel everybody ethereum is now unstakeable everyone I know we've all been waiting for the day that you can finally unstake your ether and panic sell out on the market um so the the whole the internet crypto Twitter has been a light with waiting to see what happens with uh once shapella allows unstaking so just to catch you up if you're if you're not aware ethereum when they did the merge and they transitioned to proof of stake uh staking was only one way you can only stake your ether you can't unstake it until a second upgrade called Shanghai which is involved in this combination of upgrades Shanghai and capella which is very lovingly called chappella was finally set to be released uh which was as of the time we're recording just you know a day and a half ago so chappella is the first moment that all this ether about 35 billion dollars of ether at current prices could be unstaked and people were arguing with each other on the show we've kind of debated back and forth you know how much is going to get unstaked does this mean that like everybody who's staked is going to pull their money out and panic sell their ether on the market there was a lot of worries about what this is going to do to either price well tripela has come and gone although the staking is not instantaneous there's sort of a cue you have to kind of wait in an orderly line to make sure that you can actually unstake and then go do whatever you want to do with your ether overall what we've seen now that chappella is live is that there's about 1.8 billion dollars worth of ether out of the 35 billion that is cute for withdrawals that's in dollar terms the unlocks are kind of staged over you know like 12 hour periods roughly most of the unlocks initially are coming from Kraken and it's expected that this is probably from its U.S clients because of course Kraken to shut down their staking business so a little bit over a third of their total eat staked is getting is getting pulled out from the state ether now it's not clear when the stake either comes out is this just going to go directly to people and maybe they'll restake it or maybe it's going to get sold on the market because people want to you know tax loss Harvest or they just want to sell or they just don't want their ether anymore but there's also been new deposits so about 110 000 eth that was uh unstaked and about 80 000 in new eth that was State and this maybe is expected because now your opportunity cost for staking is lower because you're not stuck so before if you decide to stake that was a big decision because you had to wait until eventually you could pull your ether back out now you shake you unstake whenever you want there's there's much less opportunity cost so Tom uh walk us through the dashboard that you just pulled up here yeah this is a great Dash from nanson just want to walk you through a lot of details around East staking but this one uh right here sort of in the bottom is probably the most interesting um basically looking at deposits and withdrawals and sort of netting out you know how much ink is actually coming out or being staked and what you see is there's sort of these two sides in the debate around uh chappella is gonna be bullish is this gonna be bearish obviously personally bearish because people can now withdraw their eth and sell it on the market and as we sort of said the majority of that is coming from Kraken after being forced to uh you know shut down their heat staking business as you can sort of see down here there's 63 of of uh on Stakes are coming from Kraken but you also see a lot of people now depositing their Ethan and staking it because now they know that they can withdraw it it's sort of been de-risked and so it's a lot more attractive to actually do that you don't it's not a hotel California anymore you can check out if you want and so um I think overall you know hey short of some structural selling um you know it sort of completes the proof of State transition for ethereum and so either price on the back of this a lot of people were worried like oh my God is The Ether price going to collapse you know is there just going to be a wave of selling and we've actually seen the opposite ether actually hit two thousand dollars which was the you know Milestone that we haven't seen in quite a while and even Bitcoin surged to 30k probably not due to chappella per se but we basically hit numbers that we didn't see until when three arrows collapsed and of course when three hours collapse you know interest rates were at like what one percent and now interest rates are at five and Bitcoin and ether are kind of back uh full swing so it's been a very very interesting event one thing that I feel like it confirms for me is that nobody knows what they're talking about like anybody who claims like I know what when as soon as unsinking happens eat the price is going to collapse or either price is gonna no one no one knows no one has any idea that's that's the lesson for me I don't know what you guys took away from seeing what happened with chappella well I thought the best thing to come out of it were all of the really high quality memes of Dave Chappelle in Shanghai I've not been on Twitter in the last like 48 hours I do not see that oh there's there's some great content I saw somebody tweet um evidence that ethereum is not a centralized entity they did not capitalize on the fact that you could do something with chappella and Dave Chappelle um like and maybe that was before you saw the memes or something I don't know but um yeah I thought that was funny one other thing that I wanted to say was like I find it ridiculous that a lot of people were spelling Doom and Gloom for when this upgrade happened because I mean there are so many of these like ghost chains where like do you remember when what was it um ethereum classic was 51 attacked and like the price really didn't budge very much like I just feel like people are busy they're doing their other things like they're not thinking that hard about like oh I need to move my assets right now or whatever and like the Die Hard people in ethereum are the ones who staked you know starting in like December 2020 or whatever or since you know even in just the last few years so like the vast majority of them yeah they're not going to be like super motivated or suddenly like withdraw their eth so I thought it was like super overblown yeah it runs me a little bit of sort of like the constant shadow of like oh the mount gots you know creditors distribution and all these people are gonna get Bitcoin and they're gonna sell it um yeah yeah yeah um and it turns out there's news came out recently that like a lot of the Bitcoin that the government the US government sees from the Silk Road shutdown has been sold in the past three months and like it's like several billion dollars like no one noticed and so it's just like you know people create these sort of narratives in their head and they want to I think just get engagement but in reality like the price has a lot of other factors that go into it yeah the reality is that you know chappella was also one of those things that was very foreseeable and this is this is a perennial debate and I'm sure we're going to incense a lot of people if I say this but like Bitcoin havings are basically the same thing everyone knows Bitcoin is going to have they know exactly when it's going to have there's no uncertainty and people can sort of argue themselves like well but the news coverage comes in so they're flow effects because people are buying more because you know the news is covering it and you could argue the same thing for chappella one way or another but the reality is that generally speaking when these things are very foreseeable in advance which obviously sure palette date was not set for quite a while but when it finally was set I think at that point it's pretty easy to say markets understand what's going to happen and it's fairly like obviously you don't know exactly what's going to happen in terms of exactly I'm just going to unstake or exactly when it's going to get sold but you've got pretty good bounds on it and so although The Ether price moved up it didn't move up a ton it didn't move down a ton it mostly kind of you know the broader Market lifted and ether listed alongside with it which I think is usually the good base case for any of these these foreseeable events that are going to affect Supply Dynamics I interviewed somebody who said that they also thought that the community was kind of like underestimating um how much commotion might happen at that time like there might be certain things that are unforeseen that would happen and blah blah blah and I was kind of like really I was like I feel like all this stuff gets tested almost like to death before they execute and yeah like nothing has really happened so that you know I think they were over estimating that I mean it's always possible when you're doing a live protocol upgrade for something to go wrong but always possible and testing on a test net like there just aren't nearly as many eyeballs and as many people trying to break something as they're going to be when it's on Main net that said it has been like what like you know seven eight months since the merge so there's there's a lot of time to test this you know this was not rushed in fact they they explicitly waited this long to make sure that every single nook and cranny of this code base was tested to to Perfection now you know never say never you never know what might be broken and somebody who figured out that there was a vulnerability could wait until maynet because you know it's doing some attack on testnet obviously is not particularly lucrative Because unless it's on girly in which case somebody's very lucrative but like in reality there's always a small percent chance something goes wrong and so you could argue that well if the price before the event Was X then the price after the event if it goes well should be X plus something I think that's that's a reasonable argument to make uh for for something like this in particular not so for the happening and not so for other things that are completely you know it's basically zero risk right well the price did go up the price did go up yeah okay but weirdly after the merge the price I think went down originally right it did yeah everybody was selling that I think I think everybody was selling that one they and they I think they'd all bought in advance and then they like wanted to do the buy the rumor sell the news thing but like too many people did it or or wait that's not exactly too many but you know what I'm saying the price was higher than when they bought so yeah it does feel like the merge was so ecstatic like I was so excited about the merge it really felt like a special thing for the industry Chapala I never I don't know personally I mean we're not trade we're not day trading either or something so it never really felt like that important of a milestone and so I was a little bit annoyed with how much people talked about it because I'm just like just wait a month and then it'll equilibriate and then everything will be fine but you know I guess Traders love talking about things like this because it's something to trade not that we've been in wanta volatility like obviously things have been very volatile regardless of something like chappella yeah in general I feel like there are a lot of people in crypto that are like a little bit too obsessed with prices and they they overreact it's it tends to be by the way I think like you know emotional men like my old hairdresser one day he was like oh my God like I lost thousands and dollars in and trading xrp last night and I was like what the are you doing and he was like out at dinner and something happened and he saw his phone and he just like Panic sold and then he was like oh I shouldn't have done that so you know it happens emotional joking about the men thing joking about the men you are not first of all you are not joking about the man thing that's definitely correct um because the the studies show that yes men are more emotional about uh finances but anyway is that true men are more emotional finances I think that men do more financial stuff like they trade more and they dabble in more crazy stuff but I do you think women are less emotional about finances than men or like women somehow they they have better returns or something because they're um I think they just do they just more Buy and Hold yeah right exactly whereas like the guys they're like oh my God this happened I have to buy or sell and you know so that's what I'm saying I feel that it's some of it is like the illusion of agency right you feel like you can do something and I think as a dude you are this obviously massive swooping generalizations but whatever it's our processity we can General as much as we want I think as a dude you're more likely to feel like hey one I'm probably right I probably know where this price is going and I should trade on it while I'm at a dinner party I feel like all those things feel very stereotypically mailed to me I don't know Robert what's your take male versus female trading Behavior I think everyone's just bad at trading in general myself included um so I don't think it's based on gender I just think it's based on being a human I think robots will eventually demonstrate that the humans are just dumb it's a very diplomatic answer Tom come on you gotta actually weigh in you can't you can't do like a run you can't pull a robber to say oh it's all humans I think uh these also show men generally take more risks or have more risk-taking behaviors and so you know you're gonna ride a motorcycle and you're gonna you know try to date shade crypto it's it's just part of the it comes with the hormones and so I think uh you know it's it's a broader a broader topic blame it on the hormones it's always the hormones anytime anytime a trade goes against you I'm like oh this damn hormones okay so let's move on to other news so chappella it's all it's all done you can unsake your ether now go have added kids other news so in the FTX the story that keeps on giving uh FTX there were some more uh I guess reports filed with the with the court uh in the FTX restructuring and they're now proposing John Ray who's leading the the bankruptcy proceedings or whatnot proceedings the whatever bankruptcy guy uh the CEO of FTX he is proposing now that they reboot the exchange and so this has been floated in The Ether for a while people have been talking about hey you know I kind of really liked fdx's software it was pretty good maybe the guy who's running it was kind of a dick but everything else was great and so now it seems like the the restructuring team is really seriously considering running the exchange back up and presumably part of if you want to actually get a recovery and sell off the rights to run FTX I presume they wouldn't run it themselves they probably sell it to somebody else and give them the software and the license and then use that to help aid the recovery for for depositors in order to get somebody to be willing to bid for it you got to build some hype and so this is kind of what they're doing they're kind of putting the word out there getting people excited on Twitter like oh my God FTX 2.0 it is in many ways the most crypto DJ thing I can imagine is getting excited about the biggest fraud exchange ever in history making a comeback so it's kind of beautiful in a way but also um you know well I I guess it's just beautiful what are you guys thoughts about FTX coming back so I I think the plan's a terrible plan frankly and I'm not a creditor but I'm going to speak with like a creditor hat on you know if I were creditor I would not want them spending any money and or time trying to actually reboot the exchange that could go towards returning money to their creditors and the reason being is that the exchange most likely will not be an independently profitable exchange and there's only two possible outcomes it's profitable and it generates assets for the creditors or it's unprofitable and it just further erodes the assets of the creditors and for so many different reasons I don't think that FTX has any innate advantage in its reboot over all of the other exchanges in the world and will be a profitable exchange and so if I were a creditor I would look at this plan and say like this is a bad use of capital and focus when they should just be focused on getting all of the assets back they can not spending them not hiring Engineers not building and launching new things and just trying to return as much as possible to the creditors but but did you see that um Zane Tackett the former director of institutional sales who who used to work at bitfinex also suggested that they do something similar to the bfx Token that bitfinex did after it's hack what do you think of that idea if people want to invest in a new exchange they should be given you know the choice to invest in a new exchange and it should be a new Venture and it probably is best off you know as a new Standalone business that gets spun up from the ground up and so you know I I think it's a bad plan you know I don't see any advantage that FTX would have over all of the other exchanges that weren't horrific dumpster fires that destroyed tens of billions of dollars of assets and Trust so I don't think it should live yeah I uh I see a lot of love for FTX or what it used to be on on Twitter and I think a lot of that is stemming from a few things right like one is they're super aggressive to list new products so like pretty much any random new coin give like list of new perk for two is they had cross margin built in on day one which you know and to an extent also kind of caused their demise but um you know it is a pretty killer app if you can do it well and now there's obviously a lot of other exchanges are looking at ways to add sort of global Cross margining or expand across margining so it's clear there's like market demand for it um but three was kind of just the UI like people just liked how clean and and simple it was but I I do kind of find it strange that I don't know about the quality of the code base or like overall engineering for FTX but I would find it kind of strange if FTX itself were like an extremely well engineered machine and yet you know in this debtors report that uh John Ray the the who's running the bankruptcy put out a lot of it was actually detailing all the poor custody practices and accounting practices that were going on at FTX and mount Alameda just like it's a lot of kind of stuff that we've heard before but just more very acute examples of like oh we found 600 million dollars in this private key that was randomly labeled and in plain text and just on somebody's computer um and I think it's like Sam himself was saying you know Alameda is inaudible just come up with some numbers for the financial report so it would be rude to me that like the people who can't do basic accounting and have these very poor custody practices can also build you know a world-class exchange I mean look from the from the front end like the product was good right obviously it was a good product it got people to especially professional Traders were were fans of the product maybe I just don't know the details but I didn't realize that they were contemplating actually running it from within the company like the current company as opposed to just packaging it up as a basket of Ip the software The Branding the the copyrights and just shipping it off to somebody else after getting everyone excited that feels to me like a much better plan than literally running the exchange from within the shell that they currently have and are trying to get the best recovery for Predators because obviously that would take like when would you actually liquidate the assets to give to the creditors and also like what a terrible idea like I you definitely don't want John Ray running a like a retail crypto exchange so I I can't imagine that's what they're actually contemplating but if they are that that is bananas I don't think that's a good idea there is a rumor that there is a engineering team somewhere that is actively looking into basically booting up FTX again I don't know if it's within this current entity or a new entity but as part of the the restructuring process well wait so I I want to separate out a couple things because I can't remember I think it was haseeb you were sort of like conflating the security practices with like the trading ux but I feel like those can be separated like I feel like if the trading ux is good all you need is like someone to do you know real like crypto exchange Security in the back on the back end to like make it worthwhile like like if the front end is good um because the security practice is like like that's a totally doable thing like a bunch of crypto exchanges do that and it's like kind of well known how you do it you know so like that that's such a basic core function like I don't I don't think there's no bells and whistles with that right it's just like doing what everybody already knows so when you say like oh you know I I don't know why they would do that I'm a little bit like oh but if the interface is good like that really is um you know the whole other part where I'm around the security is like such basic stuff like that's not hard um so I feel like it could be very worthwhile typically that was Tom not me Steve I just like to be in opposition with you yeah we need some controversy we'll get there don't worry Laura the UI is actually I mean people people credit and obviously there's a layout component to it but they actually just used the uh Google material UI basic components so like Google has this material UI framework that is sort of like the standard template you would use to build an Android app or like a website and they just pick up all those components and use it and it's like using bootstrap in like 2010 so there is actually not a lot of effort that went into into the UI I think it's kind of more uh the engine and the back end of the matching engine that like is kind of at the meat of an exchange oh right sorry that's that's what I meant you know me I'm I'm not like a tech person but that's what I meant the the trading engine yeah I mean look ultimately I think if if they're not running these chains themselves which for now let's give them the benefit of the doubt that they're gonna package it all up and sell it to somebody who's actually willing to run the exchange um I don't actually think it's all worth that much you know like the whole for customer deposits is in the billions and this thing is not worth one billion right it's not worth maybe even half a billion I don't know if it'd be worth 100 million maybe um something on that ballpark which is just not a big number right like they're finding like 300 million under the couch cushions in some of these you know some of these uh love sacks in the Bahamas so I I don't think that this is actually that big of a deal for creditors if they can get the exchange back up and running just because I don't think the Enterprise Value is really there in just some software that like is half working and half a a dumpster fire of like you know back doors and and accounting weasels um and then just a good UI right like the the meat of an exchange is like how do you attract retail customers you know building uh trust with your customer base like going to Market in different countries getting licenses they don't have any of that anymore so they would really be starting from zero and of course like it's funny FTX has Brand awareness but it is all negative so you know like you start over I don't know like GTX obviously uh it was originally GTX became opnx they kind of you know face planted when they came out I think they did like 12 on day one despite the fact they had a lot of attention a lot of people were paying attention to what was happening there but they didn't necessarily make them want to trade so I think the same thing May well be true of FTX a lot of people know the FTX name but that doesn't mean they're going to go deposit money start providing liquidity start buying their favorite crypto asset on that exchange you know it takes more than that it's difficult to to attract retail and to keep them keep them uh playing so one question for you like leaving aside the kind of brand value issues with FTX um what did you think of that ish the uh the idea of that same tacket floated around doing some kind of token similar to the effects because like so you because like the the idea there is then you know you make enough in trading fees over time that eventually they could be uh creditors could be made hold so if I'm understanding correctly the idea is that you basically get like a debt token and that token corresponds to your uh you know residual balance on FTX at the time of the bankruptcy but they're like not actually where worth a dollar per claim right like with the bfx with the bfx token I think it was like you could either get equity in bitfinex or you could get um like some percent like it was like um I forgot what so let's say it's uh like 70 or something initially you could either get immediate liquidity or you could do the longer term thing of either holding the token or you could trade it for equity in bitfinex and so there was like a Marketplace and people could like you know buy and sell these tokens and then over time the the value of the token eventually went up so instead of being 70 cents on the dollar it was like one dollar and so then people if they just held they could eventually be made whole this is the problem well a few things the first problem is that the vast majority of predators of FTX are not accredited so they can't actually convert into equity on the cap table um so only a small number of investors would be actually eligible to get the equity right but you know bitfinex obviously was kind of well they could get that they could get that token right so they could get the token I think in that case like the token I mean I have to understand the details but like that token sounds kind of security-like um it also I think at the point at which you're only really giving people just like here's a token and as we like what is the token convertible into if you can't convert into equity you just traded in and they're on the market on on there but you have to well it has to be convertible to something otherwise it's just like some beam token uh-oh um yeah I don't remember the deal sorry this is this is from 2015. yeah I think it's like as they recover the assets they pay back out all the token holders and they hope to eventually pay back out a dollar to all the token holders right which basically yeah yeah I think yeah it's a different thing I think you're right so yeah yeah so if it's a debt token like one you know super security and then two that basically is what is basically Robert's what Robert's describing is like they run the exchange they hope to make enough money from running exchange hiring all the engineers you're spending all the marketing money doing all the other stuff which is spending down people's recovery right A lot of people are like look I want to get off the ride I don't want you know FTX round two I just wanted to get my money back so a lot of people will say like look just give me whatever you got under the couch cushions I will take that home and like go play at another casino I don't want to play this casino anymore and I think those creditors I think they'd be pretty resoundingly against the proposition that like hey come play on FTX get a debt token and maybe we'll make it back uh or maybe we won't yeah you're probably right but of course I still see people on Twitter who are behind this idea and I've talked to a few of them there there are people out there who love this idea so uh understandably because it's worked before right like I mean the people who who did bitfinex way back in the day they were made whole and so I think crypto crypto um this is one thing that actually SPF said to me a long time ago that the weird thing about crypto relatives to any other asset class is that everybody in crypto is naturally bullish all the time there's always bullish and it's kind of weird no other asset class is like that but everybody in crypto you're only here because you're bullish nobody is just like bearish and hangs around and talks it on Discord all day about crypto so um everybody's like kind of optimistic in some sense and I think that's why they tend to skew in that direction I would say though that in the last year there are certain prominent critics that have just come to the foreign their thing is to be a Critic like Molly white Dan Olson um I had him on my show James blocked the Dirty Bubble media guy Jacob Silverman maybe a little bit I think so yeah Jacob Silverman those are the four that come to mind I don't actually know any of them I've heard I've heard one of those names but I forget which one it is probably probably Molly white she's the one she's yes yes yes web3 is going great or something like that that's right that's right that's the one and then there's always you know real rabini and these guys who like come out of the woodwork every time something breaks and they're like oh I told you guys all along um I just heard a podcast from uh Nasi Nicholas taleb where he was dunking on Duncan on bitcoin and so he's he's kind of Gone full circle so it's you know I think it's not a cycle until you get celebrities talking about how terrible crypto is anyway anyway okay um next up in news so there was a report released by treasury doing an assessment of the risks in D5 now this is normally non-news because I don't know like there's always kind of White House reports on some you know some kind of random minutia in crypto but this one was a bit surprising in one how much time and coverage they spent on D5 particularly which is obviously a very you know relatively small part of the crypto market today but also the way in which they were so much shrill in claiming that defy was delinquent in you know some of the obligations that defy has under the bank secrecy act and you know the requirements of AML and so on Robert as the resident D5 founder what was your take uh looking through the the treasury report on defy well I haven't really gone through it in full yet I've you know done a very quick skim so anything I say here is going to be you know the highest bullet points you know my take was that I think they were using D5 as an extremely broad umbrella term to really mean any decentralized or like distributed system that's not controlled by you know one you know very clear business I I really think they're using D5 not in the way most of us in the industry would use the phrase defy frankly you know I think in their minds defy primarily is tornado cash and things like tornado cash that are actually tools to very like you know simply like facilitate you know both privacy and money laundering and so you know I don't think that the language and verbiage that was used in report is the way a lot of people in our industry think about it the second thing that really you know stood out to me from the report was that they tried to take a holistic view it made very clear in one part of it that the actual problem space is smaller than the problem space of money laundering using traditional money and that was a nice Silver Lining to see that there we're actually trying to put it within scope and so you know if I had to reverse engineer the report I think they you know looked at a list of how many hacks were there where money went to North Korea and how many tornado cash you know experiences were there where money went to North Korea they said oh my god there was four billion dollars like of dirty money that went through defy this is a problem and it's a problem because you know it's greater than zero and it's a new technology and ideally you want to see zero dollars going towards you know evil you know actors in the world and so you know I think there's a lot of improvements that will occur over time both on the educational front people understanding that Defy is a extremely broad term when you're really thinking about things like major hacks and major you know tools like tornado cash is not necessarily the right lens to like talk about the entire ecosystem and so we'll see where this goes um you know it's one report and hopefully it sets off a better conversation yeah it was quite disappointing because you know one one of one of the obvious questions that they were asking was okay when when is somebody actually required to be in compliance they never really totally answered that question but they showed some of the boundaries of that question which um made you realize that they actually don't understand some very basic things about blockchains so you know one of the obvious things like if I send you money um you and I are not bound by the bank secrecy Bank secrecy Act is this law that basically says that if you're a bank or a financial institution that you're required to basically surveil your customers and make suspicious activity reports and stuff like that okay so um obviously if you are coinbase you have to do that because coinbase is a financial institution if you're a normal Bank you have to do that as well the question is does uniswap have to do that does do other things in crypto do that and obviously the crypto industry takes the view that well uniswap doesn't have an operator uniswap is non-custodial unit swap itself is completely automated so unusual is just software just software lives on the blockchain and therefore it is basically uh just code that's standing in between a peer-to-peer transaction and in a true peer-to-peer transaction you know the the um the the report stated very clearly if I just send you money neither of us are financial institutions we have no obligations to report anything to the government like okay yes duh obviously all right if I if I give you dollar bills and I see you on the street I have no obligation to report something to fincen or something like that right now where they kind of went off the rails is they said that is true unless there's a smart contract if you use a Smart contract then now this is an intermediated activity and therefore you know you're potentially under the purview of the bank secrecy Act which like maybe if you if you what a smart contract is is like an exchange like an on-chain exchange that's what a smart contract is but of course smart contracts do everything under the sun smart contract is the most generic possible description of anything so our contract could be a multi-sig it could be just like a literal erc20 transfer like that's a smart contract like everything in crypto smart content in nft is a smart contract mini wallet any wallets are smart contracts exactly exactly half the wallets and crypto or smart contracts and so if you are claiming that anything that's a smart contract is not a peer-to-peer transaction it's just like you don't understand which one contracts are so it's various point to see this coming from treasury which is supposed to be responsible for regulating all this stuff not understand a very very basic component of how this stuff needs to get regulated and you know we so a lot of our team right now is in Hong Kong there's a big crypto conference going on there right now we talked on the last show about how Hong Kong is opening up their doors and inviting a lot of people in and it's striking when you look at Regulators around the world the different level of sophistication about how crypto works and how it ought to be regulated the US is really the odd one out and really not understanding the difference between a decentralized and a centralized product or even something as basic as what is a smart contract and how does it change your obligations as an actor when it comes to something like the BSA yeah I think uh you know this order goes back to this whole idea of like regulating vasts which would be uh you know sort of the front ends or you know the unit swap.org versus unisoft protocol which is is naturally sort of the kind of the only point that would possibly make sense but I think the downside is like you know with a tornado sanction traditional processing seven million dollars a day and so you see even without you know a UI um like you can't just like sanction a contract and expect people not to use it and so it's like there isn't really like a clean answer here but I think you know obviously the the answer that's not in the realm of possibilities I think is like regulating a smart contract which is just doesn't make any sense yeah there's also the natural question of like okay let's say that fincen or treasury decides that you know let's say uniswap it needs to start filing you know suspicious activity reports or whatever it is that they're going to claim that you know swap meets to do who's supposed to do it like uniswap lives on the blockchain it is it is code that cannot be retracted or you know if unless the self-destruct op code is called there is no way to make it go away like that that code will always live there so who's supposed to do it who's the responsible party and like this is the hard question right you can you can you know thump your chest and say oh there are all these hacks North Korea uses the trader cash blah blah blah okay yes we we all understand that um like the hard problem is what do you do about it and it seems like this this question was not really seriously grappled with in this document which is why I feel um disappointed that you know after all this time and after all this stuff and you know all this stuff that I think the whole industry needs to learn from what is the right way to approach regulating the stuff because it's very clear defy needs some regulations and there needs to be some degree of consumer protection but um this does not seem like a very useful approach in thinking what the right answer is for uh a resilient industry well centralized actor that controls the more popular interfaces right like there are people who could they they could interact with the smart contract directly but then you have centralized entities that will you know kind of yeah operate these um more usable front ends user-friendly front ends and so um I feel like didn't we see a proposal at some point where it was kind of saying like um that those people who manage those front ends will be these intermediaries and will be required that was this that was the SPF proposal remember when SPF and Eric Voorhees got in a big fight that was the yesterday oh that was SPF so I mean who knows we might see that resurface like like do you remember when um we had this argument at the in-person recording in Brooklyn where I was telling you guys that like oftentimes I feel like the crypto Community they get really um kind of up in arms because they all view something as being one way but then you you all get surprised when you find out oh The Regulators don't view it that way and you're like mad and blah blah and it's like this thing with Gary genser where you know when he first uh was selected to be a sec chair people were like oh he knows blockchain great for us and you guys he is a completely different opinion on how all this stuff should be regulated from you and it's not that he does not understand the technology he has taught courses at MIT about blockchain technology he gets it he just doesn't agree with you about what it is or how it should be regulated blah blah blah and so like you know here we are like you're talking about this report and you're sort of like saying like how can they do this how can they do that and I'm just I'm just going to suggest again they might understand it and have just a completely different opinion I I mean I understand the point I think that's implausible in this case of what I'm talking about because it it's just a very basic point of like a smart contract can be anything everything the university 20 is a smart contract right so like me transferring your tokens your language isn't great but maybe someday they'll they'll make it more specific and the end outcome will be that well you know maybe we'll be like what SPF was from but these things matter my point is that these things matter like it's important to get the details right because you can't regulate an industry if you don't understand the details because all these things are about details right I know but I'm just saying like we might end up in a place where yes even when you're transacting quote-unquote peer-to-peer if you are using um a DEX that has a an interface that is managed by a centralized entity then that that entity might be the one that's implementing all these BSA controls and stuff down the line yeah I think those front ends you know these are uh virtual asset service providers in this scenario are like really the only logical choke point for enforcing these kinds of regulations by playing with the tornado example is like I don't think it's particularly effective like we can debate the merits of you know regulating the unit swap.org interface and people wanting to you know KY or having a kyc to use it but like it doesn't actually get that get you that much coverage people are still going to use these protocols even if you shut down you know the popular front end so um I I don't know I just it feels like there's some misunderstanding there to to receive's point yeah I mean look it's Laura to your point that is a that is a coherent answer answer you can give the answer that Sam gave which is that you should regulate the front ends and the front end should be responsible for blah blah blah Financial activities and then presumably like okay well how do they pay for that well the front ends have to charge an extra fee on top of the protocol and so this becomes like a whole financial services business right and that that's one plausible way that you can argue okay this is the way it should be regulated in the US well what do people can do they're gonna say well I don't want to pay that fee why am I paying for like some organization to like file suspicious activity reports I'd rather just go on you know ipfs and go use uniswap directly and so like did you actually solve the problem did you effectively regulate the industry did you actually create more better Norms did you actually protect investors or are you misunderstanding the problem and I think this stuff matters because the US is not the only country that's regular in crypto like crypto is a global phenomenon and if you regulate it badly here then what happens is that people are going to go overseas and there's I mean they're not going to stop targeting U.S customers because it's crypto right like people just can do whatever they're going to do and so a lot of countries realize pretty quickly you cannot just pretend that the rest of the world doesn't exist like if you're outside the U.S you definitely don't get to pretend that we're the only country that gets to do that and when it comes to crypto this is the one place where even the US can't pretend that we're the only country in the world and as a result I think you have to think seriously about these problems now look Laura your point to your point deciding that the front end should regulate crypto is a plausible answer I don't happen to agree with it but it is a plausible answer it's at least coherent what they stated is not even coherent you cannot create a regulatory regime around all smart contracts invalidate the peer-to-peer nature of a transaction like you start there and you just end up in you know just crazy town so which is fine like they'll eventually figure that out but okay well don't release a report that's like you know telling us about the risk of Diva if you can't get to a very basic answer like that yeah and offend what they're saying in the report I'm not trying to train is there right or anything I'm just trying to say that um like you seem so convinced that you're right um but they might have a different View and be very convinced that they're right that's all I'm trying to say like I I don't have an opinion necessarily in what they wrote um so much as just like okay what is your opinion Laura what is the way you think that uh these things ought to be regulated oh my God geez that's a tough question um like specifically this BSA type stuff yes like the Sam Eric Voorhees debate where do you fall what do you think should be done oh my God that's such a tough question let me just so I'm just gonna just talk my thoughts through um amazing let's do it so basically so I so I understand why they're concerned about the problem because my ancestry is not only Korean but actually I have ancestors from North Korea and I think it's like terrible you know that that country has been under this dictatorship for forever I think you know the Kim regime is evil blah blah all this stuff so definitely big problem right you know obviously like I think it is a little crazy to impose BSA type uh regulations for these like peer-to-peer Technologies like that that just it doesn't seem um especially you know like like Bitcoin was meant to be this electronic cash and I mean essentially that's what a lot of these assets are right so um so yeah so how do you how do you deal with that conundrum I mean so a couple of things so first you know when you when you were like oh I I think people are just gonna find their way around the fees and they're gonna you know go interact on ipfs no I don't I don't agree with that like most people like like for me when I'm trying to enter like transact with crypto it is like a confusing experience I'm just like oh my God like I'm totally gonna lose money any second and I have done that in the past um this is like a hard thing for everyday people to do and people generally are kind of lazy and like if there's a better interface like most people are not tech savvy let's put it that I mean most people are not like developers they're not you know they're they're people where they want an app that is like easy for them to you know just use and then if it's easy they're just gonna use it so I actually agree um maybe with the government or whatever that like if they go after the front ends then like that will capture most of the activity you know is that something they should do is that you know uh yeah I don't know if I really have so much of an opinion on that because I mean I might have more of an opinion if I were actually like an expert on BSA or whatever I am not you know what's gonna happen is like there's gonna be more news that breaks on this I'm gonna have to interview like however many people to understand the issues and then I might have an opinion but at this at this point in time I don't hello what's the point of having a podcast if you can't spit off uninformed opinions that's what that's what that's what the show is all about yeah this is The Chopping Block where we chop up ideas into little fractions of ideas and then we boil them until they no longer resemble okay so maybe this is the difference between a man and a woman like I would actually want to be in four oh just even if you don't know anything just take a stand and I'm like wait but I don't have enough information like I'm not an expert so Laura to be clear you are an expert okay relative to the average person or even the average listener of the show wait on the bank secrecy act relative to the person who's listening to the show you know way more about the bank secrecy act than somebody who's listening to a crypto podcast I know because you know who listens to this show it's a lot of like Regulators tech people Finance people like they they well okay maybe not the tech people but the finance people and the regular they know that stuff way way better than I do so so many people do but most people don't know almost anything we need to get a guest on the show who is an expert in this stuff a whole episode of The Big secrecy act starring regulators very exciting yeah all right I know exactly that's the point at which we want to exit the show we'll just like dive down the viewership until Laura fires us um okay so all right all right so let me let me shift gears a little bit um so we we decided that we wanted to have a discussion today a little bit left field we don't normally do this we usually just like chat about the news but um there was something that came up the other day I have a bunch of people who claimed that dragonfly was selling a bunch of Lido tokens and then I piped up on Twitter and I was like that's not us you know that's a different fund um and there was this big debate that was kind of going on around this about whether VCS are good or bad for crypto and I thought this might be an interesting venue for us to have this conversation even though we are VC so obviously we're going to have a view but I want to kind of I think it's an interesting conversation and it's one that we don't really entertain on crypto podcasts very often unless it's like people who don't really know almost anything about venture or Venture Capital um it's like you know kind of people who just sort of see the see this stuff from afar read news articles they're like oh VCS are bad they all dump tokens whatever I think this is an interesting place for us to really try to be intellectually fair and explore the pros and cons of what good and what bad VCS do and I think there's also a distinction to be made between good VCS and bad VCS because I think there are there's there's a distribution of behavior among VCS as well so I want to start that conversation with Laura because you are not a VC and you're probably the most independent perspective on uh on this question what do you think on the pros and cons of VCS and crypto do you think they're good for crypto if they're bad for crypto you think'd be better if there were no VCS what's your take um I'm completely not prepared to give an opinion on this opinion on this so again I'm just gonna have to walk through my thoughts here just be right back just start just start spouting off all right all right so a couple of things so I think it probably depends on the VC like there are certain people who you know I know dig really deep into the technology they're actually trying to build something they've thought a lot about you know um what are the best like tokenomics like how do you involve the community um what's the best kinds of Technology like what are um the kinds of situations that will only draw speculators and result in more like you know a bubble type situation um and then there are others that you know they are more of the style to um not respect lock-ups and to try to dump pretty soon and just take their get their liquidity ASAP and not support the project long term I think some of the activities of FTX maybe would have fallen in that category um so you know there's a range and um this is why like if I'm gonna interview VCS then I will you know try to figure out like okay so who are the ones that are more thoughtful about this or that or like who are the ones that you know like yeah just are more respected or um or yeah have really contributed in some way but one thing I will say is like there definitely is a tension um when you're trying to build this kind of technology to having VCS involved in such a way where yeah they're gonna get like really wealthy in all their um wealthy investors will get even more wealthy and so that's sort of antithetical to what crypto is supposed to be about and so in that regard um I think that's why we continually see um this basically literally the same exact argument over and over again with different terms it's like you know the fair launch tokens for this versus the VC coins and then I forget what the next iteration was but it had a different terminology and like just it keeps coming up and so I feel like probably what's going to happen is there's just going to be this sort of continual Push Pull um but I do think that you know even now like when I talk to different token projects like they they recognize that if they get certain VCS on their cap table that that is in uh is a marker of um like quality and so they're kind of seeking that out you know like yeah just you like you'll see um even certain ones that but you know they'll seek out certain investors for strategic reasons and so in that regard like you know I know for me as a reporter like back when I used to do the Forbes fintech 50 list and stuff like that you know when I looked at different startups and I so I understand startups are different from protocols or decentralized projects but they're similar in the sense that you can look at the VC list and then sort of make judgments based on that and so you know in that regard like I I feel like maybe it can help people make decisions when it comes to investing in projects you know obviously Sequoia and FTX that is like the one big sort of uh exception that maybe proves the rule I don't know but it definitely um you know that's a big issue and then the fact that like a lot of people I think thought that having FTX Ventures as an investor was for them like a boon um and yeah now like a bunch of people have been screwed so basically yeah I don't know if I have just one opinion on it I think there's like pros and cons so it's interesting the way you lay that out because I think you're very right in pointing out there are multiple roles that VCS play um one of the I mean one obvious thing is they give you money if they give money to startups right and that's kind of the obvious thing but they do a bunch of other stuff right they help you you know they might actually provide some value directly but another thing they do which you pointed out is like they are markers of status legitimacy competence technological um prowess whatever it's kind of like what college you go to right it's like okay are you learning anything at Harvard maybe maybe not maybe you're just meeting people but you're definitely getting a stamp on your forehead that other people are going to use to make inferences about you are you trying to say dragonfly is Harvard I I did not I did not name any particular funds and so it's very clear the world uses VCS that way and VCS want to be perceived that way like everyone wants to be I'm the Harvard I'm the Yale I'm the this I'm the that um but you know if I take the other side of that right so these are the functions that I think VCS basically serve is that they give you money they help you and they stamp your forehead now the the other side I want to kind of Steel Man the anti-vc position because I think for some if imagine somebody who's here who is very anti-vc um I think what they would say is that look um under I understand why startups might want money and why they might want money from firms that do this professionally and maybe you're better at giving people money than other people um but the whole point of crypto is that we want this stuff to be widely owned and widely shared and we don't want any groups that have preferential Insight access um or perspective on these Technologies than anybody else they're supposed to be democratizing and venture capital is intrinsically opposed to that part of crypto and so even if you created a great decentralized blockchain that could run super fast it was 10 times you know it could could run twice as far and jump twice as high as Solana even if you built that if it was 100 owned by VCS it'd be worthless because that's not what makes blockchains valuable makes blockchains valuable is Broad ownership that I think would be the Principal argument even if you ignore the like good VCS or bad VCS these guys don't these guys don't ignore all of that I think somebody who's a sort of VC minimalist would say VCS in general are antithetical to the the principles behind crypto what would your guy's response be to that argument well I'd like to go all the way back to bitcoin I think this is a lot of the argument against VCS in crypto is that Bitcoin didn't have any VCS period Full Stop Now is it the same for other chains or other l1s or other like things trying to be currencies there's a whole spectrum of activity but Bitcoin didn't have any VCS so to a lot of like OG crypto thinkers they say well no one needs VCS because the biggest baddest thing on the face of the Earth didn't have Venture investors and it didn't require Capital to build out a team to bring it to life I mean great job Bitcoin like Kudos right it's fantastic you know but Bitcoin really started off almost as a one or two person Endeavor um and it grew over time and it built up you know Community but like most of the point of going live it was kind of like a solo-ish effort um which is one of the most remarkable and incredible things about it and so I think a lot of people say well if Bitcoin can do it you can do it like you don't need more than like one developer right like if Bitcoin is capable of becoming a you know half a trillion dollar asset anything is and I don't think that's necessarily true right when you look at pretty much any project in human history It generally requires a lot of people and teamwork and collaboration and in general that requires Capital there's very few people that will work towards a goal for free it's exceedingly rare it's possible if you're Satoshi you know it made a lot of sense to not take a paycheck for you know the two years that went into building Bitcoin that's really not how most things come to life and so you know I just see in the context of almost everything requires this like underwriting or you know support of capital early on and Bitcoin is the Once in a Lifetime probably fluke that is the exception to the role and I don't think anything will succeed to that degree of success with that absence of Venture I think it's probably the most successful bootstrapped system in the history of the world I can't think of anything of that market cap and magnitude that wasn't financed along the way I don't think there's any comparable company or economic system on the face of the planet in all of human history and so you know I just think it's the ultimate outlier that you know steel man's oh this is why you don't need VC I I was gonna say the exact same thing and I feel like this is the exact argument that people like Jack Dorsey and Corey clipston like this is their argument and like that Meme of um you know the faucet and then like the kind of fat cat person who's like getting most of the water and then like the little peon is like just getting the little drips like I feel like that's kind of you know where all that it's those people that have this view um but one other thing that I was gonna add and I was one of the fat cats of Bitcoin they just had you know drinking from the faucet just from a different approach it's just Less Direct yeah yeah but you know like I I feel like they're like Jack Dorsey and Corey Clifton definitely were not in on the ground floor of Bitcoin you know yeah so um but I was curious what you guys thought about ethereum do you guys feel like ethereum because they didn't have like traditional VCS it was like Anthony diorio and Joe Lubin and then like random people who were involved early in Bitcoin that were sort of funding it along the way but they didn't you know there was no like Andreessen or anybody involved in that and I was curious for your thoughts on whether that counted as well but there were no famous VCS but there were definitely VCS that Finance ethereum early on there were some very famous folks in China who backed vitalik back when nobody else was willing to finance him sort of pre-ico so it took a lot of work to get ethereum to the place where they could actually do the Ico when I worshiped my book nobody like are you talking about finbushi because they they stepped in after ethereum had launched in uh right yeah they stepped in after the network had launched and they actually got um so basically what happened is like the the foundation was completely like but they were so low on one way that they were writing blog posts about how they might have to shut down within a few months and um right out and and like there was also this debate about whether or not they should release the eth to early contributors because some people were arguing if you do that then the price is going to go down but vitalik was like we gave them our word that we would do this so he did it and then yes the price like went way way way down and then they were they kept writing these blog posts being like yeah we might have to shut down by like Christmas in uh September um they did a deal with finbushi and um and we get the terms of the deal but basically I think they sold the East for like roughly a dollar-ish or something or so I don't remember all I know is that like fenbushi very quickly made their money like they recouped their investment within like like a month or two but that gave the ethereum foundation enough Runway to like at least get through that winter and then what ended up happening was that um because of excitement about the Dow the price of ether started to finally pick up a little bit and um and then yeah then they had like two years of fun way then it was like three and then but it was happening really fast and then and then with the Dow like the price of ether was going way up and so so then they were like in the clear so that's that's my point though is that yeah but finbushi didn't do that is the invested post the platform but ultimately these guys needed financing because yeah they got the thing out but like the liquidity wasn't there the buying demand wasn't there they had more work to do there was still more stuff to do to make ethereum what we think of today as ethereum it was also a teal fellow so inadvertently you know sort of funded through through VCS um in in a way yeah it was like a hundred thousand dollars he was getting like four thousand dollars a month yeah yeah um but as you know hey it counts I think um I mean to your point Laura though like I do think there's a lot of I think memes about VCS hey people misunderstanding the difference between a a venture capitalist and a venture fund and like a hedge fund and people getting you know incensed about block-ups and stuff like that but yeah I mean the other thing that people get pissed about is like oh why did this VC get to buy at this price I should be able to buy at this price hey you know there's it's part of it is often an access story it's like there's a lot of adverse selection in projects that do a crowd sale even not in crypto it's because they could not uh uh uh you know uh find VCS to back them and obviously oftentimes like the allocation in those rounds is extremely tight anyway so you have to show that you can add value and there's justification adding value in order to actually get the allocation but the other thing as we've sort of been talking about it's like a regulatory issue right like if you're taking in crowdfunds for something that is arguably a security like you can't really do that anymore and so it's not quite as clean cut as I think people want to make it out to be um although it would be nice to sort of have some blacks or crowdfunding rules yeah that's a very good point like in the Ico days um it was the case that retail and VCS got to participate at the same time and now it's it's largely a legal question of whether or not you're allowed to do that because definitely when something is not even launched and you're selling a token it's definitely definitely a security so you know you can you can have a plausible argument that it's not a security once it's actually a working product but before it's a working product it's definitely a security and so doing a crowd sale of that now we have enough legal precedent to say yep that's security you're not allowed to do that and so that's part of the reason why you know Tom as you said you know VCS get to invest because of you know credit investor laws is that only credit investors get to invest but I think it is um it's it's more than just that like people clearly I think Tom you you you you you hit the nail in the head is that this is one of the things that pisses people off the most is that why do VCS get a better price than me even when it comes to you know buying something that is is even on the open market like you know a big VC fund goes and negotiates like a big block sale at a discount with a lock up and it's like why don't why don't I get to do that too I'll also hold your token for three years or whatever why don't I get a three year discount what do you think is the answer to that or is there a compelling answer to that like why why is it that people do this and they don't just allow retail to buy you know even even like you know a dow that's selling tokens to a VC why wouldn't they allow retail to participate in the same deal yeah I don't know I mean I obviously I'm also ABC at dragonfly so I feel like I have you know one figure answer which is like yeah it's it's an it's a Nexus question like teams can pick and choose their investors depending on sort of market conditions and so they there's more demand than there is Supply and so they can find VCS who are going to do all the things you said add value signal um you know have this sort of long walk up Etc and so it's like you know most retail investors are not going to be able to do those things they don't have a network they don't have experience they can't actually help the team do things that they're trying to do which is why you do this which is again going back to my point around like like the stuff that UTC that does do crowd sales um or does your crowdfunding it's like you know oftentimes those are like you having access as like a random person off the street is often a bad sign because it means all the people who do this professionally and under itself professionally are passing on this I guess part of it too is that if you I think it's it's um when a VC commits that I'm going to hold your token for X many years it's very easy to enforce that because it's one person and they're big and they have like a reputation to protect uh and so and it's and you know all the tokens are in one place so you can monitor them uh whereas if you say okay we're going to get 5 000 people to like buy this token and all these five thousand people you better do this and you better not do that and blah blah blah like those five thousand people some of them might follow their word a lot of them probably wouldn't a lot of them will like find some way to unless it's actually forced on chain a lot of them are going to weasel out of it um and the reality is that if you're a random person you don't have that much reputation to protect and it's very difficult for a project to go after some individual you know random address that dumps their token um and so it's the same reason why I guess in IPOs you know people will go and sell to institutional investors at different prices than what the IPO ends up clearing at because they would rather have a t row price that is you know a a one entity that they know is a long-term holder that is much easier to manage on their cap table than you know 10 000 random investors who are maybe going to sue them if the price goes down and they did something they didn't like and they're gonna you know uh you know file a lawsuit for some Securities violation because you know you didn't do enough Environmental Protection or something you know ultimately if somebody doesn't hold your token they can't get mad at you and I think that's that's definitely another part of it especially as in the bear Market people have become a lot more litigious in the crypto world and I can I can tell that that definitely has a bearing because VCS don't Sue uh token assures but ordinary investors definitely do yeah I mean in a way like what you're saying is um like like I feel like I'm hearing two things like when Tom was saying that if an everyday person is buying like that's a bad sign that you know this is what was happening in 2017 and into 2018 um and yeah I guess like most of those Ico projects are not uh very successful um but like at that time the thought was like oh this is the democratization of finance and this is you know the first time in history that everyday people have been able to get in on the ground floor at this in this way blah blah blah so now you're saying like that's a bad idea I mean to be clear we we did that we democratized Finance now you can buy any token basically with very low fees just using a mobile phone using unit swap using whatever that's the democratization of Finance democracy is a fundraising is very different when you democratize fundraising what you get is you get adverse election like Tom is saying is you get the best opportunities are taken up by the best investors and the worst opportunities are given to everyone it's like look if you if you leave food out in the street it's probably not very good food right the best food is gonna be served in like a five-star restaurant to somebody who's gonna pay a lot of money for it all right restaurants are on Stars actually yeah I I would I'm still in favor of obviously having you know what we have now versus sort of the very Arcane uh accredited investor laws that that you know um we we usually have to comply with but yeah I mean it just it's just a matter of uh sort of sort of the downsides that come with having an open system yeah well Hester purse is in favor of changing the accredited investors law investor laws so it's more around like knowledge rather than um just straight up income or not net worth which could be a good idea no probably Gensler is not for that well for now we're up on time so we gotta we gotta go ahead and wrap the show Laura do you want to give us um the last word on our VCS good or bad for crypto party go with a diplomatic answer and just say it depends it depends okay it depends on the VC all right well that's it for this week appreciate you all listening we'll be back next week by everyone [Music]
