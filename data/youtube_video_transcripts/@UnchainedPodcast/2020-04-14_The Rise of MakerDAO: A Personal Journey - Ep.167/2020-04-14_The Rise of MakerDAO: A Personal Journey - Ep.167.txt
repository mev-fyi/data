hi everyone this week which is my last week in the series of essays that I'm running I have an essay for you by Mariana Conte of maker down this is definitely the most personal of this series and this essay you really shows how cryptocurrency has changed lives which is something that I think a lot of people in the industry are striving for but obviously that hasn't happened yet on a large scale Mariano also covers the events of Black Thursday and maker Dow and I know that this is an event a lot of people are still analyzing it's a fantastic essay and I look forward to hearing your feedback and now here's Mario de Conti reading from his essay the rise of maker Dow a personal journey in response to the challenging times crypto comm is waiving the 3.5% credit card fee for all crypto purchases for the next three months download the crypto command today Kraken is the best exchange in the world for buying and selling digital assets it has the tightest security deep liquidity and a great V structure with no minimum or hidden fees whether you're looking for a simple Fiat on-ramp or futures trading Kraken is the place for you the rise of maker Dow a personal journey by Mariano Conti my grandparents died without access to their life savings you see in 2001 Argentina had one of its worst economic crises to date the Argentine peso for years artificially pegged one to one to the US dollar could not hold on to its back anymore exports stopped being competitive there was no independent monetary policy people were exchanging pesos for dollars withdrawing them from banks and offering transferring them abroad or holding them in cash under the mattress there was fear of a bank run so on December 1st 2001 the Argentine government decided that people's money wasn't theirs to enjoy and instituted the Carlito a freeze on everyone's bank accounts allowing for only a small amount to be taken out per week no withdrawals from US dollar denominated accounts were permitted unless you agree to turn those dollars into pesos credit and debit card still worked but this lack of cash caused many problems in the economy from December 21st 2001 to January 1st 2002 the country had five presidents in 11 days the situation was getting worse the bank freeze was still ongoing but now most deposits were exchanged for peso denominated bonds to make matters worse all dollar denominated accounts were also turned into pesos or pacified and then they devalued the peso first going from 1 to around 1.4 pesos per dollar and then as they let it float it reached around 4 pesos per dollar in a matter of months this was around December 2002 only a year later you can see where I'm going with this not your keys not your coins money in the bank or in the government's hand is not your money I just wish I could have told my grandparents dis mantra this was not the first time something like this has happened of course for years Argentina has seen many devaluations periods of hyperinflation bank runs capital controls acid freezing among other things it is one of the reasons people buy dollars and keep them under the mattress why grandparents give their grandchildren $10 bills on their birthdays and why Argentina's general population does not trust the government or the banks it is also why I believe Argentinians are sometimes more willing to take risks in other areas and at times seem more fine and savvy than in other places in the world here most people actively work to not lose let alone make a profit if you forget the hundred peso bill in your jacket pocket and find it a year later congratulations you just found a 50 peso bill it's the reason why we've research every alternative available always searching for access to dollars so many times they lie to us and in cryptocurrencies it seems like we found our answer my journey my journey with cryptocurrency started in 2014 out of necessity to control my own money well let me take yet another step back after a long period of living in Mexico City I moved there in 86 at age 6 I decided in late 2010 to move back to when Osiris the city where I was born I've never felt fully Mexican or fully Argentinian like I never belonged to either and as I turned 30 I thought this was my opportunity to reconnect with my roots so in April of 2011 having broken up with my girlfriend sold or gifted most of my possessions I traveled to Ueno ciders with two suitcases one filled with clothes the other with a computer and I could not have picked a worse time to relocate say what you want about Mexico but its closeness to the United States means it is a very stable economy for the most part most of what I mentioned about Argentina I had lived only through tales anecdotes from relatives or the news just six months after having moved back to my home country the government instituted new capital controls regular people were mostly banned from purchasing dollars in banks and exchanges Paradis would an economy that regularly sees double-digit yearly inflation and the Argentine appetite for dollars it was a recipe for disaster and black markets dollars were bought and sold at a 50 percent premium of the official rate this has gone on for years so in 2014 when I found myself working at a small digital agency in Buenos Aires I negotiated a regular salary in pesos and another under-the-table salary in dollars this was standard practice for IT and tech professionals the problem was getting paid those dollars my employer could not deposit dollars into my dollar denominated bank account in Argentina they would be converted to pesos instantly at a rate 50% or than what I could sell them for in the black market we call it the blue market or the blue dollar don't ask me why at the time the official government quote was around eight pesos to the dollar in the blue market a dollar could get me almost 14 pesos a deposit to my local bank account was no good flying to Miami and opening an account there was not an option PayPal had long been banned my employer owed me more than six months of salary until one day he mentioned Bitcoin the Bitcoin era now bitcoin was already a thing in argentina it just wasn't my thing for a long time Argentine freelancers had used Bitcoin as a means of getting paid by US and European companies often negotiating salaries that were denominated in dollars and with the freedom of getting paid in something that the government couldn't get their hands on I just hadn't seen his true potential to like personally had to find a way to keep my money into something stronger than the peso so I did a bit of research discovered that it was totally my thing and proceeded to collect six months of salary in the time it took to send some Bitcoin from one account to another it felt like magic I would later find out that I became part of a larger group so many engineers in Argentina had gotten a head start using Bitcoin many because they saw the potential but also many just out of necessity is this another avenue that leads to dollars and keeps inflation at bay if so then we will welcome it it was a way to beat the system a way to retain ownership of one's work a sidestepping of regular banking it was not without problems someone getting paid in Bitcoin had to be sure that clear terms were drawn out do you get paid at the beginning of the month or when a project is done what is going to be the exchange rate is it when payment is due or when payment is finally done depending on the answers to these questions you could either make a money or lose a lot of money oftentimes dis transactions did not end well because of volatility I love the freedom that beacon provided but there had to be more right enter aetherium I discovered the theorem in late 2015 a few months after Maynard release and instantly fell in love here was a blockchain and cryptocurrency that had all the benefits of Bitcoin but it was programmable to my engineer brain there was nothing better the possibilities were endless it was like finding a new world all over again I put most of my life savings into etherium knowing that this was where I needed to be where my focus should be there wasn't much there yet but the thought of what could be was alluring and then the dialog happened it didn't shatter my helps in etherium but it did remind me of the risks involved with any new technology I set myself I would be fine either way hard work or no hard work I decided such risks were very much acceptable the alternative being using the traditional origin time banking system but there was still something missing from ethereal stability maker dow I joined maker in 2016 out of a series of coincidences the digital agency where I was still employed contracted for maker and I joined as a junior dev at age 35 slowly I began to learn about the premise of maker of decentralize exchanges of open finance I designed the first version of the maker Oracle's still used to this day my main motivation was a promise of a stable coin an unbiased world currency a medium of exchange packed to the US dollar which is a known and universal unit of accounting but with all the benefits of a cryptocurrency I was in this was my new mission I had not been part of the initial team that brought the white paper or worked on the first prototypes but I still consider myself a maker OG during those days we were still on the design and early experimentation stage there was no open sibling no truffle or if there were they were still also under very beginnings everything we did was new if we needed the tools to solve a problem we would build a tool joining maker also meant that I stopped getting paid in Bitcoin and I started getting paid in ether this turned out to be a good thing for me as the price of ether and really almost every cryptocurrency was going up and up but trading some of that ether into pesos to pay rent and groceries but not so easy Bitcoin was still the most traded Krypton in the market so I had to do a jump from ether to Bitcoin before I could enter the fiat world still it was worth it entered June 2017 after years of work maker released a private version of single collateral die which we now call sigh the sole purpose of this first version was to be deployed to mainland where the foundation would open a CDP with ether as collateral and create enough side to pay for the salaries of a few volunteers inside maker that wanted to dogfood what we were building after creating Desai and sending it to employees the system would be immediately shut down and those of us with SCI would be able to claim a portion of the ether collateral it worked perfectly and it showed us that the system was getting ready for primetime a few weeks after and with some bugs fixed a second version was deployed to maintenance this is the version we now refer to as paratus I only the maker Foundation and a few partners were invited to test it there was not much of an economy around it but still this was the first asset back stable coin on the ethereum blockchain soft pegged one to one to the US dollar backed by ether and again in the ultimate show of darkbootie many employees and contractors myself included of course decided our paycheck would be 100% sigh it was a historic moment seeing that number and an ethereal transaction knowing that as long as the system worked it will remain stable was eye-opening I got flashbacks to the Dow then those flashbacks turned into memories of tales of the Argentine banking system and I felt safer if I'm going to trust someone with my money let it be the Nerds and the innovators not the politicians the banks or the government there wasn't much I could do with my newly minted sigh this was still a private beta and there was no dye savings rate or yearly swap or compound other than sending it to a couple of people for novelty the idea was that it would be converted once more into ether this happened a few times during development but it gave us a glimpse of what was possible of the future and so we arrived in December 2017 the month when single collateral die launched this was the proper release the one the ecosystem was waiting for for so long and it did not disappoint it's a wonder seeing a whole financial system grow before your very eyes stemming from the simple promise of a stable asset we saw the birth of decentralized finance or open finance whatever you want to call it to put things into perspective projects like uni swap or compound finest so uber Curie's now would not launch until almost a year later I like to think and I hope you agree with me that having single collateral die around kick-started so many of the projects that we see today because of the promise of a stable medium of exchange companies like instead app started off as 48-hour hackathon projects keeping us different and sometimes better tools to interact with the maker protocol and they didn't need to ask permission there's number nobody from whom to ask permission in the to realize permissionless protocol but who makes the decisions who says how much sigh one can borrow for an amount of ether who determines how much stability fee one has to pay for the generated sigh well that's the role of maker governance and it's what makes maker Dao a decentralized autonomous organization today's episode

were not many levers he could use it mostly consisted of two things size training Ababa dollar lower the stability fee size training below $1 raised the stability fee and they were simpler times still the maker community gathered every week as it had done since 2015 to discuss how the system was operating and what to do about it fun fact governance calls used to be held on Sundays and in my case at lunch time I cooked many asados with headphones on listening in on calls much to the chagrin of my family but of course as per the white paper single collateral die was not the end goal being backed only by ether SCI is still very vulnerable to Black Swan events say the price of ether drops drastically in a manner of minutes or hours it would be very hard for the system to recover from such an event and even those I went through the greatest bear market crypto has ever seen it maintained its peg and remained a stable coin ethers price went from 800 around the times I was released up to 1400 and down to 80 it did so over the course of several months though and yet psy kept up its promise of once I equals $1 and to an Argentine this meant yet another way of getting access to dollars when I said that it used to take me some hoops to go from ether to be going to pesos after a few months of psy being on the market those hoops were gone traders and over-the-counter trading desks started accepting psy as much as they were accepting Bitcoin and ether exchanges made it easy to buy and sell psy and how bezels deposited directly into your bank account debit cards loaded with psy became the norm and gone were the days of discussing whether your invoice denominated in Bitcoin would be honored at the price when it was issued or when it was paid it just worked stability brings prosperity we all know that and in an economy so unstable like mine you pair stability with decentralization and transparency and you get an installable economy here permit me to jump ahead almost two years to November of 2019 and the release of multi collateral die multi collateral die or MCD represents the culmination of years of work by hundreds of people it takes lessons learned from two years of running single collateral die iterating and fixing bugs and assumptions here make your governance has a much tougher job to do it has to manage not one but two different assets used as collateral for generating die ether and basic attention token or bad-size also collateral but it's a special case since it is only used for migrating from the old single collateral system into the new one and in recent weeks u.s. DC has been added as this third collateral governance has to discuss weakly the state of the peg their relation between price and stability fees and also one of McD's greatest achievements the dye savings rate and as time passes the community has not only grown but it has become better at organizing itself raising its voice proposing changes to the system and overall reacting quickly to market conditions the markets collapse as I was writing this essay at the beginning of March 2020 there was a perfect storm brewing an oil price war a virus generating uncertainty in the markets late February brought unease to everyone eventually we saw an outright collapse of both traditional and crypto markets on March 12 2020 around 50% of ethers value and most cryptocurrencies in general was erased very quickly and multi collateral die being back mostly by ether was impacted as well the theorem blockchain became congested with gas prices going up well into the three hundreds of gray per unit of gas something practically unheard of not only were transactions insanely costly there were so many of them going on at once that most remained in the mental waiting for the chance to be mined every actor in the ecosystem was affected bid liquidity pools maker vault owners die holders or keepers keepers are usually automated vaults that scan the etherium blockchain looking for arbitrage opportunities in the case of the maker protocol keepers participate in collateral auctions that happen when positions become under collateralized and the system auctions off this collateral to recover the AI and remain solvent Oracle's as well were affected with the increasing gas bidding war and so many transactions in the queue the Oracles which are charged with updating the system with real world prices were slow to update in retrospect disallowed some vault owners to add more collateral to their vaults or pay off some died because they had some extra time to do so before the Oracle would update with a lower price triggering their liquidation but even then there just wasn't enough room in the theorem blocks to fit everyone's transactions as a result of all the above a large number of collateral auctions were triggered and a subset of these auctions were won by bidders whose minute bids just above zero this was truly the perfect storm vault owners struggling with high gas prices and network delays trying to add dye to their vaults exchanges were hit as well home base effectively froze withdrawals for a while because of how much gas it was costing them and with increasing demand for dye and the liquidity crunch the price of the I started going up reaching almost one point fourteen died per dollar on March 12th keepers struggle to while the maker foundation runs a keeper to participate in collateral auctions he too felt a stress of high gas prices and delay transactions and the lack of liquidity with so many options happening at once there was not enough time to recycle collateral backing to die to participate in further auctions out of foreign-owned keeper bots that participated in these auctions too started submitting zero bids in fact bidders submitting bids decimal points above zero and ended up winning more than four million dollars worth of ether for basically free after a while keepers managed to regain liquidity and started bidding again restoring competitive auction space in the end around twelve hundred vaults were liquidated resulting in 4447 options because of the collateral auction shortfall the maker system would need to recover approximately 5.4 million died here is where a decentralized and transparent maker governance and community becomes so important and it's also here where it shined the most in maker forums and chat the community started discussing the events and planning how to best react to them there was a vote to change some risk parameters in the system giving keepers more time to bid on auctions also important was to bring the pack back down to one dollar stability fees were lowered and the dye savings rate was brought down to zero for the first time since it was created also a new collateral uncorrelated with the crypto market was added USD see the feedback stable coin this would provide diversification and be an additional source of liquidity should it be needed this was not without controversy and I encourage anyone to watch or read the transcripts of the governance calls from March 12 through March 20 to understand what the community made this decision the system also needed to recover 5.4 million died the maker protocol is designed in such a way that nkr holders covered this shortfall by way of mkr dilution if a vault is liquidated and the collateral auction does not raise enough tide to replace the vaults outstanding died after a waiting period at that auction is created that seeks to raise this die by minting of mkr and thus tailoring mplayer value it is a risk that I'm care holders know about and urges them to us act responsively be informed participate and vote as I write this the maker protocol created and successfully completed a hundred and six debt auctions each one raised $50,000 decreasing amounts of MK are the total MK are minted was twenty thousand nine hundred and eighty the maker community is discussing the circumstances around the zero bits and liquidations and it is they who will ultimately determine how to address this issue I encourage you to go to the maker forums and participate in this discussion there is much to be learned from this experience and expect everyone to come out stronger in the end there is increased participation in government calls and voting new tools are being built to deal with auctions both by the maker Foundation and the graded defy community MKR holders understand now that it is a great responsibility to hold MKR because their swift action or inaction can have good or bad consequences as for me I fully believe in the system the foundation and the community my paycheck remains a hundred percent die and I will continue to work on making the maker protocol more resilient for as long as I can today did you notice something at some point you're in my tail I stop discussing Argentina's economy and its inflation this is because dai has given me the privilege an opportunity of earning a stable asset that doesn't require so much effort than planning it doesn't make me think how much am I going to lose this month or do I put my money in savings or try to buy something tangible like a motorcycle that more or less follows inflation I just work and every month I earn a salary in a strong currency it's a simple and beautiful as that what so many countries take for granted we cherish Linda she mentions in her own essay released an Unchained how memes can help cryptical mainstream that she asked for perspectives of different kinds of crypto users and she says and I quote I received by far the most responses from Argentinians I am NOT surprised by this the journey to control one's money in this difficult economy has led many regular Argentinians to discover cryptocurrencies but in a different way than I or a technical person would have done back in 2012 13 or 14 with the rise of stable coins the idea of money that cannot be censored or seized yet remains predictable and its value has current people of all aspects of life interested and it is here where I make the distinction that gives us South Americans and edge an insanely high tolerance for risk when you believe and know in your heart that nothing is riskier than your government or Bank any alternative becomes much more enticing I've seen a new economy form before my very eyes on the Internet in telegram and whatsapp groups via weekly meetups that I never saw possible with volatile Kryptos if you want to see the real power the cryptocurrencies have on regular people I urge you to look south you will find a large number of savvy users who've been finding ways of protecting their money for years and always looking for the next big thing I believe decentralized stable coins like Dai are the next big thing they've been waiting for this aren't people looking to go long or march in trade or leverage their Argentines Colombians Venezuelans and others that want to save and transact they want to stop fighting to just break even always lagging with inflation and take back control of their money they want to look at a banking system that has here after year decade after decade ruthlessly taken from them and say basta enough oh well oh I wish you could have seen this this is Mariano Conte head of smart contracts for the maker foundation I want to thank Ron Christians and for giving me the
