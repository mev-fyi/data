and discuss crypto strategy get started with eToro and the world's number one social trading platform today's guest is Nick tomato general partner of one confirmation welcome Nick how's it going you just raised a 45 million dollar fund your second with your first fund raising 26 million and launching all the way back in August 2017 which was the year of crypto mania what was it like trying to raise in this market versus in 2017 yeah it was much more difficult I'd say you know in 2017 I think most investors had FOMO they had seen a massive rise in prices and you know if you could get in front of family offices or individuals mostly not institutions in 2017 but there's a lot of demand for people that just wanted exposure to crypto because of FOMO so I would say it was really easy in 2017 to raise and it was much more difficult this time around although I did have a strong support from my existing LP base which I really benefited from so I think if I had to raise from a completely new base of investors it would have been you know even more difficult but you know I I did have a really strong group of initial investors that kind of saw what I've done over the past two years and I basically kind of executed how I said I was going to execute and I think they're generally happy with you know my communication and and you know the signs in the portfolio so far so I got a lot of support there but yeah definitely different environment and we're the types of lp's different like in terms of kind of the interest of the type of investor yes well yeah much more I would say fun to is larger l LP types of LPS right so for my first fund I had a much lower minimum and a higher number and you know more individuals and things like that fun to is you know a few fund of funds and some family offices so yeah definitely more institutional although not you know the big institutions not many of the big institutions I think it my general take from this fundraise was that it's still very early for for most big institutions so and so what have you been investing in so far and what will you focus on in this fund so fun one you know our general thesis as a fund is invest in products that the crypto community wants and needs and so I'm you know a crypto native user you know I got involved in the space I was one of the first 100 or so users of coinbase and then started working at coin base so I'm just kind of always you know trying new crypto products and think I have you know a good feel for the crypto kind of community and so that's really what I focus on you know there's a lot of VCs out there that want to see block chains applied to supply chains or to bank to bank transfers or things kind of outside of crypto and that stuff may work but I don't have a really good feel for that stuff it's kind of out of my comfort zone and expertise and I think what I have a good feel for is kind of this crypto native stuff so that's very much what you know that what we like to invest in these products that are solving problems for the crypto community and I think within the crypto community there's two types of users there's the you know the crypto a believer you know in the end there's a developer and so if you look at our existing portfolio pretty much everything that we've invested in is solving a problem for you know those two types of of end-users so I totally understand like why that's your focus and you know how that also plays your strengths but one thing I would say is that I feel like what we're seeing at least this year is that the companies and organizations that are interested in crypto have branched out quite a bit since 2017 here we've got like Facebook China launches on stable coin and this week backed which has the backing of the IntercontinentalExchange Starbucks Microsoft's venture arm etc they launched their futures product and we even had the Bank of England governor proposing a global digital currency so what do you make of those developments and I mean it sounds like it hasn't really affected your investment these days but I'm curious to know what impact you think those things will have on the crypto space yeah well I love to see that stuff to be clear I think that's all very positive for you know for the kripak currency ecosystem and kind of you know gaining more understanding and acceptance from the mainstream but I would say I'm a pretty skeptical of kind of large institutions launching cryptocurrency initiatives that that really impact the space in a meaningful way in the long term and there's a few reasons for that but but generally speaking I think you know the public first and foremost and the media also kind of overestimates the importance of institutional you know projects and kind of underestimates the importance of you know small teams that are working on on completely new ideas so yeah we can get into any of those projects in particular but generally speaking I think you know my belief is that this you know a cryptocurrency movement is very much a grassroots kind of Bottoms Up movement that's at the end of the day very disruptive to large institutions and that's why I think innovators dilemma and and lack of focus or kind of two major hurdles that you know that any institutional project whether it's Facebook or you know backdoor things like that are going to be up against well so yeah why don't you dive into a little bit like maybe let's talk about libre since I feel like that's kind of the one that has the most mindshare out in like the mainstream world and what's your take on kind of how that will play out and what impact it will have on crypto I don't have a strong feeling on how it will play out I guess other than you know I'm skeptical that it's going to be very meaningful in the long run I guess look I understand why they're you know people are excited about it I mean Facebook has several billion users and the idea of putting crypto in the hands of you know billions of Facebook users is very exciting you know we could get into the you know the tactics of kind of why I think there's there's a lot of hurdles to what they're doing but at the end of the day you know how I think about this is you know the the best crypto minds are not going to work at Facebook to work on a crypto currency initiative right they're you know they're doing their own thing and you know economic incentives have a lot to do with that and so you know I think clearly you know Zuckerberg is talking about it and it is top of mind in some sense from from the very top at Facebook but I'm just deeply skeptical that they're going to pull something you know really meaningful long run off and if you look at you know most of their materials you know a lot of it is kind of very much a derivative of you know aetherium and kind of existing crypto projects and so in you know the whole concept of Libre to me kind of feels like a poor man's maker Dow so I yeah I you know happy to dive into specifics but that I guess that that's my general sentiment on on Libre all right well why don't we dive into deeper details in a moment but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible Ã©toile gives you access to the most popular crypto assets on the market and it's virtual trading and discussion features let you discuss and test trading strategies with a community of over 11 million other traders and headline news they have officially launched in the USA eToro offers the smartest trading tools and the ability to connect with the best traders around the world their trading fees are transparent and exceedingly low - and it's available in one easy-to-use app gets started at eToro calm that's ii t/o are calm and build your crypto portfolio the smart way today will the world follow france and advocate banning privacy coins will government backed stable coins become the new Fiat are distributed and peer to peer exchanges just a flash in the pan the answer is maybe virtual currencies can flourish and create a new private and more versatile economy but that grand vision can't happen without keeping crypto clean and that requires support of governments and accountability for bad actors privacy enhanced compliance using cryptographic controls has the potential to preserve anonymity without compromising legitimate investigations cipher trace is working on this vision of the future sign up to stay up to date on the privacy enhanced compliance initiative and receive authoritative crypto AML reports quarterly WW ciphers prease calm /keep crypto clean back to my conversation with that tomato so if you're you know not thinking that Libre will end up being super impactful then you know what do you think will kind of be maybe the the really big way that people end up using this technology like in a more mainstream fashion so I think you know in 2019 there's one clear use case for crypto which is speculation and that's arguably now you know a mainstream use case and I think you know there's going to be absent flows but it's likely that we're still in kind of the you know the relatively early innings of that use case and and so you know that's my base assumption is that speculation is going to continue to grow as a use case in crypto there's a lot of people out there that say well look you know the speculation is all a bubble and you know there's got to be real use cases beyond speculation underlying it but I think that's a very kind of us centric view of the world and if you you know look at a whole bunch of countries around the world you spend time in those places you realize that you know there are people in those countries that you know may not have the ability to invest in public market equities like we do in the US or may not even have you know bank accounts and so you know crypto very much represents a you know a new investable opportunity for a lot of people in the world and I think that yeast case is going to grow beyond speculation my kind of gut is that the next potentially really interesting mainstream use case could be saving and you know saving meaning you know in interest-bearing accounts in crypto and you know if you look at negative interest rates policies around the world and even in the u.s. if you you know if you have $10,000 in a savings account you can get maybe two percent on that right now and we're starting to see products on top of aetherium that are you know giving better savings opportunities to people and of course it's still very early it's unclear where the rates will you know end up long term and there's you know challenges too for people to get into crypto still but I'm very excited about you know things like compound and and dy/dx and Yuna swab that are giving people around the world new savings opportunities and and of interest-bearing savings opportunities so that's that's a use case that I think is you know we could be you know the next catalysts to get you know millions of users into crypto yes I you know agree with you that all those projects are pretty interesting I've actually had them all on either Unchained or unconfirmed so I'll link to those in the show notes but so that in general sounds like maybe defy is what's interesting you and so aside from like maybe the savings use case are there any other trends in defy that have piqued your interest sure I mean savings is in some sense on the back of stable coins right and you know like for fun one we made some early bets in stable coins and that was really a big focus for us it continues to be I mean the need for stable coins just kind of continues to to grow and and I think if you look at it's no secret maker Dow is you know the most successful in many ways projects on top of aetherium so you know tether tether on aetherium is now taking huh true true though I know tether and technically on aetherium but yeah no one in defy uses tether so I and I've never yeah I get back to you know how I think about the world and maybe this is too near but it's kind of I think it's like do I use the products and tether is something that I've never used tether to me is kind of this you know stable coin that's used by traders on different exchanges and things like that but yeah tether to me is not really defy you mean like it's not used on Shane it's not what you mean exactly exactly like if you look at you know decentralize exchanges and you know the you know tether I think it's like the the trading pair used on on centralized exchanges like by Nance and others but if you look at kind of on chain defy decentralized exchanges you know I don't believe I could be wrong on this but I don't think you know I don't think you'll see a tether high up the list it's it's you know it's die and it's USD see what are you what's your feeling about etherium scaling issues do you worry that that could drive developers off and other crypto networks it's a it's definitely a long-term concern though I think you know my view is right now aetherium is working really well for high dollar value low throughput type transactions defy really write so and there are you know solutions that come before f20 that can give you you know some you know scaling right and and it may be it's it's 5x or 10x and not a thousand x but to me you know the fact that transaction fees on aetherium surpassed Bitcoin and you know people are actually paying higher fees right now for aetherium transactions is a really good sign and I think there are a lot of you know tweaks to be made like in increasing the gas limit size and you know implementing some layer 0 solutions such as box route that can get you you know relatively soon without you know these major protocol changes you know 5x or 10x right so all right although I did I did see this week that I guess there were because of like a scaling bottleneck there was there were I guess that there was some point where the East price fell or something and there was like a bunch of liquidations in maker Dow CDP's and they didn't go through kind of at the time that you would expect and so I feel like that does cause some risk I saw somebody tweeting about that I'll put that in the show notes yeah yeah I actually didn't see that but that's interesting it doesn't really surprise me I think clearly you know like anyone that's used aetherium in the past week or so recognizes that there's there's been a bottleneck and you know like I you know I did in a theorem transaction the other day and paid $12 you know for a fee and so but but what I'm saying is there are you know ways to get you know if 10x say without you know major changes like you 2.0 right and and particularly I mean increasing the gas limit which miners are starting to do and I think that could continue and you know increasing the the gas limit that comes with some trade offs that you know you need to consider and things like that so it's not quite that easy but I'm I guess you know long-winded way of saying my view is that defy a high dollar value low throughput stuff on aetherium is working pretty well right now but I think clearly for use cases beyond that such as you know social networking apps or gaming apps or identity stuff or you know anything that requires kind of low dollar value but high throughput you know aetherium as it currently stands can't support that right so and that's obviously you know a driving force behind why there's been such a big emphasis on youth 2.0 which you know I would say I'm cautiously optimistic on that you know early to 2020 we could start seeing some of the you know the fruits of all the work that's being done there but I also think there is a opportunity for other chains to capture some of those use cases that that the etherium isn't right now and we've you know we've invested in a few of those I would say I think that's clearly been a you know next-gen blockchains has been kind of this meme that a lot of projects have just kind of way over marketed and there's a lot of really bad projects that raised a lot of money from that meme but I think there are as you know as is the case with most memes you know they tend to get abused but there is some kind of you know interesting stuff there too and and that's projects you know the two in particular that we've invested and are are cosmos in polkadot which I think you know by my estimation are are kind of the best you know the best combination of kind of this strong community and ethos combined with you know strong technology and I think you know in order to to really you know capture any of these use cases that we're talking about I think you need both an out of curiosity for both of those obviously you would have the choice of investing either in the company such as parody versus the network polka dot or the company tender mint versus the network cosmos so how do you decide which one to do in which did you do yeah so in the case of you know the cosmos network we invested both in the company tender mint behind you know the project and the token in the case of you know Adams and and in the case of polka dot we just invested in dots so you know I think there's a whole variety of considerations there at the end of the day though I think you know what's most important is is again like incentive alignment if you know how we think about it is we don't really care if we're investing in a company or a token we want kind of pure incentive alignment with the founders that are building the prod and I think you know clearly 2017 there was way too much focus on tokens because they became this really hot thing and you could raise a lot of money with and in many cases you know there wasn't pure incentive alignment with the investors and the founders and that got into trouble but I think as you know how I think about you know early stage investing is you know if you could be your you're gonna have success if you can align yourself from an incentive perspective with with great founders and that's you know really how I think about it all right well it's been great
