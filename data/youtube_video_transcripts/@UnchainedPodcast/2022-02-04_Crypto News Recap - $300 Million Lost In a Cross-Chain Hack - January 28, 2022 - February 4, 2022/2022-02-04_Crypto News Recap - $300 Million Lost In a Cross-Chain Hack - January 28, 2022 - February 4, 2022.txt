exploit is worth over three hundred million dollars and ranks as the second largest hack in d phi history data from wrecked shows wormhole is a chain bridge meaning wormhole locks assets into a contract on one chain and mints a wrapped version of the asset onto another chain according to paradigm researcher sam cz sun the attacker spoofed a guardian signature and minted 120 000 eth on solana without having to bridge eth in the first place a guardian is a node that signs off on transactions between chains by creating a fraudulent guardian signature the attacker was able to mint wrapped eath on solana out of thin air and move the fake wrapped eath to ethereum in exchange for real eath optimism's kelvin victor also came to the same conclusion the wormhole team announced that the vulnerability was patched at 7 41 pm on wednesday night by thursday morning the bridge was live jump crypto replaced the 120 000 eth on wormhole's eath contract so that wrapped eath was once again fully backed on solana in the hours after the attack occurred it appears the wormhole team reached out to the hacker's address to offer a 10 million white hat bounty in exchange for returning the

irs for a refund claiming that they erroneously paid taxes on crypto staking rewards as if it were income the lawsuit argues that staking income should not be treated as income until it is sold this week the irs offered the jarretts their refund without explaining their reasoning behind the refund which would also mean that the irs wouldn't be setting a precedent however joshua said that they are not taking the refund explaining i refused the offer because i know that until my case receives an official ruling i have no certainty they won't try to tax me again in essence josh sued the irs for clarity on taxation of new tokens created through staking the irs tried to pay him off to drop the suit he turned down the money to continue the case and seek binding precedent for us all wrote the blockchain association's jake travinsky on twitter according to cointracker's shayhan chandra sakura if decided in favor of the jarretts the case would only set a precedent for proof-of-stake staking
