super modular is Adventure Studio that builds regenerative web 3 projects We Believe crypto can be good for the world and we're using the latest in coordination technology to build experiments and funding public goods and creating positive impact for the planet and for the people using crypto [Music] Kevin walkie's the co-founder and former CEO of kitcoin which sought to help ethereum developers connect and coordinate on meaningful projects in 2021 however get coin transitioned to a dow Kevin disassociated from Bitcoin last year after helping grow its grants program which is now distributed over 70 million dollars in funding how is super modular the natural Next Step so get coin has now become a dow it doesn't need a CEO anymore it's got its own decentralized governance uh for uh it's created 50 million dollars worth of impact on the world in funding public goods through Bitcoin grants I'm now building a company called super modular that builds Venture studio type projects and sometimes we build on top of get coins protocols Bitcoin is now a protocol in a dow and so we build on top of that protocol sometimes but sometimes we just choose the right tool for the job we we build on top of a lot of different Primitives in the space as long as it's creating positive impact that's what we care about super modular has actually been hard at work for months what sort of projects are already being used so we're we just launched Biddle box which is a hackathon in a box product we are running the ethereum for hackathon out of Bittle box right now and uh there's thousands of hackers using it to coordinate their own builds at East Denver Gavin has talked a lot about the need to support public goods in ethereum these are things that everyone benefits from but no one necessarily has a clear motive to pay for on their own what projects does Super modular want to support Bitcoin is known for quadratic funding and they just launched hallow protocol which is a protocol for doing quadratic funding we're looking at deploying that in a couple new places we have a pilot in Togo which is an African nation of about seven million people where we're going to be doing quadratic funding for their public goods out there we are doing uh quadratic funding mobile experiences and we're all kind of messing around with quadratic funding being embedded inside of Discord and lens uh basically the idea is what if we could have public goods funding protocols in our social spaces so as you're hanging out on social media you're actually earning for creating good in the world so um we're we're just rapidly prototyping right now and leveraging the builders on buildbox and creating an ecosystem of of a regenerative apps my my goal for this movement is to rotate capital in a talent and attention from dgen projects into regenerative projects that are having a impact on the world through line for all of our different builds Bitcoin is successfully distributed millions in funding and put a spotlight on smaller projects let us know in the comments whether you think Super modular will be as successful at identifying and incubating the next big thing [Music]
