Ohio welcome congressman Davidson good to talk with you Laura your mixes and Mick your background is a mix of military and MPA and owning and operating manufacturing companies how did you come to be a commerce minh and also get into Bitcoin yeah so I guess how did I become a congressman you know John Boehner was the member of Congress that represented my district and of course he was also the Speaker of the House so when he resigned you know I wasn't planning to run for Congress at that time I owned a group of manufacturing companies and so he resigned in September of 15 you know initially there were a couple people running against him but then all your more credible candidates get in right away after he announced it in October you start getting invitations to fundraisers in November a couple people stopped in my office really to raise money for another cause and they said you know it'd be great they asked who I was gonna back in the race and I said well you guys are the political people and they said it'd be great if there was an Army Ranger business guy in their race yeah and you know I came home and I thought my wife would laugh kinda like you did yeah cuz that was my reaction and she said well what'd you tell him I said well tell them they're crazy cuz it's crazy and she says call him back you'd be great at that you know only I did and you know won the race so that's how I came to be in Congress but you know I took an interest in Bitcoin you know early on because in manufacturing we had a lot of international payments and you know it has all the payment system problems that people recognize that would be watching or listening to this podcast and and so you would you'd wire transfer money and it was early on it was really clunky because you couldn't wire direct to China for example she'd go through Hong Kong was very inefficient and that led to an interest in things like digit cash and other things so when Bitcoin came on the scene you say oh this really is a free elegant solution pretty neat idea Wow okay so you were really following this stuff even before if you knew about digit cash yeah I mean not as a unfortunately not as a Silicon Valley investor just as a manufacturing guy there's a problem here in the Midwest right and and I just want to say for listeners who don't remember we're both from the same state Ohio great state so we had tried to do this interview back in December and due to technical issues we couldn't finish it and what was interesting is this time around when I went to prepare everything in the world had changed so drastically that some of the questions not only seemed outdated but almost quaint and I still feel like you know we need to dive into that background so people understand kind of what it is that you've been working on and crypto and blockchain pre-pandemic so why don't we just kind of cover that ground now so in April of 2019 you introduced the token taxonomy Act in the house what problems were you trying to solve with that bill and what are the main points that it proposes yeah so the bill itself really was a product of work done in 2018 so you know like I covered I got into Congress and then ultimately on the Financial Services Committee people will remember in that stretch 2017 in particular the ICO market was really hot and Congress really wasn't doing anything about it there were regulatory you know turf wars and you know court cases that were coming out provide patchwork and normally that's a great time for Congress to come in and provide some sort of clarity what should the law be and we couldn't get momentum on that so 18 20 18 was coming around and we couldn't get that so as a you know junior member of Congress I can't really hold a hearing but I could hold a meeting so I decided to hold a meeting and in September of 18 we had this roundtable it was initially like let's get a dozen or so people in this space thought leaders and it turned into oh well these people are coming well let's send our CEO or you know general counsel and then that led to bigger firms and more credit credible firms in the space and and I think you were saying some of them were like fidelity State Street a 16 C can you list some of the others andreessen horowitz you know in in in small firms you know early-stage startups like 10x TS in Ohio company you know and you know file coin was there from consensus you know so many of the use cases that you would look at and you know big names in the space but yeah things like fidelity State Street Nasdaq you know since you know good representation to be part of it and that drew a great piece so we really went there to listen not necessarily to say here's exactly what should be done but the bill that we drafted afterwards became a non partisan bill you know people across the political spectrum and kind of wrapping up it kind of summed up to say this isn't really a partisan issue it's whether you actually understand the issue or not because people from across the political spectrum would agree this is what this space needs to have innovation flourish in the United States so we dropped a bill at the end of 2018 that was really meant to be a public way to get feedback on what we had our work product from that Roundtable and so we thought oh well we'll be able to get feedback and drop this in February but we truly had feedback I mean just in an abundance of input from you know great law schools venture capital firms trading the trading desks startup companies entrepreneurs you name it so we had all this input coming and it took really until mid-march before we kind of gelled all that in a way that we could get it redrafted so it's been there and you know we've got a nice file of things that if we do get to the point where we go through true hearings and and then markups where amendments could be offered we would probably edit the text some to get full consensus to move across the finish line but we're not yet there it and we thought we had a lot of momentum initially because of Libra which at the time we were doing this wasn't yet if it was conceived it wasn't yet public that it was conceived so when Libra you know got a lot of awareness for this space unfortunately it made the whole topic almost about Facebook and unless about the underlying tech and and it's kind of been in between the two people are worried about the technology or you know the Facebook type issues not really dealing with the regulatory clarity that we need in the meantime so if Congress had to try to understand the seven-layer security protocol of the internet we would have never got the telecommunication 90s thankfully they just said you know we're pretty sure this is gonna be a thing we should kind of get out of the way unless some innovation happen so we're really pushing for that kind of minimal light touch regulatory clarity that the United States needs and frankly as the people that are listening to this podcast are now watching know that Capitol is fleeing the United States not really to avoid our laws with defined regulatory certainty that has been accomplished in places like Switzerland and Singapore and in terms of the clarity that you wanted to offer what that act it looks like one of them was that you would propose or that act would propose that digital tokens would be excluded from the definition of a security does that mean that if it were to pass that holding an initial coin offing offering would be legal well I mean an initial coin offering could be legal today if you can pop complied with you know Reggae Reggae plus you know part you know D there are a number of crowdsourcing there's a number of ways to do it initial coin offering that would be fully compliant with securities law the trouble is that if you want to make a coin you know in the sense of a tokenized asset functional if it's treated as a security then it for most use cases becomes problematic because you're essentially engaging in Broker Dealer activity and it fundamentally changes what a lot of firms are trying to do with the space so it says that if you meet this four-part test then you could have regulatory clarity that this will not be considered a security and that's really been the hang-up at the SEC the Securities and Exchange Commission and it goes back to a 1950s court case the Howey test which is really about oranges versus orange groves and the capital formation and and you know is it created yet or not so you know it doesn't say all tokens will be not securities but it says if you meet this test then you'll know it's not a security because you could tokenize securities in what are the four conditions yeah so one it's already created so not just proposed so it exists like the network is live right so it's functional and and and then two is that it's on a distributed ledger that doesn't require a third party to transfer assets so you don't need an intermediary so that you know we started talking about him initially as open blockchain tokens but then we said well there are people that are doing things that are very similar that would probably meet the same test and it wouldn't necessarily be on a true distributed ledger or blockchain technology but clearly a distributed ledger which people watching this would be familiar with complies versus a centralized database certainly so essentially that means that a private blockchain run by a consortium would not qualify their project would not qualify is that well because yeah it wouldn't necessarily meet this test because you know there's a bigger debate about that and the other piece is the central authority which is you know port 3 central authority you know can't alter it so this this would for example the proposed for Libra wouldn't pass this test because you know even though it's a non-profit they have a central authority that could in theory change the composition of the basket of currencies or even short-term securities that we're talking about when Herron T if you're trading short-term securities to create the value of the asset then you know the underlying product will be a security so that's the that's three and then excuse me the fourth part is that it doesn't represent you know an entity so for example I like pointing out file coin and some people may be familiar with that use case but think of Apple if they wanted to launch cloud coin in the the token was representative of a terabyte of storage on iCloud it would be very clear that you're not buying shares of Apple right you're buying you're buying storage you know a service or good you know so it's the representation of the asset can't be you know shares of a company otherwise they'll just be a big circle you know to say well gee this is a share but it's not treated as a share so you can't represent that and then that's the four-part test so even if the sec really really doesn't like your use case they still can't say that it's a security unless you know mortgages aren't securities either but you can bungle them in a way that they are now securitized so somebody could do that to tokens down the road you know to to kind of I guess highlight how far into the weeds you can get with these definitions but it's really important so that's one of the important things that it does another big thing is custody is a big issue so you know how can you give custody to somebody while retaining the private keys and in theory you could give those keys to someone else so creates a standard for that and then I think lastly a couple other things are the last big important thing is the de minimis tax exemption and while we'd like to go bigger on that the the safe thing is to just treat it the same way you would treat existing currency and the downside is that conflates all of these tokenized assets that could be represented by a digital token with currency and the reality of many of the use cases have nothing to do with currency but the language that formed in the early days of this space it's all about currency and and some of my colleagues can't get over that where you're just trying to create a rival to the dollar and destroy the value of the dollar you know there are some that are aspirational in that sense of what they hope the space can do but many of it's like the Internet I mean we haven't even remotely tapped all the use cases for the Internet so you'll you're clearly in the infancy of use cases for blockchain technology and tokenized assets so I'd rather use something else but because of that confusion but you know if you go to Europe and you're gonna go say initially to London you need pounds you're going to need euros as long as the net is less than six hundred dollars you don't end up having to pay taxes and and so that that same de minimis exception would apply here for tokens yeah so first of all the taxation issue is such a huge one for the listeners of this show and and just really a lot of people that are involved in the crypto space and you know one other thing I wanted to point out is it's so clear that you have a very nuanced understanding of this because you know just even what you were saying about how just because the they come these different assets can come and this blockchain wrapper doesn't make them all currencies I mean you know that's it's an obvious thing and hopefully someday regulation can address crypto assets in that way but you're right that at the moment I think you are one of the select few lawmakers who does have that deep and understanding of the space so one other thing that I wanted to bring up was just a few other aspects about the taxation one is that it looks to me also like there are certain IRAs in virtual currencies where distributions would not be taxed which it sounds to me like if you put Bitcoin into an IRA then you don't pay taxes when you withdraw that money is that correct well it depends on the kind of IRA so would really have nothing to do with the underlying asset in my opinion initially I mean not here in this space but or an accountant but you know you have a Roth IRA and a traditional IRA so you know the money that you put in you know in a traditional IRA is tax deferred and you don't pay taxes till the end and the money that you put in a Roth is is is money that's already been taxed and so they're they're treated differently okay yeah and a couple one other one that caught my attention was a tax exemption for exchanges of virtual currency which made it sound like crypto to crypto exchanges would be tax free which I think would excite a lot of the traders in the community yeah correct that's that's right so you know if you think about real estate people it's still it's like section 1031 but you talk about a 1031 exchange and it's it really treats it as an asset and when you do a like-kind exchange then you can net out the tax so if you the easy case is if you're you know say taking you know a hundred thousand dollars or a million dollars and you're buying something that's you know two hundred thousand dollars or 2 million you can roll that in you still end up with issues when you're going down the ladder in terms of paying out of net gangsta sunette issue but it still could minimize that generally it's done when you're taking something of value and exchanging it for something more and putting some additional you know equity or leverage into the deal and then one last piece of this is you know this what you proposed intersects with what SEC Commissioner has her purse proposed in terms of her suggestion that there be a safe harbor for token issuers and I was curious to know what your opinion was of her proposal I think ester purse and I are nearly 100% aligned in this space so I think she would make an excellent SEC commissioner okay great well chairman she's already on the board I think she would be a great chair I feel like it's pretty rare to get such a strong opinion from a politician so I think that's something you feel strongly about okay so now we've kind of gotten through most of that pre-pandemic backgrounds but actually will one last piece is so but before all of that oh like at the time you know this past winter oh you know when we thought we were gonna do this the first time what is what was the status of the token taxonomy actually at that time like how likely did you think it was to be passed in 2020 back in the winter yeah I think the the the coalition is not partisan so we have a wide range of folks unfortunately some of the chairman of the committee changed and so clearly the most vocal opponent of this space in congress is brad sherman and you know brad sherman is a democrat from los angeles and now he is the chairman of the capital markets subcommittee so near the end of the year after elijah cummings died carolyn maloney moved out of our committees chairmanship for that subcommittee and became chair chairwoman of the House Oversight Committee so that created the opening and and Brad Sherman's the most senior Democrat so he became the in that subcommittee so he became the chairman of the Capital Markets subcommittee so he famously also proposed outlawing crypto currency yeah did that go anywhere thankfully no however he continues to say that the only reason crypto currency is to launder money or evade taxes and sometimes more pejorative things than that like fun terrorism so you know safe to say that as long as he's in that chairmanship it's going to be a challenge to move legislation thankfully chairman Archer our ranking member Patrick McHenry is very Pro crypto very Pro the space he hasn't endorsed this particular bill but I think in general as ranking member he tries to avoid those things particularly things where they're still a healthy debate on and in and so it doesn't kind of tip his hand for lots of things I I think he might have supported 100 it he's got a few ideas and so that's where I say we cathode the ideas that are coming in you know we might see it amended somewhat to get across the finish line and another thing I was encouraged by you know Kelly Lafleur in in the Senate I mean she clearly understands the space coming from you know her background and in Wyoming a state that's really been phenomenal for for crypto and tokenized assets blockchain broadly heavily due to Catelyn long and a state legislature out there but Cynthia Lummis is is likely to be the next senator from Wyoming and she's very strong on the issue as well so hopefully we'll have knowledgeable allies in the Senate that will help us get momentum on in a bicameral way and get this across the finish line and the last i would say is you know just because you know congressman sherman is in a very influential position on this doesn't mean that you will carry the day so you know maxine waters and her staff have been you know attentive they've listened we've got a FinTech task force now and so you know congressman foster and congressman Lynch have paid attention to it now Congressman Tom Emmer as a Republican is leading the Republican side and you know he clearly understands the space and so I think there's some opportunity for Menem momentum but yeah I mean on virtually every issue as you've alluded to we've been disrupted by a you know a health pandemic and now really a lot of attention to some civil unrest I think you know a lot of I mean near uniformed concern over you know excessive force used against people broadly and of course most recently George Floyd yeah and so before we move on to those issues I do want to also mention that Patrick and congressman Patrick McHenry was on this show and he at that time talked about something new that he was proposing called the financial services innovation Act and it kind of would create something similar to a sandbox which he was calling permanent beta testing which was also an interesting idea people can listen to episode for more information on that and also I did do an interview with governor mark Gordon of Wyoming and certainly Wyoming is really out front and center and I've also discussed Kaitlyn's Kaitlyn lawns avanti bank which is going to be launching probably sometime in the next year all right so in a moment we will discuss taxes and will not tax it sorry we cover taxes China Libre additional dollar kovat and more but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible calleman law is run by true crypto oh geez and

unemployment and all these protests so and of course now we've had we have this election coming up so given all those things how has that changed any of your strategy around you know trying to move some crypto friendly regulation forward well as you saw in well some of your some of your listeners or viewers now may have noticed that there was a reference in one of the bills that had no momentum to you know a central bank digital currency and research there so in the space obviously some people view central bank digital currency as disruptive to you know private private efforts and some people see it as an accelerant you know either way China is moving forward aggressively with a central bank digital currency and so you know we're gonna be following whatever whatever happens in that space is really not a lot of likelihood we'll build enough momentum to be doing it concurrently at least soon so you know we'll see how that plays out but that was one of the references in the bill and then you know like I said earlier a a lot of the energy really has gone to trying to create economic stabilization as as Congress recognized that you know you would have massive disruption to the economy and the stabilization is gone pretty well in light of that I mean we massive unemployment but directionally the funding from the payroll Protection Plan for example what you kept as many people as possible in their payroll as that's kicked in you're starting to see people brought back to work and the unemployment number already trending down from the peak and so you saw the Fed step in with a lot of monetary policy and that created a lot of attention because this isn't money that the federal government's really borrowing we're effectively you know printing it you know altering the ledger so you say and of course that would be considered highly inappropriate in a tokenized asset right you've got the central bank editing the editing that currency we're gonna dilute the value of your assets and that's exactly what's happening to your are US dollars and so it highlights exactly why Satoshi Nakamoto drafted the white paper to explain Bitcoin so yeah so you you really it sounds like you're you're not a fan of the way that this is being handled and it is is it fair to say that you would trust a system more like Bitcoin that had kind of programmed monetary policy well I think you know to say that it I'm not supportive oh look I voted for the cares Act which you know was 2.2 trillion dollars I mean you look at the alternative was you really you don't you don't think you should intervene in this and so you know that highlights where some people in the space don't support central bank side central bank has a role but I do think it's cautionary you know as people still say oh we should print another three trillion and another the modern monetary theory people they believe if you have a central bank you can just keep printing you know that's not what history shows and frankly the logic of it is that you can just dilute the value of everyone's money and there's no consequence for it and if that's completely irrational so people in the in the crypto space and obviously Bitcoin fans will see the the fallacious argument for what it is but I think if you had a you know Bitcoin as your national currency you would see the lack of flexibility that would provide for a central bank in a situation like this I view Bitcoin personally kind of like digital gold versus a true currency I think it's a great store of value I don't currently own don't own any personally I think given the role in how vocal I've been as a legislator about the space that it would be inappropriate for me to do so though not technically a violation of the rules but I think that when you look at the the challenge for it it's highlighted the in the space one of the things that's really important to me is is central authority and the ability to do true permissionless transactions so Bitcoin can do that you know in theory all the way but in the u.s. it's heavily regulated by you know Bank Secrecy Act any money laundering know your customer provisions that require a lot of data collection about the on-ramps of how you come into owning the assets so I you know our country constitutionally is supposed to have privacy not secrecy and that's a tough balance and in our financial transactions in the US the Fourth Amendment's been heavily eroded so I think this space really whether it's you know the form that it takes is incredibly important and that is really a lot of the tension between people that say we want to I mean some of the with my colleagues literally want a back door so that they can see all the identity of everyone and even some want to node where they can approve or deny every transaction as the government and essentially that's playing out and that's part of why Facebook was you know timely in their Libra discussion is do you really want someone to filter your content in the same way let's say Twitter is filtering content online right now or do you want it to be truly permissionless like caches I can take a $20 bill and give it to somebody I don't need permission from anyone we just need to agree I'm gonna give you $20 in exchange for what you do and there's still consequences if you do that for things that are illegal but you don't have to get permission from a central authority or a third party to be able to complete the transaction so I think that's the healthy tension that's going to continue to exist in the space and it's it's it's highlighted everyday in our dialogue and you know some of that when you think about covet 19 people really wanted to have all the identity of everything to reopen the economy I mean one of the proposals was and so I've been on the president's task force for opening reopening the economy and one of the proposals was that you would download a digital certificate to your phone every day and if you tested you know negative for covet 19 then your certificate would be renewed for 24 hours but effectively without that the default condition is you're in house arrest that's a fundamental change to American society permissionless systems are things that embrace America's society and culture I could see a system like that working in say China where the culture is different in in the United States it's it's a little ironic that we've been so slow to embrace things that other places that don't have our history of freedom and permissionless activity embracing so I hope that we can kind of turn back and look at some of the core characteristics of cash for example and create that same filled with our payment systems well gosh there's so many things in there but I think maybe the main thing I want to ask you is just so do you feel that Kovac now presents an opportunity for the government to take advantage of this technology and some useful way or you know earlier when you mentioned how that digital dollar was put in that bill but it didn't go anywhere you know what were the arguments on either side and it was you're thinking that now was the time maybe to try to use this technology you know in the midst of this emergency because it is faster than traditional payment rails well I mean I've been a fan of using the space since way before this so I just highlighted that gee wouldn't it be great if we could just you know move money this way and and you know as individuals get payments I mean Treasury was fairly efficient in people that already had their accounts on file moving the money directly into people's accounts but not everyone did so they were so efficient that they sent cash to dead people so hopefully there would be some level of identity that let's not do that there were some flaw they tried to go very fast and they went fast but they found some errors so I think the the a lot of the issues that would make that system function come together like identity right and you know the other piece that is very popular in this space is unbanked people so it's hard for the Treasury to move money to somebody who's unbanked right now and you know a lot of the appeal of crypto is that your phone or USB Drive you know some digital wallet however it functions on your hard drive on your CPU but a digital wallet could effectively be your bank if you've got you know a proper structure to it so that could obviously be way faster yeah but but are you gonna try to you know use this opportunity provided by the pandemics to say to anything or do you feel it's it's maybe you know just something we need to keep building and working on yeah I mean Rahm Emanuel and others have made famous never let a crisis go to waste and and I'm kind of in the other theme in this sense is you know is a someone noteworthy said it's always the right time to do the right thing Martin Luther King and I think that's fitting on all sorts of fronts right now all right well so you did also mention China that country has begun its pilot for the dcep which is its digital currency and payment system and it's also unveiled a very comprehensive blockchain initiative that really is almost as efficient as the Belton Road initiative and in your press release for the token taxonomy actually even referenced the fact that she Jinping has said that blockchain technology is ten times more important than the Internet was so given the fact that they are kind of already working on this and the u.s. is still mired in dealing with the virus and all this record unemployment and all these other things going on are you just concerned in general about the us's ability to stay competitive when it comes to this technology yeah absolutely and in look the way China is trying to do this is you know different than permissionless system so my concern is that we not copy china system I read an article during the pandemic that that was concerning to me because they they said you know on speech China got it right you know we needed the government to be the arbiter of truth and it was an article in the Atlantic I wish I could attribute the and I'm like and and it's the same we don't want that to happen to our payment system either but of course China is implementing such a system and and as they're going into large parts of the world and heavily into Africa you know you know ways to connect their structure to unbanked people it is a really big deal and I think the other piece is when they can do that they truly do have a to the usdollar so you know the last time the planet had this much debt was after World War two and that led to the Bretton Woods Agreement that locked in the United States as the world's reserve currency and you know post this pandemic post this the world is going to have a massive amount of debt and unlike World War two where we largely didn't have debt I mean we had a lot from via from World War two a peak peak level for us but compared to lots of the rest of the world our currency was viewed as the strongest and I'm not positive that's the case and when you look at whether it's China Russia or even Christine Lagarde at the European Central Bank they've been longtime advocates of creating rival to the US dollar whether it's a different currency a synthetic currency basket of currencies approach as Lagarde had proposed when shoes that I am a International Monetary Fund so you know I really hope that we don't you know move forward in a way that not only lacks what China and other parts of the world are doing but ultimately sees us undermine one of our core strengths which is we are the world's reserve currency it's great for our economy it's great for our Polo's fiscal policy our ability to get debt at affordable prices and it's actually very essential to our national security programs so we don't want to undermine that we should be moving with FinTech instead of lagging and unfortunately we're we're lagging given that China's forging ahead the u.s. appears to be dragging its feet when it comes to a central bank digital currency would you say that Libre then simply because Facebook is the only entity on earth that has a larger population than the population of China that that is sort of going to be the counterweight to the dominance of dcep I mean it could be but fundamentally let's look at Libre I mean it might get a lot of support from Europe frankly it was I don't know if the intent was to replicate what Christine Lagarde had proposed when she was at the IMF but the the core prong Libra is essentially a synthetic currency it heavily represent the proposal she had as a synthetic currency so that would have a lot of appeal to a number of countries and frankly to a lot of global corporations when you look at the foreign exchange market forex market currency risk is one of the biggest hedges it's a huge market so synthetic has an appeal to a lot of folks right but I don't know if you saw that they did change the plan recently to you know have different in each place yeah so I'm following not and you know I think that's a good way to accelerate what they're trying to do I don't know that they've given up their end goal they still want to keep their Libra association and do it but they also said that if a country if they go into a country they would set it up as a stable coin and if a country set up a central bank digital currency then they're stable coin would go to the central bank digital currency so I think they're trying to stay very compatible and build momentum behind their project an idea and it certainly has the the the markets share in the mine space and already downloaded and installed on literally billions of devices so you know it could really be a thing so we'll see yeah it's interesting the hostility we saw from lawmakers in a way combined with their reluctance to maybe move forward on a US central bank digital currency could actually accelerate Facebook's dominance in this space and and actually well one other question do you feel like Facebook's change in strategy has appease those lawmakers who were hostile to Libra earlier I'm not entirely I mean it takes a little bit away by saying they're their US product would be a stable coin but when you look at the the the piece you know settling transactions and things that aren't US dollars for people like brad sherman will inherently undermine the dollar so and and i am a little concerned again because so much of the top-line attention goes to the currencies the currency issue and monetary policy concerns that while we're dithering on this topic and it's incredibly important we're not providing any regulatory clarity for the you know nearly infinite number of potential use cases that don't involve payment systems or currencies they're simply representations of goods or services or commodities and and or could be securities I mean you could even do securities and shares more effectively in lots of cases with with tokens I mean you could effectively have a bearer bonds you know represented in this space so there there is so much potential for this that I think the the currency debate if we could even Park that if we would do a lot of good for our economy and for innovation in the United States of America if we could provide that certainty for everything but currency and payment systems and I'd also to discuss the u.s. digital dollar a little bit more you know we have a former CFTC Chairman Chris Giancarlo who's proposing one he's obviously a very credible person do you see kind of the way that he has influencing anything in in you know improving or increasing the receptivity that various people in the government have to the idea of a digital dollar yeah I mean I think he was a very credible person to lead this initiative and you know when when the internet was forming in the 90s you know building momentum in the 90s not really for me you know the the established media companies were very slow to recognize how disruptive this idea could be so in a lot of ways when Congress passed this light-touch regulatory clarity in the 90s there wasn't a big lobbying effort to preserve the status quo right and so was seen as this blue ocean blue sky whichever holsters you want total you know space that could be able to go into and innovate and create and you know the the whether you're talking central banks or you know traditional banks or payment processors payment systems they all are very attuned to how disruptive this technology could be to their space and so somebody that can truly speak that language and understand it balance the relationships like he can I think was was a very helpful thing but it's still facing a very entrenched status quo that's working hard to keep their current competitive advantage in frankly as as we we continue to delay in Congress a lot of private sector companies some of the biggest players in the space are racking up patents to be able to lock out small early-stage innovators and you know trying to essentially dominate it once they do get certain D so that's also unfortunate so it sort of feels like if you just tie all these trends together a kind of paints a bleak picture you know what we were discussing earlier about what China is doing what CCP and how its using its leverage in Africa also to you know build I guess dependency on its currency there and if it is doing that in a way that's reaching the unbanked and also does it in a way with washing technology where this money I think this version of money will simply be used more the way that now with the internet you know we message people on our I'm messages and our whatsapp and our Facebook Messenger and Twitter and you know I just feel like once this technology really gets going there's just going to be a lot more transactions and if that's happening on dcep rails that just reduces the power of the US dollar so when you combine that with kind of just simply the fact that the US dollar does obviously enjoy global reserve status at the moment which kind of leads to a sense of complacency do you feel that the u.s. status as superpower I guess in a way could be disrupted I mean we're we're gonna stay a superpower I mean you know we're even if only the militarily I mean our economy is the largest in the world or markets the most functional in the world you know our military's the most powerful in the world our intelligence and surveillance systems are unrivaled so I mean we will clearly be a superpower and frankly we should spend a little less energy worrying about being a superpower and more about doing the things that resulted in that which was you know providing the world's best market for goods services intellectual property capital formation and when we do those things fundamentally the rest is going to take care of itself and I don't know maybe we can you know not squander resources and endless wars in more places that's a separate topic but I think when you look at China for example you know the way they've got to tie the pandemic piece back together the way they've gone about their activities historically and particularly in this pandemic have really alienated a lot of countries so you know they were they were literally leveraging their PPE personal protective equipment stockpiles to say well we can get you some of these you know n95 masks and protective garments for hospitals and I see use if if you agree to use huawei for your 5g implementation right and you know Western countries in particular like but you've got to be getting key to be polite about the reaction right and as people seeing how China wanted to leverage their power I think it's caused a lot of people to check up and you know let's not forget that when China became part of the World Trade Organization they promised to become a market economy and you know that was in the 90s and so far zero countries recognized China as a market economy every country would recognize the things that China has done with respect to intellectual property theft with respect to blocking market access or if you do get access you have to you know share the intellectual property and ownership of your company in exchange for that market and then they don't want to the same sort of reciprocal things I mean in fact to be listed on US exchanges Chinese companies don't have the same audit standards for example so they've really been treated separately and I think not just in the United States but around the world people have kind of grown weary of that and now they're much more cautious so those activities could delay China's ability to move forward on you know whether its digital currency or trade or some of their other belt and road initiatives interesting I just wonder what leverage some of these other countries though have to you know not do business with China I guess that's where I was going with that questioning I just worry that because of the power that they'll build well I and I can't predict I'm just surmising that that will give them I mean you already see it with how they are influencing huge actors from the NBA to the w-h-o to basically get those organizations to censor themselves based on what China's priorities are and what they're using is their financial power you know so I that's I just worry about them building even more financial power right and you look at American companies who would never accept that from the American government but in exchange for market access in China they've I mean you had Google but employees threatened to quit or quit if Google cooperated with the Department of Defense yet Google in exchange for market access in China has done all sorts of things right so you know it is an interesting paradox but I think because of that you'll see supply chains shift not just American supply chains but a lot of supply chains will be disrupted in China has built this power because they they committed to be a market economy and they provided you know a great place to innovate they have a huge potential market but they've really made it so that a lot of other countries can't really get that without undermining their own futures and and so you know that's kind of a separate topic in the sense of how China has done it but you know it may delay may give us a little bit of time on the currency side for the us to kind of get our own house in order but again you know my fear is that we get so bogged down with the currency aspects that we don't really provide the certainty for the you know thousands tens of thousands and you know massive number of use cases that don't involve currency and what do you say to those who are nervous that moving to digital currencies could hurt the US government's ability to influence foreign actors in terms of imposing sanctions etc well I think if if you're concerned about that and it's odd that you would want to stay passive and watch other countries like China become the default system right or you know other other domiciles like Switzerland become the regulatory entity or Nexus right London also working very hard to be a financial capital and I think very smartly offering asylum to all the people from Hong Kong that one move to London and and so I think London is working to really you know they've always been a large financial market and arrival to New York and in this digital space they're clearly outpacing the United States I mean the Bank of England has acted to provide essentially two financial firm FinTech companies the same sorts of things that they're doing for big banks in terms of overnight clearing and funds so you could in theory access the repo Mariusz Agreement mark market as a fin tech company in a way that you can't do with the Federal Reserve so we're a long ways out from that kind of thing happen in the United States so if you're really concerned about the United States ability to preserve you know the kind of system that we've used for sanctions in tracking you know illicit finance it seems like you would want to be more innovative instead of more stagnant you know we're essentially trying the Sears Roebuck approach to retail and I don't think that's really smart I hope it doesn't turn out as badly for us as it did for Sears I would agree with that so let's also now just turn to this upcoming election which obviously is going to be one that many feel passionate about on both sides and it seems you know since you had both Republicans and a Democrat sign sponsor the token taxonomy Act that that had bipartisan support do you feel that any of this stuff going on with the pandemic or the record unemployment at any of this or the social unrest that that has in any way affected you know the bipartisan nature of this legislation you know in generally in general how do you feel the outcome of the election could affect crypto friendly regulation being adopted in the US yeah so with respect to this legislation my hope and for a lot of things even the news cycle you know if you watch the news you'll see you know polar opposite versions of the same event depending on which channel you flip to and I keep hoping what will be popular is kind of a just the facts approach like since you couldn't be here here's what happened and you know and and I you know bipartisanship on some of these kinds of things will become trendy again versus partisan messaging bills I think the country in a lot of ways is hungry for that and so my hope is going into the election cycle that a bill like this which is not partisan could get some momentum to show that hey there really is a way for us to work together on some issues and frankly a lot of issues like that in the financial services space aren't partisan it just doesn't get much press right so I hope that we can find a way to work together to get this and a lot of other things done and maybe even get some news for the fact that we do get along and work together on a lot of things but yeah it'll be great I hope and eventually I'm sure we'll get there but maybe not before November but you know going into November one of the biggest things for the House of Representatives you know you know every every member of the House is up every two years so we're all up for re-election and the house is a completely majoritarian body so if you have control your party becomes Speaker then you are the leaders of all the committees and so the leadership really would matter in the sense that you know if if the Republicans flip the house then of course Brad Sherman wouldn't be the leader of the Capital Markets subcommittee and in theory Patrick McHenry would be if he stayed in his current role the likely chairman of financial services and so he would be more likely to be Pro this legislation then Maxine Waters has shown herself to be so far but you know it's it's not clear a that that will be the outcome and B that we would still get momentum on it because you see it but it seems more likely in the house that that would be the case and then you know we'll see what the Senate will see what the presidency it's not a partisan bill so I don't know I don't know if you know Joe Biden or Donald Trump are more or less likely or a player to be named later right so there's a lot of speculation about where the election cycle is going at this point all right well that aside what helped you wish you had from the industry to help get any kind of crypto friendly regulation push forward whether it's the token taxonomy act or something else you know I think the biggest thing that I would love to have would be a consensus that we should have a real hearing focused on you know this space and even if we have to set aside all the payment systems and currency issues for the focus of the hearing that we had hearing about it where the token taxonomy Act was a bill that's noticed for the hearing so we could have you know one or two hearings that that cover this in depth and then we could go into a markup and that's the path that most legislation follows that you have a committee hearing you go to a markup where it's an internal meeting no outsiders but you know Republicans and Democrats and others in the committee with a chance to amend and then you vote on the bill as amended and I again I think we have broad bipartisan support for this legislation that would only be made you know more broad and more bipartisan by going through that markup piece where people could offer you know their amendments and hopefully that would result in a product that functional that's also how some legislation passes but the industry guess what happened here we thought we had something so you know hopefully comes out in a usable form but I'd love that happen and I can't see a downside to doing a real hearing about it person right hopefully it wouldn't end up being like the New York MIT license which obviously was something that the industry really felt had been imposed from above and did not take into account their wishes so before we close up I had a fun question for you which is I wanted to address that moment in the congressional hearing on Libra when you asked meltem de mirrors of coin shares to explain the difference between ship coin and Bitcoin and it appeared that maybe ever-so-slightly there was a little smile on your face did you plan to use that word coin and it did you do it like for the kicks of having it in the Congressional Record well I didn't go into the hearing planning to do it and I had not spoken to Melton before I never actually personally met her before that hearing and so I was listening to her debate and I thought I might be able to broach this topic but I hadn't thought whether I would actually use the phrase good point and and I thought you know this is the most effective way to illustrate it and I think she's going to be able to go there well so it's funny that you sort of clued in on that without having known her because when she came on my show there was just more profanity and that show than in like any other show and she used that phrase specifically she actually talked about what she called the coin waterfall and that had to do with ICO is um and I think if I remember correctly I think we even named the episode we had a Chaconne waterfall in the title so she's very well known for using that word so it's kind of amazing that excuse me that you didn't know that and you didn't plan it I didn't even know that she had used a toilet as a prop at another time but I could definitely sense that she clearly was in the Bitcoin and the yes many of these other things are in fact colloquially known as coins right right well that was just such an iconic moment it will go down in the history books okay great well where can people
