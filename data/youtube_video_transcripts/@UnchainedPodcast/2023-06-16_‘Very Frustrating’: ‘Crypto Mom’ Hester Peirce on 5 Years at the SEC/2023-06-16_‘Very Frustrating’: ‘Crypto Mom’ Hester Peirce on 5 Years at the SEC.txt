particular approach to regulating crypto in the US and in the last few months especially as becoming more clear that its regulation by enforcement if you became the chair of the SEC today what would you do in the first six months to regulate crypto in the US well thanks Laura and I I do want to start with my standard disclaimer which is that my views are my own views as a commissioner and not necessarily those of my fellow Commissioners or the SEC as a whole if I were able to set the agenda for the SEC which would require me to be chair I would I think take each of the discrete issues around crypto try to develop some sort of position paper so that we could then put those out for people to look at comment on and then come in and actually have a discussion I think it's really valuable to have people discussing the same document together to sort of assess whether the approach laid out in the position paper makes sense or not and then move on from there I think that there are a number of issues discrete issues that could be address to make it clear either how we as an agency need to move forward or maybe to lay the groundwork for Congress to move forward this kind of conversation is something that we could have in conjunction with the cftc obviously would be respectful of wherever Congress is I think that's important as well I mean there's there's a lot of activity right now in Congress on on crypto and so the agencies need to be looking to Congress for their Direction but I think the agencies also can be pretty helpful in thinking through some of the more technical problems and doing that again with the help of industry and what are those discrete areas that you would want to look at so I think question number one is what kind of disclosure do you want when people buy tokens that's that's something you can talk about second thing is if you have trading platforms what would a good set of rules look like for trading platforms and who might be the uh the agency that would would oversee those or would it be a joint effort and again some of these questions are going to be resolved by congress not necessarily by the SEC and then another area would be custody there's some unique issues around custody of digital assets and I think that's that's something that you'd want to think about um you'd want to think about and again some of this may not fit within the sec's jurisdiction may or may not you'd want to think about stable coins how they should be regulated so those are some of the the places where I would start I think it would be um it would it would make sense you want to also have a framework for people to identify which regulatory regime they fit in and I think that would be something that could be discussed as well in a recent interview on unchained's premium offering a former SEC cyber enforcement Chief Rob Cohen said that he thought it was unfair that the SEC has been naming crypto tokens as Securities and lawsuits where the token issuers are not named as defendants and so are unable to defend themselves what's your response to those remarks you know this is one of the areas where people really want to get clarity around what's going to be treated as a security and what's not a security and I've been talking about this for a long time that I think we need to be very legally precise in how we're thinking about these things um and you do end up in a situation where and it's not only in crypto but there are many areas where we may we may bring a lawsuit and someone else may have an interest in the outcome of that lawsuit or even in the fact that we brought a lawsuit and and that can be very problematic one of the more famous Enforcement cases the SEC has made in crypto was the one against EOS which is now perceived as a slap on the wrist since EOS raised four billion dollars in an Ico for which the company that launched the network paid only 25 million dollars into fine in contrast some of the tokens that have been named as Securities in the recent lawsuits followed all the rules they qualified for proper exemption so they wouldn't have to register their tokens at Securities now their tokens have been named as Securities in these lawsuits why do you think these enforcement actions have been so unevenly applied and do you agree with how they've been applied I think if you look at trying to address the issues in crypto using a an infor approach I think we're all going to agree there there are a lot of frauds in the space where you're basically using the label crypto and you're raising you're raising funds for yourself that you're going to run off with yourself and you're lying to people I think we can all agree that that's a an appropriate place for enforcement to come in as I've said though if we're going to try to go on a on a an Ico by Ico a token by token approach we're going to be at this for many many years it's a very slow way to do things so I think we really need to think about providing a regulatory solution to the you know again they're they're real issues around information asymmetry and around protecting customers that we want to think about we can think about those but I I think a regulatory approach is better now I will say that people need to be aware that we look at each case on its facts and circumstances and you know you can look at a few facts you can pick out a few facts and say well I think this case should be compared to another case in this case doesn't appear fair in comparison to this other case but there may be other facts that weigh one way that you know push one way or the other and I think it's really important to remember that you know if you want to know how I feel about particular cases you can look at my voting record on those cases it doesn't come out till I will say if if we're bringing a litigated action it won't you won't see that until um until the conclusion of the litigation if it's a settlement you can look at that closer to real time I recently did an interview with two crypto trading platforms that had gotten finra approved to trade digital asset Securities one of them in particular promethium received a special purpose broker dealer license and I wondered what you thought of this as a path for existing crypto exchanges such as coinbase Kraken Gemini Etc well we put that special purpose broker dealer relief out um I think at the end of just it was December 2020 if I recall correctly um and so we now have one firm that has been able to get through and get this designation and even at the time that we put that relief out there as it made it available to people I thought it was too narrow it makes it quite difficult to use that relief so now we we have an opportunity to see how it will work but I think people really need to look at the conditions and that relief and see how narrow they are and and ask whether is that really the solution the regulatory solution that we're looking for my response would be I don't think that's the regulatory solution we need to really sit down and come up with a serious framework that was a baby step right I'm not I'm not saying that it's it was good we did something I was happy at the time we did something but I never viewed it as the solution to the problem on my show promethean's CEO Aaron Kaplan seemed to imply that ether for example is a digital asset security and so could be listed on the promethium site do you agree with that or or if you I mean obviously you may not be able to answer for ether specifically but their website included like screenshots of trading for instance like comp or something like that so you know if you agree that tokens that are kind of all in that class could be agreed then I wondered who you thought would register those tokens as a security with the proper paperwork and disclosures if any Laura I think what you're pointing out is that there are unique aspects of digital assets that I think require us to think about what the right regulatory framework is not trying to jam digital assets into an existing regulatory framework and that's something that I've been talking about for some time but many others have been talking about this for a long time as well it's not an objection to addressing the investor protection or customer protection concerns that are out there it's not an objection to getting information out there it's just trying to think how does it make sense to get information out there there are different approaches that are floating around there you know we we have a legislative draft that's out there now that people are looking at there are ways to deal with this but I think just assuming that you can take these digital assets which as you point out are are quite different from your traditional share of a company that the company is obviously going to be the one to provide the disclosure or something and so that's why I I think we've wasted a lot of time not sitting down and figuring out reasonable solutions that address concerns but also are practical and answer questions about what does this actually mean for these tokens in the primary Market in the secondary Market how are they going to trade who's going to trade them do you need intermediation all of these kinds of questions and so between the last two answers it sort of feels like what you are seeing is that even with these spbd licenses that uh it's pretty Limited in what you can list and for instance something like an ether or a comp or you know similar tokens probably wouldn't be Laura I'm not going to speak to to that and and I I you know I think we have to see how this develops this the approval just came through um I haven't had a chance to talk to the particular company post approval so I don't know what their plans are I think that the issue though is that we have to stop thinking about just putting our existing regulatory framework you know insisting that our existing regulatory framework doesn't need any adjustments at all when Congress told us we're giving you exemptive Authority we're giving you the ability to make adjustments and so we need to do that and and people need to understand what is it we're allowed to do and what structure do we have to adopt in order to do that and you see it over and over again that we're just making these statements that no you have to fit into the existing model we saw that with the definition of exchange release that that came out recently you know we're not acknowledging the fact that the technology offers some new qualities some of which make it harder to regulate some of which make it unnecessary to regulate so let's think about each of these on its own and and and stop just trying to do everything through enforcement or through we need to have conversations that involve all of the potential competitors and we want to make sure that we're not designing a regime that works only for one company we want it to work for many so that we can have lots of competition so in a moment we're going to talk more about the communication protocol definition but first a quick word from the sponsors who make

can enter a code Unchained in onboarding for a free two-month trial and get started today to see your money in a whole new way back to my conversation with commissioner purse so as you mentioned there's also this proposed proposed rulemaking on the definition of an exchange and some lawyers are viewing the current version as an effective ban on public blockchains in the U.S because for instance it would require all validators to form a group and come in and register as either a national security exchanges or ats's which stands for alternative trading systems as an example there's 773 000 validators on ethereum alone and so forcing them to become an organization forces them to become centralized so what's your response to this notion that this change in rule making could effectively ban public blockchains in the US or for blockchains themselves to become more centralized one thing is that it may that that release in which we we asked for more comments so we had put out an initial rule proposal and this was an additional request for comment with a lot more detail about how it might apply in the space whereas the first release didn't talk about defy or crypto at all this one was all about it and I think if you read it there's statements made about the current state of the world even before that proposal goes into effect so I think people need to look at that release very closely but I don't see how people are better off if they come to you with a technology that says we want to do away with intermediaries so that people can interact directly with one another or more accurately interact with code so your response to that is to say find an intermediary because we want to be able to regulate it or your response is shut down or your responses get out of the United States I don't understand how that benefits the American people I mean I'm looking forward to reading the comments I think the comment period might have just closed or maybe it's today I don't know but it's it's closing soon if it hasn't already and a couple comments had come in when I last looked at the file um but I but I'm looking forward to reading what people have to say and maybe there's something I'm missing about how how people think that the technology can work with with the regulation but I don't think it's a good solution to say find an intermediary or close down on Tuesday the SEC released emails around Bill hinman's 2018 speech and he's the former director of Corporation Finance in which he said leaving aside the manner in which ether whistled that it is presently not a security and looking over the emails it looks like at least 19 people weighed in on the phrasing of his speech including the office of the general counsel wouldn't that suggest that hinman's speech saying ether was not a security not only reflected his personal remarks but that of the agency here's one important thing to understand about regulatory agencies that a lot of people don't think about until they're actually either working in a regulatory agency or working with a regulatory Agency on the outside as you know a lawyer who interacts with the regulatory agency you know you've got a lot of rules the SEC has a lot of rules about a lot of different things and when we as a commission I'm one of five and we make the decisions in terms of updating rules or new rules or bringing enforcement actions but there are a lot of interpretive questions that come up there are a lot of questions about I'm trying to do X and can I do this under the rules if you required every time someone would have to go to the commission itself to get an answer people would never get answers out of the SEC so there has been a tradition of Staff being able to provide for example no action relief or staff being able to go to a conference and make a statement and talk about how they're thinking about a rule they're doing it in their capacity as you know on the staff but they're they're explaining how they're thinking about things if we really want to shut all that down people will never be able to get answers from from their regulator and those are answers that people really need to proceed forward no one as I started out this conversation I can't speak on behalf of the commission I can only tell you what I think as a commissioner no one else can do that either but I think you really wouldn't want to have a situation where the only time the agency spoke was when it adopted or proposed or adopted a rule or brought in enforcement action okay but I mean it does seem then that it is true that in a way the speeches are another way for the agency to make its views known and then we could extrapolate that to what happened with Bill him in speech let me tell you though that if if I go on the website and look at a speech that chair Gensler gave but that's not speaking for me he might have one view I might have another view so and frankly if you know I I had often take issue with rulemakings and and enforcement actions I sometimes issued dissent on enforcement actions so the fact that someone on the staff has said something doesn't mean that I or the rest of the commission agree with that and so I think that it is really important for people to understand that and every agency is different we're unusual and that we're a five-member commission so there are five of us who are decision makers but even in a in a in an agency and look I'm not an administrative lawyer so you probably should talk to one of them to get to get more detail on these kinds of things but even in a in a single director agency you have staff and you have people who need to call up the staff to say hey how are you thinking about this staff um and the staff can provide their answer now if you look at no action letters what they say is the staff will not recommend that the commission take an enforcement action if you follow these conditions doesn't say the commission won't it just yeah it's a pretty good it's a pretty good uh guide for you because you know it's the commission looks to the staff because they're experts for guidance but it doesn't mean that the commission has to do what the staff says would you say that the SEC has changed its stance from chair Jay Clayton to chair Gensler regarding crypto and if so is that inconsistency in its approach a typical characteristic of regulation in the U.S across like you know in any agency or is the sec's lack of consistency atypical for a government agency and maybe even problematic the goal of having a five-member commission which is politically balanced is that you have more consistency over time so that you don't have rules that change That Swing dramatically right you have rules that are more consistent over time but that doesn't mean that when a new chairman comes in the new chairman doesn't bring his own thoughts about things and we've seen with this commission that and this is outside the crypto space but there were rules that we had adopted under the prior chairman that have gotten reversed under this one so there certainly can be change over time but you also have to look at change in in the environment in which we're regulating and everyone knows that 2022 for example was not a great year for crypto a lot of things happened and I think it it affects the way all of us think about crypto so I can't speak for chair gansler what whether his views align with with chair Clayton all I can say is that I've been at the agency for over five years and it's very frustrating to me that in that time we haven't done something more productive has the year of 2022 when crypto changed the way that you view crypto given your history as crypto mom and being viewed as more of a proponent of the industry than other SEC Commissioners I mean I wouldn't describe myself as a proponent of the industry I'm a proponent of people's ability to make decisions for themselves to try things even if those things fail but I don't think that people in crypto should delude themselves about when you have centralized entities you're gonna you know don't think that just because they have crypto on the front door you're not going to experience the same kind of problems you would experience with other kinds of centralized entities and I think people in the industry could be doing a lot better job of looking at 2022 and there are people doing this in the industry but I think people should really be looking at this and saying what can we do even without a regulatory framework we don't need Regulators to tell us to be more careful we don't need Regulators to tell us to put in some of these protections and I think it's it's good when the industry kind of steps up and says all right we're going to recognize that centralized entities have these problems and we're going to take steps to protect that and we're really going to think about where does decentralization make sense if we decide that's I'm not saying the industry makes a decision as a whole right but if people decide that they want something to be centralized that they think it's it makes sense for centralization to remain well put in protections around it so has it changed the way I think about crypto no I mean I think it's been a reminder to me as well as to everyone else that you know the same kinds of problems show up in lots of different ways and and in lots of different areas but it it has has I think convinced me even more that as Regulators when we fall down on the job of not putting in a regulatory framework that makes sense it is so much harder to distinguish the good actors from The Bad actors and we actually undermine protection of American people by making it so hard for people to figure out how can I set up a business do it legitimately and not spend all my time thinking about regulation I want people to think about what it is they're trying to build and I want the regulatory framework to be clear enough so that they know okay here's what I have to do to be in compliance and I'm gonna do that and then I'm going to spend the rest of my time actually thinking about what it is I'm trying to build I think we've we've probably changed the way the whole industry has developed in the United States because everyone is is thinking all the time of well I don't want it to be considered a security so I'm going to design it this way instead and I don't think that's helpful to anyone you know I have to say that your remarks remind me a lot of a recent interview I saw of um Brian Armstrong the CEO coinbase being interviewed by The Wall Street Journal and it almost feels like the sentiments that he was saying are being echoed by you and I don't have a question there I know you probably don't want to speak about um specific cases but I I can't help be struck by the similarities I I don't want to address that specifically except to say that I'm someone who comes to regulation with a view that the American people should be free to do their own thing and make their own decisions there are times when Regulators have to step in we have a regulatory framework which I have an obligation to uphold because Congress gave it to us and told us to do it but we also should not be in a world where the government is making merit-based decisions about what people can and cannot do and that's that's where I feel that that we're in a world where we're using regulatory ambiguity to prevent people from doing things that they they want to do and and I don't see why I should step in ahead of that as a regulator I need a reason to step in we're just not approaching this in a way that I that I think is the best and I I'm hoping that we will wake up tomorrow keep saying this I keep hoping it that we'll wake up tomorrow and we'll say all right let's think about how we can really do this in a way that's efficient effective gets to the problems that we've all seen crop up but also allows people to try things and to fail you know it's not up to me to decide whether crypto is going to change the world or not it's up to me just to set up a framework within which people who think it will change the world can go try their thing and do it in the United States not have to run to some other country to do it because frankly people in the U.S will be better protected if the Innovation is happening in the U.S last quick question um there's a bill that's been introduced in Congress to Ask Gary genser from his position as chair however and whenever he leaves how committed is the staff to applying or enforcing the stance that everything in crypto besides Bitcoin is a security we at the SEC have have a very hard-working dedicated staff I know that a lot of people in crypto are very frustrated with the SEC but we have we have a great staff staff is Duty bound to respond to the decisions made by me and my fellow Commissioners and so to the extent that people have complaints about the SEC and then many of them do direct them at me but that is the appropriate place to direct them it's at the commission itself so the way the commission goes will depend on who's running the commission all right well thank you so much for coming on Unchained thanks Laura it's been a pleasure don't forget next up is Weekly News recap stick around for this week

the document suggests that Hinman planned a conversation with ethereum co-founder vitalik buterin to better comprehend the workings of the ethereum foundation a point that further fuels Ripple's push

at cinemaine ventures has speculated about promethium strategies highlighting that the company's website features tokens that were named as Securities in the SEC lawsuits against financing coinbase
