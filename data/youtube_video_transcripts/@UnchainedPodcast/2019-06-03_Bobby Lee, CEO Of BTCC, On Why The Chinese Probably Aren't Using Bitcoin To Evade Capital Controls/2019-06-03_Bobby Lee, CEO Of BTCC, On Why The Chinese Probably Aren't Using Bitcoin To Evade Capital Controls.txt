of BTCC one of the most popular Chinese cryptocurrency exchanges prior to that Bobbie was an engineer at Yahoo and vice president of technology at Walmart in China he is also the brother of Charlie Lee the creator of litecoin and for the record Bobbie and I go way back because we were in the same freshman dorm together at Stanford welcome Bobby hi Laura thank you for having me let's start with the basics what products and services does BTCC offer yea BTCC we are a would I consider a full spectrum a Bitcoin company we started as a BTC China in early 2011 and as the very first Bitcoin exchange in China and now we have the honor being the longest-running exchange in the whole world we've been running for for close to six years now so besides offering exchange we also started offering wireless services at the end of 2013 and we got into the mining pool business in 2014 and then we also we launched a physical Bitcoin business last year in 2016 so we've done over of things in the cryptocurrency space mostly focused on Bitcoin and so what does that even mean physical Bitcoin a physical bitcoin is it's our BTC cement business basically it's the idea of selling these tokens we the coins that we made out of titanium and they contain the actual private key of a Bitcoin account so as you know each Bitcoin account is actually just protected by the private key and the address is just derived from the public key of the private key so we embed the private key beneath a tamper evident hologram holographic sticker we stick that on the backside of a titanium coin and that's the thing we sell it's essentially a hardware wallet it's a one-time use harder wallet where people can put funds in the Bitcoin and then when they want to redeem it they would peel the sticker and then just import the private key into a Bitcoin wallet of their choice to move the bitcoins over to another address so these are very popular Bitcoin collectables that we've been selling since last year Oh interesting who's buying them a lot of collectors are we we have a whole range of of coins everything the the first ones we issued were the one bitcoins made of titanium we went into larger denominations with a five Bitcoin and eventually the biggest ones we sell are the blocks the full Bitcoin blocks the one unique thing about BTC cement is that all the bitcoins in these collectibles are coming straight from our mining pool meaning they're brand-new transactions these are Bitcoin rewards from each block each each Bitcoin block you know how we have the 12 and a half new bitcoins issued in each block reward today it started with 50 bitcoins you know eight years ago and then after the first block having went to 25 and then last summer via the second block having now there's 12 and a half a new bitcoins issued in every block reward so we sell these blocks that contain the full block reward plus the transaction fees that's really interesting for it physical memento I guess of something that's created out of software and I just wanted to clarify for listeners who maybe weren't aware of you know this thing about mining in the block reward you know what Bobby was referring to is that the software rewards the miners who essentially kind of like secure the transactions on the network by paying them in Bitcoin and when the software first launched it was releasing 50 Bitcoin to a miner for every block of transactions that they would process and every roughly every four years or so that the amount of that coin gets halved so it went to 25 and then now is down to 12.5 we have something very new and exciting I'd like to tell you about Laura is a new wallet called mobi we launched mobi this year mobi mo bi the website is mobile me mo bi MB this is a new revolutionary hosted Bitcoin wallet that is Global Payments it natively supports all the currencies in the world so in there you can hold the coin and also trade it and exchange it to US dollars euros Hong Kong dollars roaming be whatever currencies you want in the world and even gold and silver so it's a multi currency wallet and best of all it's a mobile first application that uses mobile numbers that means that you could receive and send money to anyone in the world with a smartphone iOS and Android and all you need is a mobile phone number so for people even don't have mobi now anyone in the world can have a Bitcoin digital currency account and that's what the mobi vision is we aim to be the first sort of bank ever to get a billion customers we want to have a billion people in the world to have mobile wallets and the idea is that we can all have cryptocurrencies in a pocket we it's a global world we can we can move money to anyone we want in any currency we want so please give it a try mobi dummy and what markets are your users in generally so it's it's a huge it's really even though we as a company BTCC started China I see ourselves as a global company my vision for the company is that everyone will use Bitcoin so we aim to provide the whole world so our video our vision is that everyone would use Bitcoin our mission statement for BTCC is to provide the whole world with the most convenient and trustworthy digital currency services and we truly think mobi is the next evolution of BTCC to help establish that so mobi for the first time is in to truly international global product rollout from from BTCC it's no longer a China only thing you could say that our exchange in mining pool business where Chinese businesses but mobi is truly a global global play and we have it in over 15 languages on the app store so mobi today on you can download from the Apple app is apps drawer it comes in 15 different languages it's got huge potential I think this might be the killer app for Bitcoin and we think it's the killer for Bitcoin we think was was hiding in plain sight which is to use Bitcoin as money think about that no one has truly been able used Bitcoin as money what you're doing with Mobe isn't that different from what circle has been doing well I beg to differ I think circle first of all they explicitly pulled out a Bitcoin so so I thought that using it on the back end but how many currencies do they support I mean what mark you do they use you know yeah you don't go by the coin there but yeah so we we explicitly support Bitcoin Bitcoin and Bitcoin out you can even redeem your mint coins through Mobius scan the QR codes or type in the private keys and once you have the Bitcoin it's basically Bitcoin is basically global currency that that's the point we're trying to make with Mobe is Bitcoin is global currency so we're not we're not trying to hide it and use it in the back end I think that's just a marketing speak right but for us Bitcoin is the real thing it's a first-class citizen it's the global reserve currency so you could charge up money in mobi by putting in Bitcoin by depositing bitcoins into the Bitcoin address as a QR code you could copy paste the address you can send it to mobi and you've also always at any point in time move your money on a movie okay and then but once your money is in mobi then be turned into any currency worldwide they could send money to other people so you could send Laura you can if you have relatives around the world you could send them money and you don't just send them Bitcoin you can send them money in their native currency or you can send in US dollars did you have to get banking partners in all these countries in order to do that no no it's in the end this is a cryptocurrency wallet so all the money in there is all hedged by our team so even though we promised you US dollars euros and so on in the end in there we store the money as Bitcoin and then so when I cash out how do I get that new cash out you would we would give you the equivalent bitcoins bits if you will one Bitcoin is a million bits so let's say let Laura I sent you one hundred US dollars so in your mobile wallet you would see a hundred dollars and all I have to do to send you hundred dollars is to to know your phone number and I can send you hundred dollars and you can download it and then we can't claim it and with that hundred dollars you want to cash out you would say one day you'll be integrated with coinbase or even without integration you can send it to coinbase so you can then send the amount of bitcoins in there to coinbase and then you sell it on coinbase and you'll get roughly 100 dollars oh I see yeah okay and because you know you have a hundred dollars worth of bitcoins you will no longer be rushed and eager to sell it on coin based you might just ski 200 dollars in Moby and then set spend it with your friends or other services without ever cashing out does that make sense right but it's being held in Bitcoin exactly tell them to coin so then the value goes up and down with Bitcoin no no it's for you a hundred dollars for you is always a hundred dollars regardless of barrel number down now if you want for it to go up and down with Bitcoin then you convert either somewhere all the hundred dollars to a Bitcoin and then it will go up and down with Bitcoin it IC or if you prefer euros or Japanese yen you can cover to all those other currencies okay well this sounds really interesting I guess we'll see how much it grows yeah so I actually also then just wanted to ask you a little bit more about the mining when you say that you offer that as a service you talked about it as a pool how is that set up yeah so Bitcoin mining is an integral part of this industry of our ecosystem mining is the concept of getting these of using computer power we call hashing power to contribute to the blockchain building the blockchain and verifying transactions and then in reward the Bitcoin network would would reward miners with newly issued Bitcoin for their for the services so this is looking going on for the whole eight plus years in the Bitcoin industry and what we offer is a mining pool a mining pool is a service where we ourselves BTCC our company we don't participate in the mining we don't have any hardware we don't invest any capital to do that but because we have a lot of customers who do do that we pull them together and the idea is that they can get better payout and better luck and more even distribution of their workload by joining a pool service how it works is that it turns out bitcoins are mined on average of of once every 10 minutes so a block comes out every ten minutes so six blocks per hour 144 blocks per day now you can only get rewarded if you actually find the block quote unquote find it and the way to find it is to calculate the right hash number the special hash number and people all over the world with mining machines are sort of guessing at these different numbers and once every ten minutes depending on the rate of difficulty someone in the world would guess the right hash number and by guessing the right hash man they would get the full block reward now imagine if you're just a single miner somewhere where there in China United States or in Europe your chance of getting it might be very slim you might not get it and once an hour and might not even get it once a day you might only on average get it once every five weeks but if that were the case you would get 12 and a half bitcoins every five weeks but that's a huge volatility in terms of in terms of income so what they do is these miners we joined a pool and then rather than getting the payout on actual you would actually get a fractional payout on a per day basis and that smooths out your income so that's service we offer and in return we so we we charge a small service fee for offering this mining pool service and we actually put these new bitcoins into these Bitcoin collectibles from BTCC mint so it's a win-win for everyone in the ecosystem and so for your pool what percent of the computing power on the Bitcoin network does that account for right now it's about eight percent seven to eight percent the the mining pool ecosystem has changed a lot over the years a few years ago was more centralized but this year in a good way in the last six 12 months that the the whole mining pool now ecosystem and market share has been very decentralized so it's a good it's a good thing overall for the for the Bitcoin ecosystem and why has that happened there are many players getting into the space so we hear about the mining is very decentralized there you know there talks about a lot of miners are in China that may be true but the reality is there are thousands and thousands of people mining you know with Tara hashes and peda hashes equipment spread out all over the world a lot of it could be China a lot of it is elsewhere in the world and this is what makes Bitcoin healthy because as you as we all know the virtue of Bitcoin is its decentralized global nature in that no single there's no single point of failure so that no single company no single individual can succumb to government pressure or any other pressure that can bring down the Bitcoin network as you mentioned you are running the longest-running exchange in the world so you have quite the history in Bitcoin how did you get started into all this yeah it's uh it's actually fit my brother as you mentioned earlier he's famous for creating litecoin so he tipped me off on Bitcoin in early 2011 at the time I was with Walmart I had my my role in China and with Walmart ecommerce I had a good job my brother told me about Bitcoin at first I was intrigued and again he heard it I think read about it from Slashdot or something the year before in 2010 so early 2011 about it and he was starting mining Bitcoin with his you know with a set up of GPU cards graphics cards and so I got my I sort of mining in the summer of 2011 as well by getting some graphics cards from from him from Charlie so I was my he was mining in California I was doing some Bitcoin mining in Shanghai that summer of 2011 I'd mind about 20 bitcoins in all the time didn't think much about it I remember setting up these machines these graphics cards of course it generate a lot of heat with all the power supplies and the fans and all that stuff so we heat up a whole room in that in the apartment so eventually I turned it off in the fall but that was a lot of fun we just you know poking around at the time it was it was Bitcoin it was a digital currency you know the implicate Bitcoin actually has not changed in the last few years at all it's still what it is in terms of the essence of it but truth be told at the time in 2011 66 years ago I didn't read I did not fully understanding fully comprehend the impact and the the fundamentals of Bitcoin which is why it took me a long time before I actually was willing to put my own money to buy a Bitcoin so I didn't I didn't actually touch Bitcoin into 2013 that's when I decided after I left Walmart I decided I wanted to get a new career in something and rather than go back to the traditional tech sector I thought that I could do a startup and in the back of my mind I've always thought Bitcoin was intriguing enough to do a start-up I promised myself in the summer 2011 if I ever were to do a startup it would be in Bitcoin and that's why by the end of 2012 early 2013 I thought hey this might be the chance let me come in and do something and that's when I got together with my two co-founders in China to to sort of take BTC China to a new level so we we agreed to cooperate I came in as CEO and co-founder and we raised venture money for BTC China so we were actually the first company in all of Asia to get VC funding so that was in the summer of 2013 and then and then the and then of course that whole year was a huge bull year for Bitcoin having seen the bull market in April of 2013 and then once again a huge bull market run in the fall of 2013 going up to eventually you know 1200 US dollars per Bitcoin yeah so let's let's talk about kind of those early days you know because here we are in 2017 for you know most of the last few years China has been kind of a main hub of activity in Bitcoin but what was it like back then in those early days you know were people hearing about it and you know who were the people involved yeah so in the 2011 days no those are way way early like it was just some software some thing we're doing on the internet like there was I didn't even bother talking to anyone else about it my wife was was asking me what's this why do you have this machine running I was just you know I'm just running some servers and stuff like that so didn't really talk too much about it it's only when I got serious about Bitcoin you know for my career that's when I started talking to other people about it so I distinctly remember in 2013 I was studying getting my MBA degree at CI BS here in Shanghai I remember in early 2013 I would ask my classmates and I would not even ask people largely in a huge auditorium like who has heard of Bitcoin and it would be no one there like no one person out there has ever ever heard of Bitcoin and that's when I thought this is very interesting because there's a huge opportunity it felt like they felt exactly like how the internet was you know when I was at Stanford with you Laura in early in the early 90s ninety 93 94 no one has heard of the Internet right only the academics only the really nerdy people had heard heard of the internet back then so I thought this is an opportunity of the lifetime is that the fundamentals were sound I being you know having having studied computer science myself I understand cryptography I understand the problem of double spending and I and I intuitively understood the concept of the fact that this is a huge breakthrough for Bitcoin having solved the double status that the double spending problem for digital currencies spiritual currencies online because digit information is so easily copied how can you have a currency where things are so easily copied well the solution was to have a global block Chane and have the blockchain keep track of the accounts movement of bitcoins back and forth and then having proof of work as a way to to guarantee the the blockchain the the longest blockchain so all these things coming together is a tour de force it's really really innovative like no individually every single component of Bitcoin has been has been done you know been there done that but collectively putting these two pieces together to form a new concept of digital currency online that was a huge huge invention a huge innovation that I likened to the invention of electricity you know and all in the mention of computers so in 2013 were other people in China kind of hearing about it or was it just really under the radar it was way under the radar so I started giving talks and talking to people about it I remember we had a Stanford Alumni Club gathering and I I dedicated a whole session to talk about Bitcoin that was in I think May of 2013 so you know slowly slowly that's that that was a breakout year for Bitcoin in China and worldwide that's when the media started covering it about what is Bitcoin you know what why is this even why are we even talking about it you know the idea of that old there's a new digital currency a new cryptocurrency you know people were still calling a virtual currency back then today we know that the term virtual currency is a misuse of that name because bitcoin is much more of a digital currency or digital cryptocurrency cryptographic currency unlike the virtual currencies from the 90s and 2000's from the early days of a internet and so when Bitcoin became kind of won't when it broke into popular consciousness here in the u.s. that was the same thing that happened in China there is that also the same time when suddenly you know the vast majority of trading in Bitcoin was occurring in China yeah 2013 was also the year for the for the breakout in trading for Bitcoin so we had we had always been the the the very first and largest exchange in China and Bitcoin trading was was just in the power let me try to think a few of a few thousand bitcoins a day and remember Bitcoin prices were much much lower back than two so that was in the summer and then we introduced zero fee trading in the fall and that's when the the volume started come up big time so it was a gutsy move the idea was to spur trading actually the idea was to spur trading was to sort of borrow from the internet model in the early days of giving out free email accounts and you know free news you know sort of the Yahoo days the idea was to spur trading it had implication on a revenue model but I thought it might be a good thing to to actually give this thing a big injection and and I think it worked the most for the most part because we introduced the OFI trading in late September right before the October holidays and then by October we saw training volcano and up and you know I can't say if it's causation or correlation but certainly that's also when the prices started coming up from about if I recall correctly it's about $150 u.s. going up to 200 250 300 and then so that was a like a three month bull run from October all the way through through December went up to eventually to twelve hundred US dollars and as we know Chinese people are always looking for investment opportunities so that was a fun crazy year when the Chinese people got interested got while they first got word of Bitcoin they they now in a so while there's this site online they now you could actually deposit money and trade these things called bitcoins and actually make money so a lot of day traders came out of that and it was very exciting to be part of that in 2013 and so at that time were you making money then on the conversion into and out of yuan and then the trades within Bitcoin were free yes we made money in other ways we charge withdrawal fees for CNY so we made up for that yeah that was a that was a very fun year and so you know we have these conceptions in the West about how there was just so much trading activity in China but was it just kind of like a really rabid nice group in China that was interested in it or was it like you know the vast majority of Chinese people were actually buying and trading Bitcoin or you know who was it attracting yeah so certainly it was not all of China that'd be very dishonest it was all of China I mean trying to have you know 1.3 billion people so it wasn't all of China now I would say it's slightly more than an ish so an ish you know whether you think it's 10 15 50 people it's probably in the hundreds and thousands in the hundreds up to a few thousand people so it's not it's not in the millions and tens of millions now certainly I would say that millions of people heard about Bitcoin but as we all know just because you hear about it doesn't mean that you're trading it right there's a huge there's always a huge factor how do you say it there's a huge drop-off rate so you hear about it and then and then the drop-off rate is like one tenth of people who hear about it actually understand it and the tens of people who understand it actually go decide to want to take action and then of that only a tenth of them actually do take action and end up being trading traders okay and but was there a particular profile of the type of person who you know absolutely absolutely the the profile we we saw were you know young men you know in there in the 20s and 30s in the 20s mostly these are the IT people and the people who are geeks and computer science people who had destroyed the powerfulness of Bitcoin and the in the implications and who also may have had access to some capital they they would buy and sell and buy Bitcoin to hold there was also narrative in the news about these these old retired ladies what we call what they call tamo in china it's a term where they are as a class of people these mothers and grandmothers who are retired they have a lot of savings and they go out and making make savvy investments and either gold real estate and now they caught on to Bitcoin but that was more of a narrative that there's a huge Tama following who are investing Bitcoin but I think that was a more fluff than than reality there might be in a few Dhamma but certainly not not an army of them doing Bitcoin investments and then another thing that you often heard or maybe it's still the case is that a lot of Chinese people were interested in Bitcoin because it enabled them to evade the capital controls that limited how much money people could send out of the country was that something that you saw yeah it's the capital controls issues is complicated it's always been a topic people always always come and ask me about it oh how do I use Bitcoin TV camera controls excuse me the the unfortunately I don't think I I also have not seen that happen at any scale you know people may buy bitcoins on $100 $1000 to to move around in the world but we definitely have not seen any sort of evading capital controls in any large means and he's anything in excess of a hundred thousand dollars a million dollars and the reason is two things one is Bitcoin is still very very hard even to this day in 2017 Bitcoin is still very hard you know how to get an account set up an exchange where are these exchanges around the world which ones are trustworthy you know how do you deposit money how do you wire money over there how long does it take and how do you buy the bitcoins and how do you move the bitcoins out how do you store the bitcoins how do you transfer it to another exchange abroad how to open an account over there and so on and so forth so it's a huge huge hassle from the vast majority the people so I would say only the elite subset in the Bitcoin industry actually know how to do that and buy sell Bitcoin across multiple exchanges worldwide even myself I don't I have an account on BTC C but I don't have any other accounts at any other exchanges that's just a reality so even I don't have the ability to do that so the other reality is that if you look at China China definitely has a cap of control policy the roaming B is not a freely exchange currency and part of that I think is China has built up a huge reserva foreign currencies you know I brought approximately three trillion dollars that's a little bit less than that now but in any case China is hugely concerned over the last year about this outflow of money and so when we when people in China go change money from US dollars to Chinese currency or from Chinese renminbi to u.s. dollars at a local bank when they do that a local bank it actually affects the currency reserves because the foreign currencies that are provided by the bank or are basically held and controlled by the central bank who hold us at hold the foreign reserves so for Bitcoin it turns out there is no capital flight for Bitcoin because everything is neutral and the the lesson here is that when people buy even a lot let's say they buy 1 million RMB worth a Bitcoin in China the reality is they're buying it from someone who's selling the Bitcoin so first of all the buyers money the local running B would go into the account and the hands of the sellers so the rebbe doesn't leave the country so the big coin is always in the cloud these are bitcoins don't have a geographic location attached to them right as we all know bitcoins or held in Bitcoin accounts become accounts are protected by the private keys so they're just all registered in the blockchain which is global there's no Chinese marching versus you know international Washington versus American blockchain so it's just one Bitcoin blockchain so if you think about that way whenever there's a large Bitcoin transaction buying and selling the money stays in the same country it's just changing hands between one person to another person in the same currency in the same banking system and the bitcoins stay in the blockchain it's just changing ownership and title of it right but then what if the person exchanges their yuan for Bitcoin and then they open an account on coin base and then they cash out in u.s. dollars and you know think that then obviously it's true you absolutely right that they could do that but my point is that when they do that someone else is on the other side of the train it would be similar to someone else buying the bitcoins on coin base and then selling it on BTC see in China you see it's net neutral does that make sense I'm not arguing no one's doing it I'm arguing it's all net neutral yeah for the individual who's doing it you know they are able to have their holdings in you know what is starts out as you on they're eventually able to convert those into some other currencies so that's what trade is all about if you think if you come back to the idea of trade global trade that's a trade is all about cross-border trade so Bitcoin does engage in cross-border trade but doesn't it's not like a massive export event or massive important event it's all neutral it's all trade neutral that's a great thought let's just pause things right here to bring an important word from our sponsor on-ramp the best companies in the world obsess about

your organization's strategic ly poised for the future you can learn more and see examples of their work at think on-ramp com I'm speaking with Bobby Lee CEO of Chinese crypto currency exchange BTCC so one thing that's been in the news a lot in terms of well for Bitcoin people has been some of the Chinese government's actions around the industry particularly this year so can you just describe for me how the Chinese government's attitude toward Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies has changed you know what was it when you found it BTCC and then how has it evolved since then yeah so the what we know in the industry is that Bitcoin is actually truly a sort of monetary financial instrument the reason is because it has a properties of money it has a properties of a store of value however for the first time in history we have a monetary money instrument that is not at issued and controlled by government even though gold is decentralized but eventually governments co-opted it and used it as a base of money so coining coinage and minting gold coins back you know for the first centuries right so where today bitcoin is still untouched by government in the sense that no government authorities have actually recognized the coin as money or used sorry yeah no one has recognized used Bitcoin as money and no one so far expressed willing willingness to do so so Bitcoin stands unique in that position so this also says that central banks around the world are still refusing to acknowledge that bitcoin is money or bitcoin is at the same level as what we call the fiat currencies and in terms of China as with many other countries you know in the early days in 2011 2013 it wasn't even on the radar it's just this brand-new sort of geek thing on the internet you know pretending to be money when it has no legal status so that was the that was the situation up through early 2013 and by the end of 2013 the PBOC got attention of Bitcoin and that's when the first sort of regulatory Inklings came out and in December essentially they stated that bitcoin is actually a virtual good and thus so people are allowed to own it people are allowed to trade it you know web sites are allowed to offer exchange services such as BTC China BTCC however because it's only a virtual good and not actually a monetary instrument all existing financial institutions such as banks third party payment companies insurance companies and so on they are not allowed to touch Bitcoin so that was the sort of edict ruling issued in December 5th of 2013 so so for the last four years for the last the afternoon f four years we've been running under that guideline so unfortunately the the PBOC still has not issued any new update to that ruling since December 2013 okay but earlier this year there were certain steps that they took I guess regulators you know talked to several the exchanges about I think it was maybe K by caml type things which are no your customer anti-money laundering processes and maybe the fact that you guys were doing No Fee trading what were some of the talks that you had with them yeah I can't go into the details those are all privileged conversations but it's true that earlier this year in January the PBOC Central Bank they had officials come visit us and many other exchanges there started to be a renewed interest in the topic of Bitcoin and potentially regulating Bitcoin so we're concerned that the main concern was about about the financial risks of trading in Bitcoin you know people you know the if prices go up people can make money or people can lose money right if price to come down so there's a lot of concern there there's also concern for for money laundering so I want to make sure all the exchanges put in the right best practices to prevent money laundering so a lot of anti money laundering rules to make sure those are followed as well as know your customer the idea is to make sure the customers are legitimate and trading on their own their own names and there's not not to have fraudulent activities or any sort of other imposters and stuff like that so these are real legitimate issues that the banking system has faced over over its many decades of operating and likewise Bitcoin exchanges need to improve these areas so we've been working closely with the central bank to try to essentially elevate our service offering to the level that we need to given the importance of Bitcoin and what are some of the changes that BTC C has instituted as well as you know some of the other bigger exchanges yeah so earlier this year in 2017 we we stopped offering margin training services we also eliminated the zero fees the zero Trading Commission's we reinstate trading commission on all buy sell the idea was to sort of calm down the market a little bit at the it was a little bit overheated maybe at the end of last year so these removes that we took voluntarily to try to appease appease the situation a little bit and how have Chinese crypto traders and investors how have they changed their behaviors since then well it's very it's very prominent change which is a trait evolves that come down a lot I mean essentially we had a lot of inflated volumes from zero free trading and that all went away a lot of wash trading then all went away so now I would say the the market is quite subdued the training market the exchange trading market now what's interesting is is we now there's developed into two markets there's the on exchange market in China and then separately there's the OTC market so the prices I've actually diverged so that's an interesting phenomenon so the on exchange market the become price is lower and then the OTC market which is the so-called off exchange over-the-counter market where people buy sell themselves on the street without going through a third party exchange that price is actually much higher so there's some why is that it's it's a market dynamics I would say the on exchange market you know has requirements mandated by the PBOC including the KYC you know all that stuff through there's more overhead so people are discounting there's a discount on the price due to the fear of burden if you will then there's some extra burden extra inconvenience maybe extra concerns whereas an OTC market it's just two individuals it's a peer-to-peer change right it's just you one person on a street corner you know selling bitcoins to another person walking up to him on the street corner and they can exchange in cash or whatever currency whatever they want it's just it's just consent amongst two adults right so that price apparently is much higher than the market price so that price actually more closer to the US dollar price in Bitcoin as well so the more the more the so-called global international price so something that I find interesting about this conversation is that I I don't remember was it a year ago or I it was a year ago I did a story where I interviewed you about some of the cultural differences between how Chinese investors approached Bitcoin versus how you see people approaching it here and in the u.s. can you describe you know what those differences are in kind of like what they were historically versus what they are now like do you think maybe the differences are less you know stark now I don't exactly recall what I told you specifically but I'll say this in in Bitcoin is a global thing and the thing itself Bitcoin itself is is um it's a big invention Bitcoin okay because it's a big invention it's due to its complexities let's put it that way bitcoin is a lot of things in it it's got a lot of things a lot of factors in it that's why it's so complex that's why such a small portion of the world actually know about Bitcoin and an understand Bitcoin it's very very complicated and because it's global we have countries all over the world all these cultures and people all over the world it turns out different people see Bitcoin differently meaning that some cultures value Bitcoin for its store value other people value for it being digital some cultures value for being a payment system you know and so on so forth so how do you feel the Chinese view it as opposed to Westerners yeah so so Westerners may view it as a payment system but but Chinese people they truly see it as a monetary instrument as a store of value right we see it as a system where it has a 24/7 24 hours a day seven days a week sort of trading nothing in the world trades I mean except for I think only for x4 in the currency exchanges trades 24/7 so so Chinese people see it much more like forex and so what behaviors did they exhibit that are different from what you see Westerners exhibiting yeah so because the Chinese may see it as 4x and because China is unique in the world to have actually a capital control system on the running B they see Bitcoin as sort of event to escape the capital control system but the vent goes both ways right it's both to escape the money and also to info the money that's why that's why that's why there's huge potential that's why I always get asked the question is Bitcoin being used even capital controls right so because of that it's also a store of value so people in China just like the rest of the room we've seen depreciation of a monetary system in terms of purchasing power we've seen the loss of purchasing power in in our currencies we've seen a huge ramp up of money printing over the last eight years and that's why if you think about why is Bitcoin moderately successful today why is Bitcoin even a topic today it's precisely to mirror the failures and deficiencies of the government-issued monetary system which is the US dollar that the paper money right so I know it's sort of getting into a philosophical discussion but but the Chinese people see it that way they see it fundamentally that all Bitcoin is an escape it's it's it's sort of like the exit sign it's sort of like the thing that's you can you can use it to leave the existing system which has its problems so that's why it's been it's in person that way so in China people for example something practical practically no one uses a Bitcoin to pay for things in China it's net it's not even used as a payment system right and the other reason for is China actually has very mature payment systems like Ali pay and now we chat pay so China has very mature payment systems even though Visa MasterCard is not established in China but China has China UnionPay the the credit card standard here so one other one other thing that I think you know has been influenced a little bit by cultural issues between China and the West is that there's this stalemate that we've seen in Bitcoin over how best to scale the network and you know correct me if you disagree but the miners who are you know largely Chinese not all but largely and then the core developers who are largely Western I think they play the biggest role here in in this decision over how to grow the network do you think that there are cultural differences that are influencing you know this decision making process and making it difficult for them to get past this impasse well I don't want to pinpoint the cultural differences I think it's natural that when whenever there's a contentious issue that there are multiple sides and multiple factions I think just by definition anything that has multiple factions is contentious so for anything that's important enough inevitably you reach a point in time where there will be an issue that's important and to large populations take opposite viewpoints right this is just human nature it's nothing to do with culture it's nothing to do with language or none do with you know East versus West it could be North versus South it could be you know whatever and and it's happened in Bitcoin and it in many ways it's a great thing right because Bitcoin has grown up to be large enough to have an issue that's contentious so I I see the positive aspects of it and now the question is what's what's gonna happen well the the the other thing was best thing about Bitcoin is no one explicitly has power there's no single person no single group organizationally that explicitly has power so the so-called checks and balances the concept of checks and balances are inherently built into the Bitcoin system so like you said there the miners this developers there's exchange operators and the users there are multiple multiple stakeholders and factions if you will and no one single group of people have ultimate power over Bitcoin and if there's a stalemate there's a stalemate that means Bitcoin will change and that that's also the strength of it that bitcoin is not easily changeable another blockchain network that's generated a lot of interest in the West is a cerium but I believe that trading of its currency ether is pretty low in China what are Chinese attitudes towards ethereum I can't speak for all of China in terms attitude towards aetherium back in time my personal views is that it's this power loss a situation it's basically the power loss situation I don't know the exact former terminologies basically bitcoin is hard enough okay let me just put it out there bitcoin is hard enough it's complicated enough it's really esoteric already when we talk about the real world the common world the common society okay bitcoin is just waste esoteric so what I've dedicated my life over the last few years is to promote and advocate for Bitcoin it's it's a tough enough job and it turns out aetherium is just one of many other cryptocurrencies that came after Bitcoin and you like we talked about there was like coin this doggie coin you know there's a theory of there's a whole bunch Ripple and a whole bunch of other is you know hundreds literally hundreds of other these cryptocurrencies that are that came after Bitcoin and some of them are popular like you theory em you know there's a few more that are quite popular but for me it's like I want to spend time and get Bitcoin make Bitcoin successful first it's only when Bitcoin is mainstream that the other coins have a chance that's my perspective so this could also explain why for Chinese people the majority of the interests and attention so far has been on Bitcoin and there are you know attention and trades in these other coins and but but the reality is that there's a lot of other pump-and-dump you know multi-level marketing schemes on these other all coins so it gives the all the it gives a whole all coin category a bad reputation you're a board member of the Bitcoin foundation and it's has some symbols over the years in 2015 it almost disbanded the money was mismanaged what has it been doing since then yeah Bitcoin foundation is interesting I joined I forgot I think was 2014 yeah as a board member it had an interesting start it was founded by the early people in Bitcoin and many of them why do you guys I don't wanna go and give in to the past but the point is that there has been some concerns from the public about the the early people in Bitcoin foundation so today we have a healthy Board of you know I think it was six or seven board members and it's a new group of people today we're still trying to be honest with trying to find the right bearing finder bearing in terms of how to contribute and help what we know is we as the Bitcoin foundation will focus on Bitcoin I think over the last year we see a lot of industry in society efforts have put more intention on blockchain there's a lot of hype around the word blockchain we have decided to stay true to the core and to promote Bitcoin Bitcoin the crypto currency itself Bitcoin the global decentralized digital currency so we're making an effort to do that and obviously whether it's funding where the support all of these some of these are challenges but in but in the end I think we have a good group of people who are behind it and we're gonna try to make a difference in this world especially in this challenging times with block size debates with the government regulatory stuff so it's never it's never a boring day in the Bitcoin space so speaking of it never being a boring day what are some developments that you expect to see in cryptocurrency this this year this year I'm looking for more and more adoption and an understanding of Bitcoin Bitcoin reached 20 billion dollars in circulation value what they call market cap this year I think it's a huge accomplishment I think the good thing is it's a one-way street and I truly think that meaning that the adoption the understanding of Bitcoin is a one-way street meaning once you know something you cannot never unknow it so every day that goes on every day with more newspaper and media coverage with more podcasts spreading out more and more people are learning about the concept of a digital decentralized cryptocurrency and that's what bitcoin is and when more people learn about it it's not they won't immediately buy into it right obviously it takes some time to to to digest it for me it took two years it took a good two years for me to digest and understand Bitcoin for me to dip my toes into it in any meaningful way so for many people if it's not two years six months or three months so with a larger and larger population Bitcoin and digital currencies will become mainstream it might take a generation you know certainly the Millennials for them you know Bitcoin digital currencies is natural it's completely natural that you just don't understand why gold is valuable for them digital currencies will be a complete natural thing so for that I'm very very excited you know you know we are on a multi-decade mission right Bitcoin is gonna keep being issued for the next hundred and thirty years to reach the twenty-one million target amount so we're only at sixteen million it's going up pretty fast but it's gonna slow down very fast as well so today we're seeing only one thousand eight hundred bitcoins being issued per day that's a very very small amount that's roughly a little bit over two million dollars in new access Bitcoin capacity it's not gonna has a Bitcoin value added to the world so that mean the world today is handling over six seven hundred million dollars of net new info that's a very small amount for a huge huge concept of a decentralized digital currency you know the equivalent amount of gold is in the in the billions right so for that I'm I'm excited for the continued increasing awareness over the over the coming year and with awareness comes price appreciation that's I think it's a direct correlation great well thanks so much for coming on the show how can our listeners find out more about you and BTCC so come to our website BTCC com so thanks
