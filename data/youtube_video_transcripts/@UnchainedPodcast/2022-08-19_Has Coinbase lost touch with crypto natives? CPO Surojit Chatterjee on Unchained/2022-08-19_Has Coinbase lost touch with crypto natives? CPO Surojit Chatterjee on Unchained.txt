one other area that i wanted to ask about which was also perceived as a miss by coinbase was the d gen trilogy when you released part one of it people were responding things like the sec should be investigating this for illegally inducing cringe and you know nick tomino also mentioned this in his tweet there's a perception that coinbase has lost its touch with the crypto native part of the community or frankly doesn't even really have people like that on its staff anymore whereas obviously in its earlier years it was more kind of on the cutting edge so how do you get that back or you know if even if you're going to say to me you haven't lost it then how do you change that perception again i'll say we try lots of different things so this is something our marketing team tried some things are more successful than others you know when we tried our super bowl ad for example i i think djs loved it uh crypto forward folks really loved it and it was a unique concept this was probably didn't hit the mark quite for many some people uh we understand that we take the feedback and we'll go and try other things but i think it's it's not true that we don't have crypto forward folks in the uh on coinbase today i think if you look at the innovation we are churning out it would not be possible without crypto forward folks you know we are the first company i just talked about building this very unique mpc based wallet right a semi-custodial wallet you probably i don't know if you follow pete kim or others uh you know he has talked about it he is one of the engineers i respect a lot there are many other people like that you know we are building um this uh you know interoperability bridges between multiple blockchains that would not be possible without people on knowing crypto very deeply and being embedded into the ecosystem if you enjoyed this clip watch the full episode available now on unchained
