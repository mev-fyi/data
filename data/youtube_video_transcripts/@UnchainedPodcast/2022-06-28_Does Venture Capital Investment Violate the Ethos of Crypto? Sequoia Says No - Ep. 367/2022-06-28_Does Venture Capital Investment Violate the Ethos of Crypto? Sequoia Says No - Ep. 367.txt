yields across 12 blockchains got crypto choose beefy today's guests are sean mcguire and michelle bailey partners at sequoia capital welcome shawn and michelle thanks for having us thank you so much it's great to be here laura in february sequoia announced that it had launched a crypto focused fund of 500 million or 600 million dollars i guess you can update me on what the final amount was at the time of its launch you talked about the fund being for your 20-year view on crypto so i was curious to hear you elaborate on what that view is what you think the world will look like when crypto in terms of both the technology and adoption reaches maturity it's a very interesting time in crypto obviously as you know laura and so the you know separate from the fun the question we keep getting asked most recently is has our conviction change and the answer of course is no we crypto's been through many cycles and we never expected the next 20 years to be a straight up into the right ride so nothing about our conviction has changed and the thesis is still the same which is that we think that crypto created both a fundamentally new asset class and a new computing platform and there will be businesses that emerge to both serve those assets you know a lot of the financial businesses centralized and decentralized as well as new applications that are you know best built on a decentralized platform and so we've been continuing to invest in all layers of that stack from core layer ones layer twos infrastructure and applications and expect over the next 20 years to see a lot of things mature and a lot more that we couldn't even fathom you know to predict today what do you think our lives will look like 20 years from now how will they look different once we're using this technology and it's fully scaled et cetera first of all i think it's hard to say and and i do and i don't feel ashamed to say that i i think it's really hard to predict what crypto will be used for you know over the next 20 30 years similar to how it was very difficult to predict how the internet would be used in the 90s that said i personally believe that all money is going to be digital in 20 years like including i think governments like i think the dollar will probably become digital i think that the yuan will become digital you know and then i'll so i think there will be centralized digital currencies think and hope there will be decentralized digital currencies i think the decentralized currencies are going to rise in adoption by massive levels especially in developing parts of the world i think there's going to be fully autonomous businesses you know uni-swap is something that who knows what the end state of uniswap is any one example will be but the idea that you can launch some code and it just runs forever as a very high trading volume business that in theory like the first version or second version or v3 i don't need people to maintain it you just ship the code and it's out there like i just there's so many examples like that that i think give a glimmer to what the future might look like but it's hard to be overly prescriptive i totally agree with everything sean said and i think for something like the internet it's fundamentally an information revolution and so it's so hard to predict and i'm certain that i couldn't in the time have predicted what that would look like whether it was google or you know and then giving birth to mobile later and that i could order cabs on my phone and you know book a hotel anywhere right like i can't possibly fathom that at the time but the broader trend that billions more people will have access to billions more information than they would have before and the cost of transacting information of sharing it will dramatically lower i think is consistent in all those businesses and so we it's very hard to say exactly what form factor will take but i think crypto being both a financial and a competing revolution i think our sense is that over the next 20 years billions more people may have access to dramatically better financial products and you know dramatically lower costs of transactions and you know internet services today that look different in terms of their censorship and uh freedom on them and who runs them and it doesn't mean the old ones will go away but we'll have more choice i think that's the broad stroke that we believe in one thing that strikes me about sequoia is that it's certainly one of the most important and powerful venture capital firms but much of its success has come by investing in the old model of you know kind of the startup in the garage or whatever and it's very much like the centralized company you had to do some restructuring to be able to invest in a large amount of tokens probably becoming a registered investment advisor is one but in general what is kind of like the mental shift or what are some of the maybe uh traditional ways that you had done business that you had to shed in order to adapt to this new model of investing in this new world that's decentralized whether or not it's actually decentralized i guess we could discuss later but supposedly i hope we do discuss that later um i'll jump in you know laura on the one hand i totally agree with you and there's a lot that's different about crypto but on the other hand i actually think that crypto sometimes thinks it's more different than it actually is like there are so many similarities to crypto and traditional businesses like at the end of the day you need to hire engineers and product people to help like build the best product and you need to help motivate them and manage them and like it's just there's a lot of similarities to building a traditional software business and and building a crypto company and it's just it's genuinely not as different as people think you know sequoia has been around for 50 years transitioned from in the early days like the biggest wins were apple and atari and some other hardware companies and then you know in the late 80s early 90s the biggest wins were internet infrastructure companies you know cisco as an example you know oracle not as much core infrastructure but closer to that than to consumer you know application then like it can only miss the first wave of web one companies miss netscape and kind of the first browser companies by in the late 90s you know led the series in google yahoo ebay on and on in web 2 you know invest led the early rounds in youtube instagram etc so square already has a history of kind of like moving from silicon to internet infrastructure to web one to web two and you know backing some of those fintech companies along the way stripe square you know et cetera backing some of the best open source companies when that was a new trend like mongodb backing some really blue sky businesses like unity which a completely new business model okay i just was surprised when you said that investing in these decentralized uh projects actually isn't that different to me the whole way that you go about getting business the business model like there's just so many ways in which i think it is different so can you elaborate on that part yeah and so i was right what i was getting to which is like sequoia has this history of transitioning through all these chapters but there's a lot more continuity than you would think in there like because at the end of the day it's about human nature and understanding you know how to find the best people how to incentivize them to work as a team you know how to find customers across many different like what definitions of a customer whether it's open source whether it's whether it's consumers whether it's enterprises like in crypto it's basically the same thing and so anyways yes there are some fundamental differences such as like investing in tokens where sequoia was not legally structured in the right way you know where most venture capital funds have been you know subject to this thing called the venture capital exemption rule where you can have up to 20 of your fund in in things other than primary preferred shares and so that was one of the things that motivated us to become a registered investment advisor as you as you said so that we can hold more tokens but other than that i i really i would challenge that building crypto companies i don't think is as different as a lot of people in crypto think it is well so then i have to ask this follow-up because obviously so you know sequoia has invested in a certain startup such as like door dash or airbnb and you may have heard that there are some crypto entrepreneurs out there who've said things like oh there could be a decentralized airbnb or decentralized uber or slash doordash or whatever and they would be decentralized they'd have the token which were incentivizing all the different workers so just when you're thinking about how about some kind of product or service that could be offered on the internet how do you determine whether it makes more sense for it to be offered by a centralized entity or in a decentralized way or you know when you're looking to invest how do you think founders should be thinking about that this idea the idea of like giving away equity in the early days of a company to help incentivize users and adoption that idea has been around a long time using tokens to do it has primarily been a regulatory arbitrage because giving you know like equity to unqualified investors has been legal no no for the last 20 years um and so it's a little bit uncertain but like the primary difference is just returning to an old idea of let's give away the ownership of the early network to the users to help incentivize bootstrap in the early days of the network so there is kind of a difference in the very early days but at the end state it doesn't matter like you know airbnb hypothetically you had a decentralized airbnb and you gave away 50 of the equity as tokens to incentivize early users and early hosts and all that after you get to some level of scale you don't have you can't keep giving away another 50 of the network and so you have like at that point people are going to use whichever is the best product like whichever has the most hosts whichever has the most liquidity whichever has the best customer service etc and so i would just say to me the only difference is in the very early days of giving away ownership to help incentivize usage but at the end of the day you have to have a better product because people are going to leave and go to the next thing if your product is not better than the alternative and so and i think that's something that a lot of web3 companies have missed actually i agree i think we've seen this kind of like unfettered lust for decentralization and i think when you really dig into it running something decentralized is actually way less efficient it takes a lot more resources with compute and people a lot more coordination to ensure that's done well and so over time it's we kind of expect that to be almost a luxury something that you want to use for the most important things for something you know as important as potentially a stateless free you know store of value or a public information network that you don't want a certain government or certain you know company to be the only people that control and so it's sort of like in a way that the same questions humans have been asking about how to best organize even governments or people right it's like yeah you can do democracy you can have it be more decentralized that comes with a lot of cost a lot of cost of participation of constantly voting of all these things so you would only want to do that for the things that are probably the most important whereas something else where you just are optimizing for convenience or access or speed you might want a centralized business model you know and to give another example less about the access of decentralization but sort of along these lines for instance someone said oh is there going to be you know some of the web 3 startups like a threat to google well if you think about what google's doing or an ad business model right if if what you're solving for is getting billions of people access to information making that free and funding it with ads is a pretty wonderful way to do that it's very hard to do that by charging those people for access you won't get billions of people access the same information they can't afford it if what you want is something where you are not taking private information and you're not selling ads and you have more security and control you might have to pay for that but it might be a smaller group that can access that and so really it's just different choices and so we think it allows the spectrum and so it's not so much either or this blunt instrument of decentralization always at all costs it's what do we want to be decentralized what does that unlock for users when is that important or when is it really not important and i'm happy to just you know use something centralized that's much cheaper and more convenient potentially yeah that's that's really interesting so i you know your example of having a store of value that's decentralized was a strong one are there any other ones where it's obvious to you that that should be something that's just decentralized as opposed to centralized yeah i mean for me like identity so i i think that sean mcguire gmail.com like i wish i owned that it was fully decentralized crypt has already done that with i mean ethereum name service as an example where i have smc.ed and every time i log into new dap like that's my handle and people can they can send me money directly to it like i have a whole history associated to it i have credibility and trust associated with it that moves across any new application you know if i'm living in a place where my government says hey like turn off twitter to all users like i still have you know i still have access to my identity and the credibility it comes with so anyways i think to me it's like money and identity are the two that i think absolutely i want to be as decentralized as possible but to the spectrum comment you know if i'm spending five dollars to buy a coffee i'm okay if that transaction is centralized if it's my whole bank account balance i want that to be as decentralized as possible and so i just think there's a pretty similar with my identity like if it's if i'm doing some action that is very low value it's fine if it's if there's some centralization in there if it's an nft that mcdonald i get from mcdonald's like i don't and it's five dollars like i don't care if it's very centralized but for a crypto punk i don't want it to be decentralized as possible let's now talk about when you are looking to invest in some kind of crypto project a lot of times there is a centralized entity behind that protocol so there's the option of investing in the project's tokens or in equity of the centralized entity that's launching this decentralized project so for instance i know you invested in filecoin and so i'm sure you had the option of investing in filecoin tokens or in protocol labs which is the company behind filecoin how do you decide uh you know which to do or maybe you do both but in general like how do you think about this decision most of the time what we're solving for is maximal alignment with the founders and so most of the time we ask to be as aligned as possible if there's if they have equity in both the company as well as the token we would ask to match that we think that's usually really important crypto's littered with examples of those incentives not being aligned and it leading to rough outcomes and of course non-crypto just broader tech similar story and so we always try to push to be both shareholders in the equity and whatever share of tokens often in equal proportions and sometimes one can get diluted more depending on emissions for the community or users or whatever but that's usually our ongoing path and then in other times you know it really depends like tokens right now in crypto are painted with such a broad brush when in reality there are so many different things in my mind there are things that look a lot more like commodities that are the native tokens used to actually stabilize or secure a network like bitcoin or ethereum or whatever then you might have application tokens that relate a lot more some people are hoping to the success of an application on top of that then you have stuff that just looks like rewards points like it's basically airline miles like it has no relation to the business right but it just gets you like trading discounts or something else supermarket points or airline points and you've got other things you've got dog money you've got you know like whatever other other stuff you want so what we're talking about it really depends on the business and what they're building like if it's something like rewards points you know we may not care because those have no value to us because we're not a user who's going to be trading on it necessarily so we may just care about being equity shareholders in other situations we may really care especially for applications to be both and then for layer ones it's just the layer one right that is the that is where the value will accrue so it really ranges depending on what's being built and how do you deal generally with the attitude that parts of the crypto community have toward vcs i'm sure you're aware that there are certain people they have this kind of disparaging attitude toward what they call vc coins i'm sure you're even more well aware that there's i think even like a separate contingent that you know we'll call them web 3 vcs and say that they're kind of taking the lion's share of the gains and leaving retail with the drugs when you try to approach different projects like do you find that any of this can affect your interactions with them and then i guess it's like a two-part question because then the second part would be if you are going to invest in one of these via the tokens then how much do you think is kind of the right percentage for a decentralized project because obviously you know there is this sense that venture capital in a way almost goes against the general ethos of crypto two per question those are great questions um first of all i love the skepticism in crypto like it's a it's amazing we love how skeptical the community is and a lot of the skepticism is very well placed you know that said it oscillates very high like heavily based on the market conditions and so like three months ago a lot of founders thought that they were gods and like just absolutely hated vcs and like hated all vcs equally today like i think vcs are showing their true colors and so like you know some vcs are pulling term sheets or trying to renegotiate them some vcs are like very strongly standing behind their founders and projects that they work with and i'm actually literally in the last month have noticed a pretty big change in the way that founders react to vcs because they're already starting to there's a look like we're out of a bull market and so they're starting to see the true colors and i think that instead of using broad strokes to say that all vcs are bad basically find the vcs that are true believers in the long-term potential and like are gonna try to support the community even when it's down rather than just be there when it's up as a cash grab and so anyways just i think more nuance is needed and and i've been seeing it heavily in terms of the second part of the question you know and like jack dorsey who's made a lot of those comments who's a legendary sequoia founder who you know like we love and our partner ruloff works with him and thinks the world of him again like i think there's a huge amount of truth to what he said and i think it's really important to call out a lot of people in web 3 think that everything's perfectly decentralized and before moxie's post and jack's comments they weren't thinking enough about the centralized points of failure and so i think all of that is very legitimate but on the other hand as we were talking about earlier like there's a spectrum here and you know jack obviously has bitcoin part of why he loves it is bitcoin is as decentralized as anything you can find ethereum something that's interesting about it to me is like it started off not very decentralized in that it really relied on vitalik and the ethereum foundation and then there's the dao hack which had a hard fork and like it's taken six years where ethereum's become much more decentralized over time and to me is now like basically fully decentralized um and so i think it's it can these things can happen over time and even if you start in a somewhat centralized way over time you can become much much more decentralized and so i just i think you need to apply the spectrum here of like bitcoin's the most decentralized ethereum's the next most decentralized then there's a bunch of stuff and then there's extremely centralized things on the other under the spectrum and you should be very aware if you're if your goal is maximum decentralization don't use any of the really centralized platforms in the middle and so but if you're going to invest in something then what do you think is an appropriate allocation for vcs because obviously if especially if these are used in governance you know then then that can create issues down the road so how do you guys think about that again i i think that this changes over time or use ethereum as an analogy like with the ico it was very centralized like of who was holding eth in the early days and i think that that was fine in the early days but it shouldn't be the long-term goal and you know i think that something that people oftentimes underestimate is vcs have a lot of experience building companies and have a lot of resources and have big rolodexes and like in the early days if the vcs are as involved as the team behind the protocol like like just take paradigm as an example with uniswap like i think everyone knows that with v2 and v3 they were incredibly involved in the mechanism design in hiring the team in branding and bringing credibility to it and so i think in the early days like it was good that they own so much of uniswap and that it that they were like incentivized to really help build this thing but over time as it gets to more trading volume and and like you want it to become as decentralized as possible and so it's just there is this big spectrum i think people just oftentimes miss the nuance in this okay so you don't have like a certain percentage where it's like we will not go beyond that i mean we've never even gotten close to that percentage with sorry well rather it should be yeah the whole vc allocation not just yours it's it's challenging because it changes over time it changes over time and so like i think in a pre-launch just hypothetically in a pre-launch project i think it's fine for i mean by definition the team and vcs own 100 of it you know but i think that like when something's at maturity it should be like less than two percent should be owned by the vcs and founding team and so it's it's just there's a spectrum of getting there okay that's a very big spectrum and a very long time frame but you know what's funny though thinking about the time frame that actually is the same time frame for other companies that are pure equity-based companies that start as startups right i mean if you look at the cap table things have gone public in the last year a lot of firms have probably sold their positions and so it actually has gone through the hundred to two percent ownership uh spectrum so i think that spectrum can take place and i think there are a lot more tools to get at the core question of how do you ensure if the goal is to make something decentralized that the power is actually decentralized i think there are tools that crypto hasn't yet utilized around transparency around you could have sale agreements right like you could you know imagine someone signing up just to own something at some point and say you have to sell a certain percent every year after that or something like that there are a lot of tools that we're just scratching the surface and thinking about how to use to get at the real goal which is making sure that it's not just decentralized in name only and let me laura like let me use another controversial example here i'll use solana um i was initially i i come from a school of thought and it may not seem this way but i come from a school of like maximum decentralization like i i i was an early bitcoin person i love bitcoin and i was very skeptical of solana for a while because of how centralized it was but something that i had an insight on maybe six months ago is that even though solana a year ago was insanely decentralized it was becoming much much less centralized pretty rapidly and you look at it like say the the number of validators in early 2021 it was like 10. you know by the end of 2021 it was i like i think i can't remember now but it was at least one or two orders of magnitude more than that but something even more important is that the hardware requirements today to run a solana validator like are pretty high but in three or four years like it's going to be easy and the biggest bottleneck today is bandwidth where you need really you need like about a gigabit per second internet connection that's symmetrics both upload and download speak to like really be a legitimate validator it's very hard to get that type of internet like that's actually gonna be commodity very easy to come by though in four or five years and the benefit of the solana team being so involved is that they've been able to like push lots of updates and you know just just this week they push like their i think it's 1.10 update which it was a huge performance update and so i've kind of come around to the goal to me is that you need to be moving towards extreme decentralization and i i think salon is going that direction just as as one example and i think that four or five years from now if they survive that long which i think they will but if they survive that long like i think it will be extremely decentralized at that point and i think there's benefits of like by being being so close to the metal today they've been able to really push huge technical improvements that push the limits of crypto ford and if nothing else like future layer ones will learn from their ideas and so i just i really view this as a spectrum and i'm trying to use a few examples to to get that point across okay uh it's like really interesting points that you're making obviously solana uh sometimes can be quite controversial but in a moment we are going to talk a bit more about your portfolio and your investment thesis as well as uh some of the recent

experience web3 like never before scale with subnets head to avox.network to learn more back to my conversation with sean and michelle your investments range from a few portfolio companies that are for instance focused on privacy you're also working on some cross-chain interoperability scaling solutions uh ways for users to manage their own data even decentralized social applications overall what would you say is your crypto investing thesis okay in in four sentences let me see if i do it uh we think digital assets and blockchains are fundamentally useful they are going to create a market for financial services for those assets that incumbents are most likely slow to serve a couple may get in there but many of them seem to be slow to serve um that with it and the the rise of crypto will bring a new crypto stack so everything from the core compute and storage all the way up through a lot of infrastructure will yield new opportunities for new companies and there'll be a host of applications that are best suited for decentralized environments or some hybrid that we have yet to to see flourish but we are seeing some really interesting tidbits that are coming so one thing that i wanted to ask about was the investments in privacy because yeah i'm one of those people where on venmo i do not publicize a single one of my transactions and i cannot understand how i can log in and see these random people that i barely know like paying their friend like i find it very weird so to my mind and granted i am clearly um maybe not the target uh audience here so maybe it's just that i'm the weird one but when i look at all this activity on these public blockchains i'm a little bit like i think in the future a lot of this will be private i could be wrong but since i noticed that that was an area that you have focused on i was curious if you could talk a little bit about what your thesis is for privacy and crypto totally i'm also not a ven public venmo transaction person it makes me super nervous when like the one time i accidentally did that um this idea has been around in crypto since the beginning but there have been two kind of primary bottlenecks one is we didn't have the technology and zero knowledge proofs are kind of this emerging technological why now that is just creating all sorts of new opportunities that weren't possible in the past and the second is regulatory where you know no matter what school thought you come from like if you're a crypto anarchist libertarian like maybe you don't want governments to have a huge say over money and and blockchains but they're going to you know like there's always going to be a few on and off ramps and you know governments are always gonna have a huge say over them and it's one of the things i think is a little bit of a narrative violation about bitcoin for non-crypto enthusiasts is that in some ways it's the most traceable form of money ever you know there's very like it's hard to think of many times where people say stole a large amount of bitcoin or got large amounts of crypto including bitcoin as a ransom so like say colonial pipeline hack you know i think they got like 100 million worth and they weren't actually able to use it or the bitfinex hack like anyways there's 20 30 of these examples of people getting 100 million plus of crypto and then never being able to use it um and so in some ways actually like from a regulatory perspective governments have been fine with the use of bitcoin and ethereum and all that because it hasn't weakened their powers too much but if you get into like a true privacy coin like in in theory that would be a regulator's worst nightmare from a fall to money perspective and i'm personally like that scares me like i actually think it this is a very like a lot of people are gonna not like me for this but i think it's important to try to stop terrorist financing from happening or you know other large large-scale activities like i actually think it's valuable to have some of this transparency and money on the large scale on the individual human level like i have the opposite view and anyways i we're getting to this new era where there's a bunch of people working on privacy coins where it's like privacy for normal users but still with some tools for regulators to still like for large dollar amounts be able to see under the hood and i personally think that's a reasonable steady state and and zero knowledge producer like the enabling technology that lets that happen so we're gonna switch gears a little bit and talk about some of the recent news because there's been so much of it let's just in general start talking about the bear market which michelle you had this great thread about it and you wrote crypto has survived plenty of winters but it's never been through a global macro storm yet bitcoin was launched in the last global financial crisis of 2008. crypto has mostly existed in a roughly zero percent u.s interest rate environment so what do you expect to see going forward over the next year or so or whatever time frame you project will be in this macro environment in the crypto industry i think the point of that was that just to ready people as they see things in crypto happen the tree of crypto has grown taller and so it's gonna fall harder right it doesn't mean that it's going away or that it's in the world but like the dollar amounts that things drop are going to be bigger because they got higher the changes and and the volatility in this period will feel uh larger than it has before and that's because we have more users more dollars more liquidity more regulator attention than crypto has ever had so it was just really trying to ready people for that that yes crypto has always been through cycles but this one may have some unique elements that make it feel different and to be ready for that and i think that really depends on the business that you are running as to how you should react to that you know for some of them that are maybe have been especially very new in the last several years of a lot of retail trading activity and you know extremely low cost of capital they may need to plan for a different environment going forward with less retail interest potentially not zero but less than they had before and you're seeing that already right a lot of the big public companies that are more brokerage tradings have had you know down 20 volumes since last year obviously because last year was historic highs that doesn't mean it's going away and that it's broken or anything like that but it just you just need to plan for that difference and so that's what we've been trying to talk about with our founders is just recognize that this is a different environment if you keep running what you're doing the same way that you did for the last two years you're probably gonna find yourself in quicksand soon so recognize that the environment has changed and plan accordingly for some people that will be you know trims for some people that might be hiring more and stepping on the gas because you can access even more talent and you're really well positioned for some people that might be you know focusing on certain product areas or hard pivoting it really depends on who you are but the message we just wanted to get across was this is different plan for that and make it a priority so michelle um i did also want to ask in that thread you talked about how crypto entrepreneurs will really need product market fit and i was wondering what that looks like for a decentralized product or service or or aspiring to be decentralized are there particular metrics that you're looking at and then how do you also measure that given how much speculation we often see in crypto i'm sure you know about how much speculation kind of made things look like actually infinity was sort of a success story for you know maybe about a year or so and then now it's really struggling so how do you kind of determine that yeah it's a great question again this ranges but for the sake of discussion i think what we roughly look at is either developer or user uptake without incentives and so this doesn't mean you need to turn off all incentives or you can't use it but if you have only seen rising developer or user uptake depending on your product when you have been pushing incentives in some way whether they're tokens or tokens related to some type of activity or something else try pulling back on that and seeing whether you see a decrease in whether that really changes and if that's the case then you can tell there is at least some proportion of your usage that's not being driven by genuine value the person's finding and what you've built but by kind of mercenary interest in the incentives that you've set up and if that's the case it doesn't mean you're over and there's nothing else to do it just means you need to work on you know iterating in terms of the product and getting something to the point where it doesn't need constant incentivization to have people keep using it i feel like this would have been good advice for the terra people before everything fell apart but anyway um and then the last bit i wanted to ask you about in your thread was that you said that to build a sustainable business token go up is not a business model so talk a little bit about what you mean by that what do you think these crypto projects should be focusing on and what kinds of business models do you think will work when it comes to decentralized uh projects in crypto yeah this is something sean and i talk a lot about so i can take past and then let sean jump into um i think the thing is that you know tokens are really cool like there's something very cool in terms of the regulatory dynamics about having found this way to really get incentive you know rewarding users rewarding early developers you know there's a lot that's really interesting about them and there are a lot of people using them for truly genuine reasons again like for ethereum or bitcoin or salon a lot of these other ones like it literally stabilizes and secures the network there is a purpose to it and there are others where it has a purpose you know but there are a lot of others where it doesn't really have a purpose and uh when you really push on it like it's kind of this application that exists and they just like slapped on this token as this weird like tumor on the side it's just not really related to what they're doing and so you know in the craze of the last couple years people are excited maybe something's going up everything's getting trading volume you know you might see a lot of growth in that and then you think oh my god we're doing something amazing it's working but as soon as the interest rate environment changes and the air comes out of the market and there that type of energy isn't there you'll see it fall away and that's where a lot of people are now and so the point we're trying to make is just like you can't just look at the token going up and seeing if you have that is the business model the same way for a sort of without a token like if you just keep getting valuation increases from investors but a lot of the other metrics of health aren't there that doesn't mean that you are on stable ground and so really looking at what is the actual business model what is the product or service you make that people actually pay you for and how does that work and then how does that relate to the assets that may or may not be related to the business is an important question that certainly many crypto founders are incredibly sophisticated and have thought a lot about but there are some others that probably think a little bit more about that but sean i want to we talk about this all the time so please you said it perfectly all right so why don't we run through some of these recent big events in crypto i want to get your opinion on each of these let's just start with tara obviously that was kind of the big one that sort of kicked off this era of these dominoes falling what do you think are the main takeaways from tira's collapse there's so many takeaways first of all i just want to say that we feel awful for everyone involved like i feel horrible for anyone that lost money there feel horrible for people that were on the terror team like anyways it's just even though it's such a catastrophic kind of implosion just want to register the empathy there's a lot of things to say one takeaway is that no one could explain where the yield comes from like if you ask someone to explain where the yield comes from like no one could actually do it and in general if something anywhere including and especially in crypto can't pass like the explain it to a sixth grader test like you know it's it's usually about it's not always a bad sign there are some things that are so novel but like it's usually a bad sign number two is that the level of arrogance around some of the people around the project i think was too high um and then number three i love how you say that without naming names and yet i think we all know that you are mainly talking about dokwan but anyway not naming any names and then i think number three is that and this is very controversial and contrarian but like even though no algorithmic stablecoin has worked i don't necessarily think that no algorithmic stablecoin will ever work i think there are some interesting interesting ideas there and the execution was poor and like there was too much hubris and all that but there could be some really interesting future innovations in the space and this is probably a five-year setback for like algorithmic stable coins but i do think there's some really interesting kernels of ideas i think the other lesson which is tough it's just a reality which is that we've seen you know in the united states at least the sec has hired 50 new crypto enforcement attorneys and as our friend at stanford joe grenfers likes to say they are not there on vacation and it's a bummer because i think of course there are some things that should be prosecuted but what i struggle with just on a personal level not you know any religious decoy or anything else is just that it's hard for crypto founders many of whom who want to do the right thing and are trying to find a way to do it to live in this world where they're most likely going to be only sued later when something goes wrong rather than told initially like this is the framework that you should fit in you should register with this group or you should register with this and here are the rules that apply to you and so i feel like without that context and then people you know choosing to clearly not follow those rules then it's one thing but we do live in a world of a lot of gray area for these founders where they don't really know and it's not that they're ignoring it like am i a commodity am i a security do i register with cftc do i not do you want me to register as an exchange what am i exchanging that you know like these are legitimate questions that people don't know how to answer but the reality that's a really big bummer is that it doesn't matter no one will feel bad for you if you do something and later it hurts people you will get sued for it and it will not end well and so that's why you know we did a podcast with sam at the end of last year and sam's resolution for the for crypto if we could do a new year's resolution for the year was like just follow the rules ahead of the rules like even though there's no clarity do the best you can do the right thing so you don't end up in these situations and you're talking about sam bankman free the ceo of tx yeah yes apologies yes yeah sam or sbf people call him you know and so that's something for crypto founders is like don't expect that because there is not clarity today that that anyone will feel bad for you unfortunately you have to do the right thing and think about how what you're building could have negative impacts on people if it's not properly supported and i think that was unfortunately the case with tara yeah well while you bring up sam which by the way i noticed a bunch of funny tweets pulling apart all the bits of his last name to be like sam bank man freed which i was like oh right of course this was uh after the block fi and the voyager news clearly scam comes from an ancient banking family engine [Laughter] destined for greatness but i did want to ask because ftx now is sort of turning out to be this savior to a number of these companies such as blockfi and voyager when do you think i mean i know that you are an investor in ftx so what do you think it makes sense for ftx to do these kinds of deals because obviously for certain of these companies you know i'm sure we we could all probably say at this point celsius is probably not going to survive so how would you kind of think about when kind of shoring up the finances of such a company would be just throwing good money off your bad or when it's sort of worth it to do that deal i'll take the first stop here michelle and then you go even though michelle's the one that works with sam and ftx with our partner alfred so i just i saw a really good tweet about this today where someone basically said that the best analogy is the berkshire hathaway like sam and ftx have been the berkshire hathaway of the space because berkshire in 2008 bailed out goldman and at least one other bank where like i think it was like i can't remember the exact details but major injection of capital into goldman and at least one other bank and so i would say there's a few things a few things here one is that like berkshire those were amazing moves in that one like if the entire us financial system collapsed like if the whole banking industry collapsed if there's a domino you know and lehman led to a ton of like if goldman would have fallen then berkshire would have lost everything like and not necessarily everything but like we all would have been doomed and berkshire happened to be in this situation where they were able to help protect the entire global economy and they actually also made money in by doing it because they're able to get good terms and invest in super high quality assets that were facing kind of the perfect storm of dominoes falling and they're able to basically stop further dominance from falling and i feel like it's very similar here with ftx where a lot of these lending protocols if they have a bad book of assets then you should not step in to bail them out but if they have a great book of assets but they might have a little bit of a short-term liquidity crunch then it's super smart to step in like if something's over collateralized with really high quality assets which is maybe that 40 50 of them are in like three month duration or 12 month duration you know locked up bonds or some other like high quality asset then it makes a ton of sense to step in and give your stamp of approval your brand trust and also make a great financial deal for you and this has been happening like since the beginning of banks you know like you know it's just that it's been other banks and or governments that will step in to kind of stop bank runs and crypto doesn't have the same tools and so i'm very grateful to sam and i think it's very strategic because it preserves it helps preserve their whole book of crypto assets where they're indexed to the entire space and i think they're getting some great deals so and everyone's all right so i'm gonna keep just plowing through these because i do have a number of questions before uh we're going to to finally close close up here so let's just move on to three errors capital we kind of talked about celsius but you know just in the interest of time i'll just move on so what was your takeaway from the this firm's likely insolvency it was surprising and we again feel badly for the people involved yeah but in terms of like going forward for builders or or and for investors yeah like how would you kind of counsel your portfolio companies or like how would you think about your investments uh based on what happened here i was gonna say 3ac shocked me i was not expecting this happened to them like i've always thought of them as very smart and they come from tradition like wall street and so you know i would have assumed better risk management practices so i was shocked candidly like there's all sorts of things in crypto that i expect to fail 3ac was not one of them and so i think the advice to startups is like there's so many people in crypto that had given a large fraction of their like had a large fraction of their balance sheet exposed the 3ac because they trusted it and i think it's just the lesson is like always diversify and you can't really trust anyone in the space you know with a large like with existential risk for your company or protocol and in crypto we don't yet have like fdic insurance so it's different than if you have a bunch of your you know fiat in a bank where it's you know insured and the government's gonna step in and protect you so i just i think people were too cavalier with with their balance sheets is the biggest takeaway to me i also think from the vc side you know there are a lot of people posting 3ac as a crypto vc and there are other people saying they're not a vc they're a prop trading firm and just understanding that i think there are a lot of solo capitalists you know what you could call a prop firm right it's all sort of the same who have been great partners and so it's not like the model itself is broken but i think a lot of founders didn't seem to fully understand the differences between a firm that has been around for a really long time versus one that's not and there were some things that sean and i were hearing you know oh well they've never lost any money and it's like well that actually is not necessarily a good sign because in this business you're destined to lose money and so if you've never lost any money you probably are very new to the world and we actually don't know what you're like when you lose money or when you're in a crisis and those are the moments where you really do want to know that you're having a good partner because those are when it's hard and you see people's through colors so there's there's and there's a lot more besides just even investors right where people are saying oh they're they've never lost money and it's like well they're a quote-unquote bank that's been around two years so that's not a good track record necessarily right um and so i think in general i think this crisis or you know period for crypto will probably give everyone a healthier and higher bar for trust in counterparties and institutions they work with yeah i actually feel like there's also something to be said about the social media behavior being sort of similar to the dokwan situation which is kind of interesting just in terms of it giving a lens into what that founder is like and maybe their ability to you know think about potential bad things that could happen or manage for risk in this case i just find it interesting that it happened to be those people because they definitely seem to have a lot of swagger on social media and let me just say sequoia is one of the places that's had some of the least swagger on social media right right right not excluding this moment in particular though exactly so we'll circle back to some of your other investments again kind of looking forward to the future obviously there's a lot of movement and activity around interoperability and trying to have transactions across chains and you have written about the problem of fragmentation across chains can you elaborate on that kind of you know how do you see this problem manifesting for users and then what do you think are the best ways to handle it we're very fortunate to have great friends at the ethereum foundation solana you know know people cosmos and avalanche polkadot and others and the more and more we just kept talking to core teams working on layer ones and also layer twos you know polygon starkware etc we just felt like there is so much demand for block space that we think will keep increasing and the smartest people we can find in the world roughly don't think that there will be one single blockchain that will actually be able to supply all of that demand and so if that's the case if you have at least two that succeed and then it probably will be some version of several layers right that help abstract the execution layer from the data layer from the storage the same way we've seen compute and storage split up in cloud and some of the other parallels to just broader tech history if that's true then you need better interoperability because what we have now where you have for instance sushi swap as an application deployed on 13 chains each of those deployments none of them talk to each other so you have fragmentation of users of data of liquidity which is in a marketplace vastly less efficient you know the examples that we were using as sean and i were working on layer zero explaining it to some of our colleagues who don't spend as much time in this space is like okay imagine you were trying to use doordash and you could only order from restaurants that were also on iphones and the android people could only order from android restaurants like that is just vastly less efficient or over whatever marketplace you want doesn't make any sense you need a way to to have connectivity at the application layer for these to be more useful to people then that brings us to okay well what is that solution and there are a lot of people trying to solve bridges and interoperability in different ways we fell in love with the layer zero team and their approach for a lot of reasons it's a really hard problem to solve incredibly high security needs a lot of demands on like simplifying really complex transactions i'm sure you know like the old way of doing it going through like you know 27 different steps to bridge between this and that wrapped asset right to get something across is total pain and i also wouldn't call it the old way it's still you know it's still prominent absolutely that's totally fair hopefully we make it the old way but but yeah that's why we said we just think this has got to be a part of the future of crypto all right and let's also talk about scaling because i've noticed that some of your investments in this area are kind of across some of the different scaling solutions for instance we mentioned star queer and ck rollups earlier i also saw an investment having to do with polygon another one having to do with arbitrary so how do you think about scaling and is there a reason why you kind of haven't focused on any on any one particular type of technology or layer two so we're still so early in crypto it's really hard to know what the end state is gonna be and there's certain just to the question of why invest in multiple things there's certain areas in crypto that it's just impossible to know what the end state will be but we kind of believe in the idea but it's hard to know which layer ones other than bitcoin ethereum will be important in ten years like for layer twos it's really hard to know if it's gonna be zk or if it's gonna be optimistic roll ups like at what different time frame you know and how that's all gonna evolve and so in some of these areas we've had a little bit of a portfolio approach but the underlying problem they're solving is incredibly obvious and even when you talk to the ethereum foundation their vision for the future is that they'll be the underlying base data layer and kind of all the most important balances and data will be written to the ethereum blockchain but that there will be like a whole layer of higher throughput lower cost transactions on top of it and so like even even the ethereum foundation believes in their twos hopefully both on top of it is their goal but multiple technologies of it yes multiple yeah yeah and a lot of a lot of them think too there's a phase and that's some of the reason like today the side chains and early polygon stuff right it's so easy for developers to use so easy to get started and it solves some really big pain points immediately for people to lower transaction fees and just get things going optimistic is this bridge solution potentially that you know maybe goes beyond that but that's kind of the prevailing thought right now and zk is much harder there's some usability problems to solve with it in terms of developers having to write in a new language or port applications over rather than you know a more plug-and-play solution on top and so there's things to be solved there but long-term there's a lot of belief that that could be the right answer that said i think it's a space where there are just so many great teams like i hope you know sandeep at polygon is just like an amazing founder our sequoia india team back to him like he's just an awesome person and so there's no we're it's not that we're putting polygon in a box that they can't scale to do all these things for instance but they have a fantastic founder and a solution that's getting incredible developer update right now and similarly with starkware you have a really hard computation and cryptography problem that ex very few people in the world are really capable of solving and these are completely technically brilliant founders who are working really hard on doing that and making some general purpose layer to solve it so over time we imagine there's a good chance that both of these get used a lot and optimistic may as well but the end goal is all growing crypto and growing ethereum and so they all share the same and purpose and and are more additive to each other definitely than anything else another one of your investments solana based marketplace magic eden announced that it had raised another 130 million dollars at a 1.6 billion evaluation what is your projection of what the metaverse will become do you think that vr ar have to be a part of it or do you think it does not need that everybody's using this word nowadays metaverse and i feel like there isn't a really good definition so i'm interested to hear where you think this is all going oh my gosh you're asking the hard questions to me i think about the metaverse and i agree there's no good definition except reading neil stevenson books and like his version of the metaverse is obviously the metaverse we're going to live in obviously obviously anyways i think of the metaverse like maybe two different ways one is just the next big phase transition of the internet and it's hard to even know what that'll be but like when the internet evolves into something that's unrecognizable from today like i would call that the metaverse and one thing that i think will probably be an important property of that is some type of spatial component where it's like we're invested in a company called gather where it's easy to build maps and you know you can link maps together like offices together so you can have a bunch of remote crypto companies that all you know like they're based teams based around the world but they can have their offices in like a digital tokyo where you can kind of walk from one crypto company to another's office and there could be like a shared game room and all of that and gathers 2d it's very early but that sense of like linking humans that are at different places on the planet but where like they can just kind of walk digitally from one space the other and go talk to people that there's some deep commonality deep shared purpose like they're big crypto fans or whatever like that and so you're organizing instead of based on geography you're basing organizing based on idea in cyberspace like to me that's like a property that i would expect to be very strong in the whatever the metaverse is so i'll say that and then on magic eden i just want to say that similar to the comment about the lair twos like the magic eden team is just insanely good sid one of the founders he tweeted today kind of the backstory behind magic eden which is his first company failed and while he was doing it who's living on a tiny little sailboat because oftentimes actually cheaper to live you know like on boats than on land and that team has just been hustling like crazy for years kind of iterating and then magic eden has grown unbelievably quickly and i'll just say like i view nfts today and i view magic eden as like amazon in the early 90s where they started off by selling books and like amazon books were not the right end point it was just bezos was insanely talented a freaking genius workaholic visionary and it's more like backing bezos when he's selling books was a good bet because the internet was growing really fast and he it was like a bet that he would go figure out other things to sell in this space and i would just say with magic eden it's something very similar where they're just incredibly talented people and photos with the open c team is very talented too it's just like two incredibly talented teams that are the book vendors of the internet like that analogy for the metaverse or for early crypto and so anyways that's how i think about it all right so we talked at the very beginning about kind of the 20 or 30 year vision that you have but michelle you wrote this blog post ask not when moon ask why moon and in it you laid out the adoption s-curve of blockchain technology can you just give a very i mean it's only three steps but why don't you give a brief overview of it and then explain where you think crypto is now and will be for the next like year or two roughly there's the early phases of this curve which look like nothing's happening and we think about that in some ways as you know crypto as an island it's very disconnected from other sources right on-ramps just for assets are still clunky information flows you know it's hard to get data from the rest of the internet on chain into certain smart contracts so it's this island right with less to do but overall as that island continues to grow in terms of users and dollars there will be more crypto native applications that are built to serve that universe than it is more likely for the rest of the world of incumbents to connect and start serving those needs then we gotta get into phase two as the infrastructure improves a lot and basic you know things like going from the dial-up phase to the broadband phase or lte 5g where we are now right those core infrastructure layers are dramatically improved orders of magnitude faster cheaper and we start having more connectivity with fluidity of assets and information between applications that are on chain and off chain and i think we're just starting to see a lot of those pieces fall into place because the core infrastructure just has to get solved first it's like a foundation of a building you just you really do have to start from the bottom and then once that takes place and we reach internet scale users you can start to get really big applications and so that's something that people often miss is that through that s curve of growth you think oh wow this company or this you know products has grown amazingly i'm sure it's tapped out by now but you're nowhere close what it looks like when we have 4 billion crypto users or more i mean you're just not even close to that and we think we will get there over time and that's when you start to see the trillion dollar companies the two trillion dollar companies because they're really serving an internet scale population in a really important way um and so we think we are still very on early on in phase one maybe just heading into phase two hopefully but it's still truly early days as much as that is a meme and a trope at this point all right well i look forward to seeing how you guys navigate going through these early innings where can people learn more about each of you and sequoia yeah i'm at sean m maguire on twitter perfect and uh michelle yours is yeah at michelle and
