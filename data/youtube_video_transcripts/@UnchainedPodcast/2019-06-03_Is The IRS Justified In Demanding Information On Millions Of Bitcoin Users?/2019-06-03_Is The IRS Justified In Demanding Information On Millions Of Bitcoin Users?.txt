business you can learn more at think on-ramp com the topic of today's episode is the coinbase IRS case in late November the IRS with approval from a federal court requested the identity of all coinbase users from 2013 to 2015 this is called a John Doe summons which doesn't target an individual but a group or class of people in the past the IRS has successfully served John Doe summons to UBS to for instance determine if US taxpayers were using Swiss bank accounts to evade federal income taxes here to discuss the topic our Daniel winters a tax accountant at global tax advisers focusing on cryptocurrencies and Jeff burns managing partner at multi-specialty law firm burns Weiss LLP and co-founder of its virtual currency Practice Group welcome Daniel and Jeff welcome Laura local Laura Daniel let's start with you what information did the IRS request from coinbase sure you know I won't lay out every single little bit there but essentially what the IRS requested from coinbase are all user records for their us users for the period of 2013 to 2015 that means all transactions it means they're a MLK watch the information chat transcripts with support personnel from coinbase they want to see everything that coinbase has on their us users for that three-year period and why do you think that IRS issued this John Doe summons you know I've been thinking this one over and I think that the IRS issued this John Doe summons because they have a fundamental misunderstanding of Bitcoin and blockchain technology I think that the IRS move here shows that although that they issued guidance in March 2014 stating how we need to treat virtual currencies such as Bitcoin for tax purposes I think that they are simply having real trouble accepting this as a legitimate way to transfer value is a legitimate way to do business in their actions with this really broad John Doe summons to coinbase it seems that their only focus is that Bitcoin can be used for tax evasion and money laundering it's because they're assuming that people are using coinbase to evade taxes is that essentially what what this implies or that's what yeah that's one implying that I'm saying what I'm saying that the IRS has a fundamental misunderstanding is that we're here in the 21st century and the IRS is just sitting with a 20th century perspective saying this is a new payment system and we think people are using it to hide assets and not to clear their income when the reality is nothing but they but they I mean so they did have a few cases that they could point to as evidence that people are doing this correct right and I think what you're referring to is in the documentation that the IRS submitted to get the John Doe summons they referenced three tax payers that they found that had accounts at coin base that had committed tax evasion that's three tax payers one individual and two businesses I believe and Jeff me maybe you could that so they found three users that committed tax evasion with a coin base account there's hundreds of thousands of coin based users it's a ridiculous overreach they're painting everyone with a broad stroke they're assuming that if you've got Bitcoin you're you're evading taxes you're doing things that are illegal they just don't get it okay and you know just to be clear for all the listeners both Daniel and Jeff probably have similar opinions on the IRS as action here but of course there is another side that for various reasons I wasn't able to get somebody who would represent that other side but as you can see the IRS does have evidence that people are doing this so it's not simply that you know they don't understand how this works but I want to also then just ask like why do you think that they picked coinbase because there are so many people that use Bitcoin but are not customers of coinbase so why why coinbase sure I think that they targeted coinbase because it's the largest Bitcoin wallet and exchange service in the United States I work primarily with with individuals and companies in the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency space and what I have seen in the last two years is that essentially coinbase is the on-ramp to the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency ecosystem for people who are in the United States that's where things start for people in this ecosystem now the IRS has well-run well-designed systems to receive income information from people we're all familiar with the w2 for wages or a 1099 for a stock sale for instance but they don't have a data feed from the Bitcoin blockchain so since they don't have a mechanism to receive that information what they're doing is attempting to a force coin base which is the on-ramp to the Bitcoin ecosystem to provide them with information about their users Jeff let's turn to you now can I just Laura would you mind can I just comment one additional thing that what daniel said on why the IRS I think targeted coinbase yeah during that period of time coin base was I would I would say probably the most safe and legit exchange for US citizens to use and very likely I mean you look at who is behind coinbase these are not you know fly-by-night people these are legit businessmen who have you know histories in successful businesses their compliance was probably very good from the very beginning of opening their doors so so they are where you'd want to go for information because some of these other exchanges probably don't do kyc they don't track everything they don't record everything coinbase is illegitimate as legit companies they're going to have that information and I think that's why the IRS went after them first yeah I wrote a feature story on coinbase for the magazine and the lead to my story actually is about how compliance was a big priority at the company from the start and how actually very early on like literally in the the beginning of 2013 they had gotten some advice to ignore some guidance that came up from FinCEN from one of their lawyers um because you know this is before they had raised money and he just said look it's gonna be expensive for you to do this you're a start-up nobody's gonna care if you ignore it and they ended up deciding no actually we are gonna try to comply with this and they then hired another lawyer so that was the lead-in to my story so you are right that you know compliance has been a big theme at the company and it's something I even saw like during their staff meetings and stuff but while we're talking about coinbase I actually wanted to state their position on the subject which the CEO Brian Armstrong had articulated in a medium blog post recently and he basically said and I'm just quoting here that the John Doe summons is overly broad and implies all users of virtual currencies are evading taxes asking for detailed transaction information on so many people simply for using digital currency is a violation of their privacy and is not the best way for us to accomplish our mutual objective and that mutual objective being that coinbase wants all their users to also pay their taxes and then he went on to say that this summons unfairly punishes coinbase and he projects that it will cost the company $100,000 to $1,000,000 to contest the subpoena and his proposed solution is that the company begins sending out 1099 B's which is a report that you know other brokerage firms send out at the end of the year so Jeff I actually want to now that you know we've established what coinbase coin basis position is I want to talk about your role in this you are not only a lawyer but also a coin based customer and now you've gotten involved in the case yourself what steps have you taken and why right so coinbase the IRS filed what's called what you said at the beginning of John Doe summons and the purpose of a John Doe summons it's a Congress told the IRS you can use this in limited circumstances it's it's supposed to be used to get information when you have when you have a reasonable belief that tax evasion is taking place so I filed a motion to intervene in the summons procedure because it was granted so at once that summons is granted claim base is free to just agree to provide all of the documentation to to the IRS they don't have to ask their customers permission or anything like that so I file a motion intervene asking the court to stop this procedure to say wait a minute this is unprecedented this is I've never seen a fishing expedition like this come from the IRS in any case I've ever seen and we need the court to look at this and somebody has to raise the issue of wait a minute this is not about tax evasion I mean let's face it the IRS had all of this time and they came up with three examples two of which were companies they weren't even in individuals they're asking for information that is more like a criminal seating they want every scrap of email every scrap of transaction history they want to know the devices that access your account and how they want to know your passwords to access your account and and as I read it potentially they want access to the virtual currency and I don't know how many people understand that once you have private keys it's it's the password that controls your your virtual currency that could be sent out anywhere and can never be recovered again so there's a danger I hadn't been aware that that's interesting I actually just want to backtrack for a second use this word fishing expedition and you often hear that John Doe summonses are not supposed to be fishing expeditions so what does that mean right it's when it's when you basically you you throw out a net to catch fish right so so if you're using a net to catch fish it's not really fishing right you're you're putting a net up there you're gonna catch everything and hopefully you'll catch some fish too so it fishermen you have that expression it basically means you ask for everything and eventually you'll find something that's the theory right if they get records on a million or two million Americans they're gonna find a couple people a couple companies that did use it to evade taxes but but to get that information they've received information on a million people who were law-abiding citizens and the IRS is not entitled to that information this is bigger than just Oh which you know they're trying to look at virtual currency this this if they're allowed to do this where does it stop right now law enforcement knows that people are using prepaid credit cards to evade taxes and to launder money they can go in and they can buy these these cards for cash anywhere there's no record they can then use it to buy products or sell them for a discount on the internet can you imagine if the IRS served the credit card company with a request to produce every piece of every transaction history on every prepaid credit card that was ever issued during a three year period this is just a ridiculous over grab so then let's differentiate what they're doing now with successful John Doe summonses in the past there are a couple cases that people point to one is is the one I mentioned earlier that involves UBS can one of you describe you know what was going on then you know what they were looking for why that ended up being successful and you know then also talked about how it differentiates from the current coin based case Daniel do you want to go first yeah thanks so much Jeff here's what happened with the UBS case UBS Bank unfortunately for them and their clients was actively assisting US citizens to take their money and move it over to Switzerland hide it not declare it violate a great deal of laws in and violate a great deal of tax tax laws in the process so the eventual outcome of that case is that the US Treasury Department pressed the Swiss government to crack the Swiss banking secrecy and the Treasury Department said we want names we want a list of names we want to know who was hiding their money in US bank and it became a top-level diplomatic dispute between the u.s. and Swiss government and guess what Swiss banking secrecy cracked UBS bank turned over a list to the Treasury Department the IRS then began prosecuting these these people for the fact that they had hid hundreds of millions of dollars and not filed foreign bank account reports and all sorts of other things now what was the biggest outcome of this is FinCEN has a report out there called a foreign bank account report and that report is required when a US person has at least $10,000 in all non-us foreign financial accounts but there was no in the the law was an old law but there was no enforce mechanism for this that's why the UBS customers were able to get away with violating the law so in response Congress enacted the foreign account Tax Compliance Act FATCA to create a worldwide enforcement mechanism to ensure that all US persons with significant funds in a non-us financial institution were accurately reported meeting their fact over their FR requirements and then they introduced a whole set of new ones so this is a case where the John Doe summons was seemingly justified is that correct in that yeah in that case yes because they had information that there were US persons and employees of UBS Bank who were clearly violating US law and so how is the coinbase case different the coinbase case is completely different because in coinbase we have three users who are implicated but that's all that the IRS knows so it's a huge difference of degree from evidence of criminal activity on a broad scale which incidentally turned out to be completely correct too we found three users that that broke the law and therefore we are now going to treat the other 99.99% of users as potential criminals it's an absolute difference of degree okay I think if I if I can add also that's a perfect example of legitimate IRS investigation right that if everybody knows or that used to be the running joke you know I'm going to open a Swiss bank account to avoid taxes they had testimony from a UBS employee that they put in their declaration to do the John Doe summons here they have examples of three people unrelated necessarily to coinbase they haven't even tied them to to it being involved with coinbase and in the other case that that people like to talk about and say it might justify this as the is the paypal case but again that's a perfect example of why this is different in PayPal they requested information on all US citizens but they limited it like there was a five year period but then they said who had a bank account or a credit card drawn by a financial institution in one of these countries Barbados Antigua countries that were known to be havens for for tax avoidance that's again a legitimate IRS investigation but here three examples unrelated to coinbase and they're gonna ask for documents on every American citizen this is not about avoiding taxes this is the IRS trying to cover itself because of it's a bad decision initially and because of that they're they're going down this rabbit hole and they're not going to be able to come out of it even if they got this information it wouldn't help them what do you mean there when you talk about this bad decision initially right you cannot treat virtual currency as property it has to be treated as a currency and and here's here's the idiocy of this of the decisions that are being made if you were to buy the virtual currency ether or Bitcoin and you went to Starbucks and you they accepted it let's just say but when you bought the virtual currency it was one value and let's say over the course of week it goes up five percent you know so you've made five dollars and now you go and you spend it on a Starbucks coffee you technically have a taxable event I mean Daniels will be able to comment and tell me if I'm right but you cannot keep records when you're making these diminish property trades where if it was a currency and it went up slightly in value like if a dollar you know can buy you a little bit more this year than it could last you're vice-versa you don't have to pay attention to that but if you're trading currencies then those are taxable events that's how this should have been treated and then it would be much easier to have exchanges issue 1099 B's like like the stock exchanges doing everything else we wouldn't have to have this huge invasion of privacy okay if I could jump in yeah I would agree with Jeff that the treatment of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies like a theory or mo narrows you cash litecoin it's awkward because there's no de minimis exception and technically if someone buys $10 a Bitcoin today and three days from now they exchange it the market fair market values risen to 12 and they use that to buy a mouse on the internet they just they have a two-dollar gain the route the reality is no one's reporting small transactions and I spend a majority of my time working with people on the Bitcoin cryptocurrency space people don't come to me for stuff like that so the minimums exception would it be too bad necessarily because the people who are really you know say you know running a Bitcoin ATM company or they're a full-time trader or they're selling bitcoins day to day on local bitcoins or they're getting paid in Bitcoin all of those activities you know we can already sort out what the income is there's tools we just apply what the rules are and those are not folks who are just you know bought twenty five bucks of Bitcoin so a de minimis exception would definitely relieved you know or reporting burden because it's really complicated to see all this stuff and so for a de minimis exception I'm assuming that that means that you know there is not a taxable event under a certain threshold is there an established threshold at which you know they they always have this or is this something that you know if they went that route that would need to be worked out believe or not I'll actually kick that back to Jeff because I'm so focused on virtual currency and I actually don't really deal with foreign currency in terms of the de minimis exception but the as I understand it big picture that's designed for somebody takes a trip to France they come you know they buy some euros well while they're there they come home they still have 100 euros left and they go and exchange it for dollars and there's a slight difference so there's nothing that they need to do and that's what its involved designed for for small-scale transactions but that's really my only comment that that's correct in the and that's one thing the IRS they could set up procedures like that I feel bad because I the people the IRS the good people they're trying to they're trying to do their job they're they have they don't have the resources to do it but this is not this is just not the way to go about things you don't just take away the privacy of millions of Americans because you need to to learn something I mean this is a data dump they're gonna take this data they're gonna use it to invest into everybody and potentially set up procedures going forward but there are other ways of doing that that that make more sense and that are that are within the bounds of the law all right so I just want to pause things right here to

think on-ramp com I was speaking with Daniel winters of global tax advisers and Jeff burns of burns Weiss LLP so to continue this conversation about the way that the IRS went about this John Doe summons is perhaps not not justified in in your opinion what do you think would be you know a more reasonable request right so coinbase filed last week in the middle of the week coin base filed a motion to intervene into my motion to intervene so and coin bases position is that that's the substantive issues need to be resolved together like and they need to be heard as well the reason why that was really important is twofold one the think think about this the IRS requested all of this information then I filed the motion to intervene and what did the IRS do it told coinbase we don't need any more information on mr. burns now I abut millions of dollars in virtual currency so so I should I should be somebody who legitimately you know has to report taxes if I have taxable events and this isn't a de minimis thing as what I'm what I'm trying to say the IRS says okay well we don't want that information I'm mr. burns so he no longer has standing to try to intervene we're not trying to get his information and they thought I think they thought oh that'll appease me and I'll be done but we received so many calls from other coinbase users who are saying can you please help us can you you know can you please represent us it strikes me as fantastical I have to use that word that they could think that just knowing my name would be sufficient but yet want all of the other information they do on everybody else yeah and I don't I don't understand how knowing your name would be sufficient because that does that then somehow give them some insight into how much you've purchased and when you've sold and all your taxable events and virtual currency no I don't think so I you know that the funny thing is they they picked a time period to investigate when Bitcoin which was the biggest cryptocurrency and still is there are other ones that are that are rising fast but they picked a time when when Bitcoin was depressed you know it had been at a time high and so the chances are there's not gonna be much in the way of taxable events for anybody during that period of time including me so knowing my name didn't give the IRS any additional information but what it made me think is well then maybe all they need to know is the names of American citizens who are coin based customers I mean if it was good enough for me why isn't it good enough for for everyone else for all the other coin based customers but go ahead dan I'm sorry Oh why'd you jump in there oh I I just want to say I do have a disagreement with you about you know did people really have you know you know material substantial taxable transactions during those years from my personal experience there are definitely people in 2015 who have material income from Bitcoin and cryptocurrency these are often people who I would say who made some very wise eke any investment decisions who saw an opportunity perhaps long before 2015 it really depends or they're just people who are frankly really really bright all the way out there outlier on the bell curve and my client base are generally people who have found a creative way okay to generate income using Bitcoin and cryptocurrency they build platforms they trade they build blockchain apps so you know there are people who definitely had the need to go in and report all their income from at least fourteen fifteen so when you do their taxes you know we were talking about these examples of like buying coffee and the de minimis exemption are you finding that their taxable events tend to be trading events or are some of them you know like in this example with the coffee are they like oh they you know bought something on overstock or they bought a plane ticket on Expedia or whatever yeah I mean I'm trying to think how much do I really want to say in detail but what I have to say is things that I that Bitcoin transactions and virtual currency transactions encompass a broad variety of activity for some people it's they're just treating it as digital gold as a new investment class which is what it is and their goal is to stock up by Bitcoin you know on a consistent basis every every couple weeks okay and just hold it for other people they have a much more short-term horizon they buy bitcoins on Tuesday they turn around and flip it make a percentage okay and that's what they do for yet other people if they work for a Bitcoin or black chain company and they are paid in Bitcoin which complicates their tax situation because it's like if you got paid in stock so if someone sends me a thousand dollars a Bitcoin because I provided services I immediately have a thousand dollars a Bitcoin but if I don't if I don't exchange that for dollars or goods or services immediately I'm gonna have a gain or loss when I do the exchange so if I get a thousand dollars a Bitcoin today and then I wait five days to cash it out I have to report a gain or loss and to go back also to the digital gold example if someone is just buying and not selling they're holding for the long term then there is no taxable event correct that's yeah that's absolutely correct if all you do is buy Bitcoin or aetherium any other cryptocurrency there's nothing to do no no different than if you buy shares of IBM however as soon as you take your Bitcoin and exchange it for goods for services or another type of property such as a different cryptocurrency like etherium like Manero likes you cash like like light coin you have a taxable event and vice-versa correct or you have aetherium yeah they advise in vice-versa if you're an all coin miner and you have especially computers so that you can mine pay cryptocurrencies such as a theorem or a theorem classic you have the dollar value one that's received like that's a today I mind a theorem classic I have five hundred dollars of ether classic tokens that's my I have income today of that five hundred ollars I then hold on to him for two weeks because I'm bullish and I hope the price will go up and then I sell those same pool for six hundred there's a game right there so it's a two-step calculation and that's why it's complicated okay so I actually I also you know we've been alluding to the specific cases of the IRS referred to but we haven't described any of them in detail can you guys tell us you know what was going on in those cases and how that ended up triggering the summons you you mean the the UBS and PayPal cases no no the the cases of tax evasion using Bitcoin that the IRS cited when requesting the summons well III think from what I remember and it was one individual who I don't know the specifics on I can't remember but there were two entities who who declared business expenses as opposed and they were personal expenses which you you could do by buying something on Amazon right if I buy something from my office or I buy something from my house and say it's my office that that's that's exactly what these these two companies apparently we're doing from what I remember but it wasn't enough - it wasn't enough you're talking about millions of people just a coin base that are US citizens so you found three examples two of which don't even apply to virtual currency so I I don't I just I think I think they thought that that they would get away with it I think they thought that that nobody would say anything and coinbase will negotiate with them which is the real reason I'm still involved in fighting so hard is that at this point even though coin base has indicated that it is going to fight compliance with with this request they could change their mind or they could reach a deal tomorrow and provide certain information the IRS and I just think coin based customers have to have someone there to argue and to say no this isn't okay you need to prove your case so Jeff what is your ultimate goal then and you know what next steps are you going to take right so we that we had our hearing moved the court moved our hearing that was scheduled for this week to February and the same day that coin basis motion intervene was being heard so I think probably at that point we're gonna we're gonna say to the judge actually we're gonna file something today but but I'll give you that we're gonna file something today that basically says we have no problem with giving coinbase time to respond and give him the court more time as long as we're notified in advance if any deal is being cut so we have a right to go in there and a class-wide injunction if we have to so that's what we're filing today when we go to the court I'm hoping now that this judge will take a look at it and say you know what yes they approved the summons because I approved it it looked legit but now this is brought to light there's a lot of a lot of information now being brought to the court that maybe I have to rethink this or at the very least we need to severely limit it to tax issues I mean if you're gonna if you're looking for tax avoiders then then figure out the most likely tax avoid our conduct and ask for information related to that not every email and is there something that you would propose in that direction like if you were to come up with some solution that would help the IRS identify tax evaders how would you structure it yeah I think I think at first I would try to get Congress to to change the fact that virtual currency should not be treated as a property it should be treated as a currency because it will streamline a lot of bookkeeping and and make compliance much easier and make enforcement much easier and the second thing is I would require exchanges to file the 1099 I think their 1099 bees and that should solve the problem and then if you see legitimate if if you see information on somebody like you know any other way the IRS has to investigate without going in and subpoenaing blanket records if I all of a sudden go out and buy an island maybe that that's something that should I be looked at you know I don't know but the IRS already has mechanisms in place they shouldn't be creating this image that blockchain technology virtual currency is a bad thing it is going to revolutionize every aspect of how we deal with each other over the next thirty years and I don't want to see that technology stymied because people don't know what they're doing so something else I want to talk about is why this summons was issued now there has been a little bit of speculation about other things that are happening more broadly at the IRS could one of you describe that yeah in September they were chastised by the Department of Treasury because they still really don't have any policies that make sense that people can rely upon to understand how you report how you treat virtual currency it's like this amorphous thing they've said they haven't really put the meat on the bones so the so least I believe what happened was they got chastised by the Treasury Department and they they reacted as most governmental agencies do they overshot and so they thought hey let's go get records on a million or two million Americans and we'll figure things out at least we can say hey we are looking into it we're trying to figure it out we've we've got all of these records and we're looking for a tax avoidance that that's my opinion of timing and why this happened now alright and I also want to talk about the implications for cryptocurrency users is this something that all holders of Bitcoin ether Manero Z cash etc should be nervous about or is it just customers so coinbase you know who should be paying attention to this well here's the big picture is that Bitcoin income virtual currency income is taxable income the IRS has issued fairly clear rules on how to treat certain transactions whether you are providing services whether you are trading whether you are remaining and and and they've also stated that if you're paid Bitcoin and it's part of your wages your employer should issue a w-2 if you're a contractor you should get a 1099 and if you sell this capital asset that it gets reported on your taxes so there are some pretty clear things that the IRS has stated what to do concerning Bitcoin income the big question is are people actually complying with those rules so here's sort of what I'd say is for someone who has an account it with coinbase if they properly reported all of their income at their coinbase account and every other wallet exchange or service that they have to find but if you did not actually report your income or didn't report it at all you might have a serious problem and how easy is it for people to do that it's not the simplest thing in the world there are a couple of software tools out there that I use I can tell you the site I don't know if you want me to do is it labor tax no the site that I work with that I find to be the best most powerful tool is called Bitcoin tax and I have used that successfully for six-figure you know income situations so that's a tool I use if your activity is light and you just have a coin base account then you probably figure it out yourself if however you have you if you just use coin base to be your entry point to the cryptocurrency ecosystem and then you move your money and cycle it through different wallets different exchanges go in and out of all coins if you have anything more complicated than just one account or two then I would suggest you contact a professional for this but my main thing here is to go back to you know what does this mean for coin based users if people will be nervous as long as you are you report all your income accurately in the first place you're fine if you didn't that really might be a serious problem and I think that when the case is eventually settled if you are on the short list of people that's whose information is sent over to the IRS you're not going to find out until you get a very unhappy letter in the mail and they're not going to tell us what their requirements were to be on that to be on that list can I can I comment in response to your question - yeah so for me this is a much much bigger question ah I'm not concerned about Bitcoin I'm more concerned about what this means going forward we've allowed digital virtual currency to some kind of a negative connotation because of things that have happened with Mount GOx and all of the stuff that you know Silk Road we all know all those stories with Bitcoin and it and it has it's made people who don't really understand the ecosystem have a negative impression about it but what's really going on here is this is a governmental agency who's basically subpoenaing private records of American citizens without justification and information having nothing to do with that agency's purpose so if it is allowed it isn't just about coinbase where does it stop do they then say well the two examples of people using Amazon for tax evasion now can they request every record for every transaction you've ever made with Amazon where does it stop so for me that's one issue the second issue is I you know we have developed and spent a lot of time developing in the ecosystem then the blockchain ecosystem I really believe this is going to change the future I believe the etherion blockchain is going to change the future so I don't want anything that's gonna put a damper on that I don't want the government you know blindly doing stupid things that are gonna interfere with that development and this is one of the things that might do that it could cause people to say hey the IRS is looking into it I don't want anything to do with this and that's not right okay so there are a couple of things that I've been hearing in terms of your criticisms and one is about how the IRS treats a virtual currency but you know as property another one is about how onerous it is to keep track of what you would need to keep track of to report everything correctly so in an ideal world you know obviously there are a few problems we've identified and how cryptocurrencies will be treated for for tax purposes you know out of this case what would you see as the ideal outcomes I would like to see the IRS meet and discuss what their what they really need and why and how and have the ability to maybe educate them and they should convene I mean there there are people like Daniel there are there people in DC they should convene a meeting and try to figure this out there are ways of accomplishing the necessary tasks that the IRS is I am not in support of tax evaders at all nor do I think most people use or will use virtual currency for tax evasion so so let's look at what the IRS really needs and let's figure out a way of giving that to them without giving them more than they really need because whenever the government gets more than it should have it ends up doing something it shouldn't do with it but you were the one I believe who made the point earlier about how calling it property was a fundamental mistake correct yeah what would you suggest otherwise I think we have to change the definition and it should be a currency so so when you buy it and you spend it on products you're not gonna have taxable events we're right but I mean a lot of people do buy it as an investment and just hold it for years so in that case would they also be taxed as if it's a currency right so if they bought it and held it as an investment Daniel can jump in on my understanding of taxation as when they sold it they would have a capital gain much like anybody who holds assets if the currency goes up in value and you held it as an investment you have you have a capital gains on it I wanted to be treated this the way currencies are treated okay you're using a currency for you know to make money or as a business you're gonna have taxable events but but if you're using it because you're gonna spend it when you go to France you you shouldn't have a taxable event oh I see if I could jump in Jeff and I I think we disagree on that I'm actually okay with the IRS treatment of Bitcoin as as a type of property in a virtual currency for the simple reason that Bitcoin isn't doesn't really fit the definition of currency in that it's not issued by a sovereign government it's not legal tender for a particular country so that's how we get to the definition of virtual currency and FinCEN is the agency that issued that guidance several years back so I'm okay with Bitcoin being treated as a type of property I just think that it would be nice if there was an exception so that people were doing small-scale transactions didn't have to do any reporting because they're not doing it anyway so that's sort of my position on that and my thinking there kind of goes to like like different states have money transmission laws and what's the definition of a currency for that and that's all legal so I won't go too far there but I'm okay with Bitcoin being a type of property and you know the big picture issue we have here is that this is a revolutionary innovative technology that emerged and regulators around the world are playing catch-up to understand how what do we do here so then since everything is sort of up in the air let's do a little prognosticating I'd like for each of you to finish this sentence if I had to bet money I bet that the outcome of this case is right I think that the court will reevaluate the court will will boot me out on procedural grounds because the IRS you know negated my standing and we'll have to try again with one of the hundreds of people who have called our office to show the court that we're not gonna give up or this judge will say you know what I'm taking a step back and I want you all to meet you know mediate the issue see if you can come up with with something that makes sense that all three interests can agree upon I think that that's the most likely outcome I don't think coinbase will give in to the government's request I'm hopeful of that and so I'm hoping that we'll get to the table we'll be able to figure out how to navigate this and when you say when you say all three interests you mean coinbase a IRS and you well i doesn't have to be me but some somebody should represent coinbase as customers because relays coinbase is a company that has to deal with regulators that they need to keep a good relationship with regulators it they stand in a different spot they don't have the same interest it's not really their information that's being sought yes it's not gonna be good for them from a business perspective but there's a different interest and that's the actual persons whose information is being sought that's the third interest that I'm saying needs to be represented whether it be me or the court can pick anybody I just want somebody at the table okay and Daniel finished the sentence if I had to bet money I'd bet that the outcome of this case is coinbase will be forced to provide information on some of their users it's part of a negotiation exactly what they'll be what the parameters for that but I think coinbase I'm not as optimistic as Jeff particularly like using the UBS case is an analogy so I think the coin base ultimately will need to provide much more information than they're comfortable doing but you don't think it's all the information that's currently being requested it sounds like it sounds like you think it's only going to be a portion probably not me but I'm really not so sure I mean I'm probably not it was a full amount I would hope the coin base does not need to provide the full amount information the IRS is requested and and and I don't think that they will but I think the end of the outcome of the case will be that coin base will have to provide information to the IRS on certain of their users within some parameters the thing being there that the exact parameters of the class of people that are being provided and the scale of the transactions will not be public information so we won't know I also like what Brian arms I'm said in his piece which was essentially hey we'll just registering 1099 F 1099 forms that's a great idea the Bitcoin exchange if it already does that so that's basically my my thinking I don't feel that up is optimistic is Jeff alright well this has been a fabulous discussion thank you both so much for joining where can people learn more
