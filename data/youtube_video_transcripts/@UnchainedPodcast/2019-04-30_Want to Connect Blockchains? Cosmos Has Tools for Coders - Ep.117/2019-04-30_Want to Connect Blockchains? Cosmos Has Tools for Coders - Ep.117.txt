ethereal summit New York the 10th to 11th and pioneer works in Brooklyn my guests today are j-kwon founder and CEO of tender mint and president of the entertained Foundation an Ethan Buckman co-founder of Ted ermine and cosmos and technical director of the interchange foundation welcome to Ethan hello great to be here J let's start with you cosmos and all the technology around it is just a massive system I was trying to wrap my head around this and it's there's just a lot there so before we dive into all the pieces why don't we give a high-level overview what problem or problems were you trying to solve with this project and what is the vision for the cosmos system tenement is it's an open source project that started in 2014 and the idea is to create a better consensus system it started with the idea that distributed systems distributed consensus systems can be created without proof of work and it turns out if you use classical Byzantine fault tolerant consensus algorithms that don't require mining you can actually address speed scalability and anti environmental issues associated with perf work as in Bitcoin so tender witness and open source consensus engine that can be used to create any blockchain system and we use tender meant to create cosmos so cosmos you can think of maybe tenorman as an operating system and cosmos is may be analogous to World Wide Web the idea is to create a network of law chains where bought chains can literally securely communicate with each other to create a scalable interoperable network of distributed Ledger's and so cosmos we recently launched the cosmos hub it's a blockchain powered by tender mint it's a Byzantine fault tolerant based proof of stake system that doesn't require proof of work and the purpose of the cosmos hub gets to connect to many blog chains and enable token transfers the two-way picking and so this way we can create a scalable foundation for a new token economy well okay so this was actually my next question for you but even before we've asked it I realized that some of the thoughts I had when I phrase this question were were actually incorrect so there's tender mint the company which is you know when I introduced you that's what your CEO of but then there's now also this tender man operating system that you described and then cosmos you said is a network that uses tender min I guess it's built on top of tender mint and you call that a network of large chains that's sort of like the World Wide Web you said as opposed to tenorman being the operating system and then within that within the cosmos network you are now also operating something called a cosmos hub which is different from the cosmos network and will I guess so we're gonna dive more into that in a bit but but there's like multiple things where some of these names are reused but did I get all those definitions correct sure yeah that's basically correct so we use we use the term tenorman actually refer to multiple different things so one is the company so the company's is all in bits but it does business as tenorman so you see it around us as tenorman tink and then there's tenorman the software which we typically refer to as tender mid color and this is the actual you know software that you would download on github that you would run that is the basis of this operating system that we've been talking about and then there's tenorman that consensus algorithm which is kind of the underlying protocol that is implemented in tenorman core and so you know we use the word tenorman to kind of refer to all three three different layers of that alright so let's go back to cosmos which is I think what most people think of when they hear your names on March 13th you guys launched the cosmos network this internet of lock chains which enables you know the different block chains to be interoperable and so what is cosmos and what are what problems are you're trying to solve with cosmos Jerse so like Jay was saying kind of the goal is you know tenorman is like an operating system or it's software for basically running a single blockchain and lots of people are out there building kind of individual independent you know siloed block chains that don't really communicate with one another well we felt that what we could what we could do with cosmos was to start thinking about how to interconnect all those block chains and how to design a protocol that would allow different block chains even if they're built potentially you know with different consensus algorithms or with different applications or different styles of managing a cryptocurrency that we'd still be able to have some protocol that allowed them to interoperate so you know unlike so for instance on a theory I'm kind of a vision with aetherium was that you could deploy all these different smart contracts onto aetherium and by virtue of all them being on the etherion blockchain you know they'd all be able to communicate with and with one another and that's you know obviously led to an explosion and interest and value of the etherium network and so in a similar way we're trying to sort of generalize that a little bit further instead of saying well instead of having many applications on a single blockchain that are able to communicate with one another like you have with aetherium we wanted to find a general-purpose protocols that will allow many different block chains to you know despite what is running top of them even very different you know applications to still be able to communicate with one another and so that was really the the key design goal of the cosmos network was to facilitate many independent heterogeneous blockchains to still be able to communicate with one another and so kind of the founding approach to that that you know at least at least to get it started is this idea of starting with what we call the cosmos hop and and starting with a set of block chains that will the first thing they'll do is connect to the cosmos hub and the cosmos hub will serve as this kind of router between the first set of block chains that come online and so as you mentioned the costumes hub is online now there's no other block chains yet online in the cosmos network a lot of people are building you know their own block chains and have either in test net phase or actually there is there's iris net which is a block chain based out of China that's built you know using the same technology stack as the cosmos club but they're not connected yet because we haven't quite finished the piece that will allow them to interoperate what we call IBC or the inter blockchain communication protocol right and so once that is actually developed and deployed then these different block chains you know at least these two the cosmos hub and iris net and then whatever others come online will start to be able to communicate with one another but kind of in the long term the the idea of the cosmos network was to roll out these protocols that would really do to the blockchain space what you know protocols like TCP did to the Internet which was to actually create the Internet create this massive network of interconnected you know smaller networks right and so in the same way we think about this is like you know the interchange right so we have many chains out there and we're trying to build protocols that will give us you know the inter chain and sort of right now you know we localize it in this idea of the cosmos network which is kind of the block chains that are building up around the cosmos hub which was the first blockchain in this network and so walk me through an example of how it works and I don't know if this is a good example because these are both proof proof of work but like I was saying you know these are the two most popular coins so like what if I have Bitcoin and I want to use it on aetherium can I use and I like I I just mean theoretically because obviously you know you mentioned that you know you're only working so far with things like I but like but like if I wanted to do that theoretically how would I use the cosmos hub to do that or you know pick whatever block chains are best for the example so it's a bit coin and aetherium are are based on proof of work so it's a bit more involved than just connecting to tender met based chains together so I'll use a different example and maybe get back to the Bitcoin example so we have this framework called the cosmos SDK a lot of projects are building on the SDK in anticipation of IBC development being finished very soon so for example iris was mentioned there's also lino it's another block chain that's that's up and running they actually have the most amount of users last I've heard eight hundred thousand users on their chain and with the IBC module the two block chains can communicate securely so in other words each block chain can be aware of the other block chains that latest state and they can start passing packets of information back and forth and on top of the packet is information encoded about how many tokens are being transferred to what blockchain and to what account on the destination so it's really it can be as simple as creating a cosmos sdk-based blockchain using that framework but there are other frameworks that plug into tenorman as well and so it doesn't have to be dance decay but the idea is to create an interoperable network of block chains that it's very easy to plug into if you build on yes decay to be very easy to connect to cosmos hub okay so so yeah now we're now we're getting into other terms we haven't defined previously so the cosmos SDK which I I think is it's that's a weight that you guys like provide tools for other developers to build their own blockchain is that correct yes kind of like Ruby on Rails is an easy way to build a new website the cosmos SDK is a framework for developing a blotchy and that also includes tender mint so tenorman is very agnostic to how you develop your blockchain application you can develop it in any language such as Python Java or go and the SDK the cosmos SDK is currently the leading framework to build on tender mint and it's a go framework go is the language developed by Google it's a great language for developing a secure complex application that that is very efficient and fast and when I was learning with this there was something that seemed somewhat similar to substrate from the parody team is that correct there are a lot of analogies maybe maybe one way to describe the differences may be the way that bitcoin is tea etherium cosmos maybe to tip polka dot so if you're referring to polka dot then is yeah and substrate yeah yeah yeah so we we we like to keep things very simple and modular for example are dependent consensus algorithm is it's a state-of-the-art consensus system but it's all based on very rather simple concepts and we try to keep the consensus algorithm as simple as possible because it's it's quite complex consensus systems I think ours it's definitely one of the most complex things I've ever had to develop and it's really important to keep such a complex algorithm simple so that people can understand it so there are similarities but maybe one large difference is that we don't start off for example with the assumption of complex cryptographic primitives like VLS signatures we don't have a virtual machine on the cosmos hub although you can develop your own virtual machine on the cosmos SDK the idea is that the cosmos hub is its is there to be a conservative set of features required to a scale the cryptocurrency ecosystem by enabling inter bought chain token transfers really that's that's all we want to solve but there's a lot that you need to build in order to solve that well for example we we had to implement a a governance system so that the blockchain can decide on what to do in a case of various failures so there's a as a novel governance system built into the cosmos hub recently the the network passed a proposal to upgrade the the cosmos hub to enable token transfers so so that's governance in action there and we had quite a bit of participation from the stakeholders but there's also a lot more that you need in order to make a good proof of stake system so there's the we have the pretty advanced or maybe the most advanced proof of stake delegation system so that you can take your staking tokens anyone can delegate to any of the validators or you can run a validate yourself and earn proportion of transaction fees and there's a commission system built in recently there was a blockchain I won't name it but they had a delegation system that allowed the the validator or designer to to run off with the earnings and the fees from the delegate errs but we've implemented a novel and a very efficient system that automatically handles transaction fee distribution on chain so there's just like yeah there's a lot of components that don't need to come together to make this all happen so one thing that is not clear to me is why would I use cosmos rather than simply exchanging the tokens on an exchange or using an atomic swap well you can use if you use an exchange to to swap tokens let's say you have our coins on unbar chain and foo coins on food chain and and you what you have bar coins in but food chain has the functionality that you need because it has the smart contract system or the privacy features that you want that bar chain doesn't then you would have to and you would have the trade bar codes for food points but with the cosmo system in via two-way pegging and IBC connections you can use the same tokens on any of the chains that accept them so you're essentially using the same tokens although it's 2a pegged and that opens the door to a simplified model for everyone so you don't have to keep track of different tokens and all those different chains I think maybe maybe a good analogy for you know that question is it kind of sounds similar to me saying like you know why would I use the internet when I could just use AOL you know so the internet opens up a whole new host of possibilities both for people building applications and for people using them that aren't really accessible through the kind of centralized gateway of an exchange or even just like a you know a two-way atomic swap and so the kind of goal of the cosmos network is to really blow open the the design space of possibilities for building new kinds of block chains that can communicate with one another and you know we're only we're at the very beginning of that experimentation here's your so that may be just one more analogy so let's say you want to scale aetherium because a single etherion chain can only process so many transactions per second once we peg once we've connected a theory of main that you can send your ether tokens to any number of EVM based chains so there could be a hundred EVM powered block chains all connected to cosmos hub and so now we have an overall through code that is a hundred times greater than done a single aetherium chain all using the same token all right and then one other thing I feel like I need to understand here is so the cosmos hub is one of the block chains that will exist in this system and hubs have zones that are associated with them so what are the zones and who builds the zone like is it you guys that build his own or because like so like for instance you know z cash have a zone would it be that Z cash developers would need to build that or like how does that how do you get these other chains to you know build these zones on your network and also what would it what happens in the zone and how does it relate to the original blockchain so as though zone zones and hubs are just kind of relativistic distinctions between different block chains that more or less refer to the connectivity between them so hub is a block chain just like a zone is a block chain and anyone can build you know these kinds of block chains and permission is permissionless Li connect them that that's kind of the key goal right so the cosmos hub is is up and on line and anyone who who wants that who has built a block chain on top of tender mint and that implements you know the IBC protocol which they would get for free if they use the cosmos SDK but they could implement themselves that they were using a different system would then be able to assuming they have a set of validators running their blockchain you know whatever that set might be they would then be able to connect with the cosmos hub and engage in you know in in these kind of one-way token transfers and data transfers through the cosmos ha and so in wait and so just so I'm clear so the cosmos have only supports block chains running on the tenement consensus algorithm and it's only ever okay so then at some point you'll build out support for other types of consensus algorithms we would like to so so really what this comes down to is the IBC protocol right and the IBC protocol has a number of requirements for you know a consensus system and for a blockchain to be able to utilize it and right now we are you know tenorman is our main reference point for what that should look like but we're trying to design the IBC specification to be generalized enough so that any other kind of blockchain consensus system that satisfied the same kind of guarantees that tenorman does would also be able to participate in this kind of IBC eco system and then one other thing that I've seen is that in order to connect to cosmos block chains it's best if the blockchain has fast final finality rather than probabilistic finality and Bitcoin and aetherium have probabilistic financial finality and they're the most popular blockchain so can you define fast finality versus probabilistic finality let's start there just just to find the difference between the two sure and so this is exactly the kind of property I was talking about with with respect to IVC that that tenorman provides so any other you know consensus algorithm that would provide this kind of fast finality and a few other things would would fit within the IBC framework basically what faster now and he means is that the protocol is designed such that within the assumptions of the protocol which are you know which tend to be that you know less than a third of the participants or of the voting power are malicious so within those assumptions when a block is is created and voted on and committed it's finalized and that happens very quickly and what that means finalized is that it will not later be reverted there's no there's no way within the protocol for a block to be undone once it's been committed right and so that's kind of what we mean by fast finality that this finalization process whereby you have a strong guarantee within the protocol that the block is committed it happens very quickly right and we can contrast that with this kind of probabilistic finality that proof of work based block chains offer like Bitcoin and aetherium we're technically theoretically and you know also in practice blocks can actually be reverted at any time as part of the protocol right so in the Bitcoin protocol you know blocks can be orphaned which means a miner mines block sends it up to the network but other mine another miner mined a block at the same height and other people built on top of that one and so one of the blocks you know even though it was created and people saw it and even if you know possibly a few blocks were built on top of it it still gets reverted right and that's part and that's part of the protocol where you have to wait some number of blocks you know in Bitcoin they typically say six before the probability that it will be reverted is low enough that you can have enough confidence to you know continue on with your economic or commercial activity right and so dealing with that kind of probabilistic nature of the commit of a block makes it very difficult to build these kinds of interoperability protocols because you don't know you know once a block has been committed you don't really know when when that commit is bender if it's gonna be reverted you don't get the same kind of guarantee right so let's face it the difference is that in a probabilistic probabilistically final protocol blocks can be reverted like undone as part of the protocol whereas in something with fat with fast finality like tenorman once a block is committed you know it's never reverted of course if the assumptions of the protocol fail like you know maybe more than a third of the validators happen to be malicious then you know the guarantees at least some of these guarantees you know could fail and then blocks to be reverted but that would be considered a failure state rather than just like a normal occurrence and once once it fails there's a there's a way to figure out which greater than a 1/3 of voting power is responsible for it and recover from it and just one thing I want to mention is that it's it's fast finality in a sense also that blocks can be committed very quickly so in into cosmos hub for example blocks are committed once every six seconds ok so yeah I actually wanted to ask about validation in the cosmos at work because see you guys will only have 100 validators to start is that really sufficient to secure the chain like how can you be sure that because as far as I understand so if as you mentioned it can go into a failure state if more than 1/3 of the voting power it's like is not there so and that's all that's necessary I think to create a fork right so that would be 33 validators how like it just feels like it's so easy that it's gonna fail it's actually much less than 33 right now because it's it's there is 33% of the you know it's one third of the total voting power right and so I think right now that's you know about 5 validators if they if they got together they would control more than one-third of the voting power so you know obviously it could be much better than that and we would like to see it decentralized far beyond 5 I think it's important to note that a few things first of all the faults are attributable which means that if if this one third or more than one-third gets together to you know maliciously fork the blockchain or revert blocks or whatever they can't do that the them doing that is attributable so anyone else looking at that will know who was involved right and so you know the community then could say okay well these guys are untrustworthy we know that they're the bad guys because there's you know irrefutable proof that they did it and so we can we'll make a new blockchain and you know and fork them out and so to some extent I mean but they could just like change their identity and hook up to the new blockchain it would be like not exactly a simple attack but do you not I mean good but they wouldn't necessarily have stake in the new blockchain because the new block saying could say well we're gonna eliminate all those validator stake and kind of start again over here right okay but they could obtain snake again absolutely absolutely you wouldn't you wrote it won't seem entity you wouldn't you could write because part of part of the proof of stake system is that you have to attract that you have to attract delegate errs and part of doing that is establishing you know a robust public identity and so if you look at the top validators at least on cosmos they're all publicly identifiable publicly recognisable entities who have significant reputation Archelon so to some extent at least there is this kind of you know business relationship or business offering that these people are positioning for and that that helps to kind of secure this in a way that you know is maybe blasphemous in the eyes say a Bitcoin maximalist but I think is part of the reality of the next generation of blonde chicks if I may I'll try to draw an analogy to to Bitcoin so in Bitcoin there's a lot of miners but there's only so many mining pools within the top 99 percentile and even to get to 51% of proof-of-work voting powder is only a handful maybe even less than five today of mining pools imagine if so in Bitcoin if the mining pools were to get together and and conduct a 51% attack or a double spend then they would lose the energy that they spent for it say the one hour or however many hours however many blocks just a handful once that would be lost but they would not lose their mining infrastructure but in a proof of state system they would lose all of their stake so it's as if the miners were to lose all of their like their it's as if their money equipment or to blow up so it's potentially even significantly even more secure that's interesting and also earlier you are saying that essentially you would just fork the system so but then you still have oh well no I guess at that point you would solicit new validators because otherwise then you have like even reduced a reduced number of validators do you know what I'm saying like like if you fork and you get rid of the bad actors then you're starting off with a pool of validators that's even smaller than before and is even more game of all well but but it's likely that the distribution of steak will be a little bit more uniform right because if it was before concentrated in the top five and you've gotten rid of the top five then your new validator set is gonna be more more evenly distributed now that you know there's there's a lot of parameters around how this would actually shake out with respect to the new token that would be created by this fork and what the value of that token is and how much would actually be at stake so you know you're right that there are significant concerns and security issues around this but you know we believe that this is a an alternative system to what exists with with proof-of-work and that is more secure in many respects and at the very least there is significant skin in the game there's a lot more at stake for people participating and there's kind of this new opportunity to build you know resilient fault tolerant networks with certain you know very strong guarantees that you can actually at least look at and understand the guarantees and understand the failure mode and what the risk is right and in the same way that there are risks that the banks collude that in existing systems you know things will go wrong but it's all you know behind closed doors and there's not much transparency and you can't really you can't really analyze the structure of the system in the same way at least here all of that is kind of out on the table you know there's a lot of encouragement for the identities of the validators to be public and all right we're gonna discuss more about security after the break but first a quick word from our fabulous sponsors ethereal summit returns to New York City this May 10th to 11th to kick off blockchain week and offer you a chance to go deep into the heart of crypto blockchain and aetherium ethereal summit is where you can get up close with the builders of blockchain and aetherium including many guests from laura's podcasts like amber bal day to char jane amin sulemani Chris Byrne iski and Mike Novogratz head to ethereal summit comm with the discount code Laura 20 to get 20% off tickets to join Laura and hundreds of the brightest minds in Bach chain at ethereal summit New York May 10th and 11th at Pioneer works in Brooklyn did you know that if money laundering were an economy its GDP would be the size of Canada's large volumes of tainted crypto assets move through financial networks often below the radar of banks cyber criminals use unregulated crypto exchanges to avoid detection no wonder governments around the world are rolling out tough new anti money laundering laws for crypto currencies complying with those laws isn't easy banks and exchanges need the best cryptocurrency intelligence available to avoid penalties now you can use the same powerful AML and compliance monitoring tools used by regulators cipher trace is securing the crypto economy to learn more visit cypher trace comm slash Unchained back to my conversation with Jake Juan and Ethan Buchman of tender mint and cosmos so I mean you guys admit already that you know right now this system is not very secure what's your plan to get more well I don't even know how you would do it but it sounds to me like you would need more validators am i right we admit the system's not very secure I mean security is a very very dense complex topic and there's a lot of dimensions to it and in some ways well I mean when you said that it would only take five validators because of the way things are delegated - sure there's only things like three mining pools - you know to collude to have a 51% attack on Bitcoin so it's already more decentralized than Bitcoin okay okay so so you feel comfortable with where you guys are at you don't feel we're sure that this is the right way to do it and here's just one more example well okay first I want to address your point earlier it once there's an attack those foul daters who conducted the attack and they're greater than 1/3 of the total stake that's bonded would disappear they would they would get slashed out and there would be say 95 or 95 days left but more validators can enter and the delegations would change to accommodate but okay so that's one aspect but I think the more important aspect and the greater purpose of or the reason why this is necessary for a scalable cryptocurrency ecosystem is because with proof of work you're relying on miners who are so anonymous that it's really easy for a small chain or any any chain that say not Bitcoin to get 51% attacked and like I mentioned earlier the miners would not get punished much I mean they would not be found their energy will be wasted but that opportunity cost is small compared to how much they might gain and so with a proof of work system or if you only had proof of work you can't really have more than one secure blockchain with proof of stake and tender mint Byzantine fault tolerant based proof of stake especially the security of one chain is independent of external actors no matter how much computation power a nation-state may have if a if if one blockchain and their validators didn't want to double spend the chain then they will remain secure there's just no way from an extra for an external actor to affect the security of a chain in a proof state system okay and what you mean by that because that was a question I was gonna ask you later on so what you're saying is a nation state can go to a minor on a proof-of-work blockchain and shut down their mining equipment or cut off their access to electricity but here they can't force somebody to unbond their state or I don't know if if I've used the terms correctly but they can't force them to to move the coins out of their stake is that what you're saying I mean any actor including a colluding set of powerful miners with powerful electricity and mining infrastructure could attack any other chain as long as their mining equipment and approval for algorithm or you know compatible and largely they are whereas in a perfect system you can't you can't attack that externally with with proof of work or computation power so even if no matter how much money an organization or even a nation-state were to have sure if if if they were to cut all the access to you know the global Internet infrastructure or then you know everything is off the table but you know beyond that it's it's a very secure system okay this is interesting but one other thing I wanted to ask about the number of validators you have so in your white paper you showed how with 64 validators you can get about 4,000 transactions per second or it was in the single-digit thousands but it wasn't tens of thousands and you know over time you guys plan an increase to like 300 validators so would that then decrease the amount of of transactions per second because because in in the white paper the graphics showed that the more validators you have the fewer transactions you get for a second like when it's you know four or whatever it was like in the tens of thousands but so how do you plan to you know kind of increase the number of alligators but then also keep the throughput high so that paper was describing the the performance characteristics of tender bent and largely the the biggest thing that happens with many like a lot more validators say a thousand validators versus a hundred is that your block commits time gets gets slower so as opposed to say five second blocks you might and it might take 15 seconds but and the reason why is because this kind of consensus system that we're building classical Byzantine fault tolerant algorithms that tenorman is based off of requires quite a bit of communication overhead so that's why we limit it to 100 validators today but I would say that a block chain you know a public bought chain especially should really be a ledger and application that can run on any laptop it should be able to run on on a typical workstation and so because otherwise developers don't have access to rank the blockchain should be accessible anyone should be able to sync with it so I would say you don't want that many transactions per second on a single blockchain instead what we focus on is providing horizontal scalability by allowing coordination among many block chains in order to get overall higher transaction throughput and by that you mean like you'll have multiple hubs that are working within the cosmos network and so people can if one hub is kind of at its max then they can just go to another hub is that what you're saying primarily what I mean is having many many zones or many block chains connected to a hub so by virtue of say having a hundred block chains connected to the hub you get you get a hundred times a throughput than having a single block chain but you can also have a hierarchy or it doesn't have to be hierarchy you can have a network of hubs as well huh okay that's interesting so one other thing I want to draw out not only for the listeners but also for myself because I've heard this term so many times and I think I sort of understand it but I could not explain it in simple terms to somebody else so that's why I'm not really sure if I understand it so when describing your consensus algorithm you all you're always talking about practical Byzantine fault tolerance what what exactly does that mean practical Byzantine fault tolerance it was a consensus algorithm that was described I believe in a 1999 paper so I'll just give a really brief history of these non proof-of-work classical Byzantine consensus algorithms it started with in about the 70s or so it's a in academia into papers and in literature there have been a lot of research into Byzantine fault tolerant consensus algorithms that don't use proof of work and then of course but can you describe what Byzantine fault tolerant means okay Byzantine means arbitrary or malicious behavior so in a public blockchain because it's an open system where anyone can participate you need to be able to tolerate arbitrary behavior especially behavior that is malicious and trying to attack say fork the blockchain so Byzantine fault tolerance means the ability to tolerate malicious behavior and there's always a there's always a limitation to how much fault tolerance a consensus system can tolerate and in proof-of-work that's 49 percent of malicious proof of work Mining power and on the flip side of that okay and but in tenement it's it's it's 33% of voting power the reason why it's 49 verses 33 is because in tenement we designed a system to be fast so it sits what consensus literature calls a partially synchronous model which just means essentially you're trying to make progress as soon as possible and you're acknowledging that the network might have some delays Bitcoin can tolerate slightly more 49% but it's also slower and bought times are ten minutes each and you have to wait an hour and all of that is because it makes the assumption it makes less assumptions or actually stronger assumptions about the network and and it requires that much time to ensure that blocks can fully propagate it's answering question I think so Laura can you explain to us now what visiting fault tolerance is so basically it's a way of designing a system where the system can still be secure even if there is some threshold of or you know under under a certain threshold of bad actors is that that's right that's right I mean that's basically right so the the industrial context for this the reason you know academics started working on it is because humans decided they wanted to use computers to fly airplanes and when you put a computer on an airplane 30,000 feet in the air it's in a very hostile environment there's a lot of incoming radiation and the bits could arbitrarily flip and the computer could fail in weird ways or not just crash but explicitly do something that it wasn't programmed to do like some incorrect behavior right and so the challenge that was posed to the researchers was how can you build a consensus system between the computers that are on an airplane that is fault tolerant not just to some of those computers crashing but even to some of them doing something incorrect and and you know as part of that it meant well there had to be some kind of a voting algorithm in there so that you would need a quorum you know like some kind of super majority or something and so that you would only you would only say that you know something happened once that large set had agreed on it and even if some of the computers you know are failing in arbitrary ways and telling you incorrect information you know the system would still be okay in your airplane would still fly straight and so that was kind of generalized over time to you know how can we these systems that operate over the internet with many different stakeholders that are participating where they all can stay in sync they're basically sharing a database even though some of the participants might be explicitly malicious or adversarial and the word Byzantine has come to represent any kind of arbitrary you know non non protocol following behavior right so anyone that's acting incorrectly according to the rules of the protocol is effectively visited and so with what's unique you know about the Kosmos hub and where it's security comes from and so on is the fact that it's really the first the first system to use classic Byzantine fault tolerant consensus protocols on the public Internet with real economic value at stake and to even have you know only quote unquote only five you know distinct stakeholders on in multiple jurisdictions across the world you know with more than a third of the state is is a huge step forward for you know computer science and economics in some sense so you know as much as we'd like to improve that further and maybe five isn't enough it's still a huge gap from what was previously just one entity murray but sue i'm glad that you circled back to this because i did want to ask also about what happened during the game of stakes which was this competition that you held in test net because it looks to me like there were some participants who showed how easy it would be to create our cart a cartel amongst the validators with an incident about involving a group called bit fish so can you describe what happened there and then just describe that story first sure so I I think it's important to understand the the the difference between the game estates test and the main net right they're very different conditions and when when we kind of set out to do game mistakes you know there were there were a few things we were going after and and it's possible that we conflated too much at once and that you know in future iterations of Ag a mistakes like thing you want to disentangle the different goals and so one of the goals was really to prepare validators for you know adversarial scenarios and staying online and securing their private keys and you know actually operating the network right because we want experts basically to be to be involved in this and so gay mistakes offer people a real ability to do that the other thing we thought we'd be able to test but I think probably turned out not to be the case was the actual economics of the system and the reason it wasn't an accurate test of the economics is because it was just a short-term game with a minimal amount at stake right so no one had to pay to actually participate you know there were expenses to run observers but no one had to pay an entry cost and there was nothing you wouldn't lose anything right so because you weren't putting anything up if you did something wrong you weren't gonna lose any money there was some reward on the table you know in the form of atoms but it's very short-term game where your reputation wouldn't be damaged if you attack the system maliciously so the game mistakes context is very different from a net and so it's hard to really draw too much learnings on the economic side from game mistakes and apply them to Maine at what did happen on game mistakes which was you know it was very interesting to see is that so so first of all to participate in GAE mistakes you had to complete a kyc process right so we collected quite a bit of information about the participants and and that was required for participation and to actually potentially receive the reward and some curiosity why why if there wasn't real money oh oh because they were being rewarded yeah the reward was in was in Adams right and so basically the the foundation who you know the entertained Foundation which coordinated the game mistakes process said that of its allocation of Adams in the Genesis block you know it would recommend that some of those go towards the winners of game mistakes but in order to do that in a regulatory compliant manner you know it collected kyc information from all the participants and and so on and we also who we also expected that by collecting kyc it would prevent anyone from mounting a civil attack on this on the system err on the game right so that we'd have so that no one would just be able to kind of knock out the game by taking over with 33% of the vote but what ended up happening was there was a civil attack where some group this bit fish group ended up collecting you know signing up using a large number of their relatives and friends and so on to actually register in the process and completed the KYC for them but thereby ended up controlling a significant amount of stake and this was actually a number of people claim to have detect this very early on I saw you know a bunch of nodes come online at the same time and so on and I think people were really curious to see how how it would play out but what ended up happening was they basically came to control a quite a significant portion of the state on the network and so the rest of the the rest of the validators of the rest of the participants basically coordinated to have them removed right so they basically mounted a hard fork to remove that that cabal from from the validator set and and to move on without them yeah it did I read that they eventually collected 55% of the voting powder power I think I think that's about right yeah well so do you feel like the resolution that the remaining validators came up with is something that would actually happen in in you know a normal situation not in a test net situation it's conceivable I don't know I think a single validator collecting that much so there were also some parameter changes on the on the game mistakes that made accumulation of stake and the large validators happen a lot more quickly and so you know that's I thought that's not the case on main net so attaining that much stake in one validator is probably you know far less likely to happen if at all if it did happen I don't know how how the rest of the network would respond it's possible they would do that as possible they would start by you know petitioning online to say oh you know you should decentralize reduce your stake it's kind of like what we saw with I think it was Giga hash the mining pool a few years ago and Bitcoin you know they had close to 50% or at one point over 50% and there was a large you know social effort to have people you know point their miners somewhere else to reduce their stake back down and so you know it's possible the same kind of tactics could be used here um let's move on because we're running out of time one other thing that was curious about so you know I totally get how cosmos is interesting because it enables this interoperability between chains but in a way right now we have something like that on aetherium with all these decentralized apps being able to interact with each other so why should a developer build a block chain using cosmos rather than just launching a decentralized application on a theory where they can tap into this whole ecosystem that's been built there so the main difference here is the is the developer environment right so on a theory um you're confined to the etherium virtual machine which is a very limited and almost a toy version of an execution environment and you're stuck with the languages that were built for that virtual machine which are very young at most a couple years old and you know they're maturing and they're you know everything's improving over time but compared to a well-established language like golang or rust or javascript or anything that people have been writing in for you know a decade if not longer you know the etherium development environment just hails in comparison to that so if you want to be to free yourself from that and to use you know mature language tools and developer tools that you've been using potentially for decades and build a blockchain application in that you know kind of much more friendly and mature development environment you know cosmos offers the opportunity for that I want to be fair today they're in the system and that there's definitely a need for a scripting system say a flexible way to upload arbitrary logic onto a chain and so I think that is a fantastic idea it allows for interoperability with in a single chain so that's great and that will that will remain and I believe solidity you will will remain a useful and important part of the cryptocurrency Co system but there's some limitations to to this one is you're reliant on as of now a single chain so there's only so many transactions per second they can and that the otário main that can handle but also in the case of let's say conflict right it's if you remember what happened with the dow hack Andy Andy Andy hard work that happened from the dow hack there was a lot of discussion and contention about what to do about the situation so in that case what happened was that the chain itself split into two because there wasn't a good governance system built in but you can see how in the case of contention for all kinds of issues in the future there will be more issues like this in general as cryptocurrencies and watch an ecosystem matures and grows it's necessary to have to provide sovereignty to a collection of community that wants to run their own chain so by having the cosmos network and allowing any blockchain to have their own validator set and their own application logic and their own rules and their own governance we believe this is necessary to to come date everyone in in a large new token economy and so there is this proposal for something called ether mint which is the east theory I'm running on tender mint so it's not clear to me how like how would that be different from etherium like what what could people do in ether meant that they couldn't do an etherium or like why would they prefer that environment over aetherium and also is this like something people are actually working on or is it a proposal I couldn't figure that out either so it is it is a real project it's in you know it it's in development it's still in you know it's still kind of alpha software I mean everything is still kind of alpha software but Ethernet Ethernet in particular we've we we had an initial version you know a couple years ago and we've rewritten it to use now the cosmas SDK so that it can integrate very nicely into the cosmos network and the idea there is kind of like like Jay was saying you know as much as as kind of young and novel as that there in virtual machine is it's still extremely valuable to have that kind of a scripting engine where you can just like upload code on the fly and you know there's a huge developer community there and there's a there's a ton of interesting work happening you know being built on top of this virtual machine and and so you know what we built with ether mint was basically a way to support anything you might build on the etherium virtual machine but now running on instead of it running on proof-of-work like it would on the etherium main net it can run on top of tenorman right and so you know you can do anything you could have done on aetherium but now you can do it faster and with with lower latency and on a you know on a blockchain where the validator set of that chain kind of has more sovereignty compared to the rest of the etherium so but the one thing you can't do if you using ether mint is communicate with all the other smart contracts that have been deployed on the etherium maintenance you're on a different blockchain of course so you can't oh so if you stand up in Ethan ok right so anyone could take the ethernet software and run an Ethernet blockchain with some validator set and they could deploy you know they can take any contracts they've written for the etherium maintenance and they could run those on their ethernet deployment right but it's a it's an isolated blockchain and so unless it's connected up through the cosmos network to everything else you know it's kind of stands on its own and even once it is connected up it won't have the same kind of access that a contract on main that aetherium would have to the other contracts on main that aetherium right so we're working on that interoperability piece but it's still you know it's still a little bit away and it's a different it'll be a different kind of interoperability than you would get if you deployed directly to Minya right so if you want to talk directly to other contracts on main and aetherium you pretty much have no choice but to deploy a contract you mean it Syria right it's not like you would create like make er down on ether mint and then suddenly like people would be using the Ethernet die to you know I guess take out loans using Dharma or or put that money into compound and earn interest like stuff so it would basically you'd have to create that whole new ecosystem exactly so you can replicate all of that defy stuff on top of ether mints on cosmos the benefit of doing that would be that there could be a much higher throughput right because you could have well first of all it's running on tenorman so it would be much faster than on on the proof of work public ethereum blockchain but because we can also have the vertical scalability through having multiple Ethernet block chains that are able to connect to one another you could get you know you could overall run more you know they wouldn't have to contend would say crypto kitty say write the crypto kitties transactions to be on one Ethernet blockchain and a bunch of the other dphi stuff could be on another and you know in that way you'd be able to have higher higher throughput through the system I just wanted to add here that we're focusing touken interoperability to start but we will be designing our tech so that eventually it will be possible to also make cross-chain smart contract calls but our focus with the cosmos hub certainly is is just to focus on the token economy you have to start off with but IBC Peggy which is our IBC covalent to connect to thorium eventually can be used for any kind of cross chain interoperability all right and actually I'm glad you brought up tokens again cuz I did also want to ask about atoms so what do atoms do in the cosmos network and for for at this moment if I own atom is what can I do with them atoms are it's that we call it a staking token so it's not meant to be a currency it's not a certainly not a stable coin it's not meant to be something that you transact with regularly but it's may be analogous to virtual Bitcoin miners and that it gives you a voting power on the Kosmos hub so when you stake and you're you're staking tokens your atoms you can participate as a validator or you can delegate your your state's tokens to any other validators and that gives you access to governance you can vote on proposals it also gives you access to transactions fees you can earn transaction fees and any block rewards in the future yeah and since you also mentioned governance it I mean you did mention it earlier as well it sounds like it's done on chain can you describe how that works yeah so it's a very simple governance system where you can make any proposal you want so the the last proposal that passed was just written in English and the idea is that as long as more than 51% of the bonded stakeholders vote in favor of that proposal it passes so there's there's a social consensus layer to these you can imagine there being an implicit Constitution that's also implemented into code there's also a bit of a twist in that a one-third minority can also veto so even though it proposal passes it's possible for it to be vetoed in case there's a small minority that is strongly not in favor of that proposal but that's the basic idea and soon we will have parameter changes as well so through a governance you can tweak the parameters of this blockchain and and certainly you can upgrade a chain through plain English proposals but in the future you can imagine it will also implement automatic upgrading as well and then earlier in the podcast we talked about some of the other I guess these are block chains that are building zones I think I'm just blanking on that the names cosmos SDK there's short names there's there's to look at iris and I know yeah exactly line oh yeah yeah um so but I think there aren't there are other ones that are that are using tender mint as well like is in finance tax using tenorman yeah and and we believe a variant of the cosmos SDK so there's actually a very large number of projects building either directly on tender mint or using the Kosmos SDK for instance loom which is a project that's built around you know pegs to aetherium is built on top of a tournament and then you know there's many others as well so there is this a short term like which would be the change that chains that would be interoperable well it's up to them so the ones that are using the cosmos SDK will get the interoperability kind of out of the box when that when those features land in the SDK and others would have to kind of either either pull them in or make it work within there within the framework they used to build their blockchain application but they would you know that the goal of the IBC specification is to make it general-purpose enough that anyone will be able to implement it you know and be compatible with it regardless of what their of how they built their application on top of tenorman and down the road on top of other kinds of algorithms - mmm and there are other frameworks besides the SDK but people are using as well so there's there's lotion which is an SDK for JavaScript and some projects are even implementing their own or forgoing any frameworks and building directly on top of tenement so for example there's the the Thailand national ID project which is built directly on tenement and in the future they can also interoperate with the cosmos or IBC alright and so now at Enderman the company has launched cosmos but you guys also recently raised nine million dollars led by paradigm which is the crypto VC firm that was launched by Fredersen the co-founder of coin base and Matt Huang formerly of Sequoia Capital so what's next for for you guys like what are you focused on just just a bit of clarification contender mint is the software provider and it was the entertained foundation technically that lost a chain okay yeah but no problem we're it was the community that launched the change let's be real here it was another decentralized neither neither the company nor the interchange foundation that we're actually running validators so the the network launched completely independent of those entities which was quite cool to see in case anyone from the SEC is listening or anyone else who's interested in this decentralized launch of cryptocurrency networks we're currently focused on completing the infrastructure so IBC is a big one Peggy is the next but tender made the company is also soon after we're done with all of this will be developing actual applications so looking for a sustainable source of revenue in two prongs one something into financial space and something else that's a little less financial that we can't talk about yet but would love to discuss as soon as you can okay well I guess maybe I'll open with that the next time I have you guys don't unchain so where can people learn more about you and cosmos and tender mint and the entertainment nation and etc etc respective websites so the main the main cosmos website is cosmos Network and especially if you check out you know cosmos network / launch there are a list of block explorers there where you can go you know there's a whole bunch of community built block explorers where you can explore the network see the validators there's also loonie which is listed there Looney IO which is a wallet system that was built for interacting with with the cosmos network and exploring it and then tenorman of course tender mint calm and that's that's a site both for the company and for the product tender mint and then for the interchange foundation there's interchange I Oh which is just the homepage for for this misconduct great alright well thanks so much for coming on unchanged thank you so much for having us thank you Laura it's
