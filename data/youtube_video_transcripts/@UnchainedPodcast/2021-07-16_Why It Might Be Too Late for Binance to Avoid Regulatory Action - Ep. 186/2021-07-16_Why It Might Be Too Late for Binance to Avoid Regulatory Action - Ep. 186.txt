blockchain protocol learn more at near.org today's guest is christine parker partner reed smith she focuses on regulatory and enforcement actions in the areas of commodities derivatives and cryptocurrencies welcome christine hey thanks for having me in recent weeks binance has become the subject of a number of warnings or announced investigations by regulators across several jurisdictions so we're recording on thursday june 15th and just this morning there was yet another one where a talent italy's securities regulator consub said binance was unauthorized to offer services in the country can you give an overview of the various notices and actions against binance in recent weeks sure they certainly are sailing into head some headwinds and just to be clear when we talk about finance i'm talking about finance finance which is the sort of the the global uh derivatives exchange that doesn't really sit in any particular jurisdiction and market participants investors have been accessing it through their website for a number of years now so just to distinguish that by dance from the sort of the finances that sit in a number of different jurisdictions including the us so the larger finance entity has absolutely attracted the attention of regulators um in the u.s in the uk italy and and a number of other jurisdictions and you know in particular in the u.s we understand that the cftc the department of justice um and the irs are all looking into their activities presumably um as a derivatives exchange that is being accessed by u.s customers but we obviously don't know the facts similarly in the uk um the fca uh restricted access as of june 30th to to retail customers in the uk likely along along the similar lines as to the investigations in the u.s and and the italian authorities essentially said the same thing you know uh italian customers are not allowed to receive any you know investment advice from finance or to do any trading activities um on the sort of larger global exchange yeah and some of the others have been japan's financial services agency which issued a second warning about binance the ontario securities commission said finance failed to comply with local regulations thailand announced it filed a criminal complaint against finance for unregistered operations the cayman islands said that finance group and binance holding ltd were not authorized to operate there and singapore is um announced that it's watching two finance entities and also poland's financial regulator caution against using exchange so it's quite the list and even in the u.s silvergate bank also cut off withdrawals and deposits for binance but not for binance us the u.s entity as you mentioned earlier what is the significance of all these actions and announcements that's a great question um i would have to say i think the the the finances the has certainly been on the radar of the global regulators for some period of time but i certainly think the lack of jurisdiction of the entity itself has really hampered their efforts and ability to bring these actions um against them typically in the cross-border setting what we see is the regulators will submit an mou or work through an mou with a foreign regulator in a foreign jurisdiction and they'll submit their request for information or their subpoena or what have you that's been a challenge with binance because it's really kind of hard to pin down what their actual jurisdiction is and so um i certainly think that has slowed things down but i i'm certain that finance has been um on the the radar of the regulator certainly the u.s regulators for a number of years now what do you think is the likely outcome of all these reports about these because especially for the us ones it was you know not 100 clear whether or not you know they really were they probably are but you know it was just reported and not generally confirmed so what do you think is the likelihood that these reports are accurate and if and when do you think these inquiries would result in an enforcement action my guess is that the reports are very accurate you know i think we've got some precedence in the bitmex case where we we heard reports of the cftc and doj were investigating them and that turned out to be correct my guess is that probably in the next six to nine months you'll see either a settlement with the cftc doj and irs or not um in which case they will likely um seek to sort of enjoy their activities in the u.s and and uh charge them for whatever violations of law u.s law that are applicable in you know the southern district of new york um or perhaps washington dc given the number of federal agencies that are involved in the case and then what would the trajectory of finance be after that i think it's unclear when you take into account the uh the activities of finance us you know for them the best resolution would be of something very speedy um uh some kind of settlement with finance um to allow them to move forward in the us with the us regulators with a somewhat clean slate but you know there just may be a different of opinions finance may take the view um you know we're engaging in activity in our jurisdiction wherever that is that's unregulated and they may want to fight the case they may not want to settle with the regulators and create some interesting precedent but i do think that there will be tensions with finance us i mean obviously separate enemies that will make it i think much harder for finance u.s to move forward in the u.s if finance the sort of parent company fighting any charges bought by u.s regulators binance has been hiring a number of former regulators or compliance directors from other big fintechs to key roles and as advisors for instance former financial action task force executive secretary mcdonald and former head of the canadian delegation to the fat f jose nadal were appointed as compliance and regulatory advisors and also max bacchus the former u.s senator for montana and u.s ambassador to china will also provide high-level guidance what's your sense of how effective this strategy will be um it is certainly worth pursuing it's certainly worth trying i think finance u.s and finance are sort of are certainly um sailing into headwinds in the us partially of their own making but also just sort of the currency to play here in the us with respect to crypto at congress and with the regulator so you know on one hand i think it clearly shows up and demonstrates that they want to turn the corner and sort of move forward with a with a new you know attention to laws and statutes and regulations and compliance and the like and really want to put their best foot forward you know when dealing with regulators in the u.s and with the global regulatory body so that certainly makes sense it should be effective but i i think we're just in the us in particular we're really at sort of um a challenging point in the the innovation of crypto and and by that i mean there's a lot of conservation on the hill with crypto they're certainly supporters there are certainly members of congress that are interested um and have areas of interest but you have vocal members of congress who are not supporters of crypto and and the regulators in the us hear that and see that so you know max baucus can certainly be an effective advocate for finance in the crypto industry at large but there are a lot of folks he's gotta be talking to on the hill um and they've got to change their tune and the regulators have to feel comfortable and convinced that the you know the hill is now supportive of crypto so they've got the right players they're going to action them i think the question is you know does that is that enough to surmount those in congress who are not supporters of crypto and you know that's not just binance but certainly you know they look to the finance holding company as a key example of you know what they don't like in the crypto space so there are certainly challenges but you know they've identified uh key players that could really be effective but it's it's an issue that's larger than just them so in a moment we'll dive more into how things might unfold for binance but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible with over 10 million users

audiences come learn why nier is the infrastructure for innovation at nea.org back to my conversation with christine parker in the 2018 interview i did with finance ceo chiang pang zhao who goes by the name cz i asked him about about binance's history of leaving jurisdictions when it looks like regulators might clamp down on finance and this was very early on when you know they would like leave china or japan or you know whatever these when these regulators kind of started making noise and at that time he responded to me quote what's wrong with going to a country where da da things are viewed favorably for you why do you have to be stuck in a country that is not good for this kind of stuff meaning for crypto this is like saying if you don't like hot places why don't you stick yourself in florida in the sun all the time so at this point in time three years later how well do you think that this modus operandi has served finance well on on one hand they have incredible market share incredible liquidity you know they're they're if not the biggest they're they're one of the biggest out there the biggest okay so they are they are the biggest and everybody wants to trade on them they've got liquidity they've got leverage they've got the products that you know retail customers in the us are pretty much anywhere else can't access so in one hand you know this approach has allowed them to build up an incredible market presence on the other hand the regulators hate it they don't think that it makes them a you know a credible partner in being sort of a responsible yet innovative crypto company that they want their retail investors to have access to it is a certainly a viable approach but i think if you want to have continuing access to retail investors from the larger jurisdictions that won't last forever so i think we're seeing that now i think we're sort of at that inflection point that being said there is not that much that uh u.s regulators can do to prevent u.s customers from accessing finance all it really takes is a website and a vpn you know i think the the key tension will be with their payment partners and you know whether customers can continue to trade and withdraw their money or deposit funds it's um you know i think it's helped them to build an incredible market but i think in the long term there are challenges to that approach and and receive them right now in a recent blog post cz cited a number of ways in which binance plans to become more compliant and one of the techniques he mentioned was that it would localize its operations similar to how binance u.s is an independent entity compliant and regulated in the u.s do you think that will be an effective strategy or is that going to sap binance of its strength and being able to source liquidity from around the globe that's a great question from from a regulatory and legal perspective it is a great approach because every jurisdiction takes a different approach to what's essentially the regulation of derivatives and there's some commonality but it's a it's a pretty local regime and so the us and the uk and singapore all have different approaches particularly with respect to retail customers so on one hand you know that will hopefully put them in the good graces of the u.s regulators on the other hand exactly to your point they are going to lose that global liquidity because the cross-border you know regulations are really tough when it comes to retail participants trading on derivatives exchange and there's just not that cross-border liquidity that you see right now with finance so yes they will you know it allow them to stand up in the u.s but they're going to lose that global you know liquidity also in the u.s we don't have any leveraged products available for retail customers anyway so it's going to reduce their offerings which will be less attractive to retail investors in the us and you lose that global pool of liquidity that being said it puts you in the good graces of the regulator so there's essentially some benefit to that and do you think that there are any other good strategies binance can use now to avoid penalties or enforcement actions the ship might have sailed on that one it might it might be too late for that you know the the it's it's really um a strict liability test in the u.s you know if you offer derivatives and you're unregulated in the us and you allow us customers to access that that exchange you know um even if they pivot now it's it's too late to sort of clean up the past bad acts but that being said again they're standing up finance us it seems like their plan is to work with the regulators to stand up a new entity and hopefully they will be successful in pushing the regulators to allow more regulated products that are more commercially attractive to retail customers i.e products that have leverage we just heard the news that shapeshift will be moving over to a decentralized exchange and finance of course has the binance smart chain do you think that binance could switch to a dex and in that way avoid at least maybe if not enforcement actions due to past behavior at least going forward they they could that by dance could could certainly take that approach again i don't know if it absolves them of prior misconduct and their decks would have to be in compliance with um local regulation whatever applies in the circumstances of how it turns itself into you know a decentralized entity certainly um a possibility for them going forward i'm not sure that it's all their current issues all right and then earlier you mentioned bit max based off of what uh has happened there with the cftc and doj enforcement actions against that exchange what would you say is the relevance there for binance in terms of you know what is this spell for them most likely uh great question i i think i mean look if they're if they're gonna take the same route you know you don't know until you don't know but i think they're probably very similar allegations against finance that there are against bitmex in which they've they're operating an offshore unregulated exchange or futures commission merchant fcm they they should be regulated and they are not conducting themselves as if they are regulated that was another charge a novel charge the ctc brought and you know they failed to do into money laundering compliance under you know bank secrecy act requirements as they would be required to do if they were regulated in the us i mean i think that's a pretty clear roadmap going forward and so you think then it could result in criminal charges against perhaps cz or other executives i don't know i was really surprised by the criminal charges against the founders of vip mix i mean that that was really something i would not want to see that as a tool necessarily going forward used by the regulators in this space but you know i'm not this other district of new york you know us attorney it's certainly they they have the precedence okay all right well i guess we will have to check back to see what comes of all this but um it's been such a pleasure talking to you and thank you so much for coming on unconfirmed thank you so much for having me this is a great conversation don't forget next up is the weekly news recap stick around for the speaking crypto after this short
