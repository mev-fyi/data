long time coming and i think the new redesign looks awesome as we've done on youtube and on the podcast platforms we've also now retired the unconfirmed brand on the site so now the friday shows will also be branded unchained be sure to check out the beautiful new redesign at unchainedpodcast.com second my book publishes in less than two months i've been sending it to a few early readers to get blurbs and also for ideas for nfts and i just wanted to share with you one early reader's reaction this person quote absolutely devoured the book in two days which is pretty crazy because i wrote a really fat book they also said they were enthralled their word and that they felt the book really brought to life the various players included in it this is someone who's been involved in the space for years but was not right in the middle of the action and they could not put it down so if you're looking for a good read that's all about crypto pre-order the cryptopians idealism greed lies and the making of the first big cryptocurrency craze today at bitly slash cryptopians that's b i t dot l y c c-r-y-p-t-o-p-i-a-n-s the book comes out 2 22-22 and so you'll have it just in time for spring break again pre-order the cryptopians at bentley cryptopians and now on to the show hi everyone welcome to unchained your no hype resource for all things crypto i'm your host laura shin a journalist with over two decades of experience i started covering crypto six years ago and as the senior editor at forbes was the first mainstream media reporter to cover cryptocurrency full-time this is the january 4th 2022 episode of unchained happy new years everyone buy earn and spend crypto on the crypto.com app new users can enjoy zero credit card fees on crypto purchases in the first 30 days download the crypto.com app and get 25 with the code laura link in the description today's topic is the 2022 crypto markets here to discuss are larry cermak vp of research at the block and igor igam berdeev director of research and data at the block welcome larry and igor hey laura great to be here again hey so let's start by discussing what the state of the crypto markets was at the end of 2021 what would you say where the top line points from last year sure uh so for 2021 um i would say we saw crypto really reach mainstream for the first time or at least trying to attempt to reach mainstream we saw obviously massive upkick of institutional adoption uh with the announcement of tesla buying bitcoin everything kicked off significantly like you could see it even on the on our research business the interest just went like up like 100x on the institutional side because uh because of tesla it kind of breached people's mainstream and then and then also it was the year of player one networks uh outside of ethereum getting a lot of adoption and then i would say last one uh just nfts completely going uh bananas and and just reaching even the normal people that normally don't care about crypto uh don't care about finance don't care about changing money but they they care about some like digital scarcity and they wanted to own a piece of something an igor what what do you think so i also like sell a lot of adoption even in terms of uh some like new tokens like ship and some flocky tokens because a lot of people use uh like coinbase wallet to trade all this tokens and uh we also saw a lot of uh adoption terms for talking like people uh and trying to like create some dow for buying some nfts or some like rare stuff so yeah we'll definitely see more adoption in the next year so this was the first time after the most recent bitcoin having where we didn't see a blow off top near the end of the calendar year like roughly kind of 18 months after why do you think we didn't see that and i did see at least one person natasha che tweeting that she thought we entered the so-called super cycle in which we stop going through these crazy bull markets and then have these long bear markets afterward and instead now the market will kind of go in a more steady fashion what do you think do you agree or or you know what does this indicate to you yeah i would say i definitely roughly agree with that idea i think in general there's probably going to be still some some bear markets and and as we saw like crypto is still relatively correlated to what happens in macro so there could be some bear markets but i think uh they're going to be much shorter because the space has just matured so much like if we compare it to something like 20 2018 and 2019 back then i think the market was still not 100 sure that crypto was something that was going to like stay and that was going to actually be used by people uh and i think we've breached that now where you know there's a lot of people that use crypto there's a lot of people that rely on crypto and i think it's it's become obvious to retail investors and institutional investors that this is something that's going to stay and i think the biggest difference from what we saw you know 2017-2018 is that there is now not perfect relation of all the assets in crypto it behaves much more as a more mature asset class where you have like different sub sectors like nfts like like d5 2.0 uh like d5 and a few other ones that behave almost like in its own cycles uh and i think that by itself is is really bullish uh because it shows that like i said the crypto is just more accepted and more viewed as a mature mature asset class and i don't think there's going to be another like two or three year bear market and igor what do you think yeah so i totally agree with larry dwinest because yeah in this cycle we have a lot of like narratives like nft like gaming all these things and also another reason is uh we also saw a lot of you know like mainstream influence like tick tockers all people just uh trying to jump in various like cryptos and this is a fresh money on this market so i think yeah that's also one of the reason why we stay like uh on the top and krypto has just like become so so interesting to young people i think like that that i mean it was a little bit of a case of like 2017 2018 but now it's almost like a interesting thing to do and for a lot of people that i talk to it's more interesting than like trading equities and being interested in that because this is just like much freer market and i think that's also affecting like how people are viewing this because younger people in general are just like so much more inclined to to be interested in this asset class and i don't think that's going to go away anytime soon all right so yeah i i kind of broadly agree with you both and for that reason i'm super excited to see what happens in 2022 because i think it'll be kind of just like something that we really haven't seen before in crypto you know i think before people kind of expected the cycles to happen a certain way and um you know i think this year it will be something new and different so at the end of 2021 you guys released this monster report on kind of all things across the whole entire sector so i'm actually just going to now kind of go somewhat step by step through the report and so why don't we start with the first topic in the report which was actually one of the biggest shifts last year which was the change in mining particularly bitcoin mining because china banned mining in the country so why don't we just talk a little bit about what it was that you guys were seeing in terms of the state of bitcoin mining and um basically what you think will happen going forward yeah so i mean obviously the biggest development uh last year was was the china ban uh which completely shifted dynamics like before bitcoin was predominantly mine in china i mean even though the dominance was like slightly decreasing it was super important you know all mining machines are still made in china are the vast majority in china there's a super cheap power as well so it made a lot of sense and when china stepped in it completely changed the dynamic of like how where mining happens now and so we've gone from i think a little bit more than 50 in china to now zero and and a lot of that hash rate has moved to other countries like kazakhstan a lot of it has gone into the us so now you know yesterday and i think uh i mean just like these days foundry usa the the u.s based mining pool that only mines in the us is is number one uh which was not even close to being true uh before this happened in china and you know mining is now more uh more common in kazakhstan a little bit more in russia as well malaysia a lot of that has shifted and i think what it showed people is that despite that massive like 50 hash rate drop it was relatively fast uh how the hash rate relocated and it was relatively kind of painless of what ended up happening i mean there's obviously a bad price effect but just in general the hash rate has recovered in about like four or five months like if we look at hashrate today it's it's it should be already a little bit higher than what it was prior to the crash and that just shows that bitcoin is more resilient than i think some people thought that it was almost like one of the things that people always brought up is that it's too reliant on china in terms of mining and you know now we saw that in three or four months that can be fixed and nothing really bad ended up happening in that time so i think it was just kind of a resilience test uh and it's also probably to the benefit that a lot of a lot more mining right now happens in the us which is just much more predictable uh china was always a risk where you had no idea what they would do so to be honest yeah i'm not like an expert in the sphere of bitcoin mining but yeah i could like say something about mining in russia because yeah you know like in russia we have like a lot of cheap energy mainly because of like electric stations uh on rivers but also we don't have a like any understanding of regulations in the future so this is the reason why a couple of my friends who yeah who like were minors which like rented some like space just moved to georgia mainly uh only because of the lack of regulation right now and also like a lot of uh like talks uh about regulation russia right now is kind of negative so yeah people just don't know what's uh the next move of like russian governance so and do you guys want to say anything i'll say about the state of ethereum mining particularly after the implementation of eip-1559 because obviously that did have an effect on transaction fees for ethereum miners yeah what i would say what i think it was the most surprising to me uh in 2021 was that ethereum miners actually end up making almost exactly the same amount of money in revenue as as bitcoin miners if you look at if you make the assumption that they sell after right after mining and there are two reasons for that i mean one is that ethereum interest and price obviously just increased significantly more at bitcoins but second also that uh prior to eip 1559 but even a little bit after that ethereum is is used a lot and because of that people are willing to pay really high fees so if you look at like the ratio between uh between the fees and the total mine amount for ethereum is obviously super super high for bitcoin it's quite low uh so so that that was the most surprising to me but i would say just in general you know after eip1559 revenues decreased a bit obviously miners make a little bit less uh but just generally you know there is now this like expectation of of the merge happening at some point in the future and then ethereum actually switching off mining so i think miners are becoming a little bit more cautious of that uh but just in general you know generating 15 billion dollars uh is is a lot of money on on a yearly basis in this year miners found the new like revenue stream is uh mav extraction so yeah i i don't think that like right now uh like mev could help uh miners to like avoid all drawbacks from eap uh yeah but anyway it's like additional from two to ten percent of revenue so okay all right so now let's talk about venture funding there was just a lot of news that you guys had in your report about that so why don't we just discuss kind of in an overview what you found in terms of the state of venture funding in 2021 and where you think we're going for 2022 and then we can talk a little bit about some of the specific trends yeah absolutely so i think like the one really quick summary would be that venture funding overall has just increased significantly like when you look at the chart that we have in the report and kind of looking at the at the vc funding year over year i mean we've gone from about like three or four billion to about 25 billion uh just like year over year and then that in basically any chart when you see something like that just a complete uh outlier uh it's very significant uh and i mean no one could miss all the announcements that we saw from vc firms over the last like three or four months raising billions of dollars of capital and all that obviously ends up trickling into crypto a lot of it ends up going into seed investments uh not too much of it into like late state late-stage opportunities but just in general um you know like two years ago it was basically just crypto vcs and no one really interested like all the traditional vc's just pulled out completely and now you have pretty much all the vc firms like even the ones that are not really announced they're all interested a lot of them are our clients and they're like thinking about their strategy to enter crypto and i think part of that is that it's just now like much more investable you can make much much more comparisons they're closer to traditional finance they can think about d5 in a way how they think about equity in in some worlds they can they can make much closer comparisons so i would say you know just in summary just venture funding overall exported completely the deal size also increased significantly so before that you know it's obviously like four or five times smaller now it's it's not that uncommon to see like 70 to 80 million dollars in in pre-product valuations for some for some crypto projects and it's just a function of so much capital being on the sidelines so much capital for you know that's competing for a fixed number of deals and if there's a really good deal and really good company or protocol that's developing something new it has a massive premium and it's it's very common now to see like 80 90 uh million dollars in pre-product valuation uh so it's a little bit crazy but just in general yeah overall just a massive explosion one of the reasons for this uh is uh that right now we have some yeah like this multi-chain world so a lot of projects just trying to launch some forks from ethereum for example and uh we just love this because for example they didn't invest in something like curve for example so for example it's a good to invest in similar projects on solano for example uh and also like the the like the second thing is uh with this like multi-chain world a lot of projects uh just something like uh polka dot pirate chains for example and uh i think right now we just like in the start of the wave of this like power chain projects and some like cosmos uh new blockchains so yeah we'll see in the next year yeah and speaking about the size of the deals that larry mentioned you know not only has that increased but also we've seen so many more crypto unicorns and i just wondered like do you think that the market is just kind of getting a little bit too frothy because there's just so much money pouring in and they're all competing and so is it like just kind of irrationally bumping up the valuations or what's your take on that i i think for sure like there's a lot of uh there's a lot of examples i can think of where you know for example you know protocols that still haven't shipped are now basically trading on the secondary market like two billion dollar valuation that seems a little bit crazy and yeah now is there's like there's like 50 plus crypto unicorns and it used to be just exchanges like two years two or three years ago it was basically just exchanges that were super profitable and now you have all these other companies like infrastructure um you know like like protocol development companies um and it's just become um almost like expected right like when you see a fundraising round of a company that is generating significant amount of revenue there's a big uh there's there's a big premium on it being a crypto company and and vc investors just in general and many investors they kind of price this in and say uh you know this will likely become a much larger industry in the next few years so probably there should be a big premium and even like you look at something like coinbase um which is obviously going public last year it's still trading at like 40 or 50 billion dollars in market cap or maybe even larger or higher now and when you make comparisons in basically all the metrics to like any other exchanges or any other you know fx businesses um the difference is like five five x or more higher uh than those businesses in the traditional world so there's just a big premium on crypto overall i think this will probably continue being this way just because it's it's a very kind of um interesting industry for people to allocate capital to uh and there's not that many opportunities uh to allocate in equity markets and obviously with coinbase kind of opening the floodgates to go in public there is now an expectation for a lot of these exchanges to do the same or for these uh infrastructure companies or even something like openc right i mean uh they're just really big uh really big premium on all those companies yeah i i do wonder if it's one of those things where it's kind of like directionally correct but then for individual bets it won't be so it sort of like makes sense and then also doesn't make sense um so let's now maybe talk about some of the specific verticals within the venture investment space just looking at the report it looked to me like defy and nfts were attracting a lot of vc money but why don't you just talk a little bit about kind of trends within crypto in terms of what's attracting money and what you expect to continue to attract a significant proportion of investment yeah i think the the most interesting opportunities for investors are always the ones where they see some sort of a liquid exit or where they see an opportunity to obviously make the most money so earlier in the year 2021 it was it was d5 and it probably continued until like summer or something then d5 started under performing a little bit so then it was nft so there were a lot of investments into obviously something like openc wearable investments that in some way give you exposure to the to the nft market and towards the end of the year we saw a complete shift to just like gaming companies uh nfd you know using nfts and games uh that has sucked out so much capital you know so so that includes games includes gaming guilds uh actually infinity really uh was was the role model for the play to earn games and now you constantly see these deals funded and you also see again like very traditional vc companies trying to get as much exposure as they can to these gaming uh gaming companies and just using crypto in general in gaming because you look at something like xc infinity which is a very liquid uh it has a very liquid governance token and it's trading much higher than like the aaa gaming studios they're gaming studios they're producing the games that are played by you know ten hundreds of millions of people uh and they're they're trading overall you know that studio is trading at less than what xc is doing and it is trading in a very liquid form so obviously that becomes for investors this is an opportunity where they see this is probably under monetized so a lot of the games right now can be making orders of magnitude more money and that's becoming very interesting now for them what i would say just in general like from from the deals and some of the stuff that i've seen it's it's almost embarrassing like look at the games they're raising 100 million valuations and it's like click-based games that i used to play you know in 2000 2002 uh and and they're trading at billion dollar plus valuations it's a little bit absurd right now and i think that will definitely end up collapsing but the trend will probably continue and and some gaming studios will you know start implementing nfts i'm pretty sure about that igor what about you what other trends in vc investment do you see that you want to talk about i saw a lot of interest in like d5 protocols on new l1 uh not only like uh forks for example something of uni swap but also some protocols uh who try to create some you know like more sophisticated uh urine [Music] opportunities using something like options uh and so on and for sure because of like solana high tps we could see even more uh like better projects which we couldn't see on something like ethereum or maybe even uh on the roll-ups to be honest okay what what oh there's there was also one other trend and that was not just funding defile on all ones but also funding l wants and funding l2s there was a lot of investment also in these areas where like now people are almost expecting the next you know year of 2022 becoming the year of some finally some roll up adoption so a lot of the roll up uh roll up solutions raised a lot of money and also a lot of d5 solutions obviously building on these on this roll-up solution so i think just overall l2's obviously raised also a tremendous amount of capital and we see it in you know matter labs darkware uh all these development companies uh they're uh they're raising it at really high valuations and it's because there's an expectation of them eventually having tokens and becoming liquid and especially after what we saw with l once this year you know all of them basically popping off like crazy if some of these l2 solutions end up getting some adoption similar to l1 you can expect a similar trend a lot of the capital will end up going there and i i'm pretty convinced that that that's going to be a trend of this year as well yeah one other thing actually that i noticed was that crypto financial services was also a popular sector for vc funding and by that you know i mean things like payments and lending but one thing that i wondered was you know obviously that sector is seeing a lot of uncertainty at least here in the us due to regulatory issues and i wondered do you feel like that's going to affect um funding in that space or you know are you noticing hesitation on the parts of investors there i would say there's definitely a lot of hesitation in terms of lending companies uh but there's there's a lot of interest in companies like nydic that just facilitate institutional investment and that i believe we also count into financial services so i would say overall uh probably i think even like companies like blockfi you know celsius as well somewhat based in the u.s they're definitely facing a lot of uncertainty and the scc has made it very clear that they don't like those businesses to be run in the us and they they don't give it their blessing so i think in the lending side absolutely a lot of that will probably end up moving offshore as well uh but just overall i think like financial services is a very logical way forward where like you try to extract some value and try to facilitate a lot of the institutional capital going into crypto so i think investment overall will probably remain similar but yeah in terms of lending there's a lot of uncertainty let's also talk about m a which was at a record high what how do you think we're going to see that trend go in 2022 yeah i think you know it was at a record high but we almost expected it to be even higher last year uh with coinbase going public and them having a lot of capital it still there wasn't really any single like massive acquisition that we've seen yet there wasn't really much consolidation and i think the reason for that was because you know none of the companies actually struggled a lot of the companies when they ran out of money like for example you know when blackfire had some issues with the gbtc trade they just did this and raised money like that within a couple of days because why not right like there there's a lot of capital uh in the markets and because of that there wasn't much need of consolidation because there just wasn't a lot of companies struggling last year this can definitely change next year uh but but i think in general we'll see a trend of company going public and then trying to acquire more companies i mean coinbase has done it a little bit none of the acquisitions were you know enormous but i think this will continue being a trend uh and um financial services probably data companies will consolidate a lot like it's you know in data companies you now have like probably hundred plus companies doing data in crypto and it's a very commoditized market um and i think we'll see a lot of consolidation there but just in general because a lot of a lot of money ends up going to tradable like token stuff because of that we haven't seen much and we've seen interestingly enough like some token mergers and mma as well like with polygon for example being one uh there were a few others that were really interesting so i think that will also be a trend in the coming years too igor did you want to add me yeah maybe so yeah uh we just saw that like acquisitions uh between various dao in crypto is not something not something special because yeah even like two days ago i think we sell uh rarity capital and fair protocol acquisition uh before this uh we have a new chiefer and uh keep network and uh even like uh in the 2020 we saw a lot of projects uh was like acquired by ion so i think we will see just trend on this like dell uh like merge and inquisition uh in like in the current year yeah i i almost expect that to continue in a bigger way even maybe than in the traditional startup space um so in a moment we're going to talk a little bit more about some of these trends particularly layer 1 and d5 but first a quick word from

and get 25 with the code laura link in the description back to my conversation with larry and igor so we've kind of briefly touched on this competition amongst the layer ones and i'm sure we're all aware it was early on finance marching then briefly very briefly cardano and then solana obviously was a big was a big you know new layer one to emerge and then at the end of the year really avalanche and maybe even tara so how would you guys characterize this race at the layer one level i would say just in general there were so many new retail participants that wanted to try to find couldn't so even like for me anecdotally when when a friend comes to me and they want to put in you know a few thousand dollars like obviously i'm not gonna tell them to go use ethereum if they're gonna end up paying like 10 of their investment and fees uh and then so so we ran into this issue where ethereum was being used so much and was being pushed to its limit so much that it just wasn't appealing to a lot of the newcomers uh that's what binance like really cap flies on obviously with the planet smart chain uh they were the first chain that really capitalized on evm compatibility so it allowed you know it allowed teams to basically just fork to projects that already existed on ethereum and just make it a lot cheaper so just in general we we ran into this trend of like people wanting to use d5 but being unable to because it was just they were just priced out completely uh and because of this you know when you have something like ethereum it's almost like the goal right it's almost like something that those protocols aspire to be in terms of market cap and all these l1 protocols they they always they have almost they promise unlimited upside it's always like you know if everything works out well like we're gonna have this much usage we're gonna we're gonna be at this market cap and that attracted a lot of people like being interested in getting exposure to these uh so i i think like solana as well uh was was quite notable because it was the first one that was able to bootstrap its own development ecosystem without relying on ethereum so much uh and that was mainly because of its kind of you know of sam and ftx uh just just kind of incentivizing them as much as possible almost like guaranteeing listings if those projects were interesting so just in general there there were so many different uh different l1 that started getting some some adoption and because of that price you usually followed and and people wanted to get exposure to it because there's like unlimited upside compared to something like d5 where uh you already know like you can make some comparisons to traditional finance or something else but with l once there really isn't a pricing metric so no one knows what these tokens should be trading at and because of that everyone's like aspiring to be ethereum and because of that like i think that it was just really an interesting sector for people to allocate capital to because what we saw after solana like now people are just chasing these like you know basically this this week and last week like near is getting a lot of this attention and it keeps going from one to another to another to another and it's like this continuous high and and and continues like basically free competition of these l1's to try to get users try to go developers try to make it interesting for uh for users to start using their chain with like incentives and stuff so i think we'll continue seeing this uh but i do anticipate this morphing a little bit more into the l2s uh in this year so yeah i really uh also was impressed by like solana in terms of uh like bootstrapping of developers activity because yeah right now we have uh some kind of technical depth which is uh like evm compatibility because a lot of developer and developer tools uh write specifically for evm uh and a lot of a lot of like d5 primitives like uni swap like balancer like uh some landing particles like compound or whatever also right and solidity and you just couldn't use them on something like solana or even near so this is the reason why we also have a trend uh for building some kind of like evm environment on uh chains like solana interior and near which is uh yeah which is like neon evm and uh for sure but yeah i really want uh to see that in the next year we could see more like compatibility uh and interoperability between various chains because uh even with like roll-ups right now we also need to use like some new smart contract languages like cairo for example for starkwear and uh i know that uh for example starkware uh spent a lot of effort uh and time of creating some like developer tools but yeah anyway right now yeah is an issue that if you want to bootstrap uh your blockchain you definitely need some kind of like evm compatibility yeah well i wondered you know once ethereum shifts to ethereum 2.0 probably sometime in the first half of next year how do you think that's going to affect this race or competition at layer one and do you feel that any of these chains that kind of benefited from the high fees on ethereum this past year will have lasting traction or do you feel like once they're scaling on ethereum then we're going to see capital flow back to ethereum i personally think that there will continue be to be multi-chain opportunities i i think you know everyone says like ethereum 2.0 maybe you start out next year i would i would challenge it a little bit i think it's going to be much longer than that i think what's what's going to be obviously more important in the short term is just the l2s and like scaling through roll ups i think for ethereum 2.0 there's a lot of uncertainty and not just around timing but also like how well those actually end up working how much will this fragment liquidity on these protocols how compatible are they going to be across the board uh and i think my view has changed on this significantly over the last two years because before we had basically like neotron and like these blockchains that basically made like you know i don't want to say the dumbest but but the the kind of the easiest compromises that they could to get as much adoption as they could uh now you see a little bit more sophistication you see l1s just in general compromising in ways it makes sense so solana for example is making the bet that this will all have to scale on chain in order not to fragment liquidity and in order to just retain users on this one layer uh and i think these like different approaches and and these parameters that you're playing with are going to be important like for example for something like a games it's it's not too important to be like as decentralized as possible it's important that you have the ownership of the assets and it's important that you have some like regulatory arbitrage basically whereas for financial services you know i keep going back to this but like i would not feel comfortable uh putting like tens of millions of dollars uh on solana if today because you just don't have the certainty of it like being constantly constantly up and if there if something happens during that time and you know price moves too much your capital can be at risk so for that for that sense i i would feel much more comfortable keeping it on something as decentralized and as with the highest ups uptime possible which is basically ethereum right now so just to me it always depends on like the use case that you're going for and i think there are going to be some more use case specific chains uh down the line and i don't think even if it's like ethereum 2.0 and even with roll-ups like i think a lot of the l1 obviously will end up correcting and the ones that that don't end up getting adoption don't end up getting developers will all trend to zero uh but but i think there will still be opportunities and i think we will end up living in a multi-chain world that has to cooperate with one another yeah so i also think that even with this transition from like monolithic uh execution environment uh to something which uh like metallic uh like roll up centric uh vision we would have uh some like space for uh various like blockchains and even like side chains for example like running for axi infinity so you don't need to like store all data and execute all transactions uh in one chain anyway so yeah even something like uh personally for sure uh like cosmos vision is uh like much better for example something like dot because you would have like blockchain for every app which you want so if you want to like some lending protocol you could have like lending protocol blockchain you could like connect this blockchain from various bridges to like ethereum to other cosmos blockchains or even to polkadot so yeah you definitely don't need to like execute all transactions and uh yeah and all applications uh on one blockchain yeah larry what's your opinion about which interoperability ecosystem will uh gain more traction yeah i think just in general i agree with igor that cosmos is the most interesting in terms of in terms of the goal and and kind of the design of the protocol where you know we've seen the adoption that tara was able to get and and then the more that happens and the more these these apps can interoperate with with one another the more interesting it's going to be i think just in general what's what's stopping cosmos to become more talked about and become the narrative is just that they they don't have great token economics and the token is not really connected to like the performance of the apps that end up building on on cosmos and because of that a lot of the you know there just hasn't been too much too much interest around cosmos outside of the apps building on top of it and cosmos doesn't benefit too much from it but in terms of design i totally agree with igor it's i think it's just a superior design but it's just one approach i think like that's that's kind of what i would want to leave people with is no one really knows what will happen no one knows if ethereum 2.0 will work out no one knows if rollops will end up getting significant adoption it's all experimenting right now and everyone's taking different approaches and and eventually over the long term the best approach will end up end up taking the most market share and and i think that's that's one of the great things about this ecosystem is that you know maybe tron did well over the short term maybe eos did okay over the short term but over the long term all of these solutions that don't take great approaches will trend to zero uh and and that's how it should be it should be perfect competition for these solutions and i will end up pushing this to be more friendly for users and will end up you know on boarding as many customers as possible all right and so we're going to talk about define in a moment but we did touch very briefly on layer two i don't know if you wanted to kind of talk a little bit more about where you think that's gonna go because clearly um that space is is sort of yeah at the ground level and it's kind of up in the air how where where things are gonna go with that yeah you will probably have more elaborate thoughts here i'll just kind of summarize like right now we already have optimistic roll-ups in production you have you have arbitrary and optimism they've progressed quite a bit since they launched but i would say almost everyone would say that the adoption has been completely underwhelming so far compared to like what it was hyped up to be even what like i expected i think eco as well in general it's because you have all these like cheap alternatives that make different trade-offs uh which normally users don't really care about that much like you know most people don't want to wait seven days for for withdrawing their tokens most users don't want to pay three dollars for the office if they can pay few cents on solana and because of that i think they got very little adoption so far uh you know there are solutions that are trying to tackle that there are solutions that will make withdrawals like much faster if you pay higher fees uh and also i believe that uh arbitrary optimism will eventually do a token that will start a massive interest i mean it's always what what starts all this like you look at like interesting compound or interest in ave uh prior to the the the token dropping basically for compound and then more tokens there was almost no interest um and after that you know you can build the incentives in a way where for example if people that end up bridging over or if people just end up using the the dapps on on these chains somehow get rewarded you get some wider distribution that i think can start another wave uh and then the second part of of l2s is obviously the zk roll ups to me that's that's the more long-term oriented solution i mean there are a lot of people that disagree a lot of people think that optimistic roll-ups are also the optimal solution i personally think that like something like like stark starknet and nzk sync will end up being a significant par significant narrative of of this year and both of them are definitely planning tokens as well and i think uh it's just a more logical and a more pragmatic approach uh and i think it will end up getting quite a bit of interest uh this year so yeah uh i also think that like optimistic roll-ups is only like short-term solution yeah but as larry said uh right now they're like already in production and people really use them even with this like long withdrawal time uh because of like some new protocols like hog exchange uh who helped people with like instant swaps because i think like operators of this exchange just like verify like all uh roll up uh transactions but yeah anyway uh like optimistic follow-ups is a good way only because of evm compatibility right now so people could just uh reuse existing ethereum instruments like hardcat web3.js and anything else and also they could just uh like redeploy like uni swap or yeah or other yeah or anything yeah but zikro labs are definitely like better alternative to optimistic roll-ups but like the main reason uh which uh this is like i think not a good solutions for like the next half a year or something is not only that they're not in production right now but also because of like the lack of like general like evm execution because you need to use some like new specific smart contract language uh to do all this zk magic so you need like some like toolbox uh for this contracts you need some uh like some framework and some like basic contracts like something like open zip link contracts uh which we already uh use for like year c 20 tokens on ethereum also like this zikr lapse uh a kind of like more expensive term in terms of executions uh uh i don't think that we could see like more like decent realizations in terms of like relayers uh who would like execute all transactions and generate all these mathematic proofs but i don't think that we need decentralization these terms because anyway uh we have like math and also we have ethereum security for uh this transaction so yeah i think they can relapse a definitely like long-term solution for scaling and not only for ethereum yeah so i agree with igor uh for that and i think for zikr well specifically the the lack of evm compatibility will be something that will end up basically delaying that because exactly like igor said there's not enough code that can be forked and because of that you'll have to go through the exact same process as solana did basically finding your own finding new developers incentivizing these new developers to develop their and because of that it will take longer but what i think like listeners should realize is that actually there are limitations to evm as well so like going through your own language in in most cases is the optimal solution if you're going for full scalability but it's the more painful one and and solana has seen exactly the same issue so so i think it will end up happening this year it will be slower than people realize but it will end up being the breakthrough i believe of of 2022. all right so let's now talk about defy how would you say that that sector overall like d5 tokens how did they perform versus bitcoin and ether and then we can go into specific defy so yeah we saw we saw d5 doing really well in q1 and q2 of last year you know avec compound uniswap all these protocols perform incredibly well in in the first half of the year and then we ran into a massive slump uh in in q3 and q4 where if you basically chart uh d5 or any sort of d5 token over ethereum it's basically a straight line down and i think the main reason for that has basically been dilution of capital so you know you now have multiple different l1's and there are obviously early early stage opportunities to invest in these primitives on them so if there's even a five percent chance that something like solana will end up taking over ethereum those primitives obviously are more interesting to you if they're at much smaller evaluations than something like uh something like unit swap or compound on ethereum so i think we ran into that issue where capital just got diluted into other protocols and people started chasing d5 protocols in in these ecosystems and then the second issue was that just you know there were just new narratives basically we saw it a little bit of a d5 2.0 narrative and just in general with nfts as well where d5 was almost like exhausted and it and in my opinion uh it was also difficult to justify investing in it in super high valuations um so if you see you know swap trading at like 25 billion you know you're looking at like three or four x upside maximum for at least in my opinion whereas uh if you look at other like early stage opportunities or different different uh layer one ecosystems you can justify much easier to invest in them and because of that we've just seen a massive slump uh and and narratives moving in different directions yeah and i just like really slurry yeah okay so let's why don't we move quickly through some of these different d5 sectors uh one thing you know that was interesting to me is dex volume peaked in may and hasn't really recovered um what's your sense of why that is occurring in my i did uh one of like research about like dex volumes and i find that a lot of dex volumes are created by some kind of like arbitrage bots uh which mainly use like sushi swap and units were version 2 and also in may we see this like sheep mania with a lot of like retail uh attention but yeah but after this uh we also saw like a listing of on uh like main exchange like coinbase and binance so i just think that like most of this next volume just moved to centralized exchange because you know like uh even because of uh like ethereum high fees people uh centralized exchange and more like friendly for like uh retail users so i think it's definitely like one of the reasons yeah i think igor is totally right it was like the it completely corresponds with the shiba mania and initially it wasn't listed on many exchanges then listed on ftx binance and a few other larger ones that people can just could just easily go to to trade it and obviously when you're dealing with like you know 100 fees versus just going on an exchange especially for these guys that are buying you know 200 300 bucks it just makes a lot more sense so i totally agree with you it was just like a massive retail mania uh on that side of things and then also we keep going back to this but a lot of that ended up moving to two l ones as well uh so so you know pancake swap for example its volume has gone up significantly i mean initially it was barely competing with unit swap and then at some point had larger volumes and you swapped it and a lot of that was just kind of like chasing uh some questionable projects like some of it like basically ponzi based uh but but just overall i think it was it was mainly the fee issue and like igor mentioned just just people moving to centralized exchanges and certain traffic exchanges having enough liquidity lending has always been a really big draw on d5 what trends did you see there and where do you think that will go in 2022 i would say in terms of d5 like there weren't any like trends that stood out too much i would say just in general you know the the more these tokens are are traded and the more these tokens are interested to people the higher the demand for for lending against them will be and in this case we saw exactly that it's kind of like a lending is a very agnostic thing to agnostic uh instrumental markets it's not like too interesting but it's a very interesting very important primitive for people to have access to in order to you know be able to borrow against these assets uh so in general like i didn't see any trends that stood out too much in terms of lending outside of some of them obviously again like moving to other old ones uh but maybe igor has something so yeah we also saw like a lot of new like d5 2.0 like protocols uh use some you know like stable coins uh like usdc some like frags thing uh yeah and yeah when i said like uh [Music] about like this protocols uh i mean something like ohm forks uh and uh or or something like she was swapped because i was kind of shocked when i found that like all uh uni tokens from compound uh were like borrowed only for uh some like super swap firm so we will definitely uh see uh in this year uh like more use cases for using uh tokens from like compound and now in some like new like crazy firms uh like yeah like in the last year okay so we're running out of time so what which trends in d5 do you feel like were the most notable and are things that you're going to be looking out for in 2022 i would say from my side obviously you know recently d5 2.0 was the most noticeable trend by far like olympus dow kind of changed how how d5 protocols think about liquidity and i would say in general and we saw this a couple of weeks ago with yearn uh d5 like 1.0 protocols or whatever you want to call them the original d5 protocols revamping their token economics to be just more easily easier to control so in this case you try to decrease emissions and try to make it more compelling for people to buy i think that's going to become the new standard uh in the coming months where a lot of the earlier d5 protocols will just revamp their token economics so it's more again so there's some reason for people to get excited by them again and for them to actually hold them we started with this trend obviously with compound like just doing uh liquidity mining and because of that you have high emissions and and you know it turns out that if you give people free money they tend to sell it and they tend to use it to buy stuff in real life as well and that obviously has negative effects on the price and investment interest in these assets so i think we'll see a lot of that i think we'll see a lot less liquidity mining a lot less emissions like uniswap kind of paved the way by stopping that on the on the base layer like sushi swaps still does a lot of emissions um so i think we'll we'll we'll see that stop uh soon and a lot of token economics revamps yeah and i really interested in uh in like uh more like protocols which create new uh wild opportunities like as i said uh something like with options or structured products like rebound for example because this is like a new way to earn wild and not something like landing or like liquidity providing so we will definitely see more products uh and uh yeah for sure on like other chains than ethereum all right so one trend that i definitely want to draw out is there were just so many exploits in d5 this year what's your take on that is that just like something people will have to put up with or what do you think the industry is going to do about that if anything yeah i think igor should just stuck here because that's his area of specialty so yeah we saw a lot of defy exploits uh but yeah like the root cause of like most of them is just like oracle misuse which is like bad practice uh even like from something like 2018. and also right now we saw only exploits on uh evm chains or compatible chains for sure or something like multi-chain protocols uh and we didn't see something uh hacks uh for example on solana and even like a week ago uh like one of the best uh like our jitter companies on solana no dime uh just uh found uh some like vulnerability in one of uh domain uh d5 primitive for solana and i think that we will definitely see hacks or exploits uh on these new chains but the main reason why we didn't see something like this in the last year is just the absence of like uh source code open source uh because competition uh new protocols uh on new l-ones just uh didn't want to share their public cut uh yeah to like absorb like market share right now but yeah in terms of uh even compatible chains we will definitely see a lot more defy exploit and i think even like more sophisticated than uh in the last year all right one other thing about d5 that i wanted to bring up was in your report you said that you felt that bifurcation of d5 would be inevitable and by that what you seem to be saying was that there would be a sort of non-kyc d5 and then a kyc d5 for institutions and so um i'm just curious for your thoughts on why you see that as inevitable yeah i think it's becoming like very obvious based on what what ave is doing what compound is doing and when we talk to institutional clients um they're just unable to trade a lot of these things on d5 they're just unable to touch it without proper kyc and because of that these protocols are missing on billions of dollars of potential inflows billions of dollars of capital that they can get you know if they slightly change their protocols so the way i i see this is that compound ave even uniswap will create products on top of these protocols that will be more friendly uh to institutional investors overall and and eventually will allow them to interact with it in in some sort of kyc way and and and on top of that sourcing like with the indeed general uh and just giving them better yield opportunities i mean we we constantly talk to institutional investors that ask us like what's the way that that we can actually get access to this like eight percent yields that that we normally can't get anywhere else i mean they're used to getting like point one point two percent on their capital and all of a sudden they see that you know there's billions of dollars like earning relatively high amounts uh and apys and that's appealing to them but unfortunately like because of regulations in the u.s like it's it's just very difficult for them to get access to it and because of that compound and ave and unisop will create protocols or or maybe not even protocols but more so like uh just just vehicles uh for them to use uh in this way uh but but i think like for for retail investors this will obviously be very unappealing all right so let's now turn to nfts because we're running out of time and obviously this is going to be probably a huge trend in 2022. something that's interesting though of course is that we did see there was a spike in activity of nft trading in august and then volumes have really fallen so where do you think the market's going to go in 2022 yeah it's a really good question i think we've now seen basically like two hype cycles in nft 71 was basically around march uh and then nfc scratched by like 70 or 80 and i i remember thinking okay this is over like this trend was just super short it's done and then all of a sudden you know we saw like another like 10x going from there and now if you look at the march period it like barely shows on the chart because because the other one was just so much larger and now we're seeing a similar thing just a complete cooldown and i think just in general i mean it's there was obviously massive hype massive hype around pfp projects massive hype around regenerative art um and you know people just were trading that they had massive fomo they saw a lot of people just making a lot of money out of nothing right and that's that's always just encouraging a lot of interest from retail investors too i think my my prediction would be that uh pfp projects will not you know they will not end up making infinite amount of money anymore they'll only be a few that will be still viewed as important by people i think a lot of this will end up going in the direction of just blockchain gaming overall nft is actually being used for a specific purpose nft is being used in financial products more um and one-on-one art as well i think uh is is is gonna be cool but just overall i mean you know something the infrastructure needs to get better uh i mean we keep going back to it but like issuing nfd and trading and fto ethereum is just like completely financially unfeasible and because of that like almost no retail investors were like super interested but because of that then you know we saw something like flow and nba top shop which is free to trade like just get a ton of attention from people so to me there's a very clear mainstream appeal to nfts and i think that's going to continue being the case and it's going to continue being popular in the future but it's going to be more refined and it's going to be more focused on i think higher quality projects down the line yeah and i think that like uh non-crypto people don't really like nfts we just saw this for example like even like months ago or something when like ubisoft which is like aaa game company uh launched some nft marketplace and gamers just like try to cancel company because of this so uh and yeah and even and we even uh saw this case with like uh like starcr2 it's also like a game when uh people just also uh try to cancel a company because of plan of like integrating nfts in triple a game yeah and also uh like all these like integrations uh between nfts and brands we also see a lot of hate because uh like crypto advanced people just uh trying to use some like strategies to mean uh like a lot of nfts in one transactions and like just non-crypto people didn't even have any opportunity to mint and uh for them i think uh this is just like looks like a scam so we definitely need to do something if we want to have adoption uh in like nft sector yeah that backlash is very fascinating to watch and it's also fascinating to watch how the different brands um handle that because some of them just cancel their plans and others kind of go forward but quietly and yeah we'll see what happens and especially after the merge on ethereum and ethereum's proof of stake then you know the kind of objection that we see from mainstream people at least when it comes to nfts on ethereum it won't exist anymore so you know what will that do for adoption well they still hate it anyway or um okay so we're definitely over time but there's just a couple more big things i really want to cover quickly so obviously gaming has been uh another big area of nfts you know i don't know if this is like exactly the same thing but clearly there was a lot of hype around the metaverse earlier this year um so i was curious what you thought was going to happen uh in terms of games and and maybe the metaverse too which is sort of related yeah i would say on metaverse like you know there was obviously a lot of hype and it all started with facebook just changing his name and and a lot of companies now all of a sudden interested to allocate to it but when you actually look at like the projects that exist today like like decentraland or or sand it's it's not a very like complete solution like if you actually try to use it and i encourage people to try yeah it's not that great right like you're it's buggy it doesn't really work you know it's it's very overpriced because of the hype it seems like we're in very early innings of that i i you know i i can't see this trend becoming much larger in the future but my guess would be it's like two three years at least away from my getting any significant interest in any significant adoption in terms of nfts in games i think we're probably closer to that you know like seeing axe infinity trade that high and i already mentioned this but just in general it's it's appealing to gaming studios uh even if they're getting backlash because they just think that they can they can monetize it much better they believe that a lot of their games are now under monetize like if you're selling a lot of money uh if you're selling a lot of a lot of stuff in your games and then have the opportunity to sell it as nfts and then collect commission on it as it gets resolved as well that will end up being very appealing to people to a point where it's going to be difficult for these companies to just say no we're not going to do this for ideological reasons because the missed pricing can be like you know in billions of dollars and so i think we'll see a few like aaa gaming studios uh introduce some some nfts in games this year i would not be surprised but but just in general like you know i already mentioned this again but the trend of like now super bad and super low quality games uh just raising a lot of money just because they have a token and they're similar to actually infinity that trend will absolutely die uh and uh hopefully it will turn to higher quality and it will turn to games you actually want to play and not just a click farm that you know a bunch of like people in china just just click like this on a bunch of phones and and get it done it should be a little bit more interesting than that and i you know i've yet to play a single game that makes it interesting enough where like i would actually spend time on it not because i want to make money but because i actually want to play and i think that will hopefully happen yeah and i just yeah totally agree with larry because we are really so early for yeah like any mention of metaverse so there were so many other topics that we could have covered but we're going to leave it there because uh these were i think all the main ones i mean there's there's really so many but it's been it's so fun chatting with both of you where can people learn more about each of you and your work at the block yeah so for me uh you can find me on twitter at lawmaster um you can reach out to me at larry at theblockcrypto.com if you have some questions or even for people that are interested in working crypto we're still hiring a lot so you can definitely reach out and uh yeah i i lead the research team at the block so my twitter handle is frank researcher uh and i think you know that i've read about various d5 hacks so if you want to join to my data team and help us to create and build new data products or have any suggestions for our data dashboard just let me know okay perfect well thank you both so much for coming on unchained appreciate laura thank you appreciate it thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about larry igor and the block check out the show notes for this episode unchained as produced by me laura shin with help from anthony yoon daniel ness and mark
