eric golden host of the web 3 breakdowns podcast and owner of board ape 7560 and many other yuga labs assets welcome eric thank you for having me laura this past weekend saw the other side mint which was for digital land in yugo labs's promised metaverse related to the board api club and some other nft projects although yooka labs and its partners who include animoka brands a coin dao and others raised about 320 million dollars many view the sale as a debacle tell us what happened so going into ape sale there was a tremendous amount of demand and the demand far exceeded the supply of available plots so on midnight there was 55 000 available plots everyone with a kyc wallet could buy two and by some people's estimates there was at least a hundred thousand to two hundred thousand demand so you know supply was exceeded by demand by a number of about four times and so ultimately i saw that decrypt reported that the sale actually destroyed more east than it issued and because of how much demand there was on ethereum blockchain and because of the changes instituted last summer the the chain itself ended up burning 55 843 east which was about 157 million dollars worth of eve what do you make of all that yeah so i think the way to think about it is everyone got in line to go into a stadium and there was 55 000 seats in the stadium that everyone could sit in and the line outside was very long in this case you know called 100 000 people were outside of the line but for people to understand ethereum and gas wars when you're at an auction and there's limited supply you can increase the amount of gas that you're willing to pay to cut the line so what happens is in this case it happened at a scale i don't think we've seen for some time that people started increasing the amount of gas so even though the price was fixed in this case it was 305 apecoin which was roughly 6 000 us dollars people started to offer to pay the miners to mint their transactions to guarantee that they would get their mint at much higher and higher increments so going into it because they switched from dutch auction to just a traditional mint i think people believed it was possible there was going to be a gas where no one really knew what was going to happen i mean now in hindsight everyone seems to have an opinion of what they would have done differently and i'm happy to jump into like kind of how you go back through the day of how it felt but getting up at the last minute going into 9pm it was abundantly clear there was going to be a gas war and people thought you might have to pay about half an eath to mint that would be the gas and then quickly it was one eth and then at the actual game time it started to range between two and three eth per mint to make sure that you are guaranteed a chance to secure one of the deeds well that yeah that's that's crazy because obviously then yeah it's more than what the um underlying asset is that they're trying to buy so actually let's just backtrack though like why were these in such demand what exactly were these nfts that yooka labs and animoka and their partners were selling so yuca labs had tremendous success first with the board api club and then board a kennel club then mutants and then the big news of acquiring larva labs and adding crypto punks and me bits so this is really the premier nft studio designer creative lab that are launching these nfts and they were had announced that they were going to launch a metaverse and people were very excited but it happened in stages so one of the first pieces of information we got was that we had to kyc or know your customer which in web 3 is definitely a very hot topic of why do we need to do this you have your right to your identity i have my wallet for a lot of people that have purchased assets from yugo labs in the past this was never required and that's just like submitting i you know like some kind of official id like a passport or something to verify what your real world identity is yeah and it's connecting a wallet to in this case a wallet to a real living person now there's two reasons i mean there's lots of like a lot of this stuff this is my opinion people speculated coming from traditional finance kyc usually means money transfer some sort of banking arrangement maybe you're you know going to win something and they need to prove it's actually going to someone and no one's rigging in the game the other best argument i heard was that a lot of these mints have been boughted so people show up they run scripts they front run everyone and by forcing someone to prove who their identity is you're at least limiting to these are real people and then there's a whole separate issue of how they could collude to still potentially front run the game but at least these are actually real people lining up to buy whatever item you're selling yeah and actually the next day or sorry i think it was the same day solana was down and the reason was because of a bunch of bots that were trying to get nfts and mints so maybe that theory isn't so out there but there were actually other so there were a number of reasons that you know this the way they structured the sale got a lot of criticism you know one other aspect which you alluded to earlier was this dutch auction aspect which they ended up discarding that was the original plan and they ended up just going with a normal price and by the way i should i should say a dutch oxen is where they start with a price ceiling and then over time it decreases and so the theory is then people will only buy at the price they're comfortable with that they think is fair you know as you mentioned last thursday they switched to this flat price of 305 8coin what effect do you think that had on the cell i mean obviously you talked about the gas wars but like why do you think they did that and then when you talked about how it sort of went down or how it felt that night maybe you could give us some color there yeah so i was i don't know why they made the decision they did but going into it it was a dutch auction and as you said all of these minting mechanisms are just price discovery you know how do you figure out what the clearing price should be and so in this case a dutch auction is you start at a high price and it keeps coming down and then eventually you actually in industrial auctions like when proof did their dutch auction as they started at five eth it came down people started buying and then when it got to one eath you also had a gas war because once everyone realizes it's officially the price that people are willing to pay you also get that rush none of these are perfect they all have flaws of them i actually um would have preferred they just kept the dutch auction and i wish they set the price higher i think that one take and we'll get to the solana example people have said you know the contract wasn't optimized this was poorly set up i i don't i don't believe a lot of that i'm not a technical expert but even vitalik came out afterwards and kind of made similar comments to what i believed is that this was an economics problem not a technical one when price um is set so low that demand so far outseeds supply you're going to have this type of event and so on thursday when they said we're doing away with the dutch auction the new plan which was an interesting one was we're going to set a fixed price and what we're going to do is we're going to let every kyc wallet buy two and they knew a gas spike would happen but then as a gas spike went down there would be a second wave you could buy two more another wave and buy two more and so everyone that i talked to was excited about buying people or loading their wallets up and they were saying i'm gonna get four maybe we'll get to six but nobody really early on thought that this would be one wave mega gas war and over until much later in the day on saturday and what happened at that point that made people suddenly realize that that was likely to be the case so um there's great people that do data analysis on blockchains one of the reasons i love it is how transparent it is and so what you could see was the information that everybody wanted which started to come out there was a um a twitter anon named crumbs who was amazing and started updating everyone because what we knew was people could figure out how many kyc wallets there were and you could figure out how many wallets had apecoin but the venn diagram you wanted was how many kyc wallets approved to do this mint had the appropriate number of apecoin and then you could back into that vision of how big the line was the problem was when chrome started pulling the data originally in the morning of saturday there was a lot of kyc wallets but they didn't have any apecoin so the theory was a lot of people forgot about this or they registered they weren't going to do it but then throughout the day all of a sudden apecoin started coming off exchange starting to fill up these kyc wallets so when the data first came out on the morning of saturday it was there was definitely going to be two waves probably not a third then by the afternoon wave two looked smaller but there were still two waves but the money kept coming in at a rapid rate so all of a sudden this kyc wallet started to fill up with apes so if you were the actual seller in the morning you were like we might not have a sellout by six o'clock at night i was like this is a disaster and the reason why i give the team i think doesn't get enough credit is if you know the facts what are you gonna do at that point now you've got yourself do you cancel them in people will be devastated or do you just let it go so in hindsight what the price that the market was willing to bear so just for simple numbers i paid roughly uh us dollars twelve thousand dollars for the an ape coin and eight thousand 000 in gas what that tells me is actually the price was 20 000. it wasn't supposed to be 12 000. the price was set so low that got this demand so high that the price should have been a lot higher but like concert tickets like sporting events when people want to have a sellout or a lot of nfts you know by saying that price low you get demand in this case the price should have clear clearly should have been a lot higher but it's really hard to price it because if you go the other way imagine yuga said we're selling land at thirty thousand dollars they would have been skewered the other way that oh my god like who's gonna pay that well there was a hundred thousand people willing to pay 20 grand that night and there was even more people that weren't able to spend that much money to get one of these plots wow this is yeah this reminds me so much of the initial coin offering craze which i wrote about in my book but in a moment we're going to talk about some of the other issues with the sale and dig into why eric

means but then why don't you then go into why it is that you think that that wasn't actually really a big issue so this isn't my area of expertise it's just me trying to do research and reading different people and a lot of people this was definitely flawed this did not go well so it's not that there weren't problems i just think that some of the things that people got upset about probably were not focused on the right areas when it comes to the technical side just following people that talked about the optimization it was vitalik that said explain this and that's the person i regard the highest of the technical ability of perhaps optimization would have helped but it wouldn't have stopped the problem other people had said they should have used a different erc type but then we couldn't have had this future state where you know you'll be able to trade in-game assets people have talked about well we should have done this on solana you know we should have done this on polygon those are chains that as you mentioned earlier have fallen down before i think personally even though people are really upset i'm just maybe the eternal optimist i was blown away that the website stayed up that ethereum didn't crash that all of this actually went through now it was a disaster from a sense of people paying the a price that the money should have gone to the creators not to you know um burning eath or miners perhaps and that could definitely be debated and i and i see that point but i'm shocked the whole thing worked if you tried to do this i mean imagine ticketmaster sold 320 million dollars of tickets and actually processed million dollars in 60 minutes would say uh like that's amazing to me that that worked i just i i mean maybe it's and maybe it's my lack of technical ability that i'm kind of in wonder that this actually stood that that type of throughput but i'd love to see other chains and i own i'm not an ethmaxy by any means but i believe that if you put half a billion dollars through something like this with nft's minting you you know you probably break a lot of different chains yeah that's such an interesting question because um yeah i i don't know how much because obviously like a an entity like ticketmaster will do multiple sales all at once like a lot of times the sales will all open at like 9 a.m or 10 a.m on different days so anyway i i don't actually know what the numbers are but that's an interesting comparison so after this sale which obviously some people view as kind of a fiasco eucalabs tweeted we're sorry for turning off the lights on ethereum for a while it seems abundantly clear that a coin will need to migrate to its own chain in order to properly scale we'd like to encourage the dow to start thinking in this direction a number of people speculated that yooka labs purposely botched the sale so that they could have an excuse to launch their own chain what do you think of that theory this is actually where i personally got as a long time you know a lot long time we've only been doing this for a year but as a fan of the team and the project a really big fan of the founders this was like kind of my first disappointment in the evening it wasn't the i know people were going to be upset no matter what happened like i kind of just assumed that and there was a harsh reaction it was the comment that specific tweet that bothered me and rubbed me the wrong way i didn't like that they were pointing because if you take my points earlier that this was an economics problem i didn't like that fingers were pointed at ethereum as if ethereum like that yuga had somehow overpowered the ethereum blockchain that that just wasn't true so i really disliked that and i was even more concerned about this notion of creating your own chain if you look at dapper labs and crypto kitties going to flow or axia building ronin like we have examples of people building their own chains when the chain didn't fit their system needs and that might have made sense in that moment people were really upset that they got in line and they weren't able to buy the thing they wanted there's always going to be people that get the thing and don't get the thing when there's a scarce resource so that that's expected but like at that very moment to kind of declare victory and gloat about it rubbed i think myself but i also know a lot of other people the wrong way and just reading the communication listening to people like gordon goner and gargamel the two founders i mean they just raised 300 million dollars their company raised earlier you know 400 million on a 5 billion evaluation if you read their personal tweets it was not a good night for them i don't know them personally i don't talk to them but they were gutted by the reaction of the community if this was a fiasco and i think that that when that tweet came out from yuga that set whoever wasn't upset at that point now everyone started to get upset about that so i think that it just was poor communication is my only guess of what like at the moment to do it but then on top of it i really hope we don't go down that path just personally as one voter of this giant governance structure we've created because i i don't see the benefits of you know moving an off-chain like that and creating your own separate chain there's a lot of things that they can create and add to the community but i'm not a huge fan of creating an ape chain one of the reasons that people believe board api club took off was that at that time last year when they launched they gave their users some meaningful commercial rights to their apes well actually i should say that they were limited but it compared to for instance crypto punks they were meaningful but the morning after this sale punk6529 tweeted that the tldr on the other side license was quote much worse licenses than prior yoga licenses so can you describe a little bit what these rights look like for these other deed nfts and do you agree that they're much worse so 6529 for someone who's not a lawyer is a great analyst who read the terms of service and did catch a lot of bad language i think it was gargamel the founder who actually responded to 6529 right away and actually got stuff changed that day which i thought was great i thought it was a good listening to the people that actually sang so yes i agree with 6529 that when the terms of service came out and this is how i think a lot of people reacted with with a gaming company with big corporations coming in with lawyers writing documents is a lot different than what we saw a year ago but you also have an ecosystem worth more than 20 billion dollars so you're going to get more people at the table but i agree the original language came out was pretty poor and i think that most people thought it was going to be changed i i was actually impressed that they started changing it that day and so now is it more similar to the rights that board api club owners have i don't have like a comparison both i i do i think the board apes rights are a lot we're a lot more open-ended you know this talks about using hong kong as a jurisdiction for legal disputes it's a very oddly written terms of service i think people reacting to it made sense because it was the first time they had seen it okay we'll put in the show notes whatever these updated terms are so after this whole tumultuous weekend what has happened to the price of apecoin to the price floor for these other data nfts and you know other assets in this universe so all of them are down from well not on mint price including gas so if i look at mine if you kind of equated to east i think we're right or hovering just above the price that people minted for the lowest piece of uh land eight coins down i think that was one thing too a learning lesson of going into such a large auction was by holding the price back of where they wanted to price it people weren't sure how much apecoin they needed so people were buying a coin specifically for this and i think that that caused a market dislocation where you're like i want to buy this thing but i don't know how much i need and so people had excess of what they needed so i kind of anticipated a sell-off i think most people did of going into this if you don't know how much you need and then people use it or were left out of line they're gonna be like why do i want this right now because they created kind of a short-term need for the actual token so that fell significantly on the the land itself it kind of depended on what type of land you got because like anything this is a now a very complex collection there are right now about a hundred thousand pieces that are trading some have coders on them that are worth 60 to 300 000. yeah and explain what a coda is so a coda was the newest character in the yuga labs creation that they said that on the hundred thousand lands there would be ten thousand codas and people were very excited about the chance to own a coda and so by minting these and then you had a chance that that you might have got one and so those have traded between sixty thousand and ninety thousand the cheapest one so if you got one then you dollars yeah dollars you were did very well so in eth terms 22 to 30 eth and then for there's a of the 10 000 there's a hundred mega codas and those have traded in the hundreds of thousands like anything i think that if you have participated in any of the the mints not just for yugo but for a lot of them you have this cycle where people mint they get excited there's a pre-reveal period where it trades at this positive because you're taking the probability of getting one of these really high-valued lands plus the probability of getting a low value land and the pre-reveal is always going to be higher than the floor price after the reveal because after it you're going to settle out there's winners and losers so pre-reveal they were trading at you and made if you had just minted that night and sold that night you would have been up 2x you would have doubled your money sometimes tripled your money depending on where you were in the evening all the way through three in the morning then after the reveal happens the market starts to separate itself and now you're in this interesting spot where there's lots of different diversity amongst the assets there's different land types environments there's so many combinations of like what am i buying and amica has there hasn't been a release of the game or how it all works so you have a of an idea-ish but no one really knows what's going to happen so right now people are trying to figure out which type of land do i want to own because if they make an announcement and they say oh this is how it works then you have a better understanding of what part of this you want to own and at what price yeah so what what kind of are the next things that people are looking toward or looking for when it comes to this whole universe well they're definitely waiting for an announcement from yuga and amica more about the game design not necessarily that the game is ready but the more they find out about the rules or how you mine resources on the land or how you play the play the land i think that's the next big thing that people are waiting for and until then you kind of have this switch between people that buy into long-term vision they want to be part of it and people that showed up wanting to flip and you know buy it on saturday sell it on monday and move on to the next thing and so you kind of have this shift from people that are playing the flipping game to the people that are really excited about the actual game being developed and want to participate for the longer term and out of curiosity are you expecting that it will be years before you can play this game because we're seeing some of these other metaverse projects taking quite a while so the sales happen you know at a certain point in time but then the actual kind of play doesn't happen for a while so are you just sort of prepared to wait it out when people talk about game design when i look at all the different projects that were doing this i feel like this was a common thing of everyone was launching nfts and saying they were going to build a game and you talk to any game investors and they'll say eric games are the hardest thing in the world to do like there's triploid enterprise software there's all these things like games are so hard and one example people give is stuart butterfield that slack was actually designing a game the game failed he had to lay off a lot of his employees but they had built a chat engine inside the game and the chat engine is actually where slack came from so the thing i think about executing hard things i love founders that want to execute hard things and i know it's going to take a long time to execute but they're also going to build a lot of different components to bring this world together and i believe they'll create value i also believe they're extremely well financed and capitalized to pull it off so is this a speculative wild investment absolutely this is not in my traditional investment portfolio this is a fun exciting thing to be a part of but right now if you ask me what team of all of these anonymous teams and they're not anonymous anymore but of all these teams executing this is by far the one that's most well positioned in my mind to be able to pull this off yeah and i should just note for listeners you spent how many years at fidelity 16. yeah so clearly you you understand uh that kind of investing well this has been an incredibly illuminating and fun conversation thank you so much for coming on unchained thank you for having me laura this has been a lot of fun don't forget next up is the weekly news recap thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap solana had a tough weekend solano went down for roughly seven hours on saturday according to its twitter account the network lost consensus after an enormous amount of inbound transactions four million per second flooded the network in a postmortem the team explained that the influx of transactions targeted a new nft drop using candy machine solana's popular nft minting tool since the price had a fixed floor and not a dynamic dutch auction the first user to call the mint received the nft which created an economic incentive to send a huge number of transactions in hopes of winning the mint the team wrote due to the overwhelming amount of transactions the network validators ran out of memory and crashed leading to consensus stalling until validators restarted the network via discord and google doc coordination this is not the first significant outage for solana which experienced a 17-hour shutdown in september 2021 which solana says shares characteristics with the blackout last weekend solana will be adding fee prioritization in its v1.11 release along with three other mitigations in the wake of the network failure binance and elon are teaming up elon musk is no longer the sole purchaser of twitter according to a thursday filing musk has raised 7 billion in funding from oracle co-founder larry ellison venture capital firm sequoia investment behemoth fidelity and finance the crypto exchange will be putting up 500 million dollars towards the acquisition by the way speaking of fidelity senators elizabeth warren and tina smith sent a letter to fidelity ceo abigail johnson about fidelity's plans to enable people to save with bitcoin in their 401ks saying that bitcoin was too risky of an asset it also noted fidelity may have conflicts of interest because fidelity has been mining bitcoin and because it offers a crypto fund to wealthy clients bitcoiners aghast at bip 119's speed a bitcoin improvement proposal or bip introduced an opcode called check template verify or ctv and it was written by bitcoin developer and researcher jeremy rubin and it caused quite a commotion in the bitcoin community this week bip 119 is not controversial at face value essentially it allows bitcoin transactions to be used in a restricted manner in the future meaning transactions can be programmed in a limited fashion in bip 119 terminology this restriction on future use is called a covenant it sort of works like a baby smart contract according to ruben allowing bitcoins to be programmed via covenants has interesting applications for example exchanges could batch transactions during times of network congestion and settle at a later date additionally bip 119 would increase the speed of the lightning network and make trustless coin joints easier to execute however rubin has asked the bitcoin community to vote on the soft fork upgrade via a speedy trial in which if a soft fork would be voted for by 90 of block miners within a specific period then the upgrade would be approved speedy trial was used in approving the taproot upgrade which went into effect earlier last year however unlike taproot which was proposed in 2018 bitcoiners are worried that bip 119 has not been studied enough bitcoin og and educator andreas antonopoulos called ruben's choice of a speedy trial activation entirely inappropriate peter mccormack the host of what bitcoin did tweeted i'm nervous that something might get activated that a bunch of people just don't agree with the sec is beefing up its crypto enforcement team the u.s securities and exchange commission announced it is increasing its crypto assets and cyber unit team inside of its enforcement division by 20 positions to 50. the expanded unit which has already brought over 80 enforcement actions related to crypto will focus on securities law violations related to crypto assets offerings crypto asset exchanges crypto asset lending and staking products d5 platforms nfts and stable coins gorbier as gruel the director of the sec's enforcement division said the regulator is expanding to protect retail investors and offer them a fair chance crypto markets have exploded in recent years with retail investors bearing the brunt of abuses in this space meanwhile cyber related threats continue to pose existential risks to our financial markets and participants said gruel the bolstered crypto assets and cyber unit will be at the forefront of protecting investors and ensuring fair and orderly markets in the face of these critical challenges not everyone at the sec was excited about the approach to crypto the agency is taking sec commissioner hester purse tweeted from her personal account the sec is a regulatory agency with an enforcement division not an enforcement agency why are we leading with enforcement in crypto your weekly defy hack roundup this past weekend on top of solana experiencing a network outage and yuka labs making ethereum unusable there were two major defy exploits reary capital and fey protocol fell prey to a re-entrancy bug that cost the platforms more than 80 million dollars according to peck shield a blockchain security firm the attack vector was similar to other successful hacks on compound-based forks for their part rari paused borrowing and fey protocol offered to give the attacker 10 million dollars as a bounty if the remaining funds were returned saddle finance a stable coin decks also experienced an exploit this weekend heck shield reports that the hack was made possible due to a wrong library being used to calculate swaps leading to the hacker getting away with 10 million dollars on the bright side a white hat hacker team at blocksec was able to recover 3.8 million dollars there was also an attempted attack on rainbow bridge which connects near protocol and ethereum however a single mev bot moonlighting as a bridge watchdog was able to thwart the attacker and come away with a 2.5 eth reward the imf says central african republic's bitcoin move is challenging the international monetary fund told bloomberg this week that the central african republic's decision to adopt bitcoin as legal tender will raise major challenges politically economically and legally the news comes just a week after the country's president signed a law legalizing crypto and making bitcoin legal tender the imf has been similarly negative regarding el salvador's adoption of bitcoin according to bloomberg the imf staff is assisting car authorities in addressing concerns regarding the new policy ens domains heat up ethereum name service domain registrations aka dot eth handles surpassed 1 million this week with over 350 000 unique owners the collection also shot up into the top 10 of all nft projects by volume this week on openc a rarity for the domain service the spike in registration coincides with a certain popularity for three and four digit ens domains like 123.eth and 6969.eth for example on may 2nd the floor price for three-digit ens names was 44 eth while the four-digit ens names were going for a minimum of 2.45 eve starbucks seems to actually understand web 3. starbucks the coffee giant with over 30 000 locations and 27 million active rewards members is joining web3 in a big way the company announced plans for nfts this week explaining the technology's potential for community building and access we believe nfts have broad potential to create an expanded shared ownership model for loyalty the offering of unique experiences community building storytelling and customer engagement the team explained in a blog post and while doing so also being a source of a creative business that can benefit a number of stakeholders in the process while creating a new type of digital ecosystem to complement starbucks is current digital platform offering details are slim but the team hinted that the nfts will drop this year and will carry community membership and exclusive experience and perks with them additionally starbucks is thinking of building a web3 platform that would be chain agnostic juno confiscates whales tokens and does massive self own as previously covered on unchained the cosmos-based juno blockchain community officially voted to confiscate the holdings of a whale's wallet after the entity allegedly gamed the airdrop the vote was not close with 72 percent of users voting in favor of the move however it appears that the juno team accidentally sent the seized juno worth 36 million dollars to the wrong address due to a copy and paste error in the code the funds are currently sitting in an unobtainable address but the team plans to move the funds during an upgrade that will rewrite juno's ledger to send the funds to the community account it was supposed to be destined for to begin with luna foundation guard
