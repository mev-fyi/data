collapse here to discuss are ulta and deputy general counsel at ava labs and arie redboard head of legal and government affairs at trm labs welcome ulta and arie hey thank you so much for having us super excited for this conversation dame here thank you so much laura for having us last month the algorithmic stablecoin tara usd and its sister coin luna blew up decimating about 50 billion dollars worth of value overnight the co-founder joe kwan was known for a cocky attitude on twitter and often dismissed critics who warned about the potential for algorithmic stable coins to enter so-called death spirals which forced the coins towards zero many retail investors lost a lot of money in the collapse terraform labs's legal team all quit let's just start with each of you describing what it is that you think the main legal and regulatory fallout of the terror collapse will be who would like to go first i can go first and first of all i have to give a quick disclaimer that the views that i'm going to express on this show are definitely mine and not those of avalabs or avalanche foundation and again thank you so much for having me here i think laura this was one of those catalyst events that and and i think the death spiral was quite spectacular as you mentioned definitely this event has incited a lot of more strong reactions for from the industry but something interesting is that those reactions are coming from both from the cryptos skeptics and i think like right now we're sort of feeding the trolls with this event and those voices are getting louder and louder but i think we have also the lawmakers and regulators that who are renewing those calls for having these new rules after the tier event i think that the terra event did impact our industry because it did indeed put the investors and the markets more broadly at risk but i mean something interesting that we still are seeing in this space is that you are having we are having this sort of narrative from the catastrophics as i would like to call them and they are they're concentrating only on the worst case scenarios and and i they think that the technology is pretty much not suitable for this large-scale economic activity etc i think of course the instability that happened with terra threatened the usefulness of stable coins but at the same time i do not think that everything so far as being gloom and doom i mean you still have projects that are building and still projects that are trying to deliver i mean on their platform also referring here to our avalanche protocol i think we're at the very early stages of this evolution in the space i hope that this event is not going to put all stable coins in one bucket we have seen a lot of more reaction we have seen some reaction from our u.s treasury secretary yellen and she's been pushing for regulation i think she mentioned this during her annual testimony in front of the u.s senate banking you also have the bank of england that proposed earlier this month if i'm correct here with the date that i think they should have the ability to intervene and to oversee the stablecoin issuers in case i mean the regulators feel that stablecoin could impact i do think that this is one of those events that are going to trigger a lot of more regulation but i hope that that is one of those regulations that is going to be very constructive for the space and for the industry and that remains to be seen yeah you know i think those are all great points and and i'd add a couple things first first i say again thank you for having me and and particularly with ulta who's one of the legal minds in the space that i most admire so i'm particularly honored honored with that look i think there's been tremendous there's sort of been a tremendous effect sort of in the crypto space both sort of the markets obviously which is the obvious effect but then also sort of amongst regulators and we can get to sort of each of those in a moment also mentioned the uk that came out with some a proposal to essentially provide uh administrators from the bank of england to deal with the fallout of failed stablecoin projects really the first and only sort of proposal of that kind in the space we've seen you know this as part of the recent bill in congress which we'll talk i'm sure about in a moment but i think one thing that's really important in terms of level setting is if this was a year ago or a year and a half ago i think regulators would be scrambling globally to address this issue but really we've seen since 2019 a converse a regulatory conversation about how to deal with this space and actually it's the only space i would submit within sort of the overall crypto ecosystem where there's a lot of agreement agreements amongst regulators even a lot of agreement agreement in the industry um in terms of sort of what a backed stablecoin project should essentially look like but i would say you know look i was in 2019 i was at the us treasury department when libra launched and i can tell you it was an absolute watershed because it was really the first time i think regulators realized that you're going to have potentially 200 billion facebook users with access to a stable asset pegged to a basket of global currencies and supported by like the most important companies in the world okay and that was the first i you know that was the first time when regulators regulators had talked a little about crypto but that was the first time they started talking about stable coins i uh i got on a plane with the under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence at the treasury department we flew to switzerland to meet with finma i think people often times forget that it was libra that was really the first time a regulator delved into stable coins because finma at that point had to evaluate the license request from libra i think that what we've seen build off of that over the last several years up into this sort of crescendo over the last few weeks are regulators at least starting to think about this issue and again i know today will delve a lot more into this but you know it's it's it's not like they have to scramble right you have the president's working group come on come come out with a pretty significant paper several months ago uh i guess late last year and really kind of delve into this we've seen it in the executive order where where financial regulators are are uh responding to so i i i think that like you know we're it's definitely a pretty extraordinary wake-up call uh for sort of the crypto community but i think that sort of regulators had already been down the road enough where we may see some some progress in the space over the course of the next several months okay so i i have to add a little bit more to aries point because i i agree with you are you sorry i i feel like i did not pronounce that correctly i think that the questions that we are asking right now or the questions that we are addressing the space after the terra collapse are not the same i mean let's remember that libra was not a successful project right i mean pretty much libra is just put on the side right now i have no idea what's gonna happen next but even after this terra event i think that we're concentrating not on the right questions i mean the question how do we regulate stable coins and what we do as an industry after this usc luna collapse i think in my opinion they're completely distinct and super different from each other i think that if we're referring to the ufc and luna collapse probably we have to address or majority of the questions should be how can we stop this sort of large-scale financial fraud that is happening in the space but i think that summarizing the the two probably is not going to be fair for for our industry yeah i think his point was more just that if it hadn't been for libra then this might have really come out of left field for regulators whereas because of the libra history they actually had some background in stable coins but actually this is the perfect segue to my next question because i did want to ask you know even before we kind of get to this implosion of terra let's just kind of lay the groundwork for people so they have an understanding of what the attitude of u.s regulators has been towards stable coins up until you know before the collapse of terra what are the main ways they tend to seem to think they should be regulated and in particular what have they indicated in terms of how they think algorithmic stable coins like ust should be regulated you know it's interesting i'll kick it off and ulta i know i'm sure you have some thoughts on this look i i think that one thing that regulators have done for the most part and it's actually just interesting a quick aside you know you talk about libra libra completely influenced the mica legislation that's currently moving through the european union i mean if you look at that legislation it's supposed it is a comprehensive framework but it focuses almost exclusively on stable coins and how to regulate them that is part of that sort of libra hangover you know to be sure and mine people what it what does that uh legislation or proposed legislation say yeah so so micah is again it's proposed is sort of working through the eu parliament but it really tries to take a stab at a comprehensive legal framework for cryptocurrency most interestingly is what it advocates for is a past portable license so in other words you can get a license in in france and it would be you'll be able to use that license in spain or across you know the entire european union so that's that's sort of the biggest piece uh which hopefully takes some of the friction out of a crypto business become being able to do business in europe but then again it hits all of these other topics in terms of you know stable coins and actually you know the first thing we really have like this is the legislation that came out this week from senators lummus and gillibrand in terms of like a a proposed you know larger sort of framework and i'm sure we'll talk about that but what's so different is we have legislation pending or out there in the world or bills proposed on stable coins or on ransomware or on anti-money laundering but uh or on securities or commodities or who's to regulate but we really don't have sort of that comprehensive framework this new legislation that's proposed in the senate is that for us micah is essentially that for the european union no i i agree with uh ari i think like the biggest question right now and we have seen like many steps even previously from the regulators but i think that stable coins have not been so much in crosshair in the crosshair of regulators in my opinion so right now like the biggest questions uh the biggest question is who are going to be these regulators like are the banking regulators who oversee stable coins and can they oversee actually all stable points at the same time like where do we concentrate i mean uh if i were to do like a analysis of the structure of stable coins and maybe the maintenance redemption processes definitely needs a little bit more transparency uh from stable coins and and i i mean it would be interesting how the regulators are going to address this the other issue that i have i mean with a kind of questioning which one is the regulator i think like for now in my opinion we have so many cooks in the kitchen and i think having so many cooks in the kitchen probably is not going to be the best especially when it comes to regulating digital assets and and and stable coins so i think probably need some more guidance from the congress who is going to be that regulator that probably is going to be a little bit more forward in in establishing it and also sort of considering the stablecoin frameworks uh and the the protection of investors so all i want to say is i realized very quickly after i stopped talking is that i got sidetracked on europe and the question was how are they dealing with sort of stable coins and algorithmic stable coins in particular and i think one thing i have to say and you know i i you know get the sort of subject matter expertise coming out of the us government you know however they really are i think essentially most regulation or proposed regulation out there today is treating all stable coins the same and i think we all know that there are you know significant differences between stable coins themselves whether you're talking about a us dollar backed stablecoin or another asset-backed stablecoin or whether you're talking about an algorithmic stablecoin that uses essentially software to to to keep the peg regulators have essentially talked about stablecoins you know writ large and i'd say probably the most significant example of that is the president's working group paper that came out the end of last year that i talked a little bit about and really what it says and i think this has been consistent across regulators is that stablecoin issuers should be treated like banks and what does that mean it means they should hold enough reserve assets to support that stable the stable coin itself and that is you know if you sort of try to to get break through all of the noise around this i think at the end of the day that's sort of the most important thing that regulators are talking about is we need to create a situation where a stable coin is actually stable because it is supported by the reserve asset that it is that is tied to and um there's all kinds of other things around stable coins whether it's anti-money laundering you know whether it's consumer protection but really at the heart of it is this idea that if you are buying a stable coin you know that it's backed by the stable asset that is pegged to so i think that's a great point i just wanted to add that i think also for regulators it's just so important to understand the differences between these type of assets right you have to understand the risks you have to understand the use cases you have to understand how each of this one functions or or probably does not function i think that again uh definitely the regulation coming after terra luna event we have to concentrate a little bit maybe even on other jurisdictions like you have japan that they were sort of very proactive and very careful and they do have a sort of narrow definition as i would like to call in regards to stable coins but if those things are unlawful in those jurisdiction i think that that is going to be a problem that and sort of short-sighted as well so i think we maybe need to refer to what is out there especially from the outside jurisdictions and how they're approaching this uh stablecoin regulation and and i'm sure later on we're going to touch up on the new dfs guidance as well and i have more to add to that yeah let's first talk about the lummis gillibrand bill because that actually proposes exactly the model that you were both talking about saying that stable coins should have reserves and i wondered if your interpretation of that bill was that effectively then the us government if this bill were to be adopted that effectively then the u.s government would ban u.s denominated algorithmic stable coins or does that simply mean that they might still exist but they would be regulated in a different way and maybe called a different name what was your take on that i'm happy to kind of kick it off and uh my quick interpretation is that there's not yet a take on that and i think that sort of you know this is a really this is really an important first step this this uh legislation and i think one thing that's really important is it may frame the conversation right like now these are going to be the issues that we're going to be talking about we're constantly going to be referring back to rifa over the next uh you know a few years as we sort of negotiate this but i think it's a really interesting question and i hate to sort of you know not have a a great answer but i will say this look and and just for people you were referring to the bill which is responsible financial innovation act absolutely and so sorry yes it was literally proposed this week so i mean this has got to be one of the sort of the earliest conversations about sort of what's in there and what to expect but i think it really is a jumping-off point to a conversation and ultimately that conversation is going to be well is the us government only going to approve stable coin projects that are backed by the us dollar or is it going are there going to be other sort of pieces to all of this and algorithmic stable coins are an interesting issue it's not necessarily that they're going to be banned right there aren't there are potentially other possibilities like they have to have us dollars in you know in reserved to support that algorithm or will it be required to have you know bitcoin or another asset to reserve so is the question going to be like are these only going to be u.s dollar peg projects or are they are the reserves going to be okay but i do think that no one is getting past this question of reserves they're going to have to be reserved because i think there was enough lost here in the terra situation and i think that the systemic risks are too potentially great for governments just to sort of allow you know allow this to potentially happen i would say just one sort of last caveat on this if we're ever going to see some sort of fdic style insurance for these types of projects or for cryptocurrency exchanges i think that's really where the importance of regulation kicks in because you know the one hand you know the guy i don't think the government is ever going to agree to sort of back something that it doesn't have some pretty substantial regulation around particularly on this reserve issue and actually just a question when you were talking about the reserves are you saying that they would only accept certain types of reserves and they should be you know either literal dollars or dollar like instruments meaning that something for instance more like a crypto collateral backed stable coin even if it was over collateralized you think that that is just a separate conversation and it's not even addressed here i think this is again like this is a jumping off point to the conversation that we're having right now and i think it could result in ultimately you know hey maybe there are other categories of stable coins that without us regulators would allow to to essentially be regulated by them and maybe that's what it is maybe those are examples but i do think this is this this initial you know any us dollar back project must have adequate reserves i also think remember this is a u.s bill and you know ultimately all that they can legislate around is what the u.s has jurisdiction on and i think this is a very clear comment that the us clearly has jurisdiction on any stable coin project that is backed by u.s dollars and i think that's sort of a that's an opening salvo into the conversation about what they can and cannot regulate so i think that's a big part of it right the us treasury is going to be involved in any project that is backed and essentially supported by the us dollar so i think part of that the reason that they focus on the u.s dollar in particular is a jurisdictional issue as well right i don't know that congress believes that they can necessarily legislate outside of outside of the u.s uh dollar and i think that's where that's a jumping-off point from lumus and gillibrand's perspective yeah which makes it sound as if um for instance something like maker dow with die which is crypto collateral backed and well oh no but well hmm i was because of course it's also backed by ustc so so actually so for then for that scenario um would you say that then it would still fall outside u.s regulation or what's your take on something like that it's a great it's a great question and you know look i think there's a lot of jurisdictional hooks for u.s regulators and another would be are you interacting with u.s persons or u.s entities and so many of these projects are so i think there's like yes u.s the us dollar is one hook for regulators or u.s law enforcement ultimately to get involved another would be are you touching u.s persons or u.s entities so i think that probably that covers any most examples now if you don't touch us persons or us entities and you're not involved with the us dollar you're not doing correspondent banking of any kind then hey you may live and breathe and move outside the u.s financial system in which case you know that would be something that would be difficult for u.s regulators or or ultimately law enforcement if there's an investigation to get involved in uh i mean i agree with everything that ari said but i would like to add that first of all i'm very optimistic at least that we're seeing this bipartisan bill i think that bill has a long way to go i mean there are a lot of definitions that we have to start working on i mean i love the sort of perspective and uh whether predicting for stable coins or i think definitely is going to move the needle as we like to say for asset-backed stable coins as the legal standard along with also many other disclosure requirements but i think that and what was your take on the stable coin portion did you feel that effectively the bill if it were adopted would kind of ban algorithmic stable coins or simply definitely i think that the yes yes and that's why again i wish that there is a little bit more experimentation in the space and but seems like this bill definitely is going to bend algorithm stable coins and when we talk about algorithm stable coins i think that we have to consider that maybe there are other structures or maybe there are other designs about algorithm stable coins that we have to consider like whether or not the stable coins can be baked back by i don't know like not only fiat or not i mean i think the understanding of fiat stable coins is a little bit mixed right now so that's why i feel that we are not on the same page at least myself with the latest bill from jill brandt and loomis yeah and just just just just one thing real quick on that you know look i think that i'm not entirely sure this bill addresses it at all and i think that there will be conversations around that to be sure um but i also think the technology is going to get better and you know i think what what is what is missed in some of this conversation because it is awful and what happened and 50 billion dollars in value right is a real thing but i think there is a winnowing out right now going on in the overall sort of crypto ecosystem where you know their projects are failing and i i don't necessarily think uh it is a bad thing today but is it overall you know as we go forward this is what happened in the early days of the internet with projects and i think we're seeing some of that fallout happen right now but what i will say is i think that some of the technology the idea of an algorithmic stablecoin right is part of the promise potentially of cryptocurrency itself it is this idea where you don't need fiat currencies to back or support or to prop up the economy you don't necessarily need intermediaries i can't believe i'm the one on this on the podcast making this argument uh ulta but no i mean i still believe my point is that at least give a chance to experimentation and you could even come commissioner her peers she mentioned this i don't know recently like i i do not think that we're giving a chance to algorithm stable coins of course this sierra luna event happened but as i said maybe you have stable points i mean algorithm stable coins that i mean you can pack them maybe to a physical commodity maybe you can pack them to central fiat central bank fiat currency my point is that at least we give a little bit more experimentation to the space just kind of putting everything under the tira event and kind of banning algorithm stable points i don't think that is going to be not only protecting innovation but at the same time is going to put a big stop due to how much potential stable coins even algorithm stable coins bring to the industry so both of you which it makes sense to me since you're both working in the industry that you would still want to see that there's a possibility for innovation for entrepreneurs to at least attempt to create an algorithmic stablecoin that would work and not enter a death spiral but it's your sense so far that you know obviously this terra collapse was was enormous and the impact on retail investors was huge and we're gonna probably see lawsuits and other regulatory enforcement actions etc but do you think that right now the is the temperature that you're reading basically that this means the end of algorithmic stable coins and that regulators will not tolerate this kind of experimentation anymore or do you think that the kind of consequences will be limited to terra and terraform labs but that they'll still allow this type of experimentation it's a tough question i will say you know like you know we're both in the industry i am definitely in the industry today but i was uh at the department of justice for 11 years and treasury for two so i you know i i definitely am always thinking with sort of that regulatory prosecutor hat and i will say look i mean i think there's serious concern and if there wasn't concern before this having played out exactly the type of systemic risk that was mentioned in the president's working group that janet yellen has talked about in every speech is not good in terms of sort of how regulators are going to look at this but i will say that maybe there are places in which you can play around with the technology and get it right where you don't necessarily create the type of situation i mean one thing to janet yellen's credit and also sort of mention this early on is that she came out recently and said you know in response to tara and said look this is not a systemic risk this you know to the entire economy and why because this is not you know it's a relatively this is a relatively small project and i think that's probably true today of the entire stable coin ecosystem but we will be at a place where that's not necessarily true and if we're going to experiment i think what i think what what reasonable regulators would say globally is that if we're going to experiment we should do it in places where we're not creating significant risk to consumers or significant sort of risk to markets or systemic risks and that's maybe sandboxes and other sorts of ways to do this i think that the the hope is that the technology will get where it needs to go because i think there's tremendous promise but i think you're now and you talk about you know you you open up the show by talking about sort of what are the real what is the real hangover going to be it's that that regulators are going to be very very skittish about algorithmic stable coins in particular in light of what happened here i think that to put this a little bit on a better perspective maybe i think that reading new york cfs guide guidance recently i think that that's a little bit up more optimistic even though they're addressing stablecoin specific regulation and definitely they're more considering or going after regulations especially when it comes to the algo staples i think that they're concentrating right now mostly on tether i mean that to me shows that hopefully we still have a chance or we're still going to have a chance about algorithm stablecoin so it seems that this guidance is mostly concentrating on usd back stable coins like they might be fully backed by the asset reserve etc i mean hopefully again this guidance is not going to put all the stable coins in one bucket and uh for allowing some more experimentation in in in the space yeah ulta is absolutely right when it comes to the new york dfs guidance which is really extraordinary and i will say before i say anything else at that guidance and that is absolute kudos to dfs for being as concise as they were and clear in explaining what they were trying to get across i mean laura you're a great writer uh you fewer words sometimes you know tell the story and they used very few words to really sort of make their point this is they said this is exactly what you have to have in terms of reserves this is what redeemability should look like you should have an asset station process so i think really what we have now is a blueprint okay a real playbook for what we're going to be seeing regulators globally look to and do and to ulta's point it's not quite as clear-cut as it has to be a us dollar reserve right there are other options within that guidance and i think that it's probably a great jumping-off point you're going to see other regulators globally look to it which is amazing for a u.s state you know regulator to come out which i think could be like some of the most important guidance um that we see globally in the space i did want to spell out for listeners the uh new york state department of financial services proposal is that stable coins traded in new york should be fully backed by certain assets those assets should be segregated from the issuers operational funds and there should be regular attestations by an auditor um which is aries sort of mentioned it but i just wanted to spell it out no i'm so sorry i usually do such a better job of explaining it myself so i'm so sorry that was awesome laura that was amazing no i i agree with you i think that this is actually the very first guidance or almost complete guidance that i have seen about stable coins in this space because i think they address a lot in this guidance they address the potential risks including here cyber security uh including here information technology network design and maintenance and then related technology and also from uh operational same standpoint my point is that at least here in this guidance we see a little bit of more better approach about the bank secrecy act money laundering and the sanctions compliance that they are trying to concentrate in this guidance and also consumer protection i think it's a very good first step in the space and hopefully uh we're going to see more of this from other regulators as well in a moment we'll talk about what kinds of regulatory and legal action we'll see specifically against terraform labs and dokuan but first a quick word

terraform labs lost its appeal against the sec which means now that the sec has jurisdiction over terraform labs listeners may recall that last fall do quan was served subpoenas on his way to speak on a panel at massari's main net conference and at that time i talked with a crypto lawyer who tends to be more skeptical of the industry and he actually said that he felt that sec was in the wrong and that terraform labs was right and saying that the sec had not followed its own rules so i was actually surprised by this ruling and i was curious to hear your opinion about this ruling and also to hear um you know even though these subpoenas were about the mirror protocol which uh is synthetic assets that were um on that in the tarot ecosystem now that terra has collapsed what do you think the establishment of this jurisdiction means for any legal or regulatory action that has to do with terror rather than mirror sure absolutely look i think that you you you nailed it in terms of the question laura and that is sort of what what does the jurisdictional question now sort of mean for what was just announced in terms of a an investigation into terra and dokuan on this on this on the collapse of of terra essentially and really what it means is that the u.s has jurisdiction over the person and potentially over over the project and and over the project as well one thing just sort of like i guess beyond just the the mirror investigation now just yesterday i believe it was reported that there is a current investigation on on the collapse which i think is potentially you know even more interesting and but the issue is going to be a slightly different issue it's not necessarily going to just be whether or not mirror was engaged in sort of unlicensed securities but it's going to be about whether there was some sort of fraud involved investor fraud involved in terror and ultimately was that fraud uh you know are are they liable for that fraud in terms of in terms of an enforcement action um and i think that that's that's what we're currently gonna see now and that's gonna be sort of the really interesting case and when you talk about fraud the way that it was phrased in the bloomberg article was that the issue was around their marketing of tara so is that what you're correct that's exactly that's exactly you know yes did they did they deceive investors essentially by making certain promises that turned out to be violations that's going to be that's going to be the interesting investigation from the sec there's going to be plenty of other investigations and civil lawsuits and we can talk more about sort of what the criminal liability potentially could be in a moment but this that is going to to me the interesting piece of the sec is they're going to go after you know jo kwon and potentially others involved in the project for this type of deceptive marketing which obviously falls under the sec jurisdiction as well but can you actually flesh that out right now like what are the consequences for like i don't know what types of charges those would be or what types of sentences those would be sure absolutely let's sort of pull these apart a little bit so what essentially what you could have is you could have an sec investigation which could result in an enforcement action of some kind which would be monetary okay you could then potentially also on the other hand have a criminal case against okwan or other individuals or even the company itself and it's been recently reported that south korean authorities in fact have opened an investigation of that kind and the standard there is very different it the standard there would be you know can law enforcement authorities or law enforcement prosecutors prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he engaged in essentially you know deceitful conduct willful fraudulent conduct that resulted in you know people it resulted in some sort of episode here losing you know 50 billion dollars worth of worth of people's funds so in the criminal context the consumers the the holders of tara aren't the ones who are going to be made whole necessarily although there there could be certainly a fine involved in that but the focus on there would be criminal liability and right now it looks like there's a south korean investigation but just given sort of the global reach of terror it's very possible that other law enforcement entities would potentially be involved then again going back to the sec that's regulatory action which would not result in a sentence or someone going to jail but would rather result in fines and potentially shutting down the project even sort of what's left of it or sort of this new iteration of it um or or sort of other activity always monetary i've heard people say things like oh if that person just never sets foot again in the u.s then they can avoid you know whatever um legal or regulatory thing they're trying to avoid is would that be the case here or is that not something that doe kwon could do that's not the case here you know uh like again putting the sec case aside a little bit sort of from a regulatory perspective there was in fact a criminal case in the u.s or even in south korea or anywhere else there's all kinds of mutual legal assistance treaties there's extradition treaties where one jurisdiction would ultimately could ultimately potentially you know make an arrest again we're probably a long time from an investigation that would result in some sort of charge or indictment but just the way that works i was you know i did exactly this job i was a federal prosecutor for about 11 years and we would indict people in other jurisdictions and potentially they would travel to the united states or they would travel to a friendly country that we had an extradition treaty with the way you don't ever get your hands on somebody is if they are in a country where they don't you know respect us jurisdiction like russia or north korea or iran but otherwise you know if if this individual is in south korea i imagine the south then the south korean authorities would prosecute him but if he had a pending indictment in the u.s and he traveled somewhere that there's a world in which u.s law enforcement could get their hands on him but this is sort of more of a broader conversation around sort of federal criminal jurisdiction and i agree with you ari but that person he was already in the united states don't you think that instead of forewarned at that time probably a probably would have been the best approach for duquan you mean when he was in the united states when he was served with those papers yeah unfortunately i just i don't know sort of what the sec investigation actually looked like at that time i don't think anybody does still obviously sort of a pending investigation so so much harder to say but um yeah no he served with papers obviously it was just regulatory there's no sort of criminal piece to it so you know you're free to go home and and um continue sort of legal process uh i think of course this is going to be a very interesting investigation i'm not very surprised by this investigation of course but at the same time i think that the biggest question is that whether or not sec versus cftc has the rights of sort of jurisdiction i still think that sec has the right jurisdiction here because we're dealing whether or not luna seems to be a security and in my opinion is a security but at the same time since we already had jurisdiction under duquan and considering the ties that he had with many u.s users as well and how much of his activity was concentrating on u.s users i think that probably would have been a better idea to to proceed with as i said with the tarot at the same time inside of a warren but i mean of course ari has more expertise than myself when it comes to this sort of actions but as i said probably that would have been much more beneficial and also protecting investors as well at that time yeah i think that i read that essentially because they had staff here including legal counsel in the u.s that those were some of the reasons yeah the judge cited for why the us would have jurisdiction here absolutely if you're engaging with u.s users if you're engaging with u.s entities i mean they have a clear presence in the united states you know but look i think what we're getting to is some of the challenges sort of in the cryptocurrency space generally in terms of regulation right no one regulator can solve any of this alone i was speaking this morning with mas from singapore who made the exact point that whatever we ultimately regulate and however our regulations are written they don't mean anything necessarily unless they are consistent with the us and the uk and the eu right and others who are sort of regulating in the space so that's the nature of crypto sort of right this you know decentralized permissionless cross-border value transfer you have to have consistent regulation across jurisdiction or you're going to have jurisdictional arbitrage which is essentially where actors you know good or bad decide to do business in a certain jurisdiction because there's less regulation there and it's going to ultimately take you know i'm not naive enough to think that the world is going to come together and come put forward crypto regulation right but or legislation or legal frameworks but i do believe there has to be some consistency and we'll see how ultimately that plays out but that is you know we are very early days there i i just wanted to say that i do expect like a private and or more confidential settlement here i mean i'm not sure how far away from from that we can go but that's only my opinion do you think that ari or is it like i don't i don't know i've never that you know the sec is the one major regulator i've not worked for um but uh i mean yeah i will say that that i don't know if that's necessarily consistent with sort of what we've been reading about in terms of them wanting to go to trial with cases wanting to sort of push them forward but um but quite frankly yeah no i uh i wouldn't speculate sort of i mean if if we're dealing only especially if he has more like civil lawsuits uh i mean probably we're gonna see a lot of more civil lawsuits and if we have more sibilances in my opinion probably we're going to see like this private and confidential settlement well you know that's another important point we're massive we're going to see a massive number of civil suits and we've started to see those already which are again completely separate from we've already talked about which is criminal rape criminal action potentially civil action i'm sorry uh regulatory action and then we'll see civil lawsuits from people who believe that there was gross negligence or even sort of beyond right some type of willful act that was fraudulent or deceitful that resulted in you know people investing and losing their money i think they'll have a hard time to establish the willful act but yeah and actually you know speaking of um civil lawsuits like do you think that it's likely we'll see a class-action lawsuit against terraform labs in the u.s i think it's highly likely um i mean we've already seen we've already seen a number of different um lawsuits or sort of the threat of lawsuits and uh we're likely to see an attempt i my lawyer friends won't like this or my other lawyer friends won't like this but you know whenever there's an opportunity for a class action you're going to see lawyers involved um so and this is and this is a tremendous opportunity right and you know ulta sort of said that like maybe the evidence isn't there but i can tell you you know like i did not spend a ton of time as a civil lawyer i spent most of my career as a criminal lawyer but they will be digging through emails and there will be massive discovery and who knows what's in those documents so i think it'll be sort of an interesting there'll just be look i mean that's the legal process there's gonna be a ton of discovery they're gonna learn a lot more and ultimately see how it all plays out but but i i do think that uh we are likely to see a lot of uh activity i actually have a very specific question about that before we get to that though i do also want to ask there were a number of big investors and vcs who were extremely vocal in their support of ust and on a recent episode of the chopping block to roon chitra co-founder of gauntlet so that he felt investors should also be held accountable what do you think of that and if so if you agree then kind of under what regulation would would that happen i can't comment because we were one of those people i don't have a strong comment either to say that it's you know i mean it's difficult to uh hold vic those who are also victims potentially um you know accountable but no i don't know that i have a good one for that so i know you're both not trained lawyers in south korean law but i did want to also talk about reports that the seoul metropolitan police are investigating allegations that terraform labs embezzled some of the bitcoins that were meant to defend ust's dollar peg if that turns out to be true what could be the legal and regulatory consequences and in general how do you see korean regulators responding to this whole terror debacle yeah i know i look as you sort of said at the outset i am certainly not a expert on korean law when i was a prosecutor i did have a number of cases where i worked with korean national police but but i will say this what we're here hearing what that means is that there's a pending criminal investigation right so put all the regulatory stuff aside which you have there is korean law enforcement korean prosecutors are looking into sort of the criminal aspects of this you know and and that requires in in the us and in most jurisdictions that requires sort of knowing willful intentional conduct and what we could potentially be looking at then is a combination of different things one you know did the leadership of tara do quan and others you know were they intentionally deceitful uh or intentionally fraudulent in um in statements that they made that resulted in um the collapse or insulted at least in people investing and losing money and then that second piece is you know the sort of embezzling piece you know look was there wire fraud again like this is as a us prosecutor you know you know was there wire fraud was there money laundering uh were there other sort of criminal acts involved in all of this whether it's this alleged embezzlement of bitcoins or whether it's just the you know the other aspects of the project itself but those are the things you're going to be looking for did people make fraudulent claims and if so you know in the u.s you know that's likely wire fraud these days because you're using a cell phone you're using a computer to do that and that involves interstate communication um you know and i imagine that those will be the same things that korean prosecutors will be looking at here so i agree with ari i think that the main cause of action or claims here definitely are going to be about about fraud and investment of money and i think that for people who are on twitter i don't think that that is of course the only evidence out there but it seems that even for the staff of terra and the acts that they performed prior to the collapse of terra they might fall they might fall under this fraud claims and potentially embezzlement of money it would be interesting how the korean government and how the korean prosecutors are going to pursue this but definitely i do expect a lot of more civil lawsuits there and especially i mean based on that evidentiary sort of fooding that they're going to consider so one other thing that i really had to ask about was after the failure of ust dokuan made a new proposal for reviving the chain without the stable coin and very quickly thereafter terra 2.0 was launched with an airdrop of 700 million luna to terrorist stakeholders could the airdrop also land terraform labs in hot water with regulators i definitely think so and actually the moment that i learned more about that airdrop 2.0 i think that definitely that would come into sec kind of supervision and i'm sure they're very much aware of what happened so to me this definitely was one of those effort that came out of the project right so it was pretty centralized again from terra and the way how they did and and performed or implemented that that airdrop probably it's going again to go under sec uh jurisdiction i mean i'm not trying to to be super negative here but i to me that did represent a lot of more regulatory issues i don't know that i had much to add to that i think that was a good answer there's been some movement toward or from regulators trying to kind of segregate the world of unhosted or self-hosted wallets from custodial wallets there's things like the travel world rule which requires transacting entities to obtain personally identifying information with their transaction partners for transactions above a certain threshold and in general it sort of seems that regulators prefer to kind of impose a system where intermediaries are maintained as part of the functioning of d5 whereas obviously many defy operators aspire at least to make it truly decentralized without intermediaries and really make it a system of smart contracts so what effect do you think this collapse of tara will have on this kind of tussle we're seeing in terms of how regulators want to regulate defy and how the d5 entrepreneurs would hope to be regulated yeah i know i'll take a crack at that i don't uh i don't know if it's going to have a major effect and don't get me wrong i wouldn't want to sort of belittle the effect that this has had on regulators and on the market but i think regulators have already started thinking and again this is earlier days like this is earlier days than where we are on stable coins today about sort of how to regulate in the d5 space and you made a great point look all of the regulatory frameworks today revolve around intermediaries you know like you you made the sort of travel rule money laundering you know example right all cryptocurrency businesses that touch us persons or in the united states are regulated as money service businesses they're required to have compliance programs they have to have trained professionals they have to have transaction monitoring like trm and other types of tools to ensure that you know money laundering is not taking place defy is different right it might not have you know compliance officers and and teams and and all that i think what regulators would say today and not a lot have spoken to this yet and i think it's i think it's interesting and it's a great question and we'll have another show you know down the road because we're going to see i think in the d5 space what we've seen now in stable coins and that is a bunch of regulators come out and start to sort of propose frameworks the abu dhabi uh global market center adgm came out maybe a month ago with what i think is really significant guidance that maybe frames sort of the question fat if the financial action task force talked about this in its latest guidance and what fat have said and what aggm says sort of to some extent is that look just cause you call yourself defy or decentralized doesn't mean you are and if you are a d5 project right that has a central uh hub that engages with users that sets you know that sets sort of controls that makes a profit then you are probably a vast or a virtual asset service provider sort of and and should be regulated as such but they also say and i think this is consistent across regulators that if you are really what you just described laura you are a smart contract that is you know you have a software that is sent out to live and breathe on blockchains and do its thing then i think that's sort of not a regulated entity but that's not going to be a regulated entity but honestly like i think the reality is that most d5 projects today are working to become decentralized and i think regulators would say well then you're probably just like an exchange but like i think you this is this is it's a great point because that this may just very well be the next frontier in terms of sort of how regulators are engaging in our space i agree with re but at the same time i think that right now we are and especially the regulators are kind of grappling with this autonomous functioning code and and this is something that regulations i think they are regulators they still have to catch up i think that we still go back to the question of where to find this intermediary and i think that this is the important one from a regulatory standpoint or perspective but this question can be answered in many different ways as long as we consider the possibility that there can be some sort of situation where there is not going to be an intermediary and that's exactly what is really taking place in uh in this peer-to-peer trading and technology that is of course facilitated mostly by autonomous functioning code so i think that probably in this space we do need a lot of more education and we do need a lot a lot i mean especially for the regulators and just because some people are kind of scared there is no reason to regulate to regulate it sort of out of existence after tara 2.0 revived some terra community watchers discovered that there had been a 90 million dollar exploit on mirror protocol several months ago the mirror protocol team has not said anything about whether or not they knew about this exploit but they they had actually fixed it in in recent months so it's not clear whether they fixed it because they knew that the money had been stolen or not but let's say hypothetically that they had known and they had not disclosed it with that kind of situation you know developers not disclosing a major hack would that kind of thing ever trigger regulatory action based on your sort of pure hypothetical and again i think i i would want to caveat by saying i don't know ultimately sort of the facts of what happened there in terms of did people know did they not know but i think what a regulator typically does and certainly law enforcement does in this instance is look at what sort of the evidence is you know i think that if there was knowledge and and a company essentially held back that knowledge and did not share it with investors shareholders call them what you want you know intentionally in order to sort of have the project not lose value then i certainly think that there's potential regulatory action it's the same type of potentially fraudulent activity that we spoke about earlier in that sec context this current investigation so i think there's certainly that there's certainly that possibility you know look i think that we've seen it's not just terra here we've seen a proliferation of hacks on cryptocurrency businesses over the last several months and um you know some of it's some have been days later that they that they ultimately noticed it or allegedly ultimately noticed it we look at the ronin hack it was four or five days after the hack that it was ultimately you know reported so i think that you know it's it's hard to say but i think it would be a very fact specific determination but i would say that like you know look yeah if they had knowledge that tens of millions of dollars was potentially lost of investor funds or or shareholder funds or however you want to customer funds and did not share that because they did not want to see the value decrease or some other sort of business decision i think that i think this could potentially be that that would potentially be something investigated no i fully agree with aria and especially i think i mean maybe i would like to be a little bit more straightforward there because i think that the knowledge was there so for these developers to be i mean to have not only the knowledge of what was going on but i think that the element of fraud and what they were trying to hide with the information that was knowledgeable to them prior to everyone else i think there are many other claims that probably are going to have several repercussions potentially okay but you're just guessing that they knew like i'm just listening yes but i mean considering everything that we've been reading so far i assume that they did have knowledge so at the moment we're still hearing new reports every day of new legal and regulatory consequences like i fully expect there may be more between now when we're recording which is friday june 10th and the day that this episode is published so going forward what are you going to be on the lookout for what other shoes do you think will probably drop yeah look from my perspective i think that this is in fact a watershed i think thankfully and janet yellen's comments it did not present a systemic risk because it was a relatively small event in the overall ecosystem but i will say that i think we are going to see more and more attention from regulators and i actually was thinking this before the terra collapsed so i i i think it's more true today though and that is the one area of all of this that i think probably the industry governments regulators agree on is sort of some regulation around stable coins you know treating them as banks requiring reserves those sort of things so i think if we're going to see any action and i don't know that we'll see any action in the us congress you know over the next few months but i would say if we're going to see action on anything it is very possible that it's stable points and i do think that this event pushed that forward again i don't think we saw the scrambling that we would have seen a year ago a year and a half ago from regulators based on sort of all that had already been done but i do think that if we're ever if we're going to see legislative action on anything over the next couple of years quite frankly in the crypto space it is going to be stable coins and this event will have had an impact on that i think we'll look back on when you write your book laura on sort of the the regulatory history the history of crypto regulation right i do think that things like libra but then an event like terra will have had a significant impact on sort of the way regulators are thinking about sort of the space in regards to this event stable coins are they still represent a vital innovation in my opinion so hopefully this is not going to be those events as i previously mentioned that is going to stop in experimentation because at the same time it's terrible to see this sort of fallout that truly affected so many people but i think in this space we should continue building systems we should continue focus focusing more on not only being having building reliable projects but earth also for them to scale as projects i do not think that we are at this point right now that we do not want for this capital markets or for the trading of these assets to move offshore because we have already seen the aftermath of many saw other projects moving offshore so again i think that we have to give a chance to stable coins and even algorithm stablecoins we want for all the developers i think for all the engineers for all these innovators in the space to keep doing and building and and and certainly give i mean hopefully we're going to have a little bit more clarity as we always say from the regulators and from our legislators and and and probably we're going to have a little bit more growth in the space i mean we are in a bear market i completely understand the sentiment that is out there right now but look that we are still here i mean uh ari and myself and many other attorneys we still are here we're still working with projects and as i said there's so many amazing projects out there continue growing and and building the space so hopefully this thera event is knowing is not going to impact the whole industry all right well we will have to see what happens where can people learn more about each of you and your work so i am on linkedin i am on twitter and i would love for people to learn more about avalanche and avalabs i mean we are the fastest blockchain network out there uh definitely there is a lot of building on our blockchain and uh and i i would love to have more people to reach out we do have a lot of more use cases that we have implemented with avalanche especially disaster recovery payments and insurance performance etc but if people would like to learn more about my company please feel free to reach out to me on twitter and linkedin terrific yes and uh we love what ulta's doing and uh yeah no i i'm at trm labs uh check out trmlabs.com uh we have a terrific blog that i write a lot for i also host a at least once a month webcast called trm talks where i sit down with policymakers in the cryptocurrency space to sort of talk about these types of issues and yeah prolific on linkedin and uh and follow me on twitter as well
