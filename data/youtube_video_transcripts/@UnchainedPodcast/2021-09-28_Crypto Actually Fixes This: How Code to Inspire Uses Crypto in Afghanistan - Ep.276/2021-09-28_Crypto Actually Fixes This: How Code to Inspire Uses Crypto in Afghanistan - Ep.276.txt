regular listeners to the show will remember that farisha was mentioned in an interview i did with steve ehrlich of forbes and people were interested in hearing more about her and more about real world use cases of crypto so faresha thank you so much for joining us especially because world news in recent months has had a direct impact on you and your family but before we get into those recent events why don't we start with your personal story as a refugee and how you became a computer science professor absolutely well i was born as a refugee in iraq during the soviet invasion to afghanistan my parents are originally from herat it's a city in west of afghanistan very mountainous and beautiful and one of the main cities that the heart of the ancient silk road was passing through the city unfortunately my parents the same as a lot of other people in afghanistan has to leave the country and find a safe haven for their children i was born in a very small town close to iran and afghanistan border i grew up in a big family eight children i'm the fifth one so you can imagine i'm not the oldest and i'm not the youngest so i kind of like i think grew up independent and i think that's really shaped my character certainly being born you know as a refugee grew up as a refugee um it's a lot of issues that you're facing not only the discriminations that you're facing with because you're just indifferent and unfortunately sometimes people look at you as an unwanted guest and they think that you're here to steal the opportunities from them and that makes it very difficult for you to blend into the community and then the financial aspects of it being a refugee you will be denied access certain basic and fundamental rights in the country that you're in such as opening bank accounts accessing education in a school and um that was one of the big issues that we were facing with my family and i remember that my mom learned how to stitch and make dresses and by selling them she could bring money to the family and she could invest in our education so i guess from the very early age i learned to be entrepreneur and how you can start great things with empty hands and that's what i learned from my mom and i know the value of education and how it is important we moved to afghanistan one year after the fall of taliban when the us invaded afghanistan 2002. to herat and i applied for university entrance and by chance and randomly i got into computer science that was certainly not my favorite field of study and my family really encouraged me to um to to continue because they said it's the future it's something that we think can help you a lot um and i continued studying computer science i got my bachelor from herat university and then i received a scholarship i went to germany and i got my master's in computer science from technical university of berlin went back and taught as a computer science professor for about three years in herat university so certainly i guess my life's history as a refugee being denied accessing education and as a woman studying computer science and teaching computer science in herat and afghanistan the discrimination the backlashes i faced the verbal sexual harassments in the working and educational space that i face in a lot of women made me to think about how i can change the situation for women especially in technology sector and that's how it led me to establish code to inspire as the first coding school for girls in afghanistan january 2015. and tell us what code to inspire does so with code to inspire there's three important pillar of the work first we provide an only a single gender school you know only for women and girls so that the family feel comfortable sending their daughters to our school second we offer the school for free because a lot of the girls come from a challenging financial background and the third which is the most important pillar of the work is we offer certain technical skills that can be translated either into job opportunities within the community in afghanistan or we can outsource projects to them so the students can work remotely or they can be entrepreneur and create their own company and startups and hire more women since 2015 we've educated more than 350 students in our coding classes such as game design web development mobile and also blockchain cryptocurrency and graphic design class with our graduates the data that we have well pre-taleable unfortunately since a month ago 60 to 70 percent of our students found job within the community and they're getting paid some of them above average income salary which is 150 per month in afghanistan we've outsourced more than 40 projects worth of 30 000 to our students and a group of our graduates about 10 percent of them they created their own startups raise funds and heart more women and our school again pre-taliban um was a physical location in her right full time for our students and the classes were being taught in person and so um give us a sense of kind of what girls education and opportunities are in afghanistan um aside from this school like you know if if they don't have this kind of opportunity then what does that look like for them well there's certainly a lot of challenges and and issues not only right now which is a whole different story with the taliban taking over afghanistan but even in past um infrastructure is a big issue um if you talk about big cities um still there's lack of buildings staff and teachers and resources for students especially female schools the lack of equipment you know like having laptops internet connections and the commute would be a big issue for the girls to leave their house especially the ones who live far away from the school if you leave the big cities um in rounding and especially in villages um you won't have um facility for that you may have access to primary or maybe secondary education but you don't have high school just because again the population is financially underserved there's not a lot of resources for them such as schools buildings and the families won't feel comfortable you know sending their daughters to travel a long way to go to the next big city to get the education so the lack of resources and um infrastructure really is a big issue to access equal education especially for girls and women and then the spot and then beside that of course uh the cultural the patriarchal society and the extremists make it very difficult for the girls to access education um sometimes families become under the influence you know of the extremists and won't let their daughter to continue education forced marriages early marriages are one of the important factors that the girls drop from school because once they get married the fiance or the husband won't let them to continue education and of course they gain financial issues not a lot of family can invest in extracurricular activities they prefer to invest in the boys education because they think that the boy is going to be the future breadwinner not the girl so they prefer to send the boy to the school not the girl so these are some of the main important factors of why girls education would be very difficult not only in cities but also in areas outside of the city for afghanistan can you maybe give some examples of kind of what risks girls face when they do try to seek out an education yes well definitely the backlashes you know and the threats they face from either their family members or the community a lot of times maybe the male members of the family relatives would be against the education and if they raise their voice they may face threats it can be um threats such as like you know um they hit them you know violence against women they lock them at home or the extreme way of like extremists burn the schools for girls we do have incidents of you know extremists and the taliban burning girls skulls and that's make the family feel so scared and uncomfortable to risk the lives of the girls to you know send them to school even like um trying to do the commute from one location to another location they may be abducted you know by unknown people so these are like serious uh concerns that make it very difficult sometimes for families to even if they want to send their daughters to school won't be feel comfortable to do that and so since founding code to inspire what impact have you seen it have so um there's a lot of inspiring stories you know and great stories of the girls who came to the school and graduated um i can say a majority of the girls who joined our coding school didn't have access to internet connections they didn't have laptops even basic phones so they were totally living in an offline world and with the um infrastructure and equipment we provided for them that was certainly a very life-changing not only um looking at the educational aspects of it but all the financial aspects of it these are the girls who came to school they were so shy they really didn't believe in themselves they didn't have self-esteem and we encouraged them you know building um their own life around what they're learning and be outspoken and raise their voice and no one would question them and we see that like their self-esteem boosted they now have social media accounts and you know write about their activities i give you one example of one of our graduates she came to the school when she was um in 10th grade and when we interviewed her was like why you want to join this coding school and she said i want to make money and we were like that's great there's uh you know nothing wrong with making money and she came from a very financial challenging background she even couldn't pay for the community but she was so motivated that we sponsored her commute gave her a laptop to take home and once she graduated she was one of the top graduates and one day she texted me and she said you can't believe what i say that i convinced the company that they're they're all men that they can make a website for you and take your business online and they agreed and they're going to pay me 200 so i was like wow you're you know such a bad ass like you know like such young age to convince you know their companies and men to give you an opportunity and now you are bringing money to the family which makes you to have a voice in the family and be a part of decision making process in the family and we have tons of stories like that yeah well i was gonna ask you um do you feel that uh the experience that the girls have that it changes attitudes either in their family or in their communities or or does the existence of the school in general has that had an impact in changing attitudes absolutely you know when we started a program and we were kind of like posting in our social media about our activities a lot of people especially men very educated even some computer science men they're like oh like that's useless what they're learning they're gonna get married they're gonna like you know go to the house clean the kitchen make babies and stuff like that and um it was so offensive because they couldn't see that you know there is a path to financial freedom with what we are trying to do and um after a year or so when we have graduates and we help them you know with jobs and giving them opportunities they brought the money to the family and some of them actually made double or triple than the men in the family and the family couldn't believe that the girl of the family is capable of doing something that the boy of the family is not and they called us they start calling us the father the brother the husbands came check the school and they said we can't believe we see that she's behind the computer she's doing something but when we have no idea but she's bringing money to the family and they started calling the relatives and other people and encouraged their daughter to join in school and we received calls from others so it became very organic once people realized that there's a value on investing education and because being able to bring money to the family that's that's great yeah i mean just when you were talking earlier you know it's such a contrast if i think about growing up here in the us like there's no question that you would send a girl to school so um you know what your thing is is it's just very eye-opening for somebody who grew up here but one other thing i found fascinating was i have seen a video about code to inspire where the girls were making video games and the protagonist or the player in the game they made it as an afghan girl and then the video showed that there were afghan boys playing this game and i just wondered um how do you think things like that have also changed perceptions of girls in afghanistan absolutely so like beside education we also want to change the perspective of community towards girls education and empowerment and we've been creating different games and apps that they're geared towards certain uh problem in the community and one of them was the afghan hero girl game that you're referring to i remember we had a brainstorming session with our students in game class and we were kind of like okay what would be the next game and then they're like you know like we are kind of like tired of seeing all these like superheroes in the game are first mainly men and we see that they're just like um targeting certain geographical you know a population there's very less female superhero and also like from afghanistan or from a muslim country so then we are like okay what about we create our own superhero and then they create that the afghan hero girl during traditional outfit um and going through different stages and it was certainly an eye-opening experience for us too we couldn't believe that the game would have um such a good feedback i mean we have thousands of downloads hundreds of comments and they're all men who are giving us the comments that oh what if you you know put the error here or what if you add this function so like it's great to see that they're engaged and when the little girls were playing that game they're all like oh i want to be a superhero like herod and um i want to you know like i have that power and i think that's very very empowering and important in such a young age when they see a role model and a superhero that they can be that person so at a certain point code to inspire began adopting crypto how did you guys start using it and why so with the cryptocurrency that's interesting i get to know about it uh late 2013 i think early 2014 and that was again because of work that i was doing with afghanistan sending payments and it was certainly a big issue just you know with the bank system requiring a lot of paperwork and takes a lot of time and all the kyc and of course it's afghanistan so people are kind of like um giving you more hard time when you deal with afghanistan especially i guess with a financial issue um the western union also we tried but it was very costly with the fees that we were had to pay and those fees were a lot 10 to 15 would be you know covering a family for a couple of days to have food on their table and then paypal is not operating in afghanistan so that was also like not an option for us and a lot of the people who were sending money the girls were underage so they didn't have a bank account so these issues were very uh time consuming very you know dealing with a lot of paperwork and and it was frustrating at some point and that's how i learned about cryptocurrency and that time of course bitcoin and how fascinating is the technology that like very fast without any third party and so secure you can just like send directly money to the girls and they can have it and um since then i get to know more about the technology itself and then how we can help the girls and we started sending crypto to afghanistan um and then with code to inspire particularly we started teaching you know blockchain technologies smart contracts solidity decentralized apps to our students and actually as of this week five of our students are part of the consensus academy which we're very excited um so hopefully they will finish the course and it will be a great uh experience for them and then with the organization itself we do accept crypto as um [Music] as donations since 2015 and i can say probably we are one of the very early organization who accepted crypto's donation but also keep holding it um so that hopefully down the road we can use you know um it for more powerful and like uh help more population in afghanistan and then also sending um since january we totally we used to send on and off but since this january we only are sending crypto to afghanistan for our monthly operation and recently for the care package cash assistance that we are helping our students who are losing jobs and their family so it's amazing it's like um it's unbelievable how this technology can help in such a critical moment where the banks are closed the western union has limited services and nothing is working in afghanistan and we are probably again one of the very only organizations and people who are using it in such a large scale well so i have so many questions about this um but initially when you started describing how you first began using crypto was that um to make payments to the girls for gigs that they did or was it to um like fund your operations like accepting donations or like what what was that uh initial purpose for using the crypto at that time a combination of both but mainly for the girls who were using you know works for the remote work and we wanted to like send it quicker to them oh i see and so then once you receive that money and i'm sure this has changed over time but how are you turning that into afghanis which is the local currency yeah that's a great question it was so difficult at the beginning because um at the beginning we kind of had to like act as an exchange ourselves because no one knew about it so we would you know if you send the crypto to the girls and they wanted to cash out they would come to us and we give them cash but then um we found um you know there's a financial district in herat that they people do money exchange exchange afghanistan euro and vice versa and then since kind of like in november last year we were like okay it's too complicated and we're done with all this you know like third party and paperwork and everything is just like too much and let's see how we can work it out and then we start investigating and then we found some people in the financial districts of herat that they said yes we can exchange crypto for you and then we start in a smaller scale you know just building a trustworthy relationship with them and see how it works and it worked so great for us that now that one person is actually about three or four people so now there are more people who do that so what we do we send crypto from our wallet to our team wallet um in afghanistan and then they go to the exchange and they convert it to mainly us dollar and then we distribute the cash among the team pay for you know rent utility and also again recently for the cash assistance for our students oh so they're actually turning into u.s dollars and then i guess later on they when they need the money then they put it into afghanis or something is that yes yes then they can go to any money exchange there and convert their dollar to afghanistan and um for those individual sellers that you are trading with are they associated with any of those kind of um you know craigslist style sellers like local bitcoins or paxful or or are they just kind of like independent uh people that offer this service they're independent people that they offer the services oh interesting and and do you do you know i mean other than code to inspire how popular uh you know crypto is in afghanistan or what other people are using it for if any to be honest with you i think since last winter the the the crypto got more momentum in afghanistan and we did have a lot of people who reached out to me either from colleagues or either non-profits who reach out and they said oh like we see that like you do a lot of crypto can you give us a little bit of like how it works we're interested you know to explore that because again of the financial um difficulties we are facing and it connects some of them to this you know money exchange person that we know and trust um so i see and even recently a couple of weeks ago again because of the humanitarian crisis that's happening in afghanistan with everything and the the bank closed and the western union more non-profits reaching out to me humanitarian aides reach out to me and ask how we are handling it and i'm kind of like you know putting them in touch with the people that we know and hopefully you know that actually would be a way that like it opens the door for cryptocurrency to be adopted more huh this is just so interesting and so for the community around your school like the girls and their families and and you know people just who know generally about code to inspire what would you say that their perception is of cryptocurrency now because of all this so first of all it was very unknown to them they are like what is this i can't touch it it's like you say over internet you know it's so it's very difficult they were like is it a scam or you want to like scam us people had a lot of you know different thoughts about this and uh you know i i i hear them because like they used to like do all this old system of only keeping cash under their pillows and how they like you know kind of like save their money so when you go and tell them you know it's money over internet they kind of like and and especially when they don't have um and basic digital literacy then that would be more difficult to talk to them about this but then once we started you know sending to our own team as an example and how they used it you know for their own we could pay for our rent and then we start sending the cash assistance to our students and now the family is getting it now when people at the end of the day they see the cash they understand what's the workflow of it but also like how it is important the privacy aspect of it how you can control your money because in geographical um as uh locations like afghanistan that it's always been on conflict war and uh you know the political system change a lot and each of them come and they have their own agenda it's really difficult to trust in the centralized system the banks and the governments because you don't know what kind of regulations they bring and then for example even right now a lot of people have to who who left afghanistan got the evacuation majority of them left their bank account behind and they don't know if they can access that bank account anytime soon you know god knows how much money they have it but they had a decent amount of number you know and to be able to you know carry your finance with yourself outside of the conflict zone that's a very big lesson that a lot of people are learning and i think crypto will change that and help the people to to realize that it's important to be as much as independent especially if you're living in a conflict zone well yeah this is so interesting that you're saying all this because you know i feel like um there's for the longest time in the crypto industry there's been this idea like an idealistic notion that crypto will help the unbanked and at least here in the us it doesn't seem to have happened to a great extent so um you know i i'm glad to hear that people uh seem to be benefiting from that in afghanistan um but you know i just want to get a sense like do you still feel that it's not very widespread and it's just kind of like a small number of people in the know or do you feel like you know it's kind of like something that people are hearing about quickly yeah it's not really still widespread but i guess like within the international community and people who are sending aids to afghanistan that's something that there are in investigating and are open to explore because they all of a sudden faced a blockage of like sending aids to afghanistan and they also like don't want to send the money to the banks with this situation so they want to like they're exploring ways that first hand send the money to the people who are in need and that's the only way so that's great to see that now the international community and the aids are looking at crypto as a way to you know how fast and secure they can send funds instead of relying and sending money to the banks and to the government i can say all right so in a moment we're going to talk a little bit more about the effect of the withdrawal from afghanistan of u.s troops has had there but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible does your firm need rigorously vetted crypto market data

impact that the withdrawal of u.s troops from afghanistan has had there um but you know right now you know for for all that you described about code to inspire what is the situation now is the school functioning you know what has happened to the girls and their families etc well the situation on the ground it's certainly very devastating not only because a humanitarian crisis is happening right now banks are closed there's no job economy it's falling apart you know a lot of people are dealing with hunger and even they don't have money to like you know cover basic necessities and that's what we are also like dealing with our students and their families who about 80 of them reach out to me and they said they have even not having a bread at home and it's very difficult because majority of them lost jobs and especially women but despite the humanitarian crisis of course education which is a fundamental human right and everyone should access to education no matter of their gender identity or any indifferences it's getting a lot of backlashes in afghanistan since afghanistan fallen to the taliban um august 15 i can say that you know that was the first day that harad my city after two weeks of resistance captured by taliban and for me watching the videos of taliban walking to the city was very heartbreaking tragic i remember that day and for the next couple of days i cried a lot because we couldn't believe that just things are unfolding so quickly like that and all the work that they've done and everyone else have done this past 20 years and maybe you know taken from us and then unfortunately within one week so quickly the entire afghanistan as of now except panchi and got into all the influence of taliban and when people say taliban 2.0 they changed i don't think they changed because if they change but the situation right now wouldn't be devastating like that first of all of course we closed the school because we didn't want you know and we closed the school before even two weeks before when the attacks happened around the city because of the safety of our students and the school is still closed because we don't know what's going to happen if we open the school in person even though we are a single gender school and african athlete taliban shouldn't have issue with that regarding the education well the taliban allowed the girls to go to school only from first to sixth grade and then four days ago they announced the first day back to school and with their announcement they only said the boys can go to school from first to 12th grade so they let the boys from you know 7th grade to 12th grade and other private institutes religious school go to school but not women no girls from 7th to 12th grad are allowed to go to school still as of now um and also the universities they had conversation with the board of universities but they only had conversation with the male you know um board and the professors and not women and and they kind of like make an excuse that they say oh we're thinking about separation you know of the classes but the high school of the girls in afghanistan are already separated you know the schools are separated the building is separated so why they don't let the girls go to school well university yes there are mixed there used to be mixed classes but not the high school and that's like why you know you can't trust them because they're not clear you know and they are of course you know preventing girls go to school and um the same as the university and also work you know we had like students who used to work in offices that you know they used to work and now they're not going there because they're not allowed to go and they don't know if they can return to the offices and work so it is a shame that all these millions of girls who had hopes you know who had dreams and every day they go to school now they're home and they don't know what's gonna happen to them and um and their future is not clear yeah i saw you tweeted that girls there are texting you messages like i am afraid for my life i haven't eaten these past days and slept in different houses over nights for my safety and i wondered so this was from a few weeks ago and i wondered has that changed at all do they is is the comfort level a little bit higher now or is are the girls still living in a state of fear yes i mean definitely the girls are still living in a state of fear and trauma i still you know receive messages from girls that they're like uh you know i lost hope i wanted to do this and that but i don't think if there would be a possibility for me to have education outside of afghanistan will you help me so i receive a lot of emails and texts not only from our students but from people that i haven't met and they ask for help and and it's again so heartbreaking to see that a functioning government and i don't all deny that there was corruption in the previous government right and there were still like people who were um against women's education work and employment it wasn't the perfect government but at least it was functioning my school was open and i could help the girls to get education you know and a lot of girls around afghanistan could go to school but with this government it seems everything is closed only for women and they're just like totally ignoring half of the community and the society so the girls are going through a lot of trauma i mean like we weren't able even to continue any our classes virtual because they just like can't concentrate you know some of them left the city with their family they're in other cities some of them left the country and some of them you know their house got shot by the taliban or because of the explosion they you know the house got destructed so just i can't imagine when you're dealing with all that you still you know have the motivation to continue and like you know have hope for your future and so are you just kind of in an indefinite holding pattern with code to inspire or is there any um sign that would kind of make you feel comfortable opening it again or and and also um you know when you talked about how you can't do virtual classes i didn't know how widespread internet would be in homes so i didn't know like you know is is this something where they could kind of take these classes in their own homes or do the coding work in their own homes yes well i mean there's two possibilities here right i mean maybe i would be able to keep the school open under certain rules and circumstances and sure why not because that space was a safe space for the girls and they accessed a lot of resources and if that space can be open and of course they would be safe why not i'll keep the school open and that would be great but for whatever reason if we wouldn't be able to keep the school open of course virtual is what we're going to pursue and do that but within the next month or so we hopefully have a better understanding of what's the agenda and how we can move forward but absolutely i will continue my work ritual i make sure every girl has a laptop internet connections at home we put all the content we have online and we help them to you know continue their classes the same as before but virtual in a safe space at their home and then help them to find jobs you know uh remotely which right now we still have about like um three clients that about eight of our students are still working you know and do their projects online which keep them hopeful and i think that's one thing that we will continue no matter what yeah i did see that um back in 2018 code to inspire did start a partnership with bounties network to allow the girls to collect bounties in eth for fixing vulnerabilities in code is that something you're still doing and if not like are there other ways that the crypto community or that blockchain technology generally um can help in this situation yeah that was actually a very exciting project that we worked with and we had some of our students get engaged do some smart projects um and it was great you know but right now we we're not that much involved but it was certainly a great eye-opening experience for our students to work you know in such platforms and then get to know about crypto and as of now yes i mean we are trying to find people who want to help us with their skill and expertise and if they can help us to create a very strong you know private um secure online platform educational for our students and then people who have experience teaching coding and help us with different you know set of programming languages and to create videos so we can share with our students or want to be mentored you know and help our students with their codings and with the companies um definitely if they want to you know offer internship for us students part-time full-time projects and work i mean these are the opportunities that we would be able you know by giving a laptop and buying internet package for our students help them to get motivated and continue what they do from the safety of their house and there's also been a lot of talk and and work on things like decentralized identity solutions or decentralized mesh networks for offering internet is that something that would be helpful in this situation at all to be honest with you i don't know what would be the taliban you know agenda regarding the internet censorship you know i don't know if they you know gonna censor or are they gonna track people or you know what would be their their agenda on that because uh for example um before like their attack to the herat city they actually bombed a main internet tower and electricity tower and that actually was a huge damage the entire western region um the whole city in the western region were offline for a couple of weeks and you know of course with the work we do and if it should be virtual then that would be a big issue um so i think it's just like again you know depends on like how they interact with you know the the infrastructure if they're gonna bring any damage any censorship and you know you know tracking people and these are like the factors and variables that we really want to take into consideration and make it as private encrypted and you know safe for the girls even to have an online identity okay but so so far it sounds like um the financial part of crypto is what has been most useful for your school yes okay well so in that regard one question i had is i'm assuming and correct me if i'm wrong that perhaps the cryptocurrencies that most people donate are bitcoin and ether um and they're also the most liquid um but at the moment or really for kind of a while now they've both been experiencing somewhat high fees on the base layer chain um does that affect you at all like i noticed today the date we're recording that the fees the average transaction fee on bitcoin is about two dollars and fifty cents and for ether today it's like a little under four dollars but a few days ago as high as seven dollars so um i didn't know if that has affected you at all or if if it's not something that you know if it's something that the sellers don't really um count yeah they we really don't haven't faced issues with that and again with the person who exchanged the crypto for us even there they don't charge us like a crazy amount we want to make them happy and keep them happy to do business with us so we pay a very small fee to them quiet so far no we haven't been much influenced by that and again the fact that we are using this technology and in this situation it's just like the best tool that's just enabled us and help us so we are very happy with the way that we are managing our finance and sending money to afghanistan so from your perspective as somebody who does use crypto a lot in a very crucial way are there any kind of like requests you would make to um developers in the industry for tools or for um you know certain types of technology that you feel would be useful or just anything you feel that entrepreneurs in the space could think about yes i still think that as you said when we talk about crypto when we say the notion of it was to help the unbanked and underserved communities i think still probably a lot of the solutions that comes out it's again it's former privileged people who do have access to bank who do have credit cards or some sort of you know financial freedom and living in a more relaxed community so any solutions especially for people who live in a constant conflict and you know war and displacement um either to keep their identity private to keep their you know documents private and they can't carry with themselves you know any part of the world i think that's something that's very important how you can keep your documents somewhere you know very private that you can access but also like you can use it you know because down the road when you're a refugee you leave everything behind and even carrying certain documents would be very dangerous for you because then they can identify who you are and that would be a big issue so that's something that i think a lot if there are solutions around would be helpful and also in case of finance again and solutions of like if exchanges or any apps or any solution that can help people not only rely on the local exchange but you know like create you know a more faster and easier way for them to access the crypto market but also would be able to cash it out i mean right now if you want to create accounts on different exchanges the kyc which is understandable but it would be very difficult for a lot of people in afghanistan just because a lot of them don't have proper documents and identification and that's one step that won't let them to even create an account let alone to use that exchange and everything yeah well that's what i was talking about when i was mentioning blockchain-based identities but um have you like i i don't know of any that are um kind of in widespread use is that is that something that you've looked into at all no to be honest with you i don't have any knowledge around it yeah i i um i don't feel like i've heard kind of a lot of you know concrete work in that area but that is something that i think could address these issues that you're discussing as uh you know we've been discussing throughout this interview there's clearly a lot of sexism and discrimination that you have faced in afghanistan as a woman um but this is an issue in a lot of parts in the world and here um in the us and just in general you know you could say in the western world like europe and in the us you know there aren't as many women in crypto or involved in blockchain technology as there are men and i just wondered from your experience as a woman in tech in afghanistan do you have any advice um for bringing more women into crypto or advice to women in the field who feel that they're facing sexism and discrimination yes it's an interesting question because i can say i got a thicket skin now and i really like don't get bothered you know i guess just like because i went through a lot but um and i'm generally speaking i'm a risk taker person so i kind of like you know i was just like go for it and i not really like get bothered by all these issues but what i think from being indifferent you know just a refugee hiding my true identity in in iran as a refugee and then a woman in technology in afghanistan being very outspoken um social which cost me a lot i think being indifferent even as like a gay woman in a group that they're all men it's beautiful because you bring a different perspective to everyone else's perspective who is similar so you have actually way stronger voice rather than the rest of the group you think you are outnumbered but actually your voice is stronger because your opinion and the value you bring to the table is much more different and might be you know things that they've never imagined so i think if even if you walk in in a room uh it doesn't matter if it's like a tech meeting in crypto space you know any space that you walk in and you are one of the very few women or the only woman you should be so proud that you are in that group because those people actually given an opportunity to see a different perspective so for me i think you have to just go for it and those single number of women in those meetings are actually opening the doors for other women to walk in so it is an opportunity for us to take it and change the environment and of course it's not an easy path i'm sure a lot of women face a lot of you know sexism verbal sexual harassments and any other backlashes but i think it's that that i can be the one who can open the door for the rest then sure i'll take it and i'll like lead that path earlier in the episode you said that you had a lot of inspiring stories like that one that you told about the girl and i wondered if he wanted to share one more yes we had one other students that she was working with you know with a client here and working on the graphic design and she was also coming from a challenging financial background but she was brilliant student very great graphic designer and they really liked her work and they picked her for doing the work for for them and she worked um so good that the client were like oh my god you're so you know happy with her and they used to pay her like ten dollar per hour and then they said now you're gonna pay here thirty dollar per hour and with that money she used to use the laptop that we were giving her to do the work because she didn't have a laptop she not only makes a lot of good money that she bought a laptop for herself but also like you know paid for the education for the brothers and also help the families and that was like and when she texted to me and she said i couldn't believe that when i walk into this school i could make this money and i can buy a laptop for myself and now do the work and help my family it's just like unreal and like that was the whole world to me to see that like her life changed like that that's so great i love it so for listeners who are interested in helping code to inspire uh where what can they do where can they go we are a non-profit registered u.s 501c3 so we are a tax-deductible organization both for um you know um fiat uh currency and cryptocurrency so if they're interested to support us a sponsor students especially with the cash assistance that we are dealing with now or purchasing equipment they can check our website code tunaspire.org and they can donate to our cause beside that we are looking for people who are interested in what we do right now and care about the future of afghan girls and their education we would like to have their expertise as i said in case of building a virtual system if they've been teaching coding use their you know materials and curriculum if they are looking to hire our graduates and students we are happy to have a conversation so any possibilities any opportunities that they think would certainly change lives and would be really appreciated so we're very open to have conversations with them great and where can people learn more about you such as like a twitter handle or something yes um my twitter account f underscore for rule that's my twitter handle perfect well thank you so much for coming on unchained absolutely thanks for having me and appreciate that you gave your platform in such a difficult time for afghanistan to shed some light and just raise more awareness about what's the current situation and the future for women of afghanistan yeah and i really wish you and all your students the best of luck navigating this time and i really hope everything works out the best for all of you thank you so much thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about ferestra and code to inspire check out the show notes for this episode unchained is produced by me laura shin with help from anthony yoon daniel ness and mark mordock thanks for listening you
