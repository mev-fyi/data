decentralized business the title of our discussion was innovate or reinvent and the panelists were amber Baldy a cofounder and CEO of clover matt wrote zack co-founder and chairman of block and lily lu co-founder of earth we had a wide-ranging discussion which included topics such as how the crypto 50 combined have more budget from blockchain development services than fortune 50 companies how government is also a competitor in the space and what factors will determine which ventures succeed it was a great discussion that got a good reaction from the audience enjoy the show smart contracts

really fantastic panelists here who are sort of working at different points along that spectrum of innovating or reinventing so why don't we just start with having each of you describe like one day did you do amber tea when I begin sure thank you hi my name is amber ball day I'm co-founder and CEO of clover at this point previously ran JP Morgan's blockchain program and as over the course of that entire journey realized just a large gap between what people think block to an applications should be doing what people are expecting out of crypto sorts of applications and what you can really do so it is kind of the decision do we reinvent or do something in a Greenfield kind of way that we're working on a clover building tools to be able to actually build those next generation applications Lilly sure my name is Lilly view my co-founder CFO of Vern comb which we recently sold to coinbase and so the last few years we've company was previously called something 21 was pretty early in the space Bitcoin mining doing a lot of work on the hardware side and so as the space kind of evolved we also evolved with it and eventually sort of turned into this platform earn comm that was quite successful is quite successful in helping get cryptocurrency into the hands of many people just through something you do every day which is responding messages and doing other sort of tasks on the Internet good morning my name is Matthew Rosic co-founder and chairman of block we're a blockchain technology company we do two things we engage with enterprises with our suite of software and then we also through block labs we build new decentralized networks and applications so we're builders and plumbers in this space all right so let's talk a little bit about this spectrum innovate to reinvent and a pre panel phone call that Rosic also throughout disrupt so why don't we talk about like where it is that you guys feel like your services fall on Matt spectrum and what those words mean to you well I think depending on the market right whether in the enterprise space broadly defined for us we engage with some of the biggest companies in the world so let's just say fortune 50 and then we also engage with this new enterprise customer that's emerged in this space called the crypto 50 so you know some of the biggest miners and gaming processors and wallets and and other players and what's interesting with this crypto 50 customer that's that's surfaced on this landscape is they individually have more budget than probably all my enterprise customers combined for this space and they they make more decisive kind of decisions in terms of how they want to engage in in these networks and these tokenized economies and it's interesting to watch both of them I think over time they wind up connecting in a particular way you see the flight path of traditional enterprise one day to connect with these with these networks and these networks when and connect with enterprise so we're starting to see that fabric and that scaffolding kind of get developed in a real time but but traditional enterprise regulated public companies are still mind you in the tokenized economies are still having issues on how to take a bite of that Apple you know the regulatory frameworks aren't as great lack of clarity there that's improving slowly but surely but it's that's where I think the enterprise innovation kind of gets stymied a bit but as regulatory clarity develops I think that that accelerates so I think that you know thus far in cryptocurrency we had a fantastic year in 2017 brought a lot of new energy and a lot of new people into the space but I think that you know like you know non crypto technology it's important that you really gain adoption for whatever it is you're building it's got to be 10x better right the speculative use case has obviously worked that way because people are making 10 returns but they'd be making in more traditional markets and I think that as people think about new use cases you know whether it's been you know remittance that people have been talking about for a while or sort of new consumer use cases that are coming into the market now you really got to think about what is the value proposition to the end-user right in the enterprise situation how does it actually make their lives 10x better or substantially better and also in the consumer world is a 10x easier to use right is it faster to to to sort of to take on an activity that maybe you couldn't do the regular tech a technology world so I think that's something that you have to keep in mind and as we're building out these new experiences yeah I think that what people struggle with is that in order to drive adoption or usage of something new it needs to be not only as good as the thing that you're using but hopefully you know ten times better and so if you're doing something that's truly greenfield and therefore there is no other alternative it can be hard to use and that's okay people will figure out how to struggle through a bad user experience for some period of time until that becomes a competitive disadvantage for your products but when you're trying to transform something that's an existing market the bar is very high and I think they're completely right about the enterprise budget kind of a thing it's not coming out of this being a full business model like you live or die based on this project working it's like well let's pull this out of our innovation budget and see if it works and so that's you know I think it results in a lot of a slower progression then people expect for moving things into production you know so let's talk about that because I think something that's so interesting is like basically when we say innovate or reinvent what we're talking about is like the incumbents versus these disruptors which are you know more like the crypto 50 right this new area of crypto finance that we see being developed and I'm just so curious because it sounds like in a certain way the incumbents are they have like more restrictions on them or something so can you talk a little bit about like what the differences that you're seeing and how you think that's going to play out because like Franklin when I look at this race between like enterprise versus public watch chains I just feel like the public watch teams are gonna they're gonna win and frame it like obviously scaling is like such a--such when there's a lot of technical problems but like when something hits there it takes off so fast and I just don't know if I'm seeing that on that enterprise I I mean I I still think that the breakdown of saying enterprise means permission means centralized means why didn't you just me to use a database versus public is somehow proletariat and decentralized and magically therefore good is just a false dichotomy and that we should be looking at this is more like just technical boundaries around information sets and incentivized actors and connecting them in more logical ways in that way you can be using public blockchains more as a coordination layer between other kind of networks you see people experimenting with side chains and stuff so I think that's going to work itself out but from the enterprise side they they will continue it's not that businesses don't understand the technology and it's not even that they can't innovate and come up with new products but I think you're right they need to sit on the sidelines more because they have an existing business to lose if they make a regulatory misstep so they're not going to ask for forgiveness they need to wait and get permission yeah I agree with that I think there's two things going on one is public related businesses don't just jump to innovation they've got this you know historical staircase that they go on and they try and reduce costs they try and grow and then they try and innovate and we saw this with the early internet with Internet's and extra nets we saw this with cloud with hybrid clouds the same thing is happening with watchings where they're doing some permission ledger work and that exercise that toe in the water gets some you know these big organizations get some a little bit more educated on what this technology is what it isn't how to apply it and that's that's really important kind of stair casing for them part one part two what's interesting and it's not initially good or bad or that this this dichotomy is happening but over time permissionless networks will always win and and when I say win that means they will get the hearts and minds of developers so the best developers will want to innovate and build on open permissionless networks so that with the internet we saw now with Bitcoin and crypto and so but that doesn't mean it's it's one or the other I think it's it's you know the regulatory dynamics the adoption curves the form factors for a lot of things we're doing in this space isn't you know Enterprise ready today and so but that that's that changes every day so I think that there might be a third party in this town Khanna me of that we should pay attention to and that's actually the sovereign states I think that you know we oftentimes talk about public chains versus private chains and it's kind of enterprise versus sort of the community and public chains and I think the presumption in there is that if it's a public permission that's blockchain that it's going to be community owned it's going to be open source and sort of going to be peer-to-peer and all those things that we've seen happen with a coin but I think you started to see Inklings of nishan States actually becoming quite interested in this and so we saw maybe an early example with the petrol which may or may not be a sort of long term long term point out there but there are countries out there that are very interested in perhaps putting together you know basically digitizing the national currency right on and be able being able to at once have reserve currency around the world and also have capital controls at home for example and and that to me I think is very relevant because if you think about the nation states and countries out there they have distribution right they have hundreds of millions if not over a billion people that they can basically you know almost instantly turn on identity on a blockchain for example and they have all the infrastructure and all of the all the resources to really do that and I think that's something that we should pay attention to and as we think about you know permissionless lock chains and we think about growing communities you know I think it's great that we've probably increased the number of people in who maybe hold a few more bitcoins somewhere I'm guessing around the mid or the high eight figures but if you think about that in either sort of overall Internet adoption terms we've still got a long way to go and if you're thinking about that in comparison to the ability to scale let's say in a social network or a you know just to a nation-state I think we've also got a long way to go yeah where we continually were like bogged down in this come security cache regulatory kind of thing that's treating these crypto products as just a private sector issue in the United States and it's I think they're completely right that that's really the wrong way to look at it if we're thinking of public blockchains more as a public shared commodity and good we should be thinking of it more like the Internet and we really take for granted how much America has benefited from so much of the underlying Internet infrastructure being developed here in the West and it's absolutely a method of soft power projection and that's why we see a lot of technical investment from countries that would like to kind of push back on that dominance if you're an institution managing crypto assets you need a secure custody solution digital asset custody company or DAC is the leading purpose-built institutional quality cryptocurrency custodian DAC leads the industry in security and service experts in the tech cyber security and investment worlds Dax founders built the system that today's major players in asset management rely on DAC is in production on over 90 tokens secure efficient egress transactions that's DAC custody with DAC visit digital asset custody for more info imagine this you dedicate countless hours of hard work to creating a smart contract only to be hacked in mere minutes if you think that can't happen think again we hear that 10 billion dollars has been raised through smart contracts but over 300 million of that has already been compromised hackers are hungry for more so security is not just critical to your success it's an absolute necessity and that is where quant stamp these standard for smart contract security comes in with a team of security audit experts dedicating to the feeding the bad guys the quant stamp of approval is your solution for safer smart contracts find out how we can be the gold standard for security at quant stamp calm Sun exchange is a solar power marketplace

crypto solar revolution start earning solar powered money today yeah I actually want to tie together a few different things that either said because I think there was just so much and everyone didn't ask about but so first I wanted to ask like if you guys feel like the regulations that especially the incumbents have to abide by of thoughts kind of like a hindrance on them when it comes to this competition but then in the same regard if that could like lead to what Lilly was talking about with how in a way like you know public box chains crypto assets they could down the line pose a threat to governments to central banks that are trying to issue a fiat money and so in that regard do you think that there's I mean printed this sort of imposes this kind of like I know it makes it seem like the government is just like one entity that is you know trying to impose its will but I just wonder if like that could play out in some regard if like governments might try to use regulation to keep the upper hand when it comes to the crypto space yes yeah I mean yeah the government the government isn't just one thing right we and we see different sentiments come out of different parts especially these different kind of committee hearings there's different they take different tones and where one sounds more bullish and other sounds more bearish on it and you know I think they're they're trying to figure out what the the right size approach looks like but they're very very concerned with law enforcement and preventing bad activity and until there's some sort of answer for that it's going to look like choke holds on the entry points and egress points in and out of the open marketplace and I also I agree I think that's where they're gonna focus their time and energy but the this industry is moving way faster than they could keep up with and it's constantly changing and it doesn't fit any rubric or any any laws or fabrics that they're that they're familiar with and and like even in the u.s. less than 3% of the members of Congress have any technical background so the whole dynamic is is not in our favor to get you know kind of these these these great red carpet regulations to to to build in this space but we're gonna see is pockets develop and this regulatory arbitrage thing kind of really play out there's a crypto congressman here at the conference Jason from Taipei who's building out this really robust regulatory framework to bring in jobs innovation and money we're gonna see that play out all over the world see that in Gibraltar in Malton Barbados and even Singapore in Switzerland and I think regulators here are gonna look at that and and once kind of this this market trickles into a trillion punches through a trillion or a couple of trillion I think that's when they'll take it a little bit more seriously in terms of out of kind of react and build that innovation keep those jobs in here but until that kind of happens I still think most regulators don't don't really understand this to the point that they want to promote a particular regulatory piece here in the US so it's still still very early in this that we're good yeah well actually amber I wanted to ask you about that because you testified in front of the committee was it two days ago or I guess so yeah yeah I've lost the track of time at this point right so we were just laughing backstage because it turns out that it is the agricultural company that actually regulates this kind of thing because crypto assets are commodity I know it seems like super counterintuitive but like Farms pork bellies CFTC crypto exactly so I was just curious like what your impression was from that day because like you know what he was talking about with Taiwan like I think it's really interesting obviously we're seeing a lot of like opening of arms from Switzerland Malta Gibraltar Singapore so weird would you you know what was your impression from that day and then if any of you want to jump in as from where the us kind of like falls in terms of this regulatory arbitrage we're seeing some people are more open-minded than others which is natural there are a few people that seem like they've kind of already made up their minds and are just very concerned about the protectionism kind of money laundering terrorist financing stuff and won't really consider anything else until that's worked out but otherwise it feels like people are trying to really understand that said I think most of the work of legislation has done more at the staffer level than at the actual congressional level and there's a real or representative level there there's a real understanding and kind of momentum there among staffers that they they want to get it right and how to move this stuff forward so even though it kind of feels like ping-pong back and forth of is it good is it bad on a given day it's just the fact that there were like literally there were two committee meetings on the same day like there's so many so so much attention being given to this now that it's it seems like it is moving forward more quickly than previously you know when we think about you know building investing and hiring we want to spend all our time doing that but I think if you care deeply about the space you do need to engage with regulators you need to need to educate them I also serve as chairman of the chamber digital Commerce letters trade association in this space and we're putting out a white paper and the next week or two on responsible token issuances and actually a guide for both practitioners in the space and policymakers to actually have a framework and start setting some best practices and and guidelines not necessarily a self-regulatory organization but to up our game in this space you know to be more responsible and disclosures lock ups and kind of more traditional things like that and for all of the regulatory arbitrage that is happening I think that's a good tension between having some of these smaller jurisdictions see this is really an opportunity to to be a part of this rapidly growing economy but at the same time we do have to recognize that United States we have some of the deepest talent some of the detail some of the deepest sort of pocketed investors and we are a very critical part of the ecosystem right and so what I see is being very encouraging is that there is a lot of sort of innovation in and you know thought about engaging with different jurisdictions and that actually does create kind of the the energy to also move some of the larger markets so since we sort of gotten to you know what you were saying about how you're gonna be releasing this best practices document I imagine there are probably some entrepreneurs here in this face you were trying to figure out like I'm really interested in this how do I start working where should I start working so you guys are all you know in various adventures in this space how should people think about it like what questions should they ask you know depending on the answers which way should that guide them like you know what what are some factors to think about when an entrepreneur wants to enter the space or or like or maybe even pivot an existing project or company well for an entrepreneur attempting to enter the space I mean I don't think the questions are probably any different than for other sectors that you want to talk about founder market fit you know do you know the market that you're trying to go into do you have the relationships to drive clients into your product or how do you plan on growing that sort of adoption of what you're building I mean it's really no different than than anything else if we're if you're trying to build enterprise businesses it's important to have enterprise relationships and you know I think the the 2015-2016 range of the hundreds of we're gonna go build a blockchain for business kind of people that went out there that now you don't hear very much from demonstrated that you can't just walk in with technical knowledge and assume that you're going to solve someone's business problem you never really understand the industry well the number of those companies are pivoting to pure crypto no I don't know noticed there were a bunch of those this year yeah but but like more to the point you know like if say let's say you do want to work in this business but you're sort of trying to figure out Oh like you know should I use this technology to just innovate like to upgrade existing services or should I create something brand new like how I should not win or kind of think about things the way that we're thinking about this at Clover is that right now businesses are trying to figure out what's a blockchain use-case and you can't get people away from that right now that's the question that they want to ask is a blockchain good for this but if you suss out the underlying pieces of what makes something blockchain e whether that's you know a distributed systems kind of is it is it a shared consensus mechanism is it a cryptographic audit log is it there's a lot of different pieces that can be useful to solve little problems that really driving developer adoption is just about getting somebody to pick up your tool to solve a problem that they have and that organically turns into things that can be connected to each other in a more multiplayer way where you don't have to do a 20 million dollar lift tree platform it's kind of a tail wagging the dog right now and I think that that'll change as a lot of these initial POCs don't go very far well actually something else I want to ask about is we're seeing all these new teams starting up starting and decentralized projects how does that differ from doing a traditional startup what I think is different about it is you know if you think about you know some of the some of the instances of value creation where recently in the non crypto tech world so uber probably employs thousands of people creative about let's call about 50 billion a value over the course of seven or eight years right on the other hand in the crypto world aetherium went basically zero to fifty billion in about three years and employees you know maybe fifteen people something like that if you're just talking about the theorem foundation so what it means is that you rely much more on the community to create value which means that your community is comprised of people who maybe just passively hold the token to people who work full-time as a developer building applications on etherion right and so you have to find a way to engage with and motivate and you know bring in people who are all the way for everywhere along that spectrum and I think that's a very different type of community engagement that it's relevant in crypto which which differs from just building a normal tech company right is ostensibly this is your sort of distributed work force but they don't report to you and some of them might only spend a minute a month checking their balance with aetherium and some people might spend you know 80 hours a week working so how do you engage with such a disparate community of engagement of skill set of interest yeah I think this is a really important point in building these decentralized networks this community dynamic is a thing we saw that where we're we're aetherium really developed this community of developers and and there's no shortage of etherium killers out there now EOS tezo's quantum you name it and the question I have is is how those developers are going to be either inspired or incentivized to move like you know a flock of birds or bees from one protocol to another you know whether they're tribal and it's like hey I learned aetherium and you know I work there I'm colors or am I gonna skip over to a new rail and they'll be interesting to see how that plays out over the next several years whatever people are gonna be entrenched and saying hey this is my rail and I'm really particular because I'm and I'm tribal you know I like the whatever Golden State Warriors and I hate the Bulls or vice versa or whatever well you're supposed to carve out some VC fund out of your four billion dollars and then subsidize developers to come and try out their projects right I'm sure that's gonna stand yeah I mean there's just I mean no I mean in reality we're seeing lots of networks build a side pocket of a billion dollars to venture invest into everybody's project and see see what happens through sunlight and water on the things that are starting to sprout and that's that's just a more aggressive community you know developing development fund air drops are ridiculous I think I'd love to see smarter air drops to build these communities with you know like air drops with with conditions but I think all these are hacks to try and build these communities it'll be an Excel that plays out we'll see how tribal or mercenary people are yeah yeah well I think that's a good note for us to end on it sounds like you get into this you'll have to do some community organizing I love Barack Obama but anyway thank you all so much for coming on the show and thanks for all for up to all of you for attending [Music]
