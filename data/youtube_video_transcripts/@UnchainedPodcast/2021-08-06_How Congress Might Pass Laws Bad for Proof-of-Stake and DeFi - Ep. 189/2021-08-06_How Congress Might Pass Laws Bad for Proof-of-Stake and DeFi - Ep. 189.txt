download the crypto.com app with code laura the link is in the description today's guest is kristin smith executive director at the blockchain association welcome kristin it's great to be back laura the crypto industry has been up in arms about a provision in the one trillion dollar infrastructure bill that would have the effect of raising a 28 billion dollars from the industry in taxes before we get into the latest news on the competing amendments and the nitty gritty of what happened last night let's just first set the stage for people who haven't been following the play-by-play why was the crypto industry concerned about the crypto portion of this bill from the beginning yeah well i'm gonna even back up a little bit further um before i get into this specific bill just to provide some background for about two years now the irs has been working with the industry and other stakeholders to try to figure out how to do an information reporting requirement for the um for the traditional crypto exchanges and this is something that the irs would like because at the end of the year customers of these crypto exchanges don't get a 1099 in the mail like they would from charles schwab or somebody else and they want to have information to help people pay their taxes the irs wants that information and the customers want that information and the centralized crypto exchanges want to provide that information the problem has been that there hasn't been regulations for how to do that but that is a process of discussions that have been ongoing and we believe the irs is very close to doing this so when the white house and the senate and the house started looking at an infrastructure package they were trying to find ways to pay for it that didn't involve raising taxes and so what they did is they included a small provision in this legislation that would essentially do what the irs is already doing and make it clear that the irs had to create an information reporting requirement for exchanges but the problem is when the language emerged i guess about two or a week and a half ago now uh maybe closer to two weeks the the provision expanded the definition of the broker to go far beyond covering information reporting for centralized exchanges and captured all sorts of other participants in the crypto ecosystem like stakers and miners and software developers and others and tried to also impose those reporting requirements on those entities and so in the beginning when i first saw this i said oh well that's that's a mistake let's get them some language changes they don't they don't know what they've done because this is complicated um but it but it became pretty clear a lot on tuesday last week that our efforts to provide some technical assistance to them uh weren't going to work and that we needed to uh fire up the base and sound the alarm and it's been um a pretty pretty intense battle for i guess the past eight or nine days now to try to fix it and so why do you think that there was resistance to what you initially viewed as just offering technical assistance does that now seem that there are particular reasons why they want the language to capture those entities well this is being driven we believe largely by the treasury department and the white house and whether or not it is uh you know if we wanted to be generous we can say there is a knowledge gap there and they don't understand what they're asking for if you want to be more suspicious it's that this is a you know hard attack on crypto and an attempt to bring it down i think it's probably somewhere in between i think i think what treasury is trying to do is capture activity going on in the defy world but they don't fully understand the d5 world um but but the bigger problem has been you know legislation is not written by the white house treasury it is written by uh congress right and the the uh senators portman and cinema have been the lead on this bill and they very early on um sort of before sharing the language struck a deal with the white house that hey we we will push this bipartisan bill forward and here are the provisions and so instead of negotiating with the house which would be sort of the customary path the senate is negotiating with the white house on this and so when this bipartisan group struck a deal there has been resistance to making changes to it and so from the very beginning of this uh when this started you know about 10 days ago there's been a tremendous amount of resistance to making changes um not based off of the substance um but based off of the process and um so that that's where we stand um well we stand a little further than that today but but yeah that's part of the thinking as to why they don't want to move they've cut a deal and they don't want to break their deal okay so let's maybe then go into the details of what's happened over the last few days and let's start with that amendment by senators ron wyden cynthia lemus and pat toomey what did that amendment say and why was this an important suggested change yeah so the the wyden lummus toomey amendment is um even in itself actually i will say not perfect but goes a long way towards solving some of the underlying certainty in in the in the portman cinema bill that that was uh the broader 2700 page infrastructure package um the the wyden amendment um and by the way the fact that ron wyden has emerged as a champion on this issue is remarkable um he this is the most active and vocal he has ever been on these issues and it is wonderful because he is the chairman of the senate finance committee which is the tax writing committee and so when he weighs in on something that's incredibly powerful he he's also been a long-standing champion for the internet and so we should the industry should applaud his emergence on the scene along with senator lemus who's been a longtime champion and toomey who is really really stepped it up this year um you know those three are the heroes here and crypto industry needs to celebrate them because they are going to bat for the crypto ecosystem uh but what their amendment does is it provides some clarity that stakers and miners um that software developers that uh wallet manufacturers um or or you know developers of software wallets that those entities aren't captured in the definition of a broker um and the way it's written is that there's room to argue that there are other types of of participants in the ecosystem that we could argue down the road are also not intended to be included um and and this this language itself was negotiated over multiple days this was conversations that happened between limits and toomey and wyden and a core group of industry people who we've been working together with to try to influence this process and so this this was you know even even though the original language that is in the portman cinema bill that came out of really nowhere with the expanded broker definition there was a tremendous focus in figuring out how can we fix this um because it was very clear early on that they would not accept simply striking the language that they would not accept just striking the definition of broker but that we needed to find some alternative definition of broker and so so this this is language that all of the stakeholders have signed off on and um we were starting to gain traction on this amendment i think that you know the crypto community really rallied um there is an organization called fight for the future who put together a grassroots website that helped people to call their senators and you know as of last night we had hit about 10 000 calls into senate offices over the past maybe a period of about 18 hours which is uh remarkable absolutely remarkable um we have a an extended team of professional lobbyists who are working senate offices on this bill some of those are blockchain association lobbyists some of those are coin center lobbyists some of those are coinbase lobbyists um you know dcg has lobbyists stellar development foundation has lobbyists um it's really been a kind of an all hands on deck like ground game on the lobbying front um we've also been doing digital advertising we're doing linkedin ads targeted at senate and house offices uh we did a buyout of the washington post homepage yesterday to try to influence the vote in favor of the amendment so what was remarkable is that this amendment came in and and the industry was able to within a matter of hours start pouring out support for this amendment and into these offices and um you know jesse powell from kraken emailed all of his us users to support this and it was this remarkable turnaround and and we were winning um we were getting close to winning i should say because we needed to get to 60 votes because that was the threshold procedurally for what we needed for for this amendment at the time um and then yesterday as we were you know starting to to approach and realize huh we're actually starting to pick off members and get people and support you know we have a whip count and everybody's you know adding all their intel there so we know where everybody's at um and then i think what happened is portman and the white house and treasury started to get scared because they realized that the crypto industry was actually a sleeping giant and they had awakened it and so they worked with senator mark warner from virginia uh and portman himself was the lead on the broader infrastructure bill and and they put together language that i believe is actually worse than the underlying bill language because what it does is it picks proof of work as being the only sort of protected consensus mechanism and leaves out proof of stake or proof of space time or any other type of model that's developed there so it's incredibly short-sighted it was not vetted with anyone in the industry this all came together very quickly uh yesterday and yesterday afternoon you know late last night um the the administration endorsed the warner amendment which is you know sort of another battle there and throughout the day yesterday there were very senior people within the administration and even the independent agencies that were picking up the phone and calling democratic senators urging them to oppose the wyden amendment and support the warner amendment so the amount we are getting pushback from the highest levels of government which in some ways it is a complement to how effective we have been over the past you know 72 hours or even into the past week but it's incredibly scary because this is this is the highest levels and this is the industry is not doesn't have the full capability yet that you know other more established industries have and so we are trying to be as efficient as possible as effective as possible and working together as closely as possible not just within the industry but with our you know allies like coin center um to make sure that you know we are getting putting all of our efforts and resources into the same strategy in the same course so it's it's definitely we're not out of the woods yet obviously and um you know the vote on both of these amendments will be on saturday and so it is uh turning out to be um you know i mean they could make a movie out of this stuff right like this is a lot of drama all right so in a moment we'll discuss why it is that the white house is pushing its way behind the new proposed amendment but first a quick word for the sponsors who make this show

it seems that this new version the warner portman version of the amendment would put a thumb on the scales for proof-of-work systems over proof-of-stake systems and um i you know upon learning this felt this seemed logically inconsistent because the democrats have tended to be more on the side of those who express concern about the environmental impact of proof-of-work coins so do you think it's that the white house doesn't understand the implications of this amendment that they support or do you think that it is that they do want to favor proof-of-work over proof-of-stake um i think that this is largely um a lack of understanding about how crypto networks work largely i mean i i think if they understood that argument and um you know they would maybe think twice about this but the the people at the white house and at the treasury department that are behind this aren't the ones that are you know the leaders on climate issues these are our people that care very much about financial surveillance quite frankly right they want to have insight into transactions they want to know where individuals money is moving and i also think that there are a small group of people over there that are worried about the emergence of d5 they're worried about the emergence of stable coins and that you know there there are probably some there that see this as an opportunity to to really you know go after crypto in a way i i don't think that's universal over there i think some are just trying to solve the tax compliance problem and they think dexes should be left out um jerry rito with with coin center is from my always reminds me that decentralized exchange is a verb not a noun um and that you know you can't go after uh you know sort of these dexes and if they're truly decentralized um yeah this is like the then they fight you stage right like it's um i mean crypto has had such a miraculous you know past six to twelve months that it has arrived um in the economy in a way that i don't think anybody saw coming and i think they're scared and they think they don't know how to regulate it and that this is an opportunity to you know prevent it from getting out of hand too quickly and so just to draw out uh kind of what the implications would be for d5 essentially this new version of the amendment that portman warner version because it does not have that carve out for proof of stake coins um and i guess for the developers who write protocols that that's why that's seen as especially bad for d5 because those developers um or the people who validate in those systems would have to report on who their users are is that what that would mean and and quite frankly it's impossible for them to do that kind of reporting right so if those types of regulations were imposed they would either have to operate out of compliance leave the united states or just simply shut down and so those are those are not three great options um you know what's wonderful about the wyden lummus to me amendment is that you know it's inclusive it encourages the innovation to stay here in the united states it encourages you know software developers to have the freedom to do um what they what they should be able to do under the first amendment right right they should be able to write code um and it's um it's uh i think very forward-looking on wyden and and lummus and to me to step in and do this but warner um you know we've we've got some people in the industry that have a good relationship with senator warner um on a staff level they're they're not the easiest people to get in touch with they they don't want to get engaged they don't want to be helpful um we have had a lot of outreach to them in the past and for them to come in and do this last minute without consulting anyone is you know really um it's just shocking and it's not how policy is supposed to be made um but again the the reason they're going to warner is he is sort of known as being technologically savvy uh he is close with the administration and the the white house wants somebody to come in and save them and he was their choice so okay so it seems like you you do maybe give some credence to that hypothesis that the drive for all this comes from treasury um i did see other people on twitter hypothesizing that this was going to end up as an attack on the industry altogether that first the administration would try to regulate proof of stake and then later attack proof of work through esg or environmental social and governance regulations what do you think of that theory you know it's interesting i saw that as well i mean it's not a bad one-two punch right i mean if you could take out proof of stake that's where a lot of the innovation is going on today and then you know we've already seen the proof-of-work arguments play out you know even with senator elizabeth warren and the senate banking committee um and and that is a narrative that has emerged this year um in a way that we've never seen before so you know whether or not i i am suspect that there is somebody in the white house that has such a master vision that they are plotting all of the pieces of crypto and figuring out how to go after them but i do think there is an underlying sense that this crypto stuff is getting out of control and we need to find every opportunity we can to try to rein it back in and so i think it was more opportunistic for them to to try to expand this definition of broker because you have to remember in the original language that they circulated it's specifically included in the definition of broker decentralized exchanges which again was totally undefined and peer-to-peer um and so so that's where their thinking was eventually and we've been able to pull that back a little bit but but it's still not super clear that that you know minor stakers software developers um are excluded and so that's why that's why the the the wyden amendment is so important and um um so yeah so here we are it's gonna be a big showdown on saturday so you said that there's going to be a vote tomorrow on saturday um what happens today um at this point do you have a sense of which amendment is more likely to you know garner the necessary number of votes and also what would you suggest people who are listening to this show and care about this bill do before tomorrow yeah so the goal today is we need to let the community know and we need to let the senate know that we need to support the wyden amendment and oppose the warner amendment um what the white house is going to try to do in treasury and they are going to try to say oh the warner amendment is the compromise between the original language and the wyden amendment it is not a compromise it is bad we need to make sure votes are no so as i mentioned before we have a team of extended lobbyists that all we got them all talking points last night they're they're being deployed to those offices today um we are actively updating our whip count trying to figure out where people are on each of these amendments um the um what we need the community to do is is sort of twofold um so the community has the crypto industry has two superpowers we have the ability to communicate really quickly with each other which is great because that was one of the reasons that we were able to activate all of these grassroots we also have really large user bases i mentioned before that jesse powell with kraken emailed his users if you are operating a platform with millions of users we need you to get the word out for them to weigh into congress and fight for thefuture.org has a campaign going right now that's going to be updated this morning i believe to also discuss the warner amendment um so we need to get we need to use our superpowers we need to communicate via twitter and we need to get word to our user bases to weigh in with the senate because i think that that will help um i think going forward there there are a couple there are two kind of underlying problems that we need to fix within the industry in order to prevent these types of things from happening to begin with one is we need to unify um and there are different sort of factions within the crypto policy world it's become very clear within the past week that there is a main group of us that can work together really well um i would like to give kudos to the coinbase policy team most of who whom are new and just showed up and you know if anybody knows me uh coinbase is not my favorite because they're the only member to have ever left the blockchain association um but we have it's been a delight working with our team and they have been incredibly effective and um you know they're they're wonderful to work with so we need to make sure we continue to work with coinbase um we need to make sure that we get everybody under one umbrella because we can't have different voices putting out different messages everybody needs to work together um the other problem we need to solve and i saw some discussion on this on twitter this morning and and this has been kind of a personal project though it quite frankly often gets pushed to the back burner because so many other problems hop up but we need to give to members of congress and members of the senate who support us we need to give large financial donations like what people what members of congress need to know is that hey if i go to bat for crypto crypto will go to back for me and we need to find a way to organize the political giving um and make it so that um we work together in a way that makes sense you know there's a lot of people that have supported cinema there's a lot of people who've supported warner they have not helped us and it is unfortunate that that all of that effort um has led to really them doing what is single-handedly like the worst amendment to ever been voted on in all of congress related to crypto right um so that's a problem we need to stop rewarding bad behavior and we need to reward good behavior and it shouldn't matter if they're republican or democrat if they're helping us we should be helping them and so that's something that i know a lot of people are getting passionate about right now i've got a lot of ideas about that and so going forward you know we need to unify we need to be politically active meaning we need to give political contributions um but but today for friday and saturday we need to fire up the user base we need to get the word out we need to get our celebrity friends tweeting about this we need to get the fight for the future campaign and then frighten us in front of as many possible eyeballs as we can so that we can get the word into the senate that wyden is good warner is bad and listen it's we can still win this thing it's not over yet we are up against the white house we're up against the treasury department um we are up against the managers of this bill but i think that we can still win this fight we just need to not give up and we need to keep pushing and going forward i think this will be looked back upon as the moment that crypto really woke up they understood washington and going forward i think we're going to be a force to be reckoned with great well so people should look for those campaigns and um you know i'll uh be sure to put the link to the fight for the future and and you know whatever else you think is good in the show notes and yeah we'll see what happens um thank you so much for coming on unconfirmed yeah thanks laura don't forget next up is the weekly news recap [Music] thanks for tuning in to
