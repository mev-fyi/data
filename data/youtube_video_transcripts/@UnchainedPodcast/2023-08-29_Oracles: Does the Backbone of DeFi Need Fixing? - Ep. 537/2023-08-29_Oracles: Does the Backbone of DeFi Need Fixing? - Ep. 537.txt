a longtime pith contributor and today you have some news about new developments in that ecosystem but why don't we just start with your background tell us about pith what it is and what problem it's been trying to solve yep absolutely so um pith is a data Oracle Network and it is focused on bringing Financial Market data on chain in a trustworthy way with very low latency in my background is in traditional Finance I started at Morgan Stanley on the FX sales and trading desk out of college at a very interesting time where the markets for equities and Futures had already become electronic and FX was undergoing that transition and so I could kind of sense out the paradigm shift that was underway and I tried to position myself to be in in an opportunity to take advantage of it so the first thing I did was move over to electronic trading desk at Morgan Stanley but then I realized that the winners were not going to be big Banks but instead trading firms and so I made my way over to kcg who is the largest U.S Equity Trader and I helped build out the the FX trading business there and then in 2017 it was being acquired by another trading firm called virtue and during that time of the due diligence it was effectively pencils down and so you had a bunch of basically hungry Traders sat in a room um the Ico boom was well underway and you can imagine in the scene where we were we were very quickly learning about crypto so we were all attracted to the kind of very obvious arbitrages that were available on centralized exchanges but what really ended up being in paradigm shift for me is as I started playing around and getting an understanding the first trade that I did on ether Delta was i absolute eye opener I had already understood that the The blockchain Innovation would allow for smoother remittance around the world but this was the first time where I fully appreciated that something like wealth management or a decentralized interactive brokers was possible and you'd be able to effectively give these financial planning tools to say a Ken like a Kenyan farmer yeah and so that was my my journey down into uh into crypto I I got a job or I was recruited to uh jump trading um when the crypto desk was emerging and I started there in 2019 and that's when I started getting involved in the in the fifth Network and uh today I'm announcing the um the formation of duralabs of which I'm the CEO we have got 20 people and we are a blockchain infrastructure company um and we're really focused on accelerating the growth of of the pith Network yeah so let's give listeners more background on pith um you know you're trying to solve this Oracle problem which is a pretty sticky problem in crypto describe a little bit what it is the problems that um Oracle providers face in the crypto ecosystem yeah the Oracle problem kind of by definition is the shared State systems of of blockchains don't have access to exogenous data and so someone needs to bring it on chain and then there's a whole bunch of trade-offs with who you're going to trust to bring it on chain and we've lived through several cycles of them um and each time there's a big issue I think a new Oracle Network kind of gets created so if you were to just start with building a application and you wanted to connect it to a um an oracle Network or you wanted to connect to an oracle let's say that you were building a lending protocol the most intuitive thing you that you would do if you were not that custom to dealing with blockchains is connect to say the coinbase API and then you'll run into some problems with that for instance there is downtime with the coinbase exchange there's down times with their coinbase API they may update it at some point they may not have all the assets that you want to have covered or they may underrepresent the market like they may have one of the assets but it mostly say trades on binance and so your price on on coinbase may not be reflective and so you can start to build out a case for having to add more data sources and you effectively have to deal with certain trade-offs and most of those trade-offs are around the speed with which you can update and so the reason why we developed pith or I started working on pith was the prevailing solution at the time um a few years ago which was chain link had two issues we thought with it the first one was that it was relatively slow so it was updating every say hour or 50 basis point move and then the second problem with it is that it only uses free data and when you're working at a kind of a systematic trading firm there's two things that are drilled into your head constantly the first one is that latency matters and if you're slow you will have adverse selection or you'll lose money and the second is that market data is pretty expensive so Financial Market data in the traditional asset uh world was six and a half billion dollars in Revenue in 2022. so if your model is predicated on getting that data when it's free you're going to have a very high limitation to what is available so that's really where pith decided to focus on um in terms of the sector and um and and how we're going to to develop the network to provide that with the lowest latency possible and so how does pith do that so pith is inclusive it's a first party Data Network and it's inclusive of sources so kind of the nodes in the pith Network are the ones that are actually publishing the data or generating the data themselves and so those consist of trading firms and exchanges so there are 85 data providers in the fifth Network today we count pretty much every large trading firm almost without exception from jump trading drw Susquehanna Jane Street and then we have pretty much every large exchange and the crypto side from binance on down to the smaller ones and also some traditional exchanges so myx IEX memex are us Equity exchanges and in December of last year uh sibo Global markets joined as a data provider um now to to us this isn't a very a very important component of it and the analogy that I sometimes will make is that when we looked at the model that was not inclusive so the reporter Network which relies on nodes that effectively go scrape data from the internet and publish that on chain felt and looked a lot more like digital music in the late 90s where you had Napster that enabled people to for a short period of time make all the world's music available for free um obviously that model is broken because the intellectual property Creator is not rewarded for it and so you have this kind of tragedy of the commons um so what model worked was the Spotify model where the content creator or the the song Creator is rewarded and that is what we sought to do on the on the pith Network the pith Network seeks to do which is to be a place where all the world's financial data can be distributed through in a similar way to all the world's music being distributed through Spotify and the crypto markets are notoriously volatile and there have even been flash crashes on exchanges as kind of um you know professionalized as coinbase how do you distinguish either volatility or Flash crashes from something like price manipulation so typically what will happen with like an oracle attack even and we'll just use that as an example because that'll give you someone who's deliberately doing this and it'll give us a framework for thinking about how it could happen without the deliberate element to it is that you will find a small exchange that's being used as an Oracle and you will momentarily move the price and then take some action on chain so for instance if you were able to take out a loan with something where you can make the value of it on the Oracle go really high you take out this loan and it comes back down the lending protocol typically ends up with bad debt and that's sort of what's happened with like the mango Oracle exploits haven't done on Venus as well um so those are obviously you know bad outcomes um and something that you want to defend against there was a really cool blog post written by Sam cesy's son like a number of years ago that dove into the details of that and his conclusion was the best thing to do is to slow things down right and so he kind of advocated for some version of a Time weighted average price and in fact you've had many people use the uniswap t-wop as their Oracle and the idea is like well we don't really need updates all that frequently we just want to have something that's not going to have this exposure now from a training perspective as I mentioned before latency makes you effectively lose money somehow you can think about impermanent loss almost as latency Arbitrage with adverse selection being the the lp holders because they're dependent upon somebody who has faster information to come and update the market price at their expense so when you kind of put this framework together you know that you know it's not great to be slow but you don't want to take all the risks of being fast and wrong so what we what pith has designed is very Innovative so the first thing is each of the data sources are required to update at the kind of the the block time for our pithnet which is every 300 milliseconds based on this on the technology um but they're updating not just a price a single price at any point they're also including a confidence interval and so you have a band with which you can use to determine whether or not that price is very trustworthy and this gives us this Innovation allows us to update prices very frequently and give the protocols who are Downstream the ability to make more informed decisions so for instance if something did flash crash on a single exchange and all the other data Publishers on the network did not represent that then it would be represented through the confidence interval because it would show you that the confidence is very low and the confidence band is wide so the idea there is that you can basically interpret the prices saying this is generally where the price is but it could be somewhere in this range as well and so that was what allows pif to be able to be very fast but also very accurate and you mentioned some data providers that definitely come more from the traditional Financial World rather than crypto and I wondered how those conversations went what does it take to get that kind of institution to want to partner with a company that is essentially trying to bridge um you know from the traditional Financial world to crypto are they open to it um or is it something pretty out of the box for them is there a lot of persuasion that needs to happen tell us a little bit about that so there there's basically uh two types of parties that are interested in providing data on um on pith so the first one would be sort of um like trading firms and their motivation tends to be that they've never monetized their Market data in the past right and so I mentioned that six and a half billion dollars of Revenue is earned through Market data it's mostly earned by the large exchanges and the trading firms are not participants on that they basically use the market data to be able to make trading decisions that that's about it so one way you can think about that is you know pif in this example is sort of like Airbnb and you know the trading firms have these found assets where they can now monetize them for the very first time and then the second group so if we think about someone like sibo who does monetize their Market data the way they think about it is it's about 20 of the revenues from all these large centralized exchanges and what they want to do is be a part of the future which they assume could potentially be 20 of the say the the size of defy um as a part of the actual data component of it and so they want to be early on the data so those are really the two things that I think motivate most participants within the network and then also some of them are all already creating their own like for instance reference rate I didn't know how that differs from this is that um something where those products would be competitive with what you know it like if they were like if let's say because I know CMA so you have sibo on your network but I know CME I think has these Bitcoin reference rates and so is you know would working with you be competitive with their own product or is that complementary or I don't even know how those really compare I think they're quite different so a single sourced reference point is going especially one that's going to be mostly off chain is going to be a certain type of a market and what pith does is it creates the references that are the pith prices um through the combination of all these different data sources um now there's a couple of ways that you can classify pretty much every Oracle Network or um or solution and I can go through them now kind of very quickly there's basically four categories the first is push or pull the second is fast or slow the third is first party versus third party and then the final is sort of single Source first a blended source okay so in the first one push versus poll in a push model basically the price gets updated to the shared state to the the ecosystem on a predetermined schedule right so this is the way that chain link mostly operates and they are for ethereum the um the schedule tends to be around every hour or 50 basis points and there's a sponsorship where the gas is going to be paid for by the nodes but usually it gets subsidized by someone else um there are some conflicts with this so if you're like a profit maximizing uh mindset what you would try and do is kind of degrade the product to the point where it's just above the switching cost in order to kind of keep the sponsorship and update as intrically as possible so there's some some issues with this um and then the other element of it is that if you wanted if you as a user wanted something that was faster you're sort of limited the poll model which is what pith has created means that all the prices are updated to a single repository at first so pith uses something called piff net which is as I mentioned a version of Solana it's validated by the data providers there's 85 data providers that are validating it and it has all the sorts of transparency requirements you'd expect from a from sort of a layer one and so you can kind of check the um the Fidelity and the um Providence of the aggregation and any one of those updates is able to be delivered to any of the chains at pits connect to pith is currently connected to 30 blockchains and all 320 symbols that are currently live or distributed to any one of those 30 blockchains um so that's the kind of the push burst pull fast for slow we sort of went over before um and in order to be sort of the fastest um you need to be kind of inclusive you have to have this first party Network for slow you know this t-wop idea um was I think kind of um one of the things that people thought about as being a potential solution for a little while um but we sort of kind of moved on from that first party first third party so in the third party model it's kind of easier to set things up you you can go to websites such as coin Gecko and coin market cap but you're limited to whatever is free and so crypto Market data has for the longest time been mostly free and if you looked at the traditional Market data it was largely free for a long time and then it became 20 of the value of of the revenues for from large exchanges um I would imagine something like that could happen in the future coinbase has started charging Market data a little over a year go and and we'll start we could expect that other exchanges do the same um and then first parties are kind of inclusive and then finally single verse Blended source is if you use a single Source there's going to be some of those constraints that I mentioned with using coinbase versus a blended source which you can just have contributors that add and create just a more robust price um so there's another example of someone who also does an oracle which is binance they have the binance Oracle but they're also a contributor to pith and so there's some users that may only want binance and then there's others that would want to use you know kind of binance as a contributor to to pith and so when you're vetting data providers to add to the network what are the qualifications that you're looking for we are looking for institutional grade companies that have a strong reputation in so much where there is more at risk for them to lose in another business than there is for them to gain by trying to manipulate the pith price and so they're very very much household names all these 85 data providers and they're all public so you can go on the the website of pith.networks Publishers and you can see all the all the Publishers a part of the network at this stage of the network it's very important for people to derive the trust from these names right and so it would be a crazy thing for like Jane Street to try and manipulate the price of um something on pith because the amount that they would end up losing in terms of Goodwill and on their name from kind of publicly doing this is going to be much more than they could potentially gain from this and so that is really the litmus test for whether or not um someone should be a data provider into pith at this time in the future when this move when when things move to a decentralized permissionless setup this will be determined by the kind of the governance token holders of the network and they'll be able to do that based on the quality of the proposed data provider that gets added and there'll be some staking and other kind of incentive mechanisms in place to protect anyone from coming in that doesn't have the best of intentions so something that I find so impressive is that you've integrated 30 blockchains you know as far as I understand that's that's a technical feed um just talk a little bit about what it is to try to provide for so many different blockchains just yeah on a integration on a technical level it's it's it is a lot of work and um my co-founder and CTO jant um has lots of opinions on um kind of the best practices that he's learned by dealing with so many blockchains um some of his insights that um I think he would he would mention is that um dealing with evm you get lots of benefits of ancillary tooling um so you get good great wallets great analytics and um you know kind of sample code that you can use to develop applications and so that's that's actually a really nice thing within rust so that'd be Cosmos and Solana there are great attributes and those languages are not specific to blockchains there is also you know kind of a a rich history of other application development there and so you also get very good libraries and um and resources unmove languages you end up having some really cool developed things specific for blockchains but you don't yet have the full robust Suite of tooling so it sort of needs to be built out and so each time we expand to a different chain we have to go through the process of learning how to operate on that chain and it is very difficult and humbling to do and um but it is a core tenant to what we at pith or at um at Duro would like to kind of lead with we want to make sure that we scale very quickly to as many blockchains and that as many projects as possible have the opportunity to use this data and and so far it's been the case so we're on 30 blockchains and on 10 of them we have a market share of over 90 this way that we think about a scaling pith to different blockchains has similarities to the way that Facebook grew so initially it was just the social network for Harvard and then it was a social network for Harvard and the rest of the Ivy Leagues and then it was U.S universities and so on um and so pith started out at on Solana and it grew to over 90 percent of the tvl TVs there that used in Oracle um and it really is never left um and it was an advantageous time because this is where you know High throughput D5 was really being innovated and so high throughput D5 was first only possible in Solana and that was the first place that we saw on-chain order books or Unchained perp um trading platforms and now it's sort of table Stakes um High throughput D5 is a trend that is sort of unmissable you've got High throughput specialized blockchains like Optus and moo and and sui and then you also have the modularity of layer twos um for the evm world and so our arbitrom or optimism and when we think about where we can kind of build up the most kind of uh critical mass of users we tend to find areas where this is a priority because Solana has done such a good job in showing what was possible and now other chains are sort of running with that baton and that's kind of how we think about a scaling as you mentioned pif has grown very rapidly in recent months so why is that and how has it grown yeah it's it's been really remarkable it's exceeded my expectations for sure um so basically pith has gone cross chain in January of this year and on the pithnet side we create a supply or it creates a supply of 320 symbols that are updating call it two times a second so it's roughly speaking 50 million aggregate prices now in January 2 000 of those were being requested per day to be delivered um and then in may we saw a spike to about 150 um in June we saw about double that and then in July it was around 1.3 million per day and this month so far we've been seeing update requests for over 2 million so why is this um the the first kind of power user of pith was synthetics on optimism when they upgraded to V2 with their new Perpetual markets and what they realized was that having a low latency pole model Oracle would enable them to create an unprecedented trading experience so Perpetual markets a year ago were not all that common within defy and they've grown very very quickly part of the reason for the growth has been the lack of FTX and the kind of desire for people to now have self-custody in their trading and so we've seen perpetuals on chain explode in terms of their growth now because pith has been able to help synthetics in creating a kind of Best in Class trading experience I think that most of the the competitors or people that would like to build something similar have found pith in similar capacities today if you were to do a derivative or take a derivative trade on on a DEX there's a 50 chance that it's powered by pith which is really remarkable growth given the kind of the short time frame with which we've kind of gone multi-chain and how is pith um tip like what what are the range of ways that pith is being used so in like most oracles or most protocols that require oracles the two largest use cases are lending protocols as well as kind of trading ones but we also see things like Structured Products um and other kind of um kind of collateral management protocols that that use pith but generally speaking those are sort of the broad two categories it's kind of trading and then and creating collateral for um uh for Lending all right so in a moment

duralabs tell us how it will be working with a pith Network and I believe there's a task coming up very soon which you you might want to talk about this Perseus upgrade absolutely so so guys we're very excited today to to announce the launch of duralabs so duralabs is a company that has 20 people ranging from contributors that were at Jump previously to alumni from Goldman Sachs or AWS chorus one and many others and what we're looking to do is build out tooling and development for the network and really try and accelerate the growth now the pith network has had a few stages of of big technology upgrades and so as I mentioned before pith started its life cycle on Solana and that was in September of 2021 and the idea was we needed to be on a layer one blockchain where there was going to be the characteristics that could give people the necessary assumptions for trust and um we wanted to make sure that you could use a Solana block Explorer and look at the aggregation back into the um the math of it and you know kind of really understand how it was working so a layer one blockchain was important but we always viewed that pith needed to be on multiple chains and so because latency is such an important component characteristic of valuable data and the type of data that pith wants to provide we needed to be on the blockchain with the fastest intervals and so that ended up being Solana so the you know decision criteria was was quite straightforward to begin with um given those constraints and we knew that we'd go to cross chain there were times where Solana became so popular and it became very congested there were nft mints and Landing pith data on a congested Solana was very difficult um and there was also down times from time to time and so we realized that we needed to create an application specific chain and if we can do that and we can convert to this pole model we would be able to scale very quickly to the number of symbols and number of data providers without having to have a new variable cost with how much we grow the variable costs sort of be Downstream and so this is our V2 and the emergence of pithnet and then we plugged in pithnet to Wormhole and started growing cost chain about eight months ago and now we've grown to um to being on 30 different blockchains the Perseus upgrade is a continuation of the development in the pithnet architecture that gets sent over wormhole in such a way we're now using Merkle trees for proofs and that allows for way more customizable uh delivery in the past we were relying on basically preset batches to be delivered to various blockchains but now they can be fully customizable with a single proof that anyone can use to validate um the the messages that were sent so this allows us to see a decrease of gas from anywhere from 40 to percent up to 90 percent depending upon how many symbols your your um you're using we can increase the publishing frequency to other chains by a factor of about two and it allows us to really continue to scale and grow the network to make sure that it's you know constantly the fastest and cheapest it could possibly be and one other aspect that I think is coming is a permissionless state with token-led governance what will that look like so right now becoming a a member or a node in the pith network is managed by the pith data Association and that eventually will get turned over to governance holders and so that and other key features this is where fifth as an application will have critical areas such as which symbols to add and which data providers do what managed by the token holders so this is a important transition in kind of the life cycle of pith as it continues to decentralize in a decentralized state if you're going to add new data providers how does that work maybe there's a proposal to you know try to talk to this other centralized party and then are like certain people delegated to to represent the network that way or you know just wondering how a decentralized entity interfaces with all these centralized entities yeah so um it is an interesting point given that the pith network has probably more contributors than most decentralized protocols today it is going to be a little bit of a challenge but I think this is something that will get proposed in governance and a framework that will allow basically General participation there was a couple of good models out there where we see you know highly participatory governance structures synthetics is a is a good example of one and then there's kind of other models that are more like say Ave or compound synthetics uses sort of committees avian compound or sort of just like token holder boats and so we'll allow the community to make proposals on how this will work but um I think that uh it's a it's a it's an exciting place to kind of experiment and do you have a sense yet of how tokens will be distributed no we haven't had any announcements around that yet okay yeah I'm sure probably the regulatory environment in the US is perhaps going to complicate that discussion um so tell us a little bit more about the the plans for Dura Labs um will you contribute exclusively to pith or do you think in the future you might extend services to other projects it's totally possible that we could extend services to other projects but for the moment we are laser focused on I'm really developing fifth Network we have a whole lot of embedded DNA with contributing to pith from myself and co-founders Kieran and Jan so you know that's where we think that we can add the most value but you know who knows over time I think that there's certainly within scope for us to be able to do and work on other projects and so the focus for Duro Labs will be contributing tooling for it just tell us like you're servicing developers is that it exactly so it'll be continuing to advance the development of the network um and so that could include additional upgrades like the Perseus one it could also be helping build out the network by working directly with data providers to go through the kind of governance process um and so those sorts of things the crypto markets are in a really interesting place right now the volumes are down um we have you know market makers that have been withdrawing it looks like Finance is in a precarious State um I mean there's just so many things that make it feel right now like like the crypto Market is just changing generally and I was curious for your thoughts on kind of where it's going and and I feel like also you you'll have an interesting perspective because you've seen so much growth during a period when everything else has been kind of um you know in this transitional state so yeah where where do you see the markets going you're absolutely right it is such a weird time um we've now um seen Bitcoin kind of make new lows at a time where I think people felt like we'd kind of bottomed out for a bit and I think that's sucked a lot of the air out of the room um so the you know the interesting thing is we have not seen a kind of General retreat in terms of the number of Builders so pith has had three new applications per week integrate and that to us tells us that people are still building things um and and that's where the Optimist in me thinks that we've got the potential for you know some some real long-term value and for if the markets become exciting for kind of the general public again um way better kind of toys than we used to have for better tooling you know the the meme is you know Builder is building these bear markets we think it's the case and I think that looking at pith's growth in terms of all these metrics that are around usage underscores that um and so um it's maybe a happy story for us to try and take a Rosy view on things but if we were to get things to turn around I think um in in terms of just the the market sentiment um there's just way better tooling and and um applications possibilities um than we had sort of in the last couple Cycles and at what Vision do you have for once things kind of work in a sort of Ideal state or in a fully mature State what will that world look like so the vision that we have for pith is that all the world's financial data should go through pith to be brought onto blockchains in a way similar to all the world's music going through Spotify and what we hope to have happen is for um the vision of D5 being what I understood as kind of that Paradigm Shift when I first did the trade on on ether Delta it's a decentralized way for people to gain access to Capital markets in all the other trends that like major growth trends that have been enabled by technology Things become cheaper but they become much more broad broadly distributed and so I think that's one of the big benefits that we have within crypto and moreover within the potential of defy we would expect to see sort of the kind of the general usage costs go way down um but in order to compensate for that the number of users go up incredibly which will increase the um the benefits for people who just haven't had access to these tools before um and that's what excites me and you know if if you thought about places that didn't have taxi drivers before and now you can go get an Uber anywhere it's just a way better like way better experience for you as a user of the technology I think that that is what's going to be enabled by crypto when it's at its full um kind of potential all right this has been a fascinating discussion where can
