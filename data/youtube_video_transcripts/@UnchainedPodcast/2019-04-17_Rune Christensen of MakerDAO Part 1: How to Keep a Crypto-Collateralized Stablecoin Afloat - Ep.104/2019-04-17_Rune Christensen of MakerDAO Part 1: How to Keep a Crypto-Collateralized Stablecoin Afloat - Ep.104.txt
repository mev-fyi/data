hi everyone two quick notes before we dive into today's podcast first there's an update on last week's episode with Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss during the show they said that no other stable coins have named their banking partners at the time I did mention that at least Heather had me and some of its banking partners but I also wanted to note that circles USD coin has several banking partners including suffocate Bank and US Bancorp asset management and true USD has named its trust companies and their correspondent banks I've appended an update to last week's episode and show notes as well

technology and interview with confidence visit us at token soft dot bio or on twitter at token soft egg my guest today is Rouen Christensen of maker Dao welcome rune thanks so much for having me and thank you for entering that crazy soundcheck all right so you were on the podcast before talking about staple coins generally and we did describe maker Tao in that episode but it's a pretty complex system so I felt like there was plenty more we could discuss so much so in fact that I actually have to warn listeners that the maker doubt system has a lot of nuances and a lot of special terminology so you may have to do a lot of rewinding it honestly preparing for this reminded me a little bit of the dy/dx episode where I was having to listen to my pre-interview with Antonio on a point six speed anyway so rune for listeners who didn't hear that but said why don't you give us a short overview of what maker doubt is and how it works yeah so at the very basic maker Tao is a decentralized platform on aetherium that creates a stable coin called die and being a stable coin means that one die is worth one dollar and this is really useful right and sort of a new frontier in crypto because once you have stability and once you have money and encrypted that just has value that you used to you can actually start using it for real stuff and more than just speculation and there's a second token also in the maker town system can you talk about that a little bit yeah so so in addition to die the stable token there's also MKR which is like the governance token and sort of a speculative token that gives holders of it exposure to the system as a whole and yeah I mean this and this really gets into this what you were talking about right there's a lot of there's a very advanced system sort of under the hood that powers the stability of the eye and the mkr token is basically like the ownership and the control over this this underlying system and it's who in the previous episode where we described stable coins generally we talked about how there multiple different models to use where you you know that you could use to create a coin that had a stable value so what is the model that maker Dao uses yeah so there's generally considered to be three types of stable coins and and maker and dive folds in the crypto collateralised model so what that means is the stability of diet comes from the fact that there is collateral so there are valuable assets that are sitting in smart contracts on the etherion blockchain and are essentially available to buy back die and in that way prop up the price and keep the keep it stable at $1 all right great yeah and just so people know right now it's started started with what's called single collateral die which is backed by ether but you're going to be moving to a multi collateral die system which is going to be backed by many different types of assets some of it I mean they all have to be crypto in form but some of them could even be real-world assets such as like crypto versions of real estate or gold or something like that yeah and even other types of stable coins as well oh right right right which I think I asked you about before but anyway okay so let's now dive into the details of how all this works and we're gonna just walk through the simplest scenario with die which is that we have a single collateral die and a user decides to create this single collateral die for themselves and and so so listeners should know that what can happen is that if you if the value of the collateral that you put up falls below a certain minimum threshold then you're died in the collapse the collateral that you put up will be liquid it your position will be liquidated however let's just walk through the simplest scenario in which somebody creates die for themselves but their their position is never liquidated how how do they create the die and then how do they get their collateral back yes so and whenever I talk about this I really like to compare it to a mortgage and like taking out alone we're using your house as the collateral from the bank right because this is actually something a lot of people do and so basically the first part of interaction is putting the collateral into the system right so this is kind of equivalent to go into the bank and saying here's my house and here's the here's the claim on my house and then you like then this system you know gives you basically an amount that you can borrow based on the value of your collateral and then gives you the Sanji of the diet and give you the money basically and overtime so now so basically now you have that you have to die you have the the stable coin that you borrowed that you can then go and spend on something and you also have what's called the CDP the collateralized debt position and this is effectively this is something like you know like when you own your house but the bank has a lien on it right so you own your collateral but the collateral is locked behind debt and you only can you can only get you can only retrieve the collateral out of the system again by paying back the debt and let's say if you wait a year before you you pay that back your debt because you wanted to spend your money and then after a year maybe the price of aetherium has gone up and you want to to like lock in some of those profits then you also have to pay a stability fee so this is basically the interest rate you have to pay to the bank as well right this is a similar logic so you you pay down the debt and then you pay the the stability fee which right now has to be paid with the MKR token so the speculative government's talking I was talking about earlier and when you paid the system actually burns the token and resulting in more scarcity of the MPR token and that's sort of what drives the value of NPR and then in the end you can retrieve your your aetherium collateral out of the system again so this is really like you pay you know when you after you finish paying off your mortgage to the bank the house is just yours right freehold and the bank can't come and take it and what is this stability fee and why does that have to be paid through MKR yeah I mean so the stability fee is really equivalent to the like to the risk premium of the loan right so the stability feasible exists to protect the system against the risk that the collateral will crash to nothing and and this system will have to recapitalize because there's you know because now there's not enough collateral to bec die so the stability feed depends on how risky the collateral asset you're using is and of course in single collateral die is to the current version that's running live on a theorem right now there's only one type of collateral and so so there's just one stability fee set for that for a set for a theorem which is what amount yes so right now it is 0.5% and what's interesting is has actually been changing quite a lot and it's been changing based on our decentralized governance process so it is actually the MPR holders that come together and then vote directly on the blockchain with their MPR to change the stability fee and and yeah then and then again the way it's like when you're paid you actually paid with the mkr as well so if you're if you're like a regular user when you want to to close your CD piece and when you want to pay back your loan and just retrieve your collateral you have to go and buy a tiny amount of MKR and then give that to the system and the system will then burn that in care and to date about 500 M care has been burned this way which is equivalent to something like we think that sir yeah yeah it was less less than 1% of the total supply right so it's not really is actually it's about 0.1% of the total supply that has been burned so far in total and but that kind of represents what gives the system value and kind of keep it keeps it going because it means that as the system runs and as people use it the value of m KR grows right because m care becomes more and more scarce and this in turn creates the incentive that's necessary for NPR holders to actively engage with the system and and govern it and make sure it remains stable in in a way I guess paying that through MKR it's sort of like it kind of in short helps ensure the safety of it in a way but do you know what I mean and that it creates an incentive to or it sort of pees I guess the people who are governing it yeah exactly well yeah that aligns the incentives of the users of a system and those who like the I guess you can say the workers right those who operate the system isn't the right verb it's more like they the value the value of their mkr arises as long as they govern it well people are people yeah okay and and in the multilateral version of the system so in the next release that really is like that we really consider to be like the full version right and the current version reconsider to be a beta this will be abstracted away so when you pay down your debt their stability fees actually paid and died and you don't even know like you don't even have to worry about what's the principal debt what's the stability fee like you just have an amount of debt that you have to pay to get access to your collateral and their system then automatically sort of takes out the portion of the of the what you're paying back that is equivalent to stability fee and takes that die and automatically buys MPR with it and then burns it so it becomes more convenient for the end user but the system still has that dynamic of buying and you know burning MKR and thus making sure that as users use the system those who regulate and protect the system are continuously rewarded to align the incentives all right so now let's move to the next scenario which is a little bit more complex than the single collateral die that's just redeemed and doesn't get liquidated so in this this is you know a version of which someone does create single collateral die but then the value of their collateralized debt position does fall below that minimum threshold at that point what what happens yeah so right now the liquidation ratio so that minimum threshold of collateral value is said 150% and on average actually most people keep it as 300% so most people they have for every one dollar of debt they actually have three dollars of aetherium collateral but that does you know your doesn't protect some people from from being a little bit taking a little bit too much a risk in getting really close to that point and yeah so if you hit that hundred and fifty percent level so that basically means let's say if you have a say you have a hundred thousand debt if the value of your theorem collateral hits one hundred and fifty dollars in value the system will detect this through its price feed oracles and will then trigger a liquidation and that really just means that it takes all your collateral and it sells it off on the market to try to to recapitalize and take get in enough diet and then when it gets enough die it pays down your debt texe also a penalty that's kind of there to incentivize people to not get get into the specific not rely on this mechanism but rather make sure that they maintain their own CDP like on their own and then whatever's left over if anything is left over is then given back to the to the user and so for this penalty which is the liquidation penalty how what percentage is that that is actually a thirteen percent right now which i think is quite high but I think an interesting dynamic that we have seen is that as over the past year right as the etherium price has completely crashed like completely crater right but what during this time die has been back to only by a theorem and what's interesting is that s SCDP holders keep getting closer to their to the liquidation point they're very good at like topping up with the theorem collateral because they don't want to get hit by that thirteen percent penalty so it's a very it's like a very strict penalty that is in place right now but also it has a very healthy sort of effect on the behavior of the users and why do you have the liquidation penalty I mean I I understand you said earlier it's to incentivize people to not get liquidated but why is that important for the maker down system if essentially you this system should always at least remain whole yeah I mean this is so I'll get this actually gets into some of the so that the deeper governance and and risk theory that we spend a lot of time talking about community and basically the thing is that maker is designed to not fail under normal circumstances right like it's like it's fine Navy theorem false let's say ninety percent over a year that's not really yeah like that is actually an expected scenario right and and similarly if there just are like fluctuations in the market and there's looking at a big crash or something that's that's still also enough for these parameters to deal with what kinda the the only real risk to to like a financial infrastructure like maker is you know it's like really like a systemic type of sleepwalking where everyone is kind of ignoring what's going on and people are just like counting on whatever or light like oh yeah we'll be it'll be fine kind of and you know so actually it's almost like a you know it's almost more than just a financial phenomenon it's like a cultural phenomenon right which i think is something like if you look at something like the the 2008 financial crisis that's like an example of when it really when complacency really sets in that's when you can get these kind of like crazy crashes that actually can catch even the most you know diligent risk model of God so we so the goal is basically that we really want to ensure that you know the users understand that you know that they're playing with leverage which is some like an you know credit is actually something and credit risk is something to take seriously so if you don't know like if you're not actively managing your own load like your own position you're not actively know what's going on in the system you should use a service that you know holds your hand kind of that helps you actually do this and so right now a few of those services exist but basically in the future we expect it to be a much you know bigger and healthier ecosystem of of many types of you know like front-end services that that for instance will help liquidate users position in advance so they don't hit the limit like so they don't hit sort of this level and just in general ensure that the system as a whole runs more smoothly because the people who use it actually you know I'm watching the market right now actually watching what's going on rather than just know levering up and then you know hoping everything will be fine yeah I love what you said about the cultural shift because I feel like this is yet another example of how people have to learn with crypto that it really is like digital or it can function like digital cash and that this money just it performs really differently or or acts really differently from that kinds of money that were used to and it's like yet another example of the mind shift that somebody has to undergo if they're going to take control of their private keys and there's actually more I want to ask you about that later but another thing that I wanted to ask you was it was who why why is it 13 percent cuz you even yourself admitted that was high yeah I mean it's actually because I mean so the reason why I think thirty percent was high and kinda I mean because it like in hindsight we actually think that we've seen I mean that in a way we can justify that it maybe it makes sense in a system like this to have a sort of a very have a very punishing penalty like that just because we saw that good behavior out of it right but so it's actually because just like for technical reasons in single collateral die it's it's implemented in a way where it's liquidation function is just not very it doesn't it's not very good basically so it's very inefficient and and for that reason that's like so just to I mean it's not I mean I guess it's not it's not like it's you know it's just like it could be a lot better and it will be a lot better in multi collateral die and basically because that's the case we just decided to really really are on you know significantly on this side of caution and just put something we thought was like yeah this is really really high we're gonna gonna put a 13% and then there's no way that we will actually run into issues you know derive from the fact that the liquidation function its implemented in the in a most simple way and then why is the minimum threshold for collateral why is that 150 percent that's actually just a natural like that is no I mean that's it's I guess it's the like what we've been looking what we looked at when we came up with that completely arbitrary number is things like other stable coins like no [ __ ] shares has this bitusd stable coin that I really is inspired by and it's sort of an evolution of that whole design and we saw then and that had a that actually had a similar like had risk parameters that were similar to that although their risk worms work slightly differently and then another example is when you look at the various margin trading platforms like that that allow people to imagine trade if you're in for instance what we saw is those that we consider to be kind of like yet once again you can say like the the nut ones and like full-on casinos but more like actually are providing leverage to sophisticated professional traders that know what they're doing and they seem to - I mean typically they will allow up to 5x leverage in many cases and also 3x is pretty common so we basically said 3x or so kind of be our absolute sort of like upper bound for how much leverage users would be able to take so we just ensure the system stays sort of under on the safe side but yeah but there's actually more newest to this because in reality you can't really like in reality the this liquidation ratio is actually not a fixed like a fixed point but rather it's a function of what the stability fee is so this you know this the interest rate you have to pay due to the inherent risk of your of your collateral of your loan so in multilateral die it'll actually be a lot like it'll be kind of like choose your own liquidation ratio depending on how much you want to pay instability fee and then those two things are related on a curve oh well this yeah I mean there's a lot of comparisons one could make just something like lending club like a peer-to-peer loan but that I definitely think of as another parallel that I'm seeing I actually think this sort of brings up the role of keepers so can you describe who they are in the community yeah so keepers I guess you can say they're kind of there they are rational agents who are completely independent from the system and who are can be like anonymous and basically can be anyone and any person can can run a keeper by just going to keep a repulsor and GIP huh github and get the open source code and what they basically do is they are yeah they're like external independent agents that exploit various profit opportunities in the system now the most obvious and sort of like the reason why the keeper concept was invented was to to arbitrage the liquidations in the system right so when a keeper sees like the keepers are constantly looking for CD piece that that reach the liquidation point and if it finds one that has recently quotation PO and then the keeper is actually the one that sort of triggers the the function in a system that actually runs the liquidation and the keeper then also will buy the collateral out of the system during a liquidation for instance and then immediately go and sell it on some market elsewhere so keepers are kind of in a way you can limit like the glue that holds the system together and they're also kind of like the rational capital that interact with the system - for instance stabilized die in the short term based on the incentives that are built in for the long term and ultimately the more keepers there are the bet like the mall regular uses the system can handle and also like depending on how efficient and or inefficient the system is that determines how much you can make as a keeper yeah the role of keeper reminds me a little bit of miners in Bitcoin or aetherium or really any other role or this new trend that I discussed on the podcast with Sheikh Brookman and - charging of generalized mining where now you're seeing that these software networks basically can employ people or machines and it's something I talked about in my TEDx a little bit but as long as the incentives are designed correctly then the people who take on these roles can make money doing them so one thing that you mentioned though is that they kind of help keep the price you know in the right you know near the peg or at the peg how does that part work yeah so and I actually I really like were saying about this in terms of mining because when we first came up with the the name keeper we actually was like thinking and how do you how to explain what this may be something like mining 2.0 and then and then what one of the so so the other key thing to a keeper of the vent that keepers exploit profit opportunities is also if your keeper and you're already doing one thing where you're sort of scanning the blockchain and exploiting a profit opportunity you may as well also do everything else that sort of is you know now you've already got this secure setup that's that's performing some sort of profitable function you may as well also look for other similar things you can do right and so the other the other really obvious thing to do like as a keeper that's already scanning maker for liquidation opportunities is to for instance arbitrage the price of died across decentralized exchanges right so if you can find something like you can find an order on two different exchanges that actually cross but that just haven't matched because there are two different order books then you can buy one and sell the other for instance right but they're really advanced and also the most profitable activity that a keeper can do is market making right so really just providing liquidity to the market and this is where they I mean and this and and this is this is what can really in a way be described as exploiting the most fundamental mechanism of the maker system which is the the governance mechanism that keeps dice table around one u.s. dollar and so basically what a keeper will do is a Kiva will just bet that if the price of die is you know deviates from $1 that's a profit opportunity because you can either then buy die and expect it to go back to $1 and sell it again for some profit or you can sell it above $1 and expect it to go down to $1 and then buy it to also similarly make a profit yeah I find this whole system pretty incredible the more I learned about it the more I was really amazed and I honestly was proud because like you I taught English and he's in Asia early in my career and so I was pretty impressed that you would let this charge to come with this system all right another role that I want to discuss is Oracle's who what would do Oracle's you who are they so the term Oracle is it's a pretty old term I think probably like a like those kind of things I feel like it's something that was made up by metallic I think it's very likely I mean I feel and remember in making a blog process I'm part in early days but anyways the Oracles is like yeah it's a it's a generalized term for external actors that provide trusted data onto the blockchain so for maker it's this like Oracle's play this very crucial role of telling the system what the price of a theorem is for instance right so the system knows when CDP is supposed to be liquidated right because you can't actually find that like the blockchain doesn't see the outside world right so you know you you actually need to have some sort of link and there needs to be some element of trust when you get in some data because you can't just have anyone submitting any data they want right then that'll immediately that is won't work you actually need to like define in advance who do you trust and like what kind of sources do you trust for your data and the Oracle problem as many like to call it right is really one of the most fundamental issues in in like smart contracts and decentralization and the good news is nowadays there's some really cool solutions and so the create illusion we're currently using with maker is just a relatively simple like diversification scheme essentially so basically rather than using one source for the price feed into into maker the MKR holders they actually choose a whole set of of Oracle's so they will chew like so right now it's fourteen different if the area mattresses so like fourteen different like people basically around the world that have been chosen through an MPR vote when the system was launched and they all individually provides data into it like they all individually continuously updates what they sort of like observed to be the current price of aetherium on the market and then there is a like a fully autonomous Mart contract that takes in all of these data so it basically takes 14 different data points in real time and then takes the median of those different data points and and then pushes that median in to maker itself so that me and taking the median of the data points is pretty important because that actually gives us some resilience because it means that if if just like let's say some of the Oracles get compromised and start sending crazy numbers it's gonna be completely ignored by the system only if 51% of the Oracle's are compromised and starts sending bad data do we actually have a problem where that's gonna get pushed into the core the system so there they also have to be some secondary mechanisms to kind of protect against yeah like like compromised Oracle's and that is that's fundamentally like the fact that Oracle's always can in theory be compromised is sort of the fundamental to the fundamental thing about the Oracle problem we're gonna keep discussing Oracle's in a moment but first a quick word from our fabulous sponsors issuing a digital security on the

Maker Tau so I totally understand everything you're saying about how the Oracle problem is a fundamental problem and I understood this part about the 51% attack but if that's all the case then why are there so few Oracle's all you have to do is get eight people to collude and they can totally corrupt the system that seems like a really kind of vulnerable position to be in yeah I'm so so right now with with single die and and the the way the system is set up currently I'm really relying a lot on the fact that like we the the people who are running these Oracle's currently actually some very long-standing community members some of them are even Oracle's from other projects in the past including bitshares which is like one of the first or possibly the first project that started using Oracle's in this way and then they're also like they're their identities actually not known they're like like the foundation runs this whole Oracle sort of anonymization scheme where it's it's only very few people who actually know who the Oracles are and so ultimately it's it's definitely and I mean what it is it's really a a system that's robust enough for the beta for single colloidal diet because it's not really it's you know at this in its current state it's not really something I can compromise I like a normal actor you know maybe some state level actor would be able to to to penetrate the way it currently works but we definitely consider it safe enough for you know for like at the relatively limited scale of single level diet and then our main focus is how to make it better right and actually the absolute key thing that must be solved is in fact like I mean the Oracle problem fundamentally just needs to be solved right like in fact you can actually ever accept that regardless of what the chance is that the Oracles get compromised like it doesn't matter what that changes as long as it's not zero that's not acceptable right you're not gonna actually be able to build a full financial infrastructure on top of it so we actually have a solution that then we believe actually I mean of course you can't like you can never like solve something or you can never sort of guarantee anything with complete certainty right but we can we sort of a protein you know like 99.999% confidence with this approach and basically the idea is that so alongside this median like this this function that sort of takes in all the different inputs and then takes the median of those inputs or to ensure that even if some of them are compromised it doesn't matter because as long as the majority of are clean then it won't get get contaminated but then the next step is that instead of pushing this sort of you know the fully processed data directly into the system there's actually a delay in post on that data so and this is through something we call the Oracle security module so basically the Oracles like sort of the processed data from the Oracle is put into the Oracle security module and then sits there for an hour and just waits and is basically available for everyone to see so everyone can see okay in one hour this will be the new Oracle input but you know we can see it now and we don't like like it's not like we can actually react we have a full hour to react and it isn't that and then if the value is something crazy like you know nine nine nine online or whatever zero or something right so so basically if if the Oracles are compromised and they're trying to attack a system by sending in malicious data then the this sort of the second layer and very strong powerful defensive mechanism can then like activate and this is where this is and this is probably actually the most important feature of the whole system it's called the emergency shutdown so basically it is a way to for the system to actually shut down in the event of some sort of negative you know external or whatever I mean it could even be if the system got hacked or it could be if the market went completely crazy or there like there was some sort of crazy crash or if there's some sort of crypto economic attack like on the Oracle infrastructure and what an emergency shut that does is it sort of freezes the system at its last known safe state so if there's currently some bad data on its way through the Oracle security module then the emergency shutdown will and will they sort of rely on like on the last on the Oracle data point that was before that right that was still safe data point and then it will settle every single use of the system at the net as a value they're entitled to so what that means is as a die holder when the worst thing I can happen to you as a die holder is that the system stops like the service sort of stuff's running right the system stopped working but you can now just like what that means you die is your dice now just becomes a claim on $1 worth of collateral right so you no longer have a stable fine that's that keeps this remain stable on one dollar but your current stable coins you can go and you can exchange them directly in a system for like the equivalent value in eath of one dollar at the time that this emergency shutdown was done and then there is this very highly redundant infrastructure of what's called emergency Oracle's so basically a different type of Oracle that that just watches out for for yeah for like Oracle attacks or and actually there's also another kind of attack is really that which is named Cal holders get getting naughty and trying to use their powers maliciously and in both cases the emergency Oracle's are able to detect this and then every sit like and then it's like a very redundant and also very I guess you can say trigger-happy infrastructure right so and even a single emergency Oracle is able to on its own unilaterally trigger an emergency shutdown and there's actually layers beyond that so even if all emergency Oracle's fail MKR holders themselves are actually with like with a relatively small minority able to also directly trigger an emergency shutdown and ultimately all of this together is how we get to that like so you know we can't guarantee with total like total certainty that an attack will be will be you know mitigated with an emergency shutdown but we can take guaranteed with like you know 99.9999 like kind of like as close as you possibly can get to total certainty and this we believe is then a strong enough to turn that it actually makes it just totally economically unviable for someone to try to attack a system in any way right because launching an attack would be very expensive and the probability of success is just it's you know it's it's it doesn't register basically well this is really intense but just so I can be clear that I understood so a single emergency Oracle can trigger a shutdown and also MKR holders can single handedly trigger shutdowns yeah it's a very it's kind of like a like it's kind of like that logic of you know it's better to better to imagine like it's better to see an imaginary tiger then to you know fail to see a real tiger you know so so basically it's you know so it's very easy to to trigger an emergency shutdown and even m'kay and even a small like a minority of em care homeless so actually a very small percentage of I'm here almost able do it now then of course the problem is like there's the flipside to this right and this is imagine shut down it's a very like well I mean it's a it's definitely like its it's not really a desirable thing right I mean ideally it never happens and that's actually also why it's called it used to have a different name but we changed the name to emergency shutdown to really like signify that this is not actually a like a feature you should expect to ever happen but it's more like you know it's almost like a game theoretic device that sits there to prevent stuff from happening but hopefully never has to be used however if it did have to be used there are you know there's a there's a lot of infrastructure in place to ensure that you can actually just do smooth sort of redeployment and and kind of like immediately restart the system and get everything back to normal so in the end what kind of like you have what we call a troll shutdown right so someone like abusing their power of being able straight on emergency shutdown in the middle attack and instead just using it to you know just like cause disruption the what that would really mean for an end user is that in their like in their wallet or something like that they would have like there would be they would have to click a button and they wouldn't even have they wouldn't even need to know why that was like what is going on behind the scenes but then that would be sort of that would be only thing I will really be filled by the end users and and the system and the governance is then able to sort of handle the entire my creation on the back end so yeah so in in its kind of it really is kind of like a you know the nuclear deterrent in a way right it's kind of like mutually assured destruction and ideally it never actually is used in real life except in one circumstances which is upgrades so you also use it when you want to upgrade the system right then you it exists - you can you can shut down the infrastructure and you can transition to a new one and actually when we upgrade from single colloidal diet to multi Clairol die it is by by eventually triggering an emergency shutdown on single metal diet and I'm sorry in the case of a troll shut to emergency emergency shutdown how is that person punished yes so so that's my favorite part so there's actually a whole bunch of like so we also have a whole bunch of game theory around that right but bait I mean but there's basically two types of extras that can trigger an emergency shutdown right there is so there are the centralized emergency Oracle's that are I mean in the long run they are basically going to be institutions of some sort that are chosen by NPR holders and given the power to to trigger an emergency shutdown in the short run they will be multiple sort of multiple independent divisions within the foundation the foundation will run like a very sophisticated security infrastructure that then also has the power to do the emergency shutdown and basically the way to like the way to prevent trolling from you know centralized legal entities is pretty simple it's just using the legal system right so they will actually be like you know there will be legal agreements in place that ensure that someone who abuses that power can actually be you know that can be pursued legally and then the other cells so that's that's like that should serve as a deterrent but of course it's not guaranteed to do so and ultimately but but wait when you say pursued legally like like what law would be broken and there's different jurisdictions so how do you that's just sounds yeah I mean like let's say like I mean this is actually different depending on which jurisdiction the emergency auricle up operates in right so but but typically it would like I mean the basically it will be an agreement between like the emergency Oracle and then something like like well-known entities and institutions in that jurisdiction that are sort of trunk-like you know that the community ultimately trusts that if we look at this entire network here and they all have agreements with his emergency Oracle that if they you know that if they abuse their their emergency Oracle powers they can be you know there are some sort of liability there and then like that's at some point there's there it's going to be enough guarantees in place that the community actually feels comfortable you know wide listing that particular mergency Oracle with the power to trigger an emergency shutdown and then if like of course it's still not it's not guaranteed it really is for sure not going to be abused but then again like the the key is that again if it is actually abused it's still like you know it's not the end of the world it is just like aux annoyance basically and the next time that like once you then have a troll emergency shutdown or such a scenario and you do the redeployment after then of course you just make sure to not make the same mistake right and exclude that emergency Oracle and in general can add more like strict checks and balances on who who guess I have that power yeah I mean one other thing that I was thinking is it's more than just aux annoyance because the people who have collateralized at 3x will recoup much less money than the people who collateralized at one point five so in that regard the people who are kind of being safer with their collateralized at positions they get punished more in that scenario right no I mean if if you do if you go from from one live system and then do an emergency shutdown and then a redeployment process and transition over you will be a Lee Sexton Oh like you click a button and your CDP will be exactly what like it was before there are actually some efficiency losses I thought with the emergency shutdown everybody's position basically well I don't know if it gets liquidated but people only receive one dollar or they don't they only get a value that's equivalent to the amount of dye that they had isn't that correct yeah well it was yes sorry I mean those as an S acid value right so if your dye holder you get value equivalent to the to the dire half if your CD P holder you get value accrual into sort of the you know the free collateral that you have so let's say you have a CD with $200 of collateral and $100 a debt right then you would get $100 of collateral and you would then immediately be able to go to the new system and and use that hundred dollars of collateral to then again collateralize to you know a 200% collateralization CP where you also you take out a hundred debt and and use that to purchase an additional $100 worth of aetherium and okay but rather than having to do this manually there will you know there's a process in place that we will showcase the first time when we do the single collateral to multiple a lot rate where you you actually just click one button once and then all of this stuff happens sort of automatically on the back end and you just see now your your CDP has been migrated over from one system to another okay and I wanted to ask more about the Oracles how often do they give their prices because as we know the crypto prices can be very volatile so if it's you know within long enough time periods then the price can really have very hot even in the interim between when they have to give their price updates yeah so right now they actually give it very often right now it's something like well actually right now they don't they they don't really look at you know they don't have a fixed frequency they just have a like they update any time they see a change of I think it's something like 1% but actually they're sort of deliberately set to be scrambled so it's but India in like Indiana it does give a pretty regular cadence of updates currently which is what actually we I mean which is something like every well it's hard to say actually because it depends on how much the price is swinging so like but I guess it's I mean at least through every minute or something you know like it it stays very up-to-date in that sense but running algorithms essentially that are the Oracles yeah well yeah it's it's um so what is its processes on on servers around the world that basically hook up to various api's of exchanges and then like - to them and then run some sort of algorithm on the different prizes that they see from different exchanges and then ultimately come up with some like some some you know as an aggregate number that they then or you know some some median number or something that they then push into maker and they actually all use different algorithms for you know for the sake of diversification so they all have like a slightly different approach and how they you know how they obtain the the current market price of aetherium one thing oh go ahead yes yeah one thing that's interesting is right we were talking about is how this thing about the price like how there needs to be very frequent Oracle updates right because that was actually also our initial thought right and that's why we engineered the Oracles the way they currently run but what we've since come to realize is that if the opposite is actually true and that the system doesn't actually need very regular Oracle updates and that's why we have that you know we have that whole security mechanism where so basically in multi-level die there will only be updates every hour yeah and and and and fundamental Ike the short version of the Reis like the reason why that is okay to do is because you can come and same for that via the risk parameters basically so you can actually take it into your overall risk assessment that that Oracle isn't in real time but rather is you know has this one hour delay but then the second part is that in multiple idle died the way liquidations are done through auctions and these auctions are like based on like based on on and you know unlike doing the preliminary calculations on it basically it turns out that these these auctions typically should have a duration that's like something like six hours or more basically to really probably you know be able to access all the arbitrary you know arbitrage and liquidity across the whole marketplace in ecosystem so once you have that as a context right if the auctions take six hours anyway then you know like that like an Oracle duration of one hour doesn't actually really change much because that just means you could okay if you were gonna make though their auction duration six hours and the Oracle frequencies one hour you can just cut down the auction duration to five hours instead and you still get sort of an overall into end cycle of six hours okay I'm having a little bit of triple following this so I think though this may relate to a question that I had for the Oracles died went live after the ether flash crash on GD X in the summer of 2017 but at that time let's say that died had been live then what would have happened is that the Oracles all would have thrown out the the ten cent prices and whatever on G Dax because it takes the median is that how that would have worked yeah so I mean so the Oracles actually like so the way the median is implemented on the blockchain on this mark contract side and it's a very simple process right it just takes the median of the of its inputs but actually the Oracle you know clients themselves so like the actual servers that are sitting there and and sort of polling data from different exchanges they actually have a lot more sophisticated signal processing logic built into them so they actually are just able to like detect this is a flash crash just totally ignore it and so of course the problem is the question is when when is something a flash crash and when is a real question that you know basically if if there was you know a major crash across all exchanges at once and it actually was sustained so it wasn't just like it's you know it goes to zero and then it goes back up after like a few seconds a few minutes but if it actually if there's like a huge crash and it's sustained for like you know like many minutes or maybe even an hour or something then at that point this you know there's no way to basically detect that this is just a flash crash and then the system would really just register those numbers so the risk of that of something like that happening basically has to be accounted for in the risk models themselves right because that's like it's something like that can always happen right I mean there are many instances of like true like Black Swan events in the real world where there are SS that just have huge crashes and this really also speaks to the the reason why you gotta have multiple collateral types right you can't keep all your eggs in one basket right but so then let's say that there was something like maybe there was some vulnerability found in the etherium blockchain and suddenly the question of whether etherium itself was viable let's say that that happened like something really even bigger than you know when photonic was rumored to have died and you know whatever just something where it's like oh my god a theory may not work anymore so in that case but I guess if this is just another way of me asking about what you were saying about how you actually don't need frequent updates let's say that that was it was thought that that was the case and then maybe like an hour or two later people realized that for whatever reason this didn't mean didn't mean the end of etherium and suddenly people were buying back ether then so how would why is it that the Oracles don't need to be updated as frequently I still don't understand that point but music I actually don't like I mean I think a better a better example to look at it's just like an asset just crashing extremely fast right and the system not basically registering this fast enough to start triggering liquidations itself so mm-hmm once it starts triggering those liquidations the price is already zero and and maybe if like I mean now I'm sort of making the argument for why why you think that you would have really fast or right I mean if you have ultra fast Oracle's you could imagine a scenario where you know the click rotations actually hadn't during that incredibly fast crash and the system would actually have been able to get some of the money back right because it it would have been lucky enough to still sell to like a greater fool cutter who was willing to to buy all the way down to zero but I mean I get it like and that is that is sort of I mean there's there is a read like there is sort of an argument to be made that this is this is good behavior but there's actually also like there's also reasons why you don't want that right because and that is actually kind of the scenario you talked about right I mean where what if it goes to zero and it is a zero for you know twenty minutes and then it goes back to the price it was before right or some scenario like that right some in some cases you don't want to just like be super neurotic and and immediately react to the data but but the most important thing is that fundamentally not like this doesn't like where whichever way you do it don't really matter in the in the grand scheme of things because make like because mega ultimately has to be able to not just deal with like really really fast crashes but with literally instant crashes right like with a crash that's literally like from one like the government seizes this entire liked organized you know linking all the gold or something that is tokenized in some vault right so the gold-tone is now from the very second that that happens the death token is now totally worthless right so no it doesn't matter how fast Oracle's are the prices is completely has gone to zero now and and that kind of scenario is something the system also needs to be able to handle right and the way you deal with that is really just through the like through the fundamental risk management of the system right so the system must have very diversified collateral and must have you know like different kinds of of stability in it and some of my uncorrelated assets that provide many different types of value and ultimately provide many different types of income streams to mpi holders right so a lot of stability fees that constantly go to NPR to buy and Karen Burnett so that if one of these many different types of collateral suddenly disappears and discuss poof and it's gone this system as a whole is able to absorb that loss so kind of like a you know silt like basically like insurance right like that every everyone everything is paying and then suddenly there's a disaster in one point and basically the payments from every other point sort of makes up for the fact that that there is a huge disaster there's a huge shortfall here but ultimately as a whole this system is able to absorb that and keep going and that also I mean that's also an interesting mechanism right because the way that actually happens in practice is that the MKR token is inflated so just like the nkr token is it's burned and and deflates in good times it actually inflates em and goes out on the market in the event of this kind of massive crash that under collateralize the parts of the system and ultimately that sort of the fundamental dynamic of the governance right it's all about trying to get in fees and good times and by all means and at all costs prevent these kind of like crazy crashes that result in inflation yeah I'm having a lot of flashbacks to the financial crisis and I'm realizing in a way what you're saying reminds me of how everybody says that when there's a market crash the smartest thing to do is to not sell of course everybody does sell which is why there's Michael crush but it's only you know when you sell that you lock in your losses so in the scenarios that you're describing where there's a crash but then there's a recovery it is better to for the system to have not sold however as we were talking about before you don't want the MPR holders to become complacent and so that's why if they do manage the system in a way where it is exposed to these risks and therefore is harmed by the risk that they take then there I'm care Holdings get diluted so okay rune so we're now starting to sort of talk about multi collateral die and yet we're approaching the end of the hour and it's kind of crazy that we have not even discussed that or any of the many other things going on in maker down and I had a feeling this was going to happen actually when I went into the episode because I mean it's the case with pretty much every episode where I generally have more questions than I have time to ask but this episode definitely took the cake and since we had a soundcheck that lasted longer than a typical episode I think I'm just going to make this a two-parter and we will release the second hour with
