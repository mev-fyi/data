not a dividend It's A Tale of Two fun now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet generally speaking airdrops are kind of pointless anyways um my name's trading firms who are very involved I like to eat the ultimate D5 Protocols are the antidote to this problem all right hello everybody and welcome to the chopping block every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry insiders perspectives on the crypto topics of the day so quick intros uh first up we got Tom the D5 Maven and master of memes next up we've got Robert the crypto connoisseur and captain of compound next we've got tarun Giga brain and Grand Puba at Gauntlet and then finally myself I'm aseeb I'm head hype man at dragonfly so the four of us are early stage investors in crypto but I want to caveat and nothing we say here is investment advice legal advice or even life advice so guys it's been um a bit of a bit of a crazy week we've got a lot of since the last time we met a bunch of uh drama especially with respect to hacks that have gone on in the last couple weeks but I want to start um Laura just uh I think yesterday yeah it was yesterday right yesterday just released her Blockbuster interview with doe Quan which if you have not seen highly recommend to go see it it's pretty crazy what did you guys think of the dope Quan interview what were your what were your takeaways I think it's the first time other than that what coinage interview this is like his first like really hard-hitting interview that he's done publicly I'll be the first one to admit that I'm saving this to listen to this weekend that I haven't done Twitter it seems like it's a banger it's definitely a bang right Turner did you not see it either I didn't see it either I've been focusing on things really unbelievable unbelievable unbelievable all right sorry for doing my job okay Tom did you watch it yeah I guess I'm the only one I was really impressed actually by Laura's research and how pointed her questions were she went like really into detail on you know things like what happened with this djend box thing or whatever this I think um I saw someone that's had a tweet that was like take a shot every time doe says the thing people don't understand and I was like I think it's like a very apt description of the interview how many shots were you by the end I mean you're talking you know uh at least in the teens so it's just like I I in some ways empathize because I think what was actually happening or how Tara actually worked and how it's presented publicly were like very very different but at the same time I didn't get a lot of sense of remorse from from Joe in the sense that um he's like yeah it is what it is and we acted certain ways a lot of it is feels very hearsay where he's like oh this wasn't these were our funds it was just something else so I I don't have all the information on on who was actually doing what as sort of the Terra claps went down but yeah it was it was super I guess informative and just entertaining to watch honestly like Laura really kind of grilled dough it's definitely great TV there are a lot of good accusatory moments on the main stage which were they're fun it was fun to watch I I did come away feeling very unsure because you know you'd expect there to be some point where do I mean one you have to ask like why did doe agree to do this right like he's got active court case again so we've got criminal cases against him uh in addition to civil cases so it does feel like you know what what was his lawyer thinking in agreeing to let him do this uh or maybe you didn't consult his lawyer it it seemed like he sort of had an answer for everything and some of them were very clear-cut like hey you know for example Laura was grilling him of like hey it looked like your block explorer was censoring certain transactions where you guys were minting uh sdt for yourselves in order to you know do something or other and he was like no that is not true our block explorers didn't censor anything in fact it's all open source you can go check it out yourself and so I'd love to see the fact finders go and kind of take all the explanations he gave for each individual element and see whether or not he was telling the truth if in fact he was and supposedly there's a there's an auditor who's going through the lfg books um who's going to go through all the stuff after the fact and actually verify some of the claims that have been made into the arguments between himself tfl and you know some of the accusers I mean hopefully we'll get some clarity on was doe telling the truth about these things personally I can believe that he he may be telling the truth and that at the end of the day when somebody gets put on public trial the way the dough has there's always going to be you know innuendos and kind of you know random things that kind of look weird that you know ever I'm sure every single crypto project if you like turn over enough stones and you like paint them in enough light they look very suspicious they look very strange they look very like somebody trying to profit off a protocol when you just see transactions Unchained you have no contact so you don't know what they are but I can also believe that maybe there were some genuine Foul Play but I kind of feel like the fact that he's coming out publicly and really directly answering almost every single question that Laura answered to him means that he's he doesn't seem to be afraid so it feels to me like um you know our suspicion that we that we've mentioned earlier that like this might be mostly people trying to basically say like look we invested in this stable coin that blew up and we want to find somebody to like go you know kind of you know nail them to a cross and say this is this person's fault um and it kind of feels like that maybe is what's happening with doe we'll get a better answer to that once we have you know the the full accounting of what happened with tfl um but honestly my takeaway from that interview is that he seemed very confident in his answers he seemed to be pretty self-assured that that um you know he he there wasn't any Foul Play well I'm I'm excited for the forensics and the Auditors and like that the truth of open source analysis to sort of come through and like you know shine a light on like all clear or oh man like no one knew this you know and the thing is like even in all clear is not being all clear for most people you know so I imagine for the Korean government where he's currently you know he's got a criminal indictment you know for them I doubt well maybe I I don't know I I don't want to speculate but my guess is that there will be people who want to go after regardless of whether all the accusations that have been thrown around around malfeasance or unjust enrichment turn out to be false even then I'm sure there are going to be people who uh try to find some way to pin the disaster as some kind of criminal Affair but I I did take his point and he made this point very clearly which something that that um I think I've stated on the podcast before that I think it's very important to differentiate between failure and fraud they're not the same thing you know the the he he made an interesting defense of the of the basis cache the basis cache Revelation as well which is the claim that look I I was never really involved like it was two other developers from tfl I gave them my blessing to go and build this thing I should post it on the on the telegram account for a little while maybe you know clearly I shouldn't have done that that was a that was a stupid thing to do but um you know it's like there were a lot of people who built stuff on Tara that I helped support I'm not responsible for every individual thing they do and I I didn't see basis cash as the failure of Terra they're two different things I wasn't even working on basis cache and so I I think you made a fair point at a reasonable defense of now if he was right about that then yes I think it's a it's a reasonable defensive the terror sorry the basic cash story yeah there I also feel like there are no Knives Out for sort of the sub-promoters of some of this stuff like you know the people who are running those like anchor SUVs or you know the people who are actually running those front ends that were taking in you know ACH money and like putting an anchor and like I feel like we've heard really nothing about those people um because I don't get the impression it was actually dough going out and you know promoting people saying hey you should take all your money out of the bank and put it into anchor there's all these other people and Joe was just sort of building the saying it you know mostly building uh uh Luna rather yeah it's very clear though that the the Crux of what the Crux of what rubs you the wrong way was his arrogance about the whole thing and that was one of the that I felt like that was one of the real highlights of the interview was her talking about like do you regret the way that you spoke about this stuff the way that you followed people the way that you you showed this kind of Limitless confidence that gave people confidence that there was no way that Terror was going to fail and it seemed like he I don't know it's hard to tell what's real Contrition and what's like okay you know I've been counseled by my by my lawyer to express Contrition so I don't know it's clear that this is not the last word yeah it has a non-watcher um did uh did he actually reveal anything about his whereabouts no he was very intentional that it's like look um it's very unsafe for me to mention my whereabouts because I've been targeted everywhere that I have mentioned my whereabouts which I can also believe it did look like he was in some sort of Bunker slash club though so it looked it looked pretty nice that's true it looked interesting he did mention that he's very didn't see he's very into building furniture and I was like did he build that thing behind him that's like really that's uh did not peg him for somebody who's into building furniture usually you expect more stability from furniture than we got out of Tara so but um foreign I didn't know you ever had uh enough of a funny bone to make a joke like that every now and again it comes out when I'm talking about Tara you never know what might happen um all right all right so speaking of disasters uh we should talk about the hacks that took place over the last couple weeks so the the the first one which is probably the most ridiculous hack that I have seen in a very long time was the mango Marcus hack so quick background so mango markets uh one of the biggest markets on Solana one of the biggest D5 protocols so this mango markets I believe there was both like a purpose protocol but also lending mango markets basically they had like 160 million ish tvl uh and there was an attack that took place against them by an initially Anonymous address that basically what they did is they bought a bunch of mango tokens and then manipulated mango on spot markets to massively increase the price of mango which made the protocol think that they had a huge amount of collateral and then use that huge amount of collateral they borrowed all the real money in mango meaning like the usdc and the soul and whatever they barred all that out mango of course then collapsed on the spot markets after they stopped buying I think they used like 10 million dollars to buy up uh this huge amount of spot mango to massively shoot up the price because it was very low looking 30 and then mango markets the mango price collapses and by that time they've already borrowed all the collateral out of the protocol and basically sees everything besides the mango tokens so as a result mango markets was totally drained then so okay you're on Solana Solana doesn't have a huge amount of TDL anymore you know it's like you know between 1 and 1.5 billion I believe um and so trying to fence like all the money in mango is pretty hard on Solano right there aren't a lot of places for you to hide and so what happens is that the the protocol hacker ends up giving a governance proposal to the protocol where he proposes to return the majority of the money but to keep 40 million for himself as a finder's fee as well as a promise not to prosecute him and this proposal ends up passing governance which is absolutely insane then shortly after the the proposer of the the actual hacker ends up being doxxed and so we now know who the hacker is the hacker is this guy obvious Avi Abraham Eisenberg uh he he claimed in his tweet I was involved with a team that operated a highly profitable trading strategy last week I believe all our actions were legal open market actions using the protocol as designed even if the development team did not fully anticipate the consequences of setting parameters the way they are so uh he's now become a little bit of a micro celebrity within D5 um you know it's like this kind of like Ken Bone kind of character I almost feel like we're like now he's like kind of playing it up in the character and he's he's kind of honing it what what what did you guys think about Good Old Avi and his mango markets exploit well I'll start with the one side perspective there's obviously a number of people on Twitter who like view this guy as a folk hero I'm going to take the opposite side which is you know what he did was Market manipulation whether you believe that it's legal or illegal you know my view is that it is illegal uh as clear Market manipulation uh it's also deeply unethical and even though coda's law he completely violated the expectation of the protocol the users the community and you know you can Rebrand a hack or an exploit however you'd like you can Rebrand a hacker or an exploit into a profitable trading strategy I can try to Rebrand bank robbery or you know some other horrible crimes as profitable trading strategies it doesn't make them right and it doesn't make them legal and you know at the end of the day I think what he has demonstrated is that you know as of right now you know he has basically robbed the protocol in broad daylight and just bragging about it and it's really curious to see where it goes from here you know I think one part of him is correct in that you know every protocol has to address the risk parameters assuming that some black hat [ __ ] is gonna try to exploit it right and it's a great wake-up call for every defy project on every single blockchain to take this moment as a wake-up call there was already a copycat attack for you know the world's tiniest you know borrowing protocol on cello where there it was like the moo token or something like that Mulan markets yeah like you know imagine it was like you know a market way smaller than mango but the same exact construct that was already attacked in the exact same way where mu which had even less liquidity you know was used to attack it it's a wake-up call for every D5 protocol every defy Team every D5 Community they're just assumed that some black hat is going to be attacking you what's going to slow them down well you know conservative risk management both Technical and Market risk but also you know this one those things where I think the community itself has to say like hey it's not cool or you know exchanges have to say like hey we don't want your money like that you've robbed from a protocol you know like there need to be more of a community response in general where it's going to continue and it's going to escalate you know this guy is shopping around you know similar trades to hedge funds being like capitalize me and I'm going to go after bigger fish by robbing protocols again like at some point this has to stop and like either it stops from the government coming into the sector or it stops from like the entire Community saying like dude like no like this isn't like a good thing even if you call it a profitable trading strategy so I think he sucks I guess there are a couple things that are worth pointing out with regards to this attack and more like General Oracle manipulation stuff the first thing is that you know the beginning of this bull cycle started with an asset that is probably everyone on this podcast would agree is a hundred percent a security and and not even a question which is ftt uh and it started with ftt being this thing or an exchange that's a new exchange bootstrapped itself to basically allow people to get really cheap collateral early like by basically giving people this token that was really really cheap and you could use this collateral on the exchange that way you know basically it's the price of the collateral went up you now could borrow more you take more margin you can take more risk and that was sort of a way of being like hey you don't have to put your ether stable coins here you can get this token that theoretically gets fees from this exchange which is centralized Hong Kong company burning its fees into the token the beginning of a bull market it's always actually if you time it correctly and you're making a new Exchange allowing people to re-hypothecate off your own asset that is sort of implicitly or explicitly getting fees from the venue that you're using is a good way of bootstrapping these uh mango certainly and certainly did the same thing right like Mango's token actually if I remember correctly the token launched before the protocol was running uh I forget it's very close though like I forget if it was like right before right after but the token was there very early and one of the easiest ways especially in a bull market to increase usage of your protocol is to say hey we're going to have like crazy risk parameters if you use the mango token as collateral and uh you know if you're a number go up land well liquidation probabilities obviously a very degenerate form of risk management but it is a good strapping tactic right and so I think if you assume that it's a bootstrapping tactic you also have to understand that bootstrapping tactics have a lifetime and you have to update your parameters as a function of market conditions right you can't you can't just like believe that this bootstrapping thing is going to work forever You could argue the same thing happened to FDT why is SBF Shilling ftt nowadays to try to get people to catch the fee burn I mean it's a very similar thing there's a while you didn't need to do that and now it actually is like kind of important to the stability of their exchange given how much collateral is denominated in ftt and FTX right the difference is a centralized Exchange if something like this happens can just step in and be like kick out the user right in this case you use the same type of bootstrapping growth hack that the centralized exchange uses but you have none of the ability to do a Reclamation in the same way and so I think there was a lot of carelessness on that side outside of what you would call the attacker or hacker from the perspective that both Soul land and mango have been sort of pretty as a irresponsible was like monitoring their protocols right we've seen both of them have the same type of problem and I think a lot of this has to do with a trying to make your own exchange security slash token uh used as collateral which again works on the way up but on the way down or like even even mildly on the way down you probably should be starting to tampen and not let people do that uh and I think there's there's a lot to be said about the fact that you do need to dynamically manage these things the other thing that's actually quite interesting is the Insurance Fund for mango was also insolvent uh not just actually the the loans that were so the Insurance Fund is is supposed to cover these insolvencies if if they occur um but the problem is the Insurance Fund was also completely denominated 98 in in mango itself obviously when mango crashes because of this type of thing the Insurance Fund can't cover any insolvency because it's crashing exactly at the same time that everything is going wrong and so there's a lot of fallacies here I'm not going to show that one that makes sense I do not realize the Insurance Fund was in mango that's insane I'm not going to show my own book about how you should avoid these pitfalls but you know that's awesome but if you want to know how to avoid these pitfalls give to ruin a call yeah let tarun convert your mango into USD coin all right go there you go um yeah I what really struck me about this is I agree with those points obviously Taran um in terms of you know yes having your own native asset as collateral in the beginning is kind of a nice bootstrapping mechanism but you got to move Beyond it especially when you've got serious capital and you want to build this table protocol the thing against the thing about this whole Saga I mean the attack itself is pretty straightforward right it's not a genius attack it's something that a lot of people have thought about before um the the thing that's so striking was just how Brazen the whole thing is and like how Gangster the the like the proposal was of like okay I'm gonna give you back enough money to make your users whole let me keep the rest also don't you know like don't at me like the idea that like you can also wave a criminal prosecution by Adele vote is also like insane like I I'd love to see what happens when you know I don't know where did you know where this person lives was he an American I believe he's in the southern district of New York oh okay that's a good it's a good place to be making these Dow proposals from I I mean this seems so absurd the part of the other news that uh we didn't mention earlier so he actually made a bet a side bet with somebody from Twitter who bet that he would not be charged so um oh according to Laura he's actually in Israel um okay so maybe I look I don't know the Israeli police are pretty intense too but I I don't I don't know what I expect to happen I don't know enough about Israeli law here but um yeah I think it's gonna be it's it's gonna be uh it's gonna be rough I don't think we've ever heard of um globally accepted non-prosecution agreements in history but I'm I'm a little dubious yeah it's an interesting one and of course like there were Americans who had money in mango and so I'm sure U.S prosecutors will find some way to establish jurisdiction over this dude especially given like one of the best things that you can do to get you know uh uh to get law enforcement after you is to brag about your take and to make headlines which this guy has managed to do you know doubly so so um yeah this this seems uh this seems just like so Brazen that this is not going to end well for this gentleman hopefully hopefully I'll just say hopefully I mean I don't ever wish anybody like ill but like this is one of those like such Brazen crimes that you don't want it to become a pattern yeah and look I mean the idea the idea that like well the code lets you do this therefore it's legal is like I I think that's just obviously not how anything Works ever like if that were true then every hack on chain would be legal which obviously they're not so in which we know because people have been prosecuted before for hacking people on trade so um I I I think this is just an obvious Punk so we'll see what happens um but of course the gears of Justice turn much more slowly than the uh the new cycle of Twitter but that was not the only hack that took place in the last couple weeks we had another massive hack one of the largest hacks ever on BNB chain so this one was pretty uh also pretty insane so what happened was that there was a um Let me let me try to follow this because it's a pretty it's a pretty intense one um so what happened was that there was basically a vulnerability in bnb's uh um relayer Bridge which allows you to move funds from binance into BSC and basically what the attacker did is they were able to forge arbitrary messages for sort of pretending that they were relaying sort of these cross-chain transactions of minting BNB uh and they were able to Mint 2 million BNB which is worth hundreds of millions of dollars using this using this bug um basically I think it was like in some Cosmos SDK kind of iavl tree module that wasn't verifying proofs correctly and so uh using this bug they're able to quickly mint 2 million BNB take this 2 million BMB deposit into Venus borrow just kind of like the same thing as having mango borrow as many other assets as they could Bridge those assets into other chains and then basically run uh the assets that they had on other chains they tried to you know make a run for it and try to go sell them deposit a curve whatever onto other blockchains So within uh I think within like a couple hours of this hack BNB chain shut down so kind of they unilaterally decided we are going to Halt the chain I'm sorry BNB chain is going down for maintenance which is kind of insane obviously it's all the time what's the big deal it's a lot of conflict attack so that's why it keeps going down um so the BNB chain was down until basically they could stop and freeze the actors uh of course they you know they were able to get away with about 100 something million tokens that they'd already bridged out but I think on BNB chain I believe they're now doing governance votes to decide what to do with the hackers frozen assets um once they once they got BNB chain up and running again so I don't know that we have any information about the attacker or um any speculation about who they might be but this was clearly a very sophisticated attack and it was one that ended up resulting in a very large um cve for the entire uh Cosmos ecosystem that caused a a patch to get pushed out I think last week to pretty much every cause of SDK chain so again although the exploit itself was really really large it seems like the attacker made off with on the order of 100 something million I don't know it's it's clearly been a bad couple weeks for blockchain security um did you guys have any Reflections on the BNB chin hack well the BNB chain one is interesting for two reasons one it's example number 712 of bridges are hard bridges are like right now the weak point in security um for a lot of these things but the thing that was technically interesting about it is that it required some pretty deep diligence and like cryptographic understanding this was not a script kiddie attack right this was far more in-depth and complex than like anything obvious doing on Mango markets right you know probably required a lot of planning and Analysis and finance chain was probably the biggest opportunity to burn what amounts to be almost a zero day the whole ecosystem that's vulnerable has figured out how to patch it and in doing so they've basically upgraded you know a lot of the cryptographic libraries for the entire ecosystems industry as a whole and this is amount to in some ways like burning a zero right um so hopefully this can get replayed again or there's not the opportunity to this is the one time we'll see it and you know the deep cryptographers in the world can learn from this and prevent this from ever happening again and the rest of us users will just continue to use blockchains a little bit safer and netnet it might be a good thing for the ecosystem you know after everyone gets their money back and at the end of the day 100 million dollars is like a day's worth of trading profit for binance so like you know they'll cover it whereas something like mango like I don't know if anyone's gonna be better off on this I'm surprised they like almost let this happen in a way like I thought the whole idea with BSC is it's like finances sandbox and like nothing can go wrong other than maybe losing some money on like a bad trade and like it seems like it would have been somewhat simple to just like check some invariance and then like given that everything is co-located anyway and there's only like a few validators just like shut down the chain if something's going wrong but in a scenario like you have all the downsides of a decentralized permissionless system um but like you know it seems like the upsides are not as as present yeah there really wasn't a lot of defense and depth here but I think it's also pretty hard to do in blockchains especially when like these third-party Bridges because I believe they exited through third-party Bridges right so if it's not like a BNB Bridge it's pretty hard for BNB to be like oh something weird happened we're gonna freeze all our bridges so if they're using other Bridges then you know there's there's kind of No Way Out yeah I guess I was thinking the fact that you know it's finance's own bridge and they run so many of the validators like you would think would be simple enough to to have something detecting because this was not an atomic attack which is I think always so difficult I mean it's impossible to defend against this was similar to Mango markets a multi-step multi-transaction process um and so you would think it would be simpler to see that as it's happening and shut down the chain if they voted to do so yeah I know that I I can see that I mean having an automated change shutdown is pretty drastic because I imagine you'd get a lot of false positives so that's like a really scary thing to have running in the background I do agree with you like I mean my understanding of the attack was that like you know bnb's actual bridge and I don't understand the mechanics here so I might be getting some stuff wrong but it seemed like you know these are proofs being relayed on chain which basically means that this is primarily an on-chain Bridge it's not a multi-sig type Bridge right like you're actually submitting proofs of uh of blocks onto the blockchain so if that's the case then it's pretty hard for there to be like a secondary mechanism that goes in and like you know automatically turns things off or freezes things but again I add another detail so I'm very much speculating here I mean this was actually like a problem in tenderness um tendermen had this particular sort of Merkle tree that was not like didn't correctly check all edge cases and so basically what happened is like you know for I guess the listeners Merkel tree is a Merkle tree is like how is one of the ways you represent sort of a compact proof of a block you take a set of transactions and then you hash each transaction then you make a hash of the hashes and you kind of group them up into your tree and I think effectively what happened was if you have a empty hash uh as your neighbor there was some way you could get the proof to not actually check that and usually you know that that would be like an error so what you could do is you could insert a transaction that would always return true when the Merkel proof was checked even though it like never actually generated you didn't have to generate a signature for it and so I think this is actually just like a generic thing Cosmos I'm not sure if it was actually fixed outside of this incident or if this actually is like a CV like a serious bug in like all tenderman implementations that part I I didn't check enough about but the idea is you basically could insert this transaction that would always everyone would if they're running stock tendermint would validate as true even though it had no signatures on it um I see so it wasn't at a smart contract level it was in the consensus level no it wasn't yeah exactly the Merkel tree which is like that's why it's actually quite a news it's Robert's point it's definitely not like yeah it's not like hey I just like swept the order book of mango I did think it was it was kind of funny that you know there's a governance debate about whether or not to freeze the seized funds in addition to the patch that's going to you know that has fixed the bug so you know maybe we will see a a CC's Vision coming out of this which is uh yeah leads the Hacked funds untouched but I feel like I feel like every chain goes is at some point where there's some catastrophic failure that leaves a lot of funds isolated and they have to decide whether or not to you know freeze those or to reclaim them I imagine part of the reason why they had to do that was just the veneer of decentralization you know because like everyone knows what the answer is the answer is like yeah you you freeze the guy but um if you do it themselves and it kind of looks like oh BNB controls it you know whatever they do they shut down the street and as soon as it happens no no no no come on Robert don't be like that don't be like that no of course not BNB is so decentralized but but actually one one funny thing is that um you know the the role that these governance votes are playing is like um you know we we maybe we didn't fully democratize Finance but we definitely democratized company boards because we now have like five million people in the forums fighting about something that's usually like a board decision right like this freezing thing is very much like this happened it would be like HSBC deciding whether to freeze some account right and it'd be like if it was so bad it would go to the board or if it was Credit Suisse it would never reach the board the same thing was true with the mango markets of you know a bunch of people in governance for deciding whether to take the uh it's interesting that we could drive as board votes yeah like the most boring thing that no one ever wants to do it's true it's true the things people do for decentralization man so yeah it's been it's been it's been a bad couple weeks and uh a a couple ridiculous hacks and some some very ridiculous governance decisions that have been made that was not the only drama though uh there was there was another piece of drama that actually we discussed on The Chopping Block on a a special episode that we did over the weekend because magic Eden announced that they are no longer going to be enforcing royalties and that they're going to zero fees so this caused a giant stir a bunch of people got really mad on Twitter saying that magician is anti-royalty either so evil while you're doing this and so we end up doing a debate over the weekend with uh Legion Laura uh joshuon from Magic Eden and myself do any of you guys see the debate no nobody saw well I'm waiting my week this weekend this weekend okay of course that's when you watch all your watch all your Unchained content you'd like to save it up okay good good I'm good I work during the week and I watch on Saturdays look some some of us have uh jobs that have been walking obviously okay all right all right our Founders you guys are visas okay okay sorry I didn't mean to assume I didn't realize how busy you guys were sorry I what what how did I even me Tom did you at least watch it you didn't watch it I feel like I'm living the debate you know every day at dragonfly so I don't need it guys oh my God all right fine well whatever we can relive the debate in real time by talking about it so what did you guys think about magic 8 and shutting down royalties okay so did you know I didn't see the debate but I have some strong feelings on this so one is I think the biggest misunderstanding in all of nft and crypto and like when you talk to people outside of crypto they're like oh wow like the royalties can be baked into the nft it's like no they can't be baked like like and I think what people are realizing now is that there aren't royalties baked into the nft like you can't like actually at an nft level in force royalties where someone gets a fraction of the fee every time it trades it's been something like conceived of really at the marketplace level and socially enforced not through the immutable laws of blockchain technology that being said you know I think people are discovering that what they thought was true about the world is not true and that royalties are not a part of nfts royalties are part of you know artists requests and desires and marketplaces supporting that but a Marketplace wants to get volume and win so the easiest way to do that is to make it the lowest cost place to trade you know if you can you know go from a five percent feed to a zero percent fee that's a lot for a trade right especially if you're an nft person you're gonna flip it you know like a couple times you might sell it by like those fees really add up and so you know it makes a lot of sense for magic Eden to attempt to get rid of fees now there's really two things that are interesting here one is and I think this is actually like really productive for the whole space and I hope everyone might regrets this Shifting the fee from the seller to the buyer now I think when you're thinking about a royalty or an artist payment makes a lot more sense for the fee to be on the purchaser as opposed to the seller of an nft and I actually think that this part of their action was really well thought out um I think you know if there is going to be a royalty fee it should be paid by the buyer whether or not it's optional right it should add to the price and be a buyer premium in effect why well this is somebody entering a Marketplace and a community um there's somebody like beginning their Journey with the artist not someone ending their Journey with the artist it should really be an entry fee as opposed to an exit fee so I think this piece of magic Edens uh change was actually quite good and quite sound which is saying if there is a royalty it goes to the buy side not the sell side not somebody leaving the community goes the person joining the community well second you know making it voluntary you know I honestly expect that in the absence of other tools most users are going to choose not to pay it you know most people are somewhat greedy you know most people are pennies I I assume they're going to see a lot of and the data will tell the story but I assume they're going to get a lot of traction and a lot of people setting that to zero in their like account setting because like they're doing it at the account level and you can literally be like oh I default to zero like a lot of people are going to default to zero I I want to hear the rest of it but I so we actually have the data now because it's been live for a few days okay um but by the way one one quick question um this sort of buyer versus seller fee thing is there an analog in house purchases like I guess it's like the homeowner association gets paid by the buyer or so because like I'm thinking of it like in in normal liquid assets there has to be some equivalent kind of thing right yeah the so the seller pays the fees of a house generally I mean there might be taxes on the buyer but like the seller's paying the commissions and the Brokers and all that isn't that fake though because like the seller is like gonna pass on the fee to the buy like it's gonna affect the price right like does it matter who's paying the fee good question I don't know I don't know I don't know because it's kind of like tax incidents right like in economics people study tax incidents which is like you tax one side but they raise their price which means that you know like it doesn't like a lot of times it doesn't actually right anyway what's Happening Here Yeah so basically free change the vast majority of uh Magic eating sales had a royalty involved um so this is looking at non non-zero royalties versus uh total sales so 80 90 percent of sales had royalty after the 14th was when the change went in um you're down to like let's say 10 15 of uh trades having a royalty so I do want to get the dollar value for this but it's pretty interesting that you can like just check out the data you know immediately after after the change and see what you know people's revealed preferences which is they usually don't want to pay um royalties so but since the change volume has gone up a lot right because I heard that watch trading has gotten really intense on Magic heat and because it's zero fee that's what people are saying but um I mean the number of Trades is the same so I don't know where that's coming from unless people are just you know trading some insane dollar amount on those trades and sort of marking up uh the so what is the what is the top line uh that's just number of Trades yeah ignore the final day yeah the final line just because the days of today yeah yeah I see people or pinching pennies the data speaks for the reality that was an excellent chart Tom thank you for sharing that thank you um I um I think the interesting thing is like you know people 's narratives I think is that like oh there's a magic even clone that has no royalties and therefore they're using that to undercut magic Eden and they're losing market share and therefore they have to be competitive in that and do that but in reality if you look on like Solana really the main competitor um in terms of a computer you know nft is Haiti swap which is like a pseudo swap competitor on Magic Eden which of course does not have royalties but I think even independent of the royalty and and fee discussion which is like a totally different model so I think they're up to like 25 of Solana nft volume depending on the day so I feel like there's like so many factors that are kind of difficult to disentangle here which is like okay do these nftamms out compete nutritional order book exchanges is it the lower fees that they charge 50 bips versus 2.5 is it like the you know Creator fees uh or the royalties that are like allowing them now compete them and I feel like it's just difficult to sort of separate all those things because you're not really comparing you know like for like with one variable changed for sure what I think we need to see and you know I actually this over the weekend me and um former uh CTO of openc put out a request for startup to explore this concept you know what I think has to change people have to want to pay royalties um it has to be like a positive thing where you're like excited to pay a royalty to an artist and support an artist there's a lot of you know examples of people like patreon et cetera like being super excited to support artists and like being willing to pay that royalty but I think if that doesn't exist they're going to pay zero as Tom has shown so I think there needs to be more tools for creators more ways to track royalty payments more ways to like analyze wallets and figure out who is like supporting the artist or not um and I think there's going to be actually a Renaissance at some point whether it's like 12 months from now or five years from now or two weeks from now but at some point I think what's going to happen is some nft artists or creators are going to figure out a way to get people really excited about this and say like okay all the people that are paying the royalty you know and not like opting out get to go to vcon or whatever you know or they get like you know the airdrop and the ones who don't don't get the airdrop like I think people are going to figure this out and I think like the end state of this whole Magic Eden you know let's rip away the royalties to build markets everything the end state of all this is going to be there are royalties going to artists and there is an on-chain economy and like artists will benefit from the existence of royalties and they might not be like programmatically enforced at the Smart contract that created the nft level but they're going to be like enforced through other means that are like probably even more exciting and more like Advanced and more customizable and allow artists to be even more creative and instead of just being this like oh we get five percent of every trade hooray like that is our road map it's going to be like really more creative outcomes where it'll be like you know experiences and like very different like interactions because of these royalty streams and I think net Ned's can be really cool I I can believe that I think if you see creators innovating on more reasons why you want to stay within the sort of lit economy of the pro-royalty exchange and this is one thing that we talked about near the end of the debate is that you know Kyle made the suggestion that having these no royalty exchanges kind of means that like okay now it's really in your interest as a Creator to push people into your own platform to trade and kind of build liquidity and have a Marketplace specific to you and your nfts or your content because there we talk about royalties right like as though there's a separate concept but really royalties are just like an extra platform fee if there was only one platform let's say openc you just had 100 market share on every chain then the royalty is just like an extra platform fee and if you own the platform then there is no royalty there's just the platform fee right and so you know in reality like royalties are they are kind of a weird concept because if you think about it that way imagine you just had one nft Marketplace that was open C they owned everything okay and when you have a royalty basically what you're saying is that okay openc when you sell this product please charge a margin you know if you let's say let's say your openc is five percent and then you charge ten percent okay so you're saying please charge a margin of 15 on every purchase and give me two-thirds of it now in normal business would be like wait what why are you telling me what percentage of well first of all why are you tell me what margin to charge second why are you telling me what percentage of it you get like no I tell you what percentage you get or we negotiate right like that that's how in normal business exchange of value takes place but royalties are all dictated by the Creator right which is kind of it's just not how any other business would work any other business a Creator would say okay if you want to list my assets I I get two percent otherwise you get it or don't get it and they say oh well what about one percent you say oh well okay one one and a half or blah blah or whatever it's really important I'll add this extra thing on top I'll give you exclusivity that that's the kind of thing that happens is like a bargaining but in nfts it's like okay if you say 12 royalty on this thing The Exchange just enforces it even though like you know they're they're charging a customer 17 net or you know whatever whatever the the you know net of the actual fees are on the exchange and giving the artist almost you know the vast majority of what they're charging the customer that it's kind of weird and I think it's not a stable equilibrium right that's not the way it's not the way that like an actual functioning Market would work um and so I do think that it's sensible to think that um there is going to be a way that artists are going to be able to command more of a premium and capture a bigger share of secondary trading but I don't think it's going to work the way it works now which is the artist says seven percent and then all the exchanges enforce it on their behalf it is uh I mean speaking of people not realizing royalty's not being enforced programmatically there's also this weird component of like you know it's like open C doesn't even look at the royalty like metadata or like a component of the nft contract you just said it manually on openc so it's like it's all just sort of like you know this just huge sort of misnomer and misconception around like what is actually going on with royalties it's literally just like a website you know has this feature and and that's kind of where we're at I mean not that we can learn from like the incredibly horrific world of Music where like royalties are incredibly complicated and shitty and horrible but like you know they did sort of figure out at least the user experience of it which is like I go to a record store I buy a record like I'm not thinking about royalties it's 12 you know and like all the rest happens behind the scenes um for the user experience I mean one of the things that um if this weekend did you listen to the debate uh one thing that it came up in the debate was uh Laura I I look forward to getting your comments one of the things that Laura was bringing up is that like look one of the reasons why royalties are so important is that look if you're an artist like so I was I was suggesting like look there are other ways to align interests between artists and their collections right one of the ways of course is like what yoga Labs did which is you meant a bunch of nfts you keep some back for yourself it's like you know a company you you sell some to investors in your own equity and by owning equity in yourself like over time you can sell it later and you know capture some of your upside um and I do agree that's one of the core things about royalties that's great is it creates this alignment between creators and their products even after they're already sold you know Laura made the point that as a Creator as an artist you know you don't necessarily have the the privilege financially to be able to hold on to some of your own collection not just sell it because like you might need to make rent you maybe you don't you don't have the ability to sit on your own assets or like kind of take this long day to bet on yourself and so royalties are a way to allow yourself to get this fee stream over time that that you know it's very different than having to to get this payment all upfront and this is an argument that I've heard now from a few other people talking to me after the um the debate and I I I I totally disagree with this framing for a couple reasons one I was chatting with somebody in Twitter DMS was telling me about this nft Marketplace on Solana that allows you not only to sell your nft but also to tokenize the royalties and sell the royalties and of course if you look at normal artists right like regular artists in the world when they sign a deal with a record label they sell both the IP and the royalty stream right they keep a small portion of the royalty stream but very often they sell a huge portion of it up front right so like 90 of the royalties and 90 of the IP or the 100 of the IP goes to the record label and you know artists willingly sign those kinds of deals I mean like look it's it sucks maybe they wish they're better options maybe we wish that artists had more bargaining power but in reality like if somebody wants to get an upfront payment instead of taking a long data thing like basically saying that like look an artist shouldn't be able to do that they shouldn't be able to sell their royalties and they should be forced to keep the royalties and get paid over time to me that's basically like saying okay artists need to have for they need they need to engage in like a forced Savings Program that's effectively what you're telling them is that you can't take the payment up front you have to you know kind of divvy out the payment over time if you had yoga Labs do a drop you know some new nft collection and they said not only are we selling the collection we're also selling off the royalties right anybody can buy the royalty stream for this collection a lot of people buy it it would be worth it'd be worth quite a lot of money it might be worth a amount of money that's even comparable to the entire collection right because if you just look at how much money Yuga Labs makes from each collection versus how much they make from all the royalties but a lot of them it's like 50 50. for for Board apocal of itself it's like 80 20. most of the money was in the royalties not in the initial mint um and so I think it's not as simple as just royalties are a way for artists to save money or to get fees over time I think it is the the core thing about royalties that makes them special is the alignment between the artist and what they create after the fact but I think you know to your point uh Robert there are other ways to do that I think that's ultimately what people are gonna have to innovate and either one you need to create a platform and own the platform and get people to want to pay royalties because they want to be part of your community to create extra perks or extra reasons to stay within the economy of your royalties or three just create a culture of patronage that's kind of what a royalty is it's like if a world is unforced then basically it's patronage and not everybody's gonna be a patron right some people will some people are will sign up for your patreon just to support you they don't even need anything right they might it might be easier to get them to do it if they if you offer perks but if you don't offer perks people will do it um and I think right now that seems to be the three different directions you can take if you want the concept of royalties to persist I would definitely buy the board ape royalty IP right token but not not a security I can't say whether I mean if the nft itself oh that's a good question is the um is the nft less of a security than the re than the royalty stream because the royalties I'm sure a function of health and the nfts are traded right hey The Entity is our okay even if you don't like [Laughter] that this 1933 law with very which was very underspecified has the ability to have gradations of being like continuously security and like you can compare one thing being more of a security or less of security it's not like that very binary and the way you're talking about it basically suggests it rounds up to being a security regardless yeah that's fair I just don't know that practically speaking it's any less of a security than the nfts themselves would be given that in all these cases you're kind of hey is your health security is it I'm not sure are housing securities okay I I I guess not then I don't know um I think the argument for the fee stream is it like it does sort of represent some like common Endeavor that yeah but like why would that be more so than an individual nft because the nft is actually your your your your expected future profit relies on the actual speculative Market existing not true it assumes a function of the Velocity so the fee stream is revenue so in the how we test it's like that's the common Enterprise with future expectation of profit matches the fee stream much more than like oh the speculative Market could like not exist hold on that seems oh that seems very arbitrary right like if you're buying an FPS because you're hoping to take a profit no no look I'm not a lawyer obviously but like the monkey like it's not what else is all right all right I mean look nominally I agree with you on the face of it it's like okay one is a picture of a monkey one is a financial product right so like I think in a court of law a lawyer would be like yeah that looks like a security that one looks like a monkey but um I think practically speaking I'm gonna die on this hill practically speaking I think they they seem very similar to me uh because both depend on the efforts of the Creator and the community both of them like one is a function of price the other function of velocity both of those are things that are ultimately you know like the Creator either can or cannot influence them depending on the approach the Creator takes right some creators don't do anything to try to create velocity or create price appreciation some try to create both right some try to make both increase but they're a function of each hold on let's say let's take an example let's say it's not an nft on a blockchain let's say it's an actual piece of art on the wall and you know let's say who's your favorite artist doesn't matter let's just say super art okay super artist makes a piece of art and says hey I'm going to sell the royalty stream on this to haseeb and like every time it trades the seed gets one percent and Robert's gonna buy this really cool piece of art how could the really cool piece of art that I'm buying be a security in the offline world well I I agree with that I agree with that I agree with you I don't think that that piece of art should be treated as security but the fee stream as well like at that point it's no longer the efforts of the original artist that's going to get you to sell that thing to someone else right because that fee stream comes from that has a mechanism for resale right that's that's the hard part here there's a common among whom right like well I'm not in a common Enterprise the fee stream and like securitizing that that's probably an investment contract like for sure but the Arts now uh I mean look I whatever this is probably the wrong forum for us to adjudicate this question but I think it's a good argument that like none of you sell it to someone else that person is now party to the contract but like I didn't know that person I didn't enter into some arrangement with them right I think there's a reasonable argument they're like look the original Creator who set this thing into motion I'm no longer in a contractual relationship with that person by owning the revenue by owning the royalty stream that's the argument I would make that's the argument I would make but anyway I I get your point I get your point um okay we're we're at time this was a this was a interesting continuation if you guys have thoughts please ping us on Twitter and tell us which side of the argument you would you would take but that's it for this week signing off yeah everybody I um one last thing one last thing some some guy in the comments and YouTube is giving me [ __ ] for not giving the exact mango insurance I went and looked it up uh which is okay 94 mango in March it was 80 mango right before the hack and now it's like 50 for 60 59 61 something loading that range so to the Heckler go [ __ ] yourself no no I like I like him guys right that's great thanks YouTube guys [Laughter] yeah sorry just to read the comment which is on the screen I don't know if IDK if you're unsure about the facts maybe stop blabbering thank you Gian that was a very very useful comment really appreciate you stepping in there I figured I figured I'd try to put it together then no that's good you nailed it you nailed it you'll [ __ ] dominantly see y'all
