so vitalik buterin recently sold about seven hundred thousand dollars worth of  coins which are these joke coins that are often a huge waste of money not to be confused with regular cryptocurrency which are non-jobe coins that are often a huge waste of money but like a hot girl in a bar vitalik actually got these coins for free turns out that sometimes people will send free coins to a celebrity in the hopes that their followers will copy them and then buy the coin it's not a bad true copy vitalik that's why unicorn t-shirt sales have gone years Anna can have positive repercussions one time Shiba Inu sent about half their total coins to vitalik and he donated them to a covid relief fund which I have to imagine is the sole reason why the pandemic is wrapping up after a mere three years is it rude to sell something that somebody gave you for free my mother would say yes but in my defense I think that a gift card for egg freezing was kind of a weird birthday present
