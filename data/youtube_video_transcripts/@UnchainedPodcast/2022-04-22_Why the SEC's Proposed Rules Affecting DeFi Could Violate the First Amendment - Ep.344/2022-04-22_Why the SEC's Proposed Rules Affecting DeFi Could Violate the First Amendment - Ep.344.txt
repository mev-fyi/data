peter hi laura it's great to be back yeah nice to have you this week coin center filed a comment letter with the securities and exchange commission about a proposed rulemaking about the definition of exchange and alternative trading systems what did this proposed rule making say so the proposed rulemaking does a few things but the main thing it did that we were concerned about is redefine the term exchange in the regulations which basically determines who needs to come in and register at the sec as an exchange or as a member of an exchange and if you don't register you can have a big fine levied against you and if you had your registration revoked maybe for some reason like trading unregistered unregistered securities you're no longer allowed to do those things that are defined as being an exchange now the old definition of exchange was pretty narrowly focused on using established methods to bring together orders for buyers and sellers of securities the new definition however is about making available communications protocol software or systems that others might use in order to bring together buyers and sellers not even necessarily orders and so you know from coin center's perspective we're a digital civil liberties organization worried about things like free speech and the ability of people to publish software we were really quite concerned when we first saw this proposed rule making because it basically seems to say that you need to register before you're allowed to publish software that might be used by other people to trade securities so a lot of people felt that this rule making really was targeted at crypto blockchain d5 in particular or kind of related fields and yet the rulemaking actually didn't ever refer explicitly to those areas do you agree with that assessment that it was meant to target those areas and if so why do you think the sec wrote it in a way where those topics were not actually mentioned yeah no that's a great question because it doesn't look on its face like it's targeted at defy or crypto at all and you know we make it a sort of a point of policy to not psychoanalyze regulators and just sort of take them at their word and so with this one we're a little confused because you know when you're a lawyer you care most about the law as it's drafted because at the end of the day maybe 30 years from now after all these regulators have sort of come and gone a judge is still going to look at the words in order to decide who's obligated by the words of the law so we had to look at the words and the words seem to indicate that even if you're just publishing software if people are using it to buy and sell securities including ones potentially on a decentralized network you need to register but that would mean it seemed like there's a whole bunch of people who would need to register because they make say dex software available and some of the tokens that people trade using that software are going to be securities and like you said nowhere in the rulemaking is dex mentioned is crypto mentioned is publishing software necessarily mentioned it's this make available communications protocol which is publishing software that's i mean that there's no reasonable interpretation of that statement that doesn't include publishing software but why didn't they come out and and mention it and the only other thing i'll add about that is the sec is under a duty in its organic statute in the congressional law that was passed back in the great depression that created the agency to do something called an economic analysis an economic impact analysis for their new rules and they did this in the rulemaking because of course they have to and they estimated that there were only 22 communications protocols out there some of which might now need to register because of the rule change which seems to indicate that they're not thinking this applies to software development as software development even though it's definitely drafted that way because it would obviously be more than 22 persons i think ostensibly the rulemaking was targeted at things like the bloomberg terminal you know information service providers that have some sort of system that allow people to say like ah i like tesla stock i would sell around these ranges it's not exactly like a traditional stock market where there's a bid and an ask and they're matched but it's still obviously a tool that's used by people to trade securities but the way they drafted it is so broad and because we care about the law not necessarily what people thought the law meant when they drafted it we had to sort of file this comment and make constitutional law arguments as to why this is probably too broad it's going to chill a lot of protected speech under the first amendment and it really it can't go forward in this form they have to go back and fix it oh oh so some people were saying that this is like a stealth attack on d5 and gabriel shapiro of delphi digital was saying that he thought that these drills could kill you know this kind of technology this these decentralized financial services but you're saying that you think the sec didn't actually mean to catch this in its dragnet so again like i can't psychoanalyze gary gensler or or hester purse although hester purse filed a descent saying people should check this out it looks kind of broad but i can't psychoanalyze any of them it is weird that it would be drafted in such a broad way such that if you knew anything about crypto and you know chairman genzler does know a lot about crypto you wouldn't immediately think oh this seems to cover a lot of the stuff that maybe the people who drafted it up in staff didn't think it was originally going to cover and you would think you would then either go back to the staff and say we got to narrow it or you would redo your economic analysis to say okay this is going to impact thousands of software developers not just 22 communications protocol systems but obviously neither of those things happened the rule got published the proposed rule got published with its incredible breadth that could cover software development and yet the economic analysis still said only 22 persons or entities are likely to qualify those two things are very hard to reconcile just having a plain reading of the rule as it was drafted so i don't know how this happened i don't know whether it's like oh well maybe it will cover a bunch but we'll clean that up later and maybe we won't mind having that extra authority i just psychoanalyzed them i you know i did an internal monologue i'm not supposed to do that but you know i i'm just i have no idea okay so coin center wrote a comment letter what did you say in that comment letter the typical way to respond to an agency is to address the substance of the law say from an economic policy standpoint or an innovation standpoint like this is going to be bad for business or bad for bad for technologists in the us or things like this or is to go at it at a process standpoint and say you know the administrative procedures act says that you need to have a certain amount of comment time and this was a short comment it was a short comment we didn't make either of those arguments actually we did something a little untraditional non-traditional for uh agency rulemaking we filed a whole comment that was about constitutional law that was about the limits that the first amendment our freedom of speech and freedom of religion and other things but most relevant here freedom of speech the limit that that amendment places on government agencies and on congress that says you cannot regulate beyond a certain point and this was convenient for me as i'm the director of research at coin center i write our comments and i write our reports because i was already working on a report about the first amendment implications of regulating activities like decentralized exchange software publication or being a minor or a staker on these networks and the we saw the sec rulemaking and i thought like all right well this report is now going to turn into a comment letter to the sec just for convenience sake and maybe later we'll expand it um to more things than just securities regulation and publish it as a report but it was actually really fortuitous from my perspective because i'd already done a lot of research into a a case that's that came out in 2011 called ims health versus sorrel which was about pharmaceutical data brokers the pharmaceutical industry wants to know whether doctors are prescribing their drugs so they can target ads at the doctors to get the doctors to prescribe their drugs more and vermont and a couple of other new england states tried to ban the sale of that information whether a doctor is prescribing a drug or not and the supreme court ultimately said no that's speech yes it's commercial speech it's speech that's all about profit god knows the pharmaceutical industry is all about profit but it doesn't matter you can't ban a certain type of content or a certain type of viewpoint even if it's a capitalist viewpoint even if it's like pharmaceutical companies want to have ads and so that case is i think a really good precedent to build on as far as saying look we can do all kinds of sensible regulation of conduct like when someone helps someone else buy a security we can't do that kind of permission-based regulation when it comes to just someone publishing software and tools that enable other people to trade securities or to trade assets or other things like this because banning the publication is just like in that pharmaceutical case banning speech and we just don't do that in the us because it stifles innovation and the cool thing about having to then extend this specifically to the exchange act rule making this paper i was already writing as i looked deep into all the old sec case law and i thought that there actually wasn't much there as far as the intersection of the sec's authority and the limits that the first amendment places on that authority but actually there's a really big case in 1985 so it's exactly as old as me it was called low versus sec there was a guy who was a disgraced former investment advisor so he previously had registered with the sec under the investment advisors act and he did some insider trading or something and so they revoked his registration not allowed to be an investment advisor anymore and what he used to be doing was direct to client like i'll talk to you laura you tell me what you're interested in investing in i'll tell you if it's a good idea or not what he continued doing after his registration was revoked is publishing a a stock tip newsletter just sort of like you can you can buy it on the street corner in a little magazine stand and the sec brought an injunction to stop him from publishing that newsletter because they thought you know you're still doing investment advice we told you you can't anymore the supreme court came back in that case and said no you can't stop someone from just publishing a newsletter that's a protected speech activity and so a unanimous court in 1985 said that there is a limit to the sec's jurisdiction when it comes to people publishing dispassionate advice or tools or information and so frankly that's exactly what's about to happen here if the rule making was to go forward and become final you're telling people they can't publish communications protocols you know it's just a series of rules written in software you could publish it like a book and so i think the same first amendment limitations apply this is incredibly fascinating but first let's have a quick word from the

d5.cc unc back to my conversation with peter so i have to admit that when i was first reading about this i was very confused about how writing software could be free speech because to my mind i was like well you're building a product but from what you described here about like the pharmaceutical case and other things i mean i think i get it like it's like just building on previous law so now that you've made this case for why you think that this potentially is a violation of the constitution i did notice in your blog post that you said that you said quote we don't need to wait to sue the sec it can happen as soon as the rule is final so it is is that what coin center plans to do so that we was intended to be the community yeah the larger community of people in this space it could be coin center um i'm not sure we would be strictly against bringing a pre-enforcement enforcement challenge but it's not something that we're absolutely you know gung-ho about at the moment our main hope is that the sec changes the rule before they publish it and at the very end of our comment we actually cite a really cool speech that i found from commissioner roberta carmel who was the first female commissioner of the sec actually back in the 1970s and she wrote this great speech or gave this speech i suppose there's no recording of it sadly where she says look during my tenure there were a lot of rules that we passed that we had to think about the first amendment implications because we deal with speech all the time and there were some specific examples where we limited the breadth of our rule mid-stream we were about to publish a rule and then we were like wait a minute this is going to chill protected expression and we are generally not interested in doing that and so that sets a great precedent i think and then you can fast forward all the way to today uh commissioner hester purse currently at the sec wrote her in her dissent that you know people who are developing these communications protocols should look hard at the rule and make sure that it doesn't impact their activities and so i think you know between this 1970s statement of the limits of the sec and the first amendment and hester's perspective today i think you know there's a very reasonable argument that the sec should take a hard look at this proposed rule and narrow the category and like we were discussing earlier the economic analysis suggested that the category they think they want to have is only 22 persons or institutions so i would say great that's probably the right category so you need to find a way to narrow the definition so that it really only does apply to the bloomberg terminal and not to somebody who's just publishing software we also to your listeners who might be writing this software or active in the decentralized exchange community we go through activities beyond just publishing software you might be maintaining the website that's the front end for the smart contracts on the ethereum blockchain or the tezos blockchain or whatever and that seems to be more of a centralized activity and of course it is but it's still just a speech activity and you know there's a lot more i'm not just one of these like code is speech that's the end of the conversation there's a perfectly reasonable area of activities for the government to regulate through things like registration like if i was to be a practicing lawyer i'm trained as a lawyer but i don't practice because i work for a non-profit i don't have clients but if i was to be a practicing lawyer of course i have to go get barred before i'm allowed to practice my profession and you might think well the lawyer's profession is all speech how can that be permissioned if this other thing can't be permissioned and the fact of the matter is it's actually discussed in this low versus sec case justice white who wrote a concurrence in the case says look it's okay to regulate professional conduct it's not okay to regulate dispassionate publication of information or or tools or newsletters for that matter and so where's that line we're allowed to impact speech if it's incidental to my professional conduct as a lawyer they can tell me you can't speak in front of a judge but they can't tell me i can't speak in front of a crowd on the street about the rights of man about what the sec has been doing lately i can't stop they can't stop me from speaking to you right now about what the sec is doing right now simply because i'm not i don't happen to be barred as an attorney or something and so this discussion is really rich in the low opinion and it's very interesting i think justice white's concurrence strikes the perfect line between where it's okay to regulate with permission professional conduct and where you're actually regulating speech as speech the phrase he uses a couple times is a personal nexus between the professional and the client and so you have to ask yourself in most of these decentralized exchange systems is there a personal nexus between the people who have developed the decentralized exchange tool and the people using the tool there actually isn't because that's the whole point of the damn thing is that we shouldn't have to trust a personal relationship we should be able to trust the code and the math and the effective operation of the blockchain which is all deterministic it's all just a computer saying yes the digital signature's valid and therefore the trade goes forward so to me this does mean that there's this big sector that is not going to be able to be subject to some sort of permission-based regulation now you still might be able to get these people for touting securities like if someone the developer was out there also saying like hey use my tool in order to sell this synthetic tesla stock which i know you're not allowed to buy in your home country well that's a whole different that's a whole different case but asking that developer to license as an exchange before they can even publish the software i don't think you can do that under the constitution yeah and i actually just wanted to note also you briefly mentioned this but sec commissioner hester in her dissent noted that the rule making was 650 pages and there were 220 separate comment requests and then she said the commission only gave people 30 days to comment and she believed 90 days would have been more appropriate and so you know it's reminiscent of what happened at the end of the trump administration with treasury secretary steve mnuchin when he tried to push through some rule making with a short comment period one you know comment terry that i noticed again by gabriel shapiro of delphi digital he talked about how you know if this rule making did go through then automated market makers would need to you know kind of comply with these different like registration with finra or you know some of the other things that you mentioned and then he said the primary purposes served by exchange regulation such as fair access public pricing auditability are already intrinsically present in amm architecture and thus regulation of amms as securities exchanges is not necessary either that was super interesting what did you think of that comment and then like what are the actual issues that you think the sec should be concerned about when it comes to d5 yeah i i hadn't seen that before but that's a great comment from gabe the reason again why we have something like exchange registration is because there is trust there is when i send an order to an exchange to buy or sell or even a non-firm trading order which is kind of what they're trying to extend it to ostensibly with the bloomberg terminal there's somebody who's going to pick that up and execute my wishes that as i express them in the order and the communications right and i have to trust that person to do that faithfully and transparently and in an audible way whether it's the new york stock exchange or the nasdaq or the bloomberg terminal and all these are you know proprietary business models and they have often opaque practices and it's perfectly reasonable to require regulation from them and i think when people see our space they say oh these people are trying to replace that with software so they can avoid following the law that's totally wrong actually no we're trying to replace that with software so that the interests of the law are embodied in the code itself it has to be transparent now it has to happen on an auditable blockchain yeah i love the way you only go forward as a trade if the digital signatures are correct and both parties genuinely committed to the transaction in a way where they can't back out so a lot of the safeguards that we look for with securities regulation or exchange regulation are inherent in doing this peer-to-peer using auditable software on an auditable blockchain whereas they are absolutely not apparent if you're using a trusted third party to do it so regulation of the trusted third party makes total sense regulation of the software developer who published the rules that are transparent and allow people to reach agreement peer-to-peer makes a lot less sense yeah so since the comment letters were sent earlier this week now what happens what are the next deadlines or developments that people should be on the lookout for oh and one thing about gabriel shapiro's comments that i think is also worth mentioning uh here is there are two rule makings going forward one right now is about this exchange act redefinition of exchange there's a whole nother one about being a dealer in securities where they would subject people with over 50 million dollars in assets under management to dealer uh regulation even if they're just sort of selling on their own account and that has implications for things like as you said automated market makers we haven't filed in that ongoing regulatory process in the dealer one we've just filed in the exchange one and the deadline for that was actually last week so sorry if your listeners haven't filed and wanted to file so you know what's going to happen next well both of these rule makings the exchange one and the dealer one are going to ultimately end up with final rules that there's no definitive timetable for that that could happen tomorrow in the case of the exchange rule making it could happen the day after the comment period closes for the dealer rule making or it could take months in both cases so i mean i think if it takes a long time it makes me a little hopeful that they they read our comment and they took it to heart they're obligated by law to read our comment but do they have to actually you know take it to heart i don't know and maybe they'll be going back and and rewriting these things if not if the thing that gets published in the exchange rule making is really just what it is right now which i think unequivocally makes it an obligation for people publishing software to register i think it's going to chill a huge amount of protected speech in this country like you're going to be like a software developer and you're saying well they expect me to register i i don't know anything about this world and i don't think i'm engaged in an activity that should require registration but i'm scared i don't want a lawsuit against me i've seen lawsuits that the sec has brought against a lot of other people that i know and so maybe i'll just stop working on the software library you know i've got other interests i could work over here or maybe github or the other websites where people publish these software tools and then the the website like github republishes them they say wow hey this is a tiny fraction of our business we're mostly interested in being a host for linux software libraries or something like that so we'll just drop from our platform all of the dex software libraries and that has massive free speech ramifications because you're basically losing this huge vital part of the internet where new tools and ideas for the future of human interaction are being shared and we're saying no we're just not going to have that anymore in this country it's too dangerous or something like that which is very un-american and i would also say unconstitutional and so there's this other case that we mention in our uh comment letter it's uh banta b-o-n-t-a and in this case the supreme court was asked can somebody bring a challenge to a law before the person who's supposed to enforce the law has even enforced we call it a pre-enforcement challenge or a facial challenge because you say the law on its face is unconstitutional it's not the way that they're enforcing it it's just the law on its face and in that case bonta because it had to do with free speech the court said normally we have a high bar for people to bring lawsuits pre-enforcement challenges we want to wait until to see how the agency interprets it and brings a lawsuit but in the first amendment case because there's so much protected expression which could be chilled people who would have spoken but decided not to speak decided to self-center we're gonna allow pre-enforcement challenges if a substantial number of potential applications of the law are unconstitutional restrictions on speech and in this case if the rule was published as it is that's a very easy bar to meet a substantial number of applications of that standard would be barriers to protected expression so this is what i meant by we the community somebody in the community maybe coin center somebody in the community could probably bring a challenge the minute the rule becomes final assuming it's the same rule that we've seen so far because the court would say look under the standard in banta pre-enforcement challenges are allowed we can sue the sec we don't have to wait for the sec to sue us and then we just go from there we go from the district court levels of the circuit circuit court level maybe in a circuit where where the judges care a bit more about free speech and then all the way up to the supreme court where the judges the justices rather care very deeply about free speech that's i'll briefly say there's another section of our comment which i hope everyone will read if they're interested in this that analyzes the court supreme court as it existed in 1985 when they had the low decision which already unanimously protected speech rights against the sec to today with sorrel in cases like it where they're protecting the rights of pharmaceutical data brokers the court is extremely interested in vindicating speech rights especially even in in the more capitalistic or or free market type areas where you have people making money off of speech or using speech to do things like securities trading so i'm very optimistic that if this rule was not changed before it became final there'd be a a very promising case to be brought against it obviously this would all be worse than if they just didn't have the rulemaking because there'd be this legal chaos in the midst but i guess that is the part of me that is a lawyer even though i'm not a practicing lawyer i kind of like chaos and and the fight all right well we will have to see what happens next but thank you so much for explaining all of this it has been a delight to have you on unchained thanks laura it's been great being here as always don't forget next up is the weekly news recap stick around for this week in crypto after this short

easter sunday beanstalk a stablecoin project on ethereum suffered an exploit worth 182 million dollars rather than a smart contract bug or theft of private keys this was a governance attack the beanstalk hacker was able to get away with roughly 76 million dollars in assets by taking out a flash loan to purchase 70 percent of beanstalk governance tokens publishing and voting for a proposal that sent all treasury funds to the attacker and then paying back the flash loan all in one transaction the attack was rather sophisticated to pull it off the attacker took out one billion dollars worth of assorted tokens on ave and flash loans and exploited beanstalk's emergency commit function allowing them to immediately execute their proposal without going through the typical life cycle of a governance proposal both of these moves required a high level of defined knowledge and skill in the aftermath of the hack beanstalk's bean stablecoin which traded at one dollar last week was trading below 10 cents according to its twitter account beanstalk is offering the attacker a 10 white hat bounty for more information and discussion on beanstalk check out this week's episode of the chopping block where tom schmidt taron chitra haseeb karashi and i go in depth on the beanstalk hack and defy security in general an ofac first a russian miner sanctioned the us treasury's office of foreign assets control for the first time added a crypto miner to its list of sanctioned entities on wednesday bitrev the russian crypto mining firm along with 10 subsidiaries has now been added to ofac's special designated nationals list ofac also sanctioned the publicly traded trans capital bank and 39 other individuals and entities treasury is also taking action against companies in russia's virtual currency mining industry by operating vast server farms that sell virtual currency mining capacity internationally these companies help russia monetize its natural resources russia has a comparative advantage in crypto mining due to energy resources and a cold climate wrote treasury in its press release however mining companies rely on imported computer equipment and fiat payments which makes them vulnerable to sanctions the united states is committed to ensuring that no asset no matter how complex becomes a mechanism for the putin regime to offset the impact of sanctions treasury concluded in a statement shared with coindesk bit river ceo igor runets pushed back against the sanctions by calling them unfair runit's claims that bit river whose parent company is based in switzerland has never provided services to russian government institutions or sanctioned entities the u.s going after russia-based minors could have massive implications russia is the third largest source of mining power in the world accounting for over 11 percent of hash power according to the latest statistics out of cambridge furthermore russia's president vladimir putin expressed interest in russia's crypto mining potential in late january additionally the news comes shortly after the international monetary fund published a paper explaining how russia could avoid sanctions levied in the wake of its invasion of ukraine via crypto mining over time sanctioned to countries could also allocate more resources toward evading sanctions through mining mining for energy-intensive blockchains like bitcoin can allow countries to monetize energy resources some of which cannot be exported due to sanctions the monetization happens directly on blockchains and outside the financial system where the sanctions are implemented ust is now the third largest stablecoin tara's native stablecoin ust is now the 13th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and third largest stablecoin narrowly climbing past finance's busd this week the news coincides with the burst in price from terrace governance token luna which increased 17 between monday and tuesday ust is still much smaller than tether and usdc which command an 82 billion dollar and 49 billion market capitalization respectively compared to only 17 billion dollars for ust however ust is now far and away the largest algorithmic stablecoin meaning instead of being supposedly backed one-to-one with dollar equivalent assets like usdc and usdt ust is designed to keep its peg to the dollar through a mint and burn mechanism that being said one reason that ust has become so popular lately is its transformation from a purely algorithmic stablecoin to a token with some backing as luna foundation guard has purchased over one billion dollars in btc to back the ustpeg in times of prices furthermore tara is now one of the largest buyers of cvx governance token that plays a significant role in the liquidity of stablecoins on

unchained with tara co-founder doe quan who discusses lfg's decision to back ust with btc and then galwa capital's kevin joe who analyzes the risks associated with ust's dependence on anchor in

moon birds is mooning data from crypto slam shows that moon birds a new nft collection has accrued more volume in the last seven days than the following 10 collections combined and it's not even close the 10 000 piece collection which launched and sold out on saturday has racked up over 113 000 eth in volume in the past seven days equating to 344 million dollars for context mutant api club the second largest collection by volume during the same period only did 64 million dollars worth of volume moon birds minted at 2.5 eth and less than a week later the floor price for the entire collection is over 38th marking a quick 12x return the hype surrounding moon birds seems to be derived from its team proof collective founded by kevin rose a partner at trueventures proof's previous 1000 piece
