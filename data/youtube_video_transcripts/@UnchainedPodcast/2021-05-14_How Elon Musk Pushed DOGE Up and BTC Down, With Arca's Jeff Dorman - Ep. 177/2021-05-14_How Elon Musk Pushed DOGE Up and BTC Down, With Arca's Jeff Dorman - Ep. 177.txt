welcome jeff hi thanks for having me so it's been a wild week in the crypto markets but before we get to some of the very specific events that drove some of the market movements let's just talk about the broader picture in general as we're coming out of this pandemic how do you see the different macro forces intersecting with the crypto markets sure uh there's i mean it depends what you say by crypto markets and this is a big thing that we talk about a lot at arca is is we don't really think it's one market anymore this is a large asset class with a lot of different types of digital assets that all have very different drivers of what you know makes the price move and what makes interest in them move so cryptocurrency itself especially bitcoin is obviously very affected by the economic data in the macro picture but a lot of the other assets in this asset class really aren't and really shouldn't be in some ways you can think of digital assets almost like the etf right the etf wrapper itself is consistent across all etfs but there's really no reason why a healthcare etf would react the same way as a bond etf which would react differently than a gold etf right what you put inside the wrapper matters i think the same thing is happening in digital assets so specific to cryptocurrency and bitcoin you know this is a huge week from a macro standpoint right we've had strong economic data for the past six weeks really across retail sales across um uh gdp but now you have the inflation uh whether it's transitory or not but you are starting to have it creep up what i think is probably most interesting though is everybody is concerned about the rise in rates but rates themselves are going nowhere so we have all this inflationary data we have all these headlines talking about rates are going to have to rise and that causes uh bitcoin to go down it causes you know the nasdaq and small cap stocks like the russell would go down but rates themselves are going nowhere so i think inflation is on people's mind i think bank of a bank of america recently said that uh i think it was four or five times uh the amount of mentions of inflation on earnings calls uh than last year and and more so than any time since 2004 but the reality is without rates really going anywhere and without the dollar going anywhere it's still very supportive of risk assets and i think most of these fears will probably subside pretty quickly and so when you were talking about how you view crypto as encompassing sort of different categories how would you break those out yeah so i think there's four types of digital assets right now and there might be more you know a year from now and two years from now but right now there's four there's your crypto currencies which for all intents and purposes honestly is just bitcoin but now you have dogecoin and ripple and some other ones that have high market caps but but aren't necessarily being used for anything then you have your protocols and platforms um led by ethereum which is certainly the biggest and the most highly used but you do have some competitors uh finance smart chain uh on the more centralized side and then you have things like solana and eventually cardona uh you know avalanche algorand you name it but you know these protocols and platforms are base layers where uh it's really the total economic activity that happens on the chain is kind of how you value this as an investment um and then you have asset-backed tokens you know there's not as many asset-backed tokens but these are you know these are regular securities uh you know maybe not in the eyes of the issuers or in the by the sec yet but these are securities these are these are tokens that are backed fully by either equity or debt or some sort of an income stream like an mba salary in the in the case of spencer dinwiddie last year but you know asset back tokens can be modeled and valued based on what the underlying asset is it has nothing to do with crypto or money or macro and then the fourth one is probably the largest group of digital assets and certainly the most interesting and that's what we call pass-through tokens and these pass-through tokens are are hybrid uh instruments they're they're they're quasi loyalty or rewards program on one side and they're quasi equity on the other side um these are these are instruments that generally if you own them you can participate in some way shape or form within the network because you own it you know that's the quasi-loyalty or rewards part and then you have some sort of an economic interest either it's revenues or profits that are being passed through to you or some sort of inflation schedule of new tokens that are being passed to you but you actually generate some sort of economic benefit or yield from owning it and it's these pass-through tokens that have driven defy it's what's driving nfts and gaming it's what's driving web 3.0 uh and these are generally you know have nothing to do with the economic factors that drive bitcoin and and you know the the the stock market and rates so it's not surprising to me at all that defy has completely uncorrelated to bitcoin especially in a week like today because those factors that drive defy are not relevant to what's driving bitcoin that's fascinating yeah i love what you said there about i guess what i would call governance tokens which of course obviously they're they're kind of um i don't know if like self-contained does the word but yeah they're they're sort of like you know if you're interested in whatever protocol um you know those represent like whatever that's doing whether it's like a lending protocol or um you know something around a stable coin then um then that is you know really kind of uh what will i guess affect the price movements in those um well i would also say that i also said part of the reason they you know they used to be called governance and now we call them pass-through tokens and there's a reason for that is that governance without any cash flows to govern is kind of pointless nobody cares about governing something that's a shell that has no actual revenues and cash flows now in the last 18 months you're starting to see real revenues and real cash flows you know at these centralized exchange companies like bnb and you know uh ftx like these c5 or sorry like the d5 ones like unit swap sushi swap etc once you actually start having real cash flows and have the ability to pass through something real back to your token holders the governance really gets replaced with this pass-through element it's the same thing but you're actually governing something that has value for the first time so um let's also talk about one of the more recent notable market moves in crypto which is of course ethereum trading at all-time highs um earlier this week it reached a little over forty three hundred dollars although as a press time i think it's around thirty seven hundred why do you think we've seen ethereum go from 740 this year to about 4k sure um i mean the short answer is there's been a lot of money flowing into ethereum that has been evidence no matter where you look whether you talk to some of the otc brokers who are starting to see institutional money coming in or you see some of these new products like the canadian etf and some of the other products that are specific to ethereum coming in but there's there's real money pouring into to ethereum and i think that is for real reasons um you know the first and foremost is is even though we've talked about ethereum killers forever and who might you know use syrup ethereum's throne as as the top smart contract platform the reality is there's an enormous amount of economic activity that is happening on uh on the ethereum network and in the protocol from again all the things we just mentioned from d5 to to nfts and gaming to to everything that uh you know may or may not have as much traction as those two and probably more importantly though for the first time you can value ethereum um as a protocol a lot of the protocols and platforms especially when they're up and coming they're really more like call options right this is why venture capital firms love to invest in the protocols they're call options on future economic activity but there's no way to really support what that value might be but with this new proposal that's coming through ethereum with eip 1559 and the switch to eth 2.0 what that's saying is all of these transactions that are happening on ethereum that are producing real value right now only to miners that cash flow is going to start being distributed back to token holders so now instead of just looking at this as a what if and look at all this economic activity now you can run a real gcf analysis or a real you know dividend yield model and say well if ethereum has produced 50 million dollars in fees in the last seven days i can annualize that and i can figure out what percentage of that is going to token holders and now i can come up with an actual price for what ethereum is worth and i think that's probably the biggest takeaway for me is that not only are the venture capital firms loving ethereum now but now you have real traditional value investors who are starting to look at this as a technology with real cash flows yeah and so i i do agree that everybody is talking about this and i'm very interested to see what happens when it does get adopted um so in a moment we'll continue that discussion please also turn to elon of elon musk's effect on the markets but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible tesos lets you easily exchange smart money throughout our digital world a

there's you know this big shift coming do you feel that um right now like it's sort of like a bitcoin having where um once it happens we won't really see the price rising because everybody's expecting it or do you feel that afterward we will see it rise even more well there's a big difference between catalyst and event driven investing and you know long-term fundamental investing generally we do both at arca and when we think of something long-term and fundamental it's usually something that already has kpis and metrics and cash flows and something that we can really model when we look at events and catalysts we're looking at a hard date or some sort of hard catalyst that we are basing an investment off of i think with ethereum right now you have to still put this more in the event and catalyst driven bucket because even though we're talking about this transition to each 2.0 and the eip 1559 proposal and these cash flows coming it hasn't actually happened yet and for anyone who's actually worked at a technology company and has ever pushed code or you know seen a github commit things can go wrong right there could be bugs and that's when you have three or four developers in a small company you know imagine thousands of developers across the world all working on this project so um you know there's a good chance that this could be buggy there's a good chance there could be uh um you know some effects of this transition and migration that you know we haven't really thought through um and i think until you see it it's too early to say that yes this is a fundamentally you know sound token that has these real cash flows but you know there's no question that ethereum economic activity is going to continue even if there's hiccups with this migration so you know it depends on what type of investor you are but you know if you are long ethereum there are real reasons to belong given all of this activity that's happening as an investor you know depends on what your mandate is and depends on uh you know how you think about how smooth this transition will be and what you know how long your time horizon is on sticking with something with ethereum i still think and i've said this multiple times before i still think that a lot of the applications that are built on ethereum are probably going to be seen by traditional investors as as as better places to put their money than ethereum itself once they really learn about the ecosystem not necessarily because it's better but just because it makes more sense a traditional you know equity analyst who is used to analyzing companies with cash flows is probably going to gravitate towards something like defy or something like a gaming company before they gravitate towards towards ethereum simply because it just is easier for them to understand but long term you know rising tide lifts all boats and and they should all perform pretty well as long as the economic activity on ethereum continues to be strong that's interesting i um i guess i think of it uh differently because ethereum's more proven and the d5 stuff is more risky but i take your point about just how they might be able to grasp some of the defy tokens more easily um so here we're you know making this kind of or you are making this pretty smart analysis just based on the fundamentals but um let's now kind of talk to some other talk about some other things that have been going on in crypto um especially in regards to elon musk's effect on the markets um let's just first talk about dogecoin uh what happened with that would you say and what do you think all that says about the crypto market i don't know if you saw the snl skit about what it what is dogecoin but you know i think it represented everything pretty well sure yeah i did see it and you know i i've been writing a blog every week for three plus years talking about the digital asset market and never if you would ask me at any point did i think i'd ever be talking about dogecoin um you know i i'm not highly emotional i'm not you know i'm not a bitcoin maximus i'm not an ethereum maximalism you know i'm an investor i'm a profit maximalist and you know we will look to wherever we see value i never thought i'd be writing about dogepoint but we did we wrote about it a few weeks ago because it is taking over the markets interest um you know dogecoin fits in the cryptocurrency basket which is similar to bitcoin bitcoin cannot be valued right you can look at it in terms of relative value versus gold you can look at it in terms of total market size based on your money supply but there's no way to value bitcoin despite the fact that many analysts have tried and i've heard many of them on your show i i don't believe it i think bitcoin is a belief system bitcoin is you know how many people want to own this relative to the amount of bitcoin exists and that's really it does coin's the same thing there's no valuation to dougherty but the way to think about it is thinking about options and think about what the black shoals market tells you when you when you price an option you know the black scholes model tells you you need to have the strike of the underlying you need to understand the the security price the time to expiry the risk-free rate and the volatility those last three things are the most important there is no time to expiry when you're talking about a new cryptocurrency or or a protocol right this is not like a company where there's a you know ticking time bomb and if they run out of cash they ultimately default these things can stick around forever so you have right away you have infinite expiration which gives a option value then you have the risk-free rate well we all know interest rates are zero and some points are negative so right there that that makes options more attractive and then you have the volatility and there's no question that these instruments have a lot of volatility so when you think about it in that way um you know i personally don't think dogecoin will be successful as a real store of value or as money like it is you know intending to do but if you just think about it mathematically um you know bitcoin has a 900 billion dollar market cap and dogecoin has a 50 billion market cap so that's you know the market is basically telling you that there's a you know roughly a five percent chance that dogecoin can one day be a form of money just like bitcoin and you know i i don't know what the right percentage is i don't know if it's zero or one or two or ten percent but it's probably not zero based on the fact that you know there's no real way to to kill this and if if you believe what i think which is that all these cryptocurrencies are belief systems who am i to say that you know millions of people around the world aren't going to rally behind dogecoin more so than bitcoin now from a security standpoint it makes no sense bitcoin is a much more secure network and there's hundreds of other reasons why bitcoin makes more sense as a store of value than dogecoin does but you know again if it's popularity increases and there's you know people who really will this to succeed there is a small chance that it succeeds and the market is basically pricing it based on that option value and do you have the same take on all of these other dog coins like the shib coin for she be you know and akita and bone and dog elon mars which had the ticker symbol elon i just wondered what you made of that whole thing as well yeah i mean honestly we ignore most of it um you know just because we're in the digital asset market doesn't mean we have to be paying attention to every little thing that pops up on twitter so you know we're aware of it we understand that it was driving you know some interest and and some some value but you know there's a difference between waiting for something to actually have real kpis and real metrics where you can look at how many users are using it or how many wallets are interacting with it or how many transactions are being sent versus something that's just taking advantage of a theme and and popping up overnight uh you know we're patient investors if any of these new you know dog coins that come up are still here in six months or 12 months and have the same type of success as some of the others you know then we'll have some real numbers to dig into uh for now it seems like a little bit of a sideshow to the main event and quite frankly as an active manager we love that right the more the market and the media continues to focus on things that we don't find to be all that relevant and valuable the more we can focus on the things that are and you know the most interesting thing from my standpoint especially having come from you know places like lehman brothers and merrill lynch and citadel is you know the sweet spot for active management or investing is always when the the asset class is evolving and growing and the opportunity set is growing but the competition isn't and truthfully a lot of these things that pop up that grab everyone's attention it's just providing a nice smoke screen for the real economic activity that's happening and it means the competition is focused in the wrong place so i love it personally as an investor even though i honestly have no idea what these are and probably would never adjust it yeah yeah and just to note see at chiang ping xiao of finance the ceo there tweeted that binance ran out of eth deposit addresses due to shib today that was the day they listed it and he said never happened before for any other erc 20 coins so well you know yeah it says something about what the demand was um but yeah and if that demand is still there in six months it might become interesting i think you know it's a little too early to tell but like i said a lot of these are option value and i'm never gonna tell somebody that it has a zero percent probability of working so for those who have done the work and enjoy it you know it could very well be profitable and very well interesting but for those you know who do real fundamental evaluation you know we certainly have to see more than just a a few days yeah and we'll have to see now after vitalik's sales of the shib token and and some of these other dot coins um did crash the price or i don't know if crash is the word but you know uh definitely took some of the air out um so now let's talk about elon musk's announcement that tesla would no longer no longer accept bitcoin as payment um the company did say they would continue to hold bitcoin on its balance sheet so tell us what effect that had on the markets and why you think that was the reaction well first of all i think that might have been uh you know the final catalyst that took the markets down in the last few days here but i don't think it was the only thing that was happening right we've already talked about the macro lens you know between the inflation data between uh uh what we saw with some of the uh stocks the publicly traded stocks that that are of basically digital asset companies all being down somewhere between 30 and 40 in april and already being down 20 to 30 here in may not to mention the nasdaq you know having three or four days down there was a lot of other signs that were uh leaning towards people wanting to err on the side of selling over buying and i think the elon musk news or the tesla news that came out yesterday was kind of just you know the the nail in the coffin for those who are trying to to make a buy or sell decision but at the same time you know i wrote back in february how many times can bitcoin rally on the same news because if you look at the rally from november through you know middle of april it was the same news over and over again tesla announced that they bought bitcoin square announces that they buy bitcoin you know bny melon and deutsche bank are reviewing crypto custody mastercard and visa and venmo and paypal and morgan stanley it was all the same news over and over again like they were you know you could summarize that in one sentence which is there are new entrants to bitcoin so if that is a central theme that drove bitcoin up 5x over the course of six months by that same definition if one of those players pulls out you should have a negative reaction to it now it doesn't really change anything in terms of the full scope of what bitcoin is or how much penetration is having in the market but again if the markets are going to reward that type of news on the way up they should also negatively punish it on the way down and you know i think the reaction was actually in the beginning the reaction was great it was a very bitcoin specific piece of news right tesla and elon musk said we don't believe that uh bitcoin is environmentally sound and i don't believe in that i think there's been enough uh on your show as well there's been enough people who have refuted that so i don't want to get into that but um it was very bitcoin specific tesla said we do not want to accept bitcoin anymore because it is not environmentally sound and that was it so in theory the only thing that should have gone down was bitcoin and for the most of yesterday that's actually what happened bitcoin was going down and the rest of the market was holding in pretty well uh today you had a little bit of a spillover in contagion effect where the rest of the market started to trade off as well you know that's when you get back into these high correlations and and you know whether or not this is all just one market but i thought the reaction was healthy yesterday even though i don't think it has any real long-term consequence oh okay you know that interests me that you said that because i just feel like this year with the nft thing there's been a lot of talk about environmental stuff and i feel like sort of like now that the normies are coming that they're highlighting this way more than normal crypto people but you don't think this will have a long-term effect on the crypto markets well i mean look i wasn't there when satoshi wrote the white paper but i'm pretty sure you know seeing mark cuban and elon musk battle on twitter about whether or not bitcoin is environmentally sound i'm pretty sure that's not what was intended uh two eccentric billionaires fighting over the value of bitcoin um so no i mean it's one piece of a giant mosaic theory puzzle um i think the esg concerns are are valid across the entire globe and i think there is some components of what bitcoin is offering that you can say is is has a negative impact uh on the environment because of the electricity but at the same time again we've been refuting it people like nick carter have been refuting and i mean there's enough evidence to also support that you know energy is is a grid and there's excess energy available and miners are efficiently looking for the lowest cost surplus of energy and therefore it's not really adding uh any more of a carbon footprint than would be there without bitcoin so it really just comes down to people either believe that bitcoin should exist and this idea of a government state free monetary system should exist or not if it does then you would say yes this is worth the energy that goes into it if you don't believe bitcoin should exist of course you're going to say the energy isn't real um you know there's all kinds of things that uh utilize energy in the world that you can validate if you believe the the means justify uh the end so you know i'm not a big believer that the bitcoin esg concerns are going to have a huge impact on this market but i do understand um you know why if you're tesla and you have this brand of being environmentally conscious and you you know sell renewable batteries and you're looking for uh you know energy credits why you would take that stance yeah i i do obviously see why you know for the position they're in uh it was probably something that had to happen at some point um but i do think this is a growing concern i'd like to keep my eye on it um well this has been such a fascinating discussion thank you so much for coming on unconfirmed well thank you for having me laura don't forget next up is the weekly news recap stick around for this week in crypto after this short break did you know nearly 338 million dollars worth

bitcoin price drops on wednesday tesla ceo elon musk said that tesla had suspended the purchase of vehicles with bitcoin citing concern over quote the rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for bitcoin mining and transactions the announcement immediately sent the price of bitcoin plunging because you know so much of the bitcoin transaction activity was people sending their btcs for teslas the price hit a monthly low of forty six thousand dollars before bumping back up to around 50k it was not all bad news however tesla will continue holding btc hinting that bitcoin vehicle purchases could come back if mining transitions to a more sustainable energy source musk ended his announcement with a tease writing quote we are also looking at other cryptocurrencies that use less than one percent of bitcoin's energy per trans action if that is the case tesla could be looking into cryptos running on blockchains that use proof-of-stake consensus algorithms rather than bitcoin's proof of work which is dependent on computing power and therefore energy to secure the network solana itself a proof of stake blockchain has already shot its shot on twitter replying to musk with a waving

a passive burn account the co-founder of ethereum netted 15719 eth worth about 63 million dollars in his sale of 660 billion ship 140 billion akita and 43 billion elon buderin immediately sent the proceeds from his meme sale to charities including givewell the methuselah foundation a coveted relief fund for india gitcoin and charter cities larry cermak director of research at the block speculated that vitalik's token dump stemmed from the tokens clogging up ethereum which consistently caused gas fees to go over 400 he also mused that investors would be quote rugged regardless later don't get me wrong and by much worse intended people but still wouldn't be surprised if this leads to lawsuits it was a busy week for vitalik in between his charitable activities he posted on uniswap's governance forum proposing that uniswap's uni token should become a price oracle in the same vein as a chain-link but simpler with a strict focus on price rather than data feeds a uni price oracle would specialize in wrapping real world numbers into smart contracts on ethereum luderan also saw ethereum reach a 500 billion market cap overtaking jpmorgan and visa and market capitalization
