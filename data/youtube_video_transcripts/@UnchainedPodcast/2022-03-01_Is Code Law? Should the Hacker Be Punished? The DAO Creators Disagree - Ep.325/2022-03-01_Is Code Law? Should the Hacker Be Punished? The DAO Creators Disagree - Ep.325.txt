all formerly involved with socket and the dow which takes up two months of ethereum's history and yet is about a full third of my book welcome christoph lovetaris and griff thank you hey thanks for having us hey thanks so we are going to discuss what is easily the biggest event in the book and in my opinion in ethereum's history and that is the dow attack on ethereum and the dow in general and we will try to do our best not to give too many spoilers and stick to kind of more publicly known information but for those of you who find this episode interesting you should definitely check out my book the cryptopians which came out last week so first let's start with each of you saying what thanks griff yes oh yes i also have my cut yes why don't we do an ad right now so let's each of us go or each of you go around and say what your involvement had been in ethereum and what your involvement was in the dow at the time that this event starts which is kind of like late 2015 early 2016. and why don't we start with you kristoff because i think you're you're really the origin well the originalist idea of the dao was older than me i mean this is coming bitcoin is it down itself ethereum wrote the white paper so maybe starting with the white paper by vitalik which is like a prophecy because most of it actually got fulfilled so i read this in i think beginning 2014 i was doing my phd in traditional physics i got totally like sucked into it and after the crowd sale i started in the group with gavin wood and c plus plus team writing tests it was full time on working with the ethereum foundation now working actually closely with jeffrey wilker gavin wood and vitalik buttering because they were both the heads of their clients python go and cpr plus and i would write tests that they always put like sync with each other always be true to the protocol the protocol itself written by gavin in the yellow paper that's why like per default he was kind of right and the other ones needed to check that they were also doing the right thing so working for the foundation um one and a half years and then leaving end of 2015 um with my co-founders then my brother simon jens and stefan tua we started slogged long story short we wanted to build like a decent live sharing economy we called it universal sharing network i just think craft came up with this term i guess or like this was also a time crisp joint like beginning 2016 end of 2015 and so then the idea of course was to do fundraising and we didn't want to go with vcs because we wanted to build a decentralized universal share network you want to have lots of people access to it and back then even token sales were pretty rare and new there was i think auger that went pretty early we had of course the ethereum crowdsale itself so we thought the best thing would be to raise from the community but now with ethereum being launched and we know the tech we could do much better so we said instead of just doing a simple token sale let's give them more voting power and then basically evolve to let's just have the power over the money we keep the money in the small contract until we said let's do a full blown down like fully decentralized this as it should be there's no compromises and this actually happened in the week of defcon one like this decision was made one day before the talk so i changed my slice and then presented it if you got a lot of traction a lot of interest so i wrote the paper about the dao meaning like how it worked a smart contract the first version then we got more people joining it since it was an open source project left terrace joined the company um some people has had some open source contribution but not too many then we got like the audit we coded it we don't want to get into all the details but we know we launched not exactly relaunched if you describe it in the book how it happened i i i committed the last commit and then made it public under version 1.0 this was like officially the last step from zlokit of course we were very involved in the slack community and hope that people would launch it at it as they did got launched you read in the book it raised lots of money about 150 million dollars then the price of ether went up and at some point and close to 250 minutes but okay that's yeah now we're going too far in the future so no no it's okay but why so why don't we i think it's left terrace next to joint do you want to go love terrace i i joined ethereum back in 2014 yeah along with christian and i worked on the solidity team writing the solidity compiler and the c plus plus client i was hired by iron buchanan and i was working under gavin and just worked on there until the launch of ethereum and right after defcon one spared the book also we all were let go of our positions and then i knew christoph who was also working with us and he told me about this really cool new startup uh slokkit and i had seen also the devcon1 presentation i was like why not that sounds like a cool thing to do and joined uh slokit in beginning of 2016 or end of 2015 like somewhere there i don't remember exactly where and then yeah worked there i i actually find the cool stuff that we did was uh before that uh like it's not mentioned at all but you know we did all this universal setting um uh planning the the theme computer we were trying to create and uh went with simon so um chris was brother and co-founder of slokit and stefan of course like to barcelona ubuntu mwc yes the conference in barcelona yeah and then we got the ubuntu guys all really excited about stuff and it was really really cool and there was no down mention almost at all there we were just talking about the actual ethereum computer that we wanted to create so iot devices that are well uh controlling physical things and everything happens through the blockchain yeah but then funding came up and then it was the dow that uh traumatic experiences here yeah um but no it was like the is also um presented in the devcon1 presentation like wanted to get funding from the community not from vcs uh so we started working on the dao and uh yeah that's probably already towards the end of my involvement it's like i don't need to go to the hack already right so no no wait there was one thing i i felt that i wanted to say but but so i mean christoph was saying that he thought that you know they had decided to do the doubt right before devcon but you're saying that you guys almost got the vc funding at the mobile world congress there's also a funding there the the dow was at least known in defcon one that's when i basically announced people do this but the event of course to conferences is not for vc money just like to get the ethereum computer this iot device out to get people excited about connecting iot devices to the blockchain this is what left harris did there was ubuntu okay yeah so there were many people who were really excited about you know like the actual thing that we wanted to build so that was just a mechanism to get funding in a more cypher funk way rather than just you know going the old busy way but the thing that we wanted to build was completely different this is also why why um christoph and slocut appealed to me like because we were talking a lot also while we were working together about you know iot i was very much into low level uh stuff back then and uh yeah i really liked the idea and i got really really excited and i thought that this dow thing is just a distraction uh from what we actually wanted to do huh okay and griff what about you yeah i mean like like they're saying we were a sharing economy company so i came in way i didn't know much about ethereum beforehand i actually had been in crypto for a while but i had heard ethereum was vaporware and just didn't really think much of it and so but then i i was getting a master's degree actually the first master's degree ever or any degree ever in digital currencies and which i collected a week after the dow hack which is kind of funny but um for my interest in crypto i was really excited about dao's specifically interlacing with the sharing economy and i wrote a white paper for one of my classes about a bike sharing economy and so i sent and then i just was googling like sharing economy crypto you know or bitcoin probably at that time sharing economy bitcoin and uh slaka came up and it's like they're using ethereum that's crazy whatever and then but but i'll i'll dm them you know and i i think i sent i don't know how many emails i sent to kristoff but many uh and thankfully for you know no one's going to read some random dude's white paper but uh i took a video recording of me presenting the white paper for the class and you know i'm pretty engaging to listen to so like he was like oh this guy's cool i think i don't know what you were thinking christopher but you let me in as i was so excited and um i was like i will work for free just let me like participate in this amazing thing i can't believe you guys are doing exactly what i want to do so i i jumped in as uh i don't even know i guess i was like an intern or something right uh and and helped make the slack and coordinate the community around socket and that was really how i got in so you guys have this idea for this universal sharing economy that had these kind of like smart locks that would open with ethereum transactions is that like a good kind of general description oh wow that's actually the one that's the one from defcon one wow and you can you hold it up one once more for a bit longer can you see this wow it's a door one okay okay nice that's so funny for people listening on audio you might want to check out the video for that and so then you have this idea to get funding from this dow which would kind of i mean the way most people thought of it was what that it was going to be this decentralized venture fund because there would be like proposals and then the community would vote on which ones they wanted to fund so when you announced the dao what was the community's like general response to the idea i would say very positive in the beginning it was like really what always people people wanted to do but also it was not thought of as a venture fund although of course later on it became more this direction because people talked about it like it in the beginning it was more like their company which would be behind the decent sharing economy or be behind the universe's share network and we would be one of many getting funded by it because he would build it and work for it let's say we would do like let's say bike logs or door locks another company would do washing machines whatever so they could also go to this dow and ask for funding because they want to connect some other stuff to the sharing economy but i was thinking at least more of this is the company which builds the universal share network or companies maybe the wrong world so more organization which is doing this completely distributed and we would just be a service provider but yes the community was actually very um interested that's why we got like five or six thousand people on slack within a couple of weeks um at defcon one people got excited they love to go to our booth and feel and touch kind of ethereum i think it was more like for the first time people could touch ethereum in some way they could get a feeling of i c and the airbnb was a big thing back then like it was really exciting to taking off and people learned how airbnb works and just this idea of i could pay kind of the door lock to open and people got really excited to see it firsthand so that's i think one reason we got such a positive feedback yeah i actually i'm in an airbnb right now and i had to tr i had trouble with the lock and it would have been really nice if i could have used a transaction on my phone to open it but anyway and griffin left harris do you want to add anything to that i can just say 100 agree you know the venture the venture side of the dow was kind of rewritten after the dow hack and really during at the time it was of course the dow could do anything but i think we imagined that the main dow would follow socket or like that was kind of the cultural thing that we expected we had no idea but the dial had this feature where it would split off and so you know i at least i thought like other people might want to try other ventures but they'd probably end up splitting off into a separate dow and siphoning some of the original funds so it would have been a very um fractal sort of vc fund you know uh if it if it went that direction but we we never know i think it came a bit when a lot of money came in in the beginning when we thought about 5 million like this you cannot like fund hundreds hundreds of ventures with like 5 million or even 10. so it was like maybe 5 maybe 10 maybe even 20 million you could still use all of this for the universal share network for like let's say five companies building things around it but then there was 150 million dollars in it but then it really looked like a venture fund because like this can fund so many things in the ethereum world and people accept that this is like that decentralized venture fund for the ethereum community funding everything in there this was how it was after it received that much money but not before and why did you guys not cap the sale there were several reasons for this um i remember we had a discussion in slack about this pros and cons the pros of course security point of view like we don't need that much money this was a pro the converse what if one big whale just gets all of it or 50 or 60 of it just very quickly because you saw those icos very getting the big guys getting in very quickly this was one thing we were afraid of and that maybe would just some people want to get in and cannot get it and we maybe we feel over confident in the security of the dow that we didn't think of this kind of hack said this is also why we tested that much and people could like spit it split off if they don't like it so that in the end we decided to not do it because it got things more complicated than this than it needs to be of course in hindsight from a security point of view it would have been better if you would have done it of course but back at the time we decided not to and just to go back to how popular the dow became and how it raised so much money why do you think it raised that much money because it was a lot and ethereum wasn't even that big at that time the split function right like it felt like a risk-free investment because you could always split your money out and it's kind of like what is now the rage quit mechanism in molok daos where it feels like well okay i can put my money in but i have like cryptographic security that i can pull my money out so it felt like something to do and then of course once it cascaded and got so big people followed in like like no tomorrow you know at the time we didn't understand fomo right like it was this is long before all the icos and and all that stuff so that's my guess what do you think i mean i i credit uh stefan for this he was really good at what he did and we had let's say the cream of the crop of the ethereum community back then escalator so it was it really looked as if it's approved by everyone and everybody and it's the next big thing this is how it looked like and probably that should that's a loan should have pointed to us that it will get bigger than we expected but nobody expected this much money like i don't think that christoph expected i mean like reading the book i don't think you expected that much absolutely not i also have to say in hindsight i was very naive at the time like i didn't make a big deal of those creators like stefan i think he understood a bit more what we were doing there because he was more like the marketing and community management and so for me it was really we needed a create list of creators who know what they were doing so of course it would be nice if they respected the community that's why i asked them but i didn't think of it as like also a marketing thing like you have those names there stefan understood this very well and used this also and i can't blame him for this again he did a great job his job was to build a community and to get people excited about it which did way better than we expected and the second thing why i think it's what kriff said after let's say the first 10 or 15 million it got attention and then people started to think of it as an investment fund and so if all the companies building on ethereum would be funded by the dow that this would be the perfect investment if you just want to invest in the ethereum ecosystem but not the base layer on the application layer it would look like created by those guys even though that that shop was not like to touch those projects that shock was actually to check the address maybe the id that it like everything is correct but it it looked like they would like actually create and look at what's good what's not and all the applications would just get funding from there so then from an investor point of view i got one call from an israeli guy that we want to put in 20 million maybe and if if it's safe or not i just said nothing well you have to decide on your own you have to do a security audit i can't tell you anything so but this was clearly a guy who thought about it from a purely investment perspective like is this the way i can invest in the ethereum application layer that's how it became later on because it started like to raise the first 10 or 20 million and then as scruff said they filmed in because they maybe thought there's no other way to get into those application layer companies building because it would all get funded by the dao that could be one reason yeah that makes sense because i did realize in the report in the course of my reporting that there were multiple companies that were looking to make proposals to the dow and ultimately later they had icos but at the time there were a lot of people that were like oh i'll go get funding from the dow one thing i want the listeners to know is that we have mentioned stefan a few times that stefan twall who actually started in ethereum as the well i think he started kind of more as like community management and communications and then later he was brought onto the management team as chief communications officer and then you will read what happened in the book to him at the ef at the ethereum foundation um and then later he ended up at socket as a co-founder and again he kind of had yeah this sort of outward-facing communications type role so once you guys realize that it was get that it was going to be huge how did you feel yeah i mean i think i was the only one that was happy about it honestly well maybe stefan too stephanie was stephen was pretty happy about it everyone else the developers were scared as like profanity insert profanity here it was a really intense time but i don't know christoph i think you have to say say how you felt again we did not expect anything like this at all on the one side happy like the plan worked they actually got money because there was also a fear that maybe gets just a couple of hundred thousand and this was like nothing and we worked so much for it because from a financial point of view uh we did not expect this taking so long and also simon like he was using his credit cards to buy food for his family like he didn't get money for a long time like we we have so at developers we were naive like always two weeks you know we can put anything in two weeks so we thought maybe end of december channel really getting the star out and then of course it took longer and the more legal work and then it tracked on until april and so we really needed funding and we were totally stressed because we were working like crazy all those hours so me was like now i don't need a break and this was not a break like this was just more exciting more people asking me and just i just needed a little break and i was really scared about it i mean there's a photo of me with one of like one guy in berlin uh ey advisor and he was like concreted giving us shaking hands concreting us i could not be even be happy like they were making dinner for us i was just just leave me alone for a couple of weeks i've not because this is like i don't know where this will end like if there's so much money in it i have no idea what this will become and maybe i don't want to be associated with this anymore if they're just funding some crazy stuff which i don't like but i also didn't know i could never ever stop this this week like even when i'm 80 or 90 the this is true i mean on ethereum we'll always see this this will always be there just not alive anymore not that much at life loved harris do you want to add on that i was actually when for the entire duration i think of the race i was not in germany i was at my parents place in greece and they were also watching it and saying oh look at what our son is working on it's gathering money and it's like yeah yeah that sure and then he's like oh wait that's you know is it the loader and didn't you guys caught this are you sure that it's okay and then i said yeah yeah no worse and then it started going 5 10 and then it went up and i just didn't want to go back to germany i i got like a similar um stresses as christophe because i mean it's actually quite simple as a developer you just know that things can go wrong like there is no such thing as bug free code and yeah it's just stressful to know that something that you worked on has gathered uh and is securing so much money and well probably that stress had a reason to be there dude what happened yeah yeah so let's talk about that because before the actual hack there were a lot of conversations online about how there were flaws in in the in the dow nobody picked up on you know the ultimate exploit but obviously like there was a new york times article of flaws that eman gunsir the cornell professor pointed out along with i think it was like dino mark and i forget who else was on that paper but and dino mark used to work at consensus oh yeah vlad's unfair yeah who worked uh doing yeah ethereum research and there but there were other things because i know you guys were um looking at how to enable people to remove their money more quickly and kind of arguing about whether or not you should do that and things like that so at that time when people were pointing out the flaws the sale was done you knew you know you would rate so by my calculation the day that the sale ended it was 139 million but then the price of ether was rising so by the morning of the hack it was a quarter billion dollars so while people were talking about all the flaws and then you're seeing the val the dollar value of it rise what what were you your feelings during that period so i've i did take them seriously but also as i said nobody pointed out like really really bad flaws like you can take money from it or it was more game theoretical things that you could for example this buyers towards yes and this those are two things but they're usually not fair tell like this is not like the end of it it's more like yes it needs improvement so sometimes they did write it in a manner it sounded like everything is gonna end this thing is like completely broken and so that's why we defended it sometimes that no it's not completely broken it needs improvement and then we started working on this dial version too you made on github like already created those issues i started providing code you all know that download version 2 is not just a simple click and deploy it needs like deploy and convince everybody to move there and so that's why we also try to work on what can we do like as intermediate solutions what we could do was working on the smart contract of the receiver of the funds so we made this like a small contract which from which you can make proposals to receive money from your down would hope that people would use it as a default and there you could build in a bit more security things so that um people could for somebody get their money back from there as well if they would vote it for it things like this a day like a daily payout not a all at once so that's the kind of things you worked on and since you were not scared for this thing would lose all their money it's just like yes needs improvement we need a second version and also because it got that big you said let's create a security group you wrote about this in this book we make a proposal like and since it got that big i was scared i was like let's get like five of the top notch researchers and they're costing like 300 or 500 per hour it's like if you're asking for those security audit companies they charge a lot and so we said this is a very expensive we want to have 24 7 everybody like all the time watching the ether scan or something what is happening and so we made a proposal which was expensive and you wrote how the community reacted was not happy so we said okay if you don't want this we make a smaller one which of course just one guy not that much security but we felt of course this was so new and so much racist could maybe be attacked so you wanted to do something also if you even though we thought none of the flaws mentioned were brutal critical and will stop everything just small things which needs improvement and that's what we tried to fix yeah i felt a bit annoyed by all of this stuff because i'll be honest i felt that people wanted to make uh themselves famous through associating with the dao in a negative way like we had a lot of problems pointed out but these problems for example like the negative vote thing the bias for voting yes i think or something like that those who still have this problem like i i i had a f not fight but argument with someone from the ens tao right now that a proposal was not gonna pass because he was abstaining and then he says oh yes you're actually right and then he voted no just to make the proposal pass even though you know he wanted to say that he didn't want to vote no but he wanted to so that he doesn't agree and he abstained and that with three hours for the proposal basically it would make it not pass even though if he voted no the proposal would pass it's exactly that same thing and it still happens so it's not as if the problems that were pointed out were serious maybe the most serious one um was something that was not found by any of them and it was the one that yeah they withdraw how was it called yeah the stalking withdrawals which this is yeah well so we'll we can talk about that later when we talk about you know my article revealing who we believe i did attack the dow um so okay so why don't we do this so we're gonna take a commercial break to hear from the sponsors who make the show possible and

kristoff luftaris and griff all right so let's talk about the dow hack how did you why did you each just tell us briefly how it is that you found out and how you felt at that moment i think i think i was the first to find out i feel like it was i want to say his name was moe man i can't even remember anymore so long ago i woke up and went to the slack because that's my job you know and just talking to the community and they're like hey something weird is happening you know it looks like the dow ether scan maybe he's broken or something and then started looking into it and then i started dming everyone because it was pretty looked really bad and eventually got a hold of simon who's not in this call and i was like you gotta wake find kristoff go to his house wake him up you know because it was like 6 00 30 a.m or something yeah and then we had to formulate a plan i i think i ended up getting a hold of left terrace i can't remember who got a hold of you laugh definitely you i remember this school it was you it was early morning and how did you feel when you heard the news i just didn't believe but like so first of all i didn't believe what people were saying so i wanted to verify it and i verified that something is wrong by going to etherscan and then i felt really bad and i just tried to realize what's happening i think that my first direction was to actually because it was maybe eight or nine so close to my like i had to wake up i had woken up and then i probably started to try and understand and also talk with others and christoph i think and others in the chats about trying to figure out uh what the attack was and uh remake the contract that so not to make um recreate the attack basically to understand what's happening and kristoff i think it was friday morning if i remember right yeah my brother my brother called my way my wife she was waking me up because as i was working long so i was sleeping a bit longer in the morning and she was just saying simon was just saying well there's something strange happening um just check on eso scan so like whenever when the knees are scared to see this very regular thing going out it could look like it was a split down functions called the beginning i was saying well this is just a regular thing people can call the split down it's just something for whatever reason someone doing it in a very regular way but looking deeper at it that's like having some kind of going through other contracts and going back then it seemed like no this is a hack and this was then i really realized this is over this was like game over for me because i know how less we could do i know that we had no power over the dial we couldn't change the code we couldn't do anything so this was like the worst case scenario like i prepared in a way that people could split and get their money out like that's what the last test i did was always if something is wrong people can split and get their money out or they can make a proposal and get the money out so the money can get never get stuck that's like what i was more worried about but this like money was flowing out of the system i was then laying on my crowns like this is over so then i really have to like get all my stuff together again and say well now let's fight back i have to do what i got to do so call f call vitalik that's called the ethereum foundation for help because i wanted to have as many people as possible looking at the code seeing because i could not see directly what was happening like in the first let's say 30 minutes or so i did not detect what was happening so that's and we started to call this ethereum foundation and this was a strange feeling because i haven't talked to them since a while it's like like hi guys i'm here again and i'm really sorry this was like i think that's how it started so and they just didn't want to hear this like okay let's just dig in what's happening here is anybody a clue then we let's just right into what's got what what can we do and i think even this first call we thought about all options and just like a soft fork something quick like can we somehow get the miners to not include transaction to the style just to win some time this was the first start we need time to analyze stuff um that's why the software was the first idea i think hard fork i don't know if this came up or not in the call but software first let's buy time and then but we could not find it out in this course we just after speaking to each other sharing all the information he got back to work and tried to figure it out what it was i don't know exactly who found it out and reported it i think was on some skype or slack channel someone who shared the details yeah and one thing i want to clarify for people when you said that you couldn't like fix it it's because you would have needed to get the whole community to agree to this upgrade and then get everybody to migrate their tokens so you know it's since it's decentralized also you like weren't in control of it you couldn't just kind of be like okay we're gonna fix this and you know redo it um it was live on ethereum and it would have needed all the community support to change it and and frankly the tooling is not what it is today so um even though it was technically a dow there was literally no way for the token holders to really manage it which is like another another funny thing but also cool to see how much progress has been made in dao's okay so this next part only involves left harrison griff because i believe and kristoff you can correct me if i'm wrong at this point you just decided to focus on coating up a hard fork in case ethereum decided to go that route was not this day like it took a bit more time until this decision was made i don't know one or two weeks not too long but it didn't take too long for me to realize the hard fork would be the only like clean solution that everybody could get everything back everything else should be tried and then you can take it over left tails and craft because you focus on plan b yeah so during this part left harrison griff were involved in trying to rescue the money so talk a little bit about what that was like and what was going on in your mind while you were working on that or trying to work on that well it was definitely a team effort right uh like the night before the dow i was writing starting a blog post about jordi bellina who made liquid democracy for the dow that i had already used which we still don't have today on ethereum anywhere as far as i can tell so uh you know the brain which is like delegating votes right yeah liquid delegates so you could delegate to someone who could delegate who could delegate and so there's one hop delegation on ethereum but i haven't seen too much liquid democracy but he had made the thing right uh he created this contract and it it was there but just never got used due to the dao uh i i used it to vote on something oh we we in the dow because i i i could have sworn he told me that he created it too late so it actually didn't get implemented in the dao it didn't get implemented in the dow code as a default for voting everywhere so then he re-implemented it on top of ethereum as separate contracts so that you could just send your dow tokens to a contract and then you'd get dow vote tokens and then you'd use those dow vote tokens to signal how your delegates should vote or kind of you know or you could like your delegate would have to vote by a certain time and then you could use your delegate dow tokens to pull out your dow tokens so his vote doesn't have your weight if you disagree it was a super cool thing and it worked and as i was writing a blog post you know da da da and then of course the next day well that wasn't the priority that blog post anymore but uh while left terrace was figuring out the hack and how the heck happened i think you were first left i can't remember but yeah so this is this is something that was really it wasn't in the book and i was like ah no my moment of glory well he didn't tell me then because i had i didn't know this is too much i don't remember actually i i tried to forget this stuff because i also was too scared about the implications i think that i haven't talked to anybody uh about this stuff until you contacted me and the only reason why i think i talk to you is because a lot of time passed since then but it was just that i i as far as i recall i had recreated the attack and had an attack contract ready on the same night but we never used it at that day we used it later yeah and jordy jordy had his own attack contract right yes this is in the book so jordy um was also mentioned pretty well there about that last four million well left terrace if i if i ever i don't know if i ever update the book in any way um i will i will try to put your moment of glory in there yeah i so so we had uh we had figured out a couple we had figured out how the attack happened and then we kind of like gathered other people who we trusted that to figure out if we should make an attack because the hacker stole 50 million dollars but there's 100 million dollars still sitting there right and while the hacker was attacking we didn't have it still but then the hacker just the attack just stopped and we didn't really know why and then we figured out how to hack in so then it was like well but there's no sense of urgency the the drain it the draining has stopped so when do we attack and this was like a big debate amongst the at that time the robin hood group yeah which people can definitely read about this in the book because i this this was fascinating to me um and and it still is part of kind of the philosophical question around what really even happened so during this whole time did you guys think that the dow attacker was going to attack again i mean nothing stopped him right i i think griff you maybe mentioned that he stopped because so not mentioned like theorized right that maybe he stopped because you know if he took everything then it would be you know like too much but if he just took 30 percent of it and then maybe he can get away with it or something like that other theorized that maybe his contract got broken somehow he had some kind of flaw and then he just stopped but as you also mentioned in the book like once i mean if i realized it in the in in in in less than a day then others can do that also and once that's publicized everybody can copycat the entire attack so then uh even if it's not the original hacker someone else will perform an attack it was just a matter of time so the next kind of like month for you guys was very intense do you want to talk a little bit about what that was like during that period between and we didn't even really cover the initial rescue so we can talk about the initial rescue and just in general what you were doing between then and the hard fork and like what was going through your head and what your life was like it was dow wars it was wild i mean left at the beginning left and jordy were just practicing attacking it was like drills like military drills and they were going all day all night like just practicing attacking the dow and i was going more from the social angle gathering capital because to attack the dao effectively you needed a lot of money and so it was like we were there was a lot of on the social side it was finding all the curators getting their uh private keys you know it's hard to get people's private keys i can't believe they were handing them out but uh so we got their private keys we're asking other people for dow tokens and ether so that we can achieve the attacks uh in a faster way and it was just kind of a waiting game until eventually someone actually started hacking and that's when it was wild it was really crazy we were you know i mean people still have gas issues to this day right we were having gas issues like it was uh it felt it felt like a military operation but at the same time we are not military people you know we were just hackers trying to make it work and then once we ended up rescuing the funds then it was like kind of just pushing for the hard fork as well as you know there were ended up being eight nine different hackers that all had money in it so we had to figure out how do we you know we we didn't stop you know it was just this constant kristoff is holding down the hard fork stuff let's let's figure out like the hard fork will work you know but what if it doesn't and that was left harrison i and jordy and and the crew because after we stole 100 million dollars from the dow some people didn't want to be any part of it anymore so the robin hood group became the white hat group much smaller group and uh and we just kept practicing like how are we going to hack the other hackers and how can we engineer a solution to get into the dark dark dow right and i'm sure you talk about all this stuff in your book yeah and so for people dark down was the split dower child out where the hacker had siphoned the funds the three point six four million each the thirty thirty one percent of the ethan the dow um left harris what about you what was your life like during this period not fun it was uh yeah basically like this like basically what cliff described described very accurately since the night of the i think it was evening right their initial white hat attack yeah like tuesday night around 7 p.m i think if i remember correctly yeah like you explained how it happened in the book i don't know how much detail you want me to go i think that it was mostly accurate but we also like i think we served we said the same private key and just had different people do the attacks at scripts so the initial attack was successful in taking everything out of the dao except for the last remaining in which jordy had a different contract that he had made and that was basically i remember it was different than mine and it just didn't have the already made attack so it he just made it work and take the last four million and from that point on grief had this amazing spreadsheet i still have a link to it i think where he just uh he had i organized everything very very nicely so i i still think that this is a very i think you probably had access to it right because you use the same name that we used there in the book yeah i i can't remember if i had access to the doc or if griff gave me a screenshot of it but i i'm now actually listening to my own audiobook because i have never heard it all the way through and earlier today i went through that section i was narrating it to myself um and yeah it's very intense because also if i remember correctly it was like color coded so it's like very you know there are like certain days where it's just like you can tell you guys were like ah we have to do this thing right now there's like a lot of exclamation points too so basically griff's job there was exactly like gathering before the initial attack gather the funds to do them because this required a lot of effort and no doubt against i don't remember no mostly tokens it required yeah no it required um was it tao toki yeah mostly yeah dow tokens to get eth the more dow tokens you had the more ether you could score out of the dow exactly yeah you were sending in down tokens and getting out you yeah we had the whales that gave us the tokens and then just use them for them for draining but also the fact that there were many copycats that indeed attacked at the same time as us which is what caused us to actually take action finally all those copycats got funds and they had to be followed and it was people like grief who organized i think that basically organized the entire thing on the dates so when did this guy attack when is his two-week period uh how much do we have there and he was basically counting like we have this brexit that counts how many tokens do we have in its uh dark dao which we basically followed all of them in the original chain at least yeah this is i think like this was one of the hardest parts of the book for me to explain you know there were just so many dows and like the money was kind of different types of money like some of them were dark meaning they were they looked you know nefarious like people who had hacked for bad reasons and then others were people like trying to innocently take their money out and and just you know be like i'm done with the dow um and and i i had a very hard time explaining this because this got super super super complicated but um but the point is i mean it was much worse for you because you were trying to chase all that money all right so let's move ahead to the hard part by the way so we are going to skip over a very very interesting side story with the dow which is kind of crazy and mind-blowing and i if you have not read the book yet just please read it because there is something really crazy a nice a nice little subplot going on here that is yeah very mind-blowing all right so see you guys hard fork after the hard fork did you expect ethereum classic to survive and um you know once you saw it did survive how did you feel about that i in no way expected that they're in classics survive it didn't make any sense to me at the time uh now it makes more sense but at the time it was like everybody who had ether got etc why wouldn't they just sell it like who cares there's no development going on on etc there's nothing it just i i even it took me a while to call it etc i was pretty irreverent i was calling it dead f right it's like you can use your dead ass for nothing just sell it you know uh so but i don't know maybe other people had thoughts i also did not expect it at all it's more because also we had hard forks before also the ethereum and nobody did care about the minority chain um mostly there was a nice blog post by vitalik recently about legitimate the chisholm i cannot say this in english legitimacy yeah to say like is it legit or not and legit this also came with like retail like the ethereum foundation like the community in general and it did feel all the time nobody wanted to change so meaning even though somewhere against the hot fork they mostly said but i will follow whatever the maturity of the ethereum community will do that's what it failed before so meaning i did not expect at all that there was a large group would say i don't follow the maturity i want to make this chain kind of work and to port it and make listing the coin so i did not even think about selling because i did not think that someone would actually list it or it would continue to be mined so i was totally surprised by it love terrace i think that here i was very much um how do you say like affected by grief's comments because i didn't know anything about you know what he called sitcoins back then or altcoins or i went with what he said and thought that may there is no way and i also like didn't imagine that this could happen and i just thought that this would not exist this can't exist it's a joke and then it actually existed and stayed but i didn't expect it let's just keep it sword and say that i just would not have expected the film classic to to survive it made no sense and then now so i know kristoff and left terrace have read this part of the book and griff hasn't because he just got the book yesterday but now that you guys have read this part do you guys have more understanding about like why that happened i'm just curious even later i kind of understood what i mean the things that you explain in there after the stuff with switzerland there are some things that are not in in the book i think that we we were contacted by some of these people and i realized that there was a lot going on behind the scenes that i didn't know at the time and if i had known those i would have expected for it to to stay that there are powers that want it to stay because of financial reasons but at the time which time means like the first days after the hard fork no sorry listing go from poloniex that is what made it uh for for for me and everybody else i think the listing by polonics meant that it survives at the time uh i thought that no this can't be serious and that it's a joke and the poloniex makes a mistake and we'll just you know we can just get free money but then well yeah i realized it a lot later yeah in hindsight i mean also when i read the book i have been very naive and i have lived in this ethereum bubble so to say i was never like a hardcore bitcoin even though i i love bitcoin still do um i never was so much engaged in this community and so i that's why i did at a time i didn't anticipate there was so much hate against ethereum because they may be missed out on the crowd sale but it just hated ethereum because it had like a pre mine how they call it so because of all those reasons there's a lot of negative energy also is a lot of money and also there's a lot of influence on those exchanges and of course on the crypto community in general so and realizing now of course the power was there the financial incentive was there there was enough reason to hate ethereum and to see this is a chance like also especially the hard fork goes against bitcoin philosophy a lot so this was a lot of reason for them to stay on the other side so it makes a lot of sense today but again i was in my little crypt not crypto bubble ethereum bubble and from that bubble that bubbles point of view didn't make sense yeah and so for people like left terrace was sort of referencing that subplot i mentioned and and you're right he i think shortly after this he understood probably why it survived or why it would survive but okay so why don't we just quickly catch everybody up on what you've done since all all these events in ethereum just kind of the last few years and like if you could just talk about kind of how people in ethereum treat you or maybe they don't know that you are involved in this i don't know but i'm just curious to hear well i think the story starts really with defcon too that's when i like this was shortly after that and i was really really afraid of going there like i was really like even on the airport i was saying like what if like just some crazy chinese guy just like on the street just yeah punches me or whatever like i was really even afraid afraid of physical violence against me so i did not know what to expect when going there i actually that's all this thing you cannot read this in the book but i think it's okay to say now i was not allowed to speak about the dao i wanted to speak about the tao and i want to like what happened and how i feel about it and i was if i wanted to talk about it i was not getting a talk so like ming was really really strict because of sec they feel like that ethereum would be connected to a dao this was like a forbidden topic i was not allowed to mention it they were like standing there with the trigger to like shut me down and have a do because they didn't know if i would talk about it now so this was like that's why i had to talk about smart contract security which seems like a bit boring after the dao i mean sure it's also related but it would expect me to speak about what happened but i was really not allowed to so i made a more or less boring talk about smart contact security like what we learned what should be done in the future and but in the end defcon 2 80 of the talks were about smart contract security like this was every talk saying the same so in the end yes i at least said a little bit like thank you very much for like what you got i'm sorry for what happened kind of and i tried to give a little bit of like the emotion which i actually felt all the time what i really wanted to say and i got a very positive feedback and during defcon so many people came to me and said thank you and like what you went through and like very very positive i was very relieved to feel this way because it meant for me i can continue to be a part of this community i can continue to work in the space of course there will be people who hate me for what will happen but the maturity of people understand and support me and this is like everything which came after it was more or less the same of course the closer you get to the tower from a time scale perspective the more people remember me and about this but now six years later if you go somewhere people don't know about dao anymore maybe something happened like there but only really people when we are in the community at that time know my involvement or our involvement and know me so this kind of time for gifts lots of things so after like one year or two it was not that big of an issue anymore and i stayed in this ecosystem as an entrepreneur building slogan and as we sold it now i'm building a venture studio there's lots of projects in this direction so that's future but yes i made more or less stayed there as an entrepreneur and trying to build things on ethereum i had similar feelings with christoph i was not welcome anymore in this because i had a part in the dao i didn't want to go to defcon 2 i was afraid for similar reasons but also for reasons you have in the book violence and problems because of some characters but there i felt uh so just talking to people i just felt uh relieved like completely relieved there was not a single person who was aggressive there was everybody was saying you guys did great and that's without anybody knowing what uh i did there like from um so this is something that actually has pissed me off to this day at that point i decided that after leaving um that subplot that i would never talk about what happened with the hack that i was not involved in even though some people mentioned my name i never said that i did this and grief i had to ask him to not mention my name and that's why i was not known to be much but like the only thing is some reddit posts that uh some people assume that i am part of the robinhood group but i never actually said anything until basically you contacted me or maybe matthew lising is the first guy that i talked to but i think that we talked more than anything else in more detail i mean back in in dev control i felt just just by mentioning that i worked in the dao and that it was you know like bad time everybody was just saying really good things nobody said oh you guys uh you know like did something wrong or we hate you or anything like that and something that i think that christoph sometimes is a bit too um sigh he didn't just get positive feedback probably this in the video but you will see that he got a standing ovation at the end of his uh uh devcon 2 talk and it was a very very uh it was a very emotional moment i think uh at least for me because i was there in the crowd and it felt as if you can still be part of the community because after living there i really thought that so after leaving that subplot i thought that i would be out of crypto completely and christoph's talk and the reaction to it and the experiences they had in shanghai basically made me change my mind completely yeah yeah i watched that video and i chronicle it in the book because also it was emotional even just watching it for me so um yeah it was it was really lovely how people treated you afterward i felt rip sorry did you want to talk a little bit about what you had done since and how people treated you sure and and left harris is totally underselling his contributions as always uh to the space after he left from raiden and all the brain bot work uh and to starting roki uh which is like oh yeah i forgot to mention uh what i did since then yeah sorry uh yeah i joined brainbot we made a payment channel network a layered what they call now layer 2 but i left that position at some point and then i started my own company which is like a privacy preserving portfolio tracker an accounting tool for ethereum and many other blockchains and yeah that's what i'm doing right now like my own thing i want to add one small thing which was a hard thing is like we kept the names lock it and continue to reduce it this was like the decision like should we now say well this is over like after what happened many people told us burn down slogging you can create a new company if you want you can even have the same co-founders do even the same thing but don't use locket anymore that's like over we make this like decision to not do this to stand with the name even though the dow happened and all of the stuff even the co-founders stayed together you make right after the doubt decision like we did some consulting i even saw kriff wearing a suit and when it go to us to like a company in berlin and just just selling our time basically and stefan has the fun to all had a task to try to get an investment and if he would not have gotten an investment i think would have shut it down maybe six or twelve months later yeah i think we all had it really easy honestly i feel bad for stefan twall like stefan really got the worst and it it it's unjustified i mean i guess he had already he kind of became the fall guy which was just really sad uh but he had already kind of had tenuous relationships with other people and he did make huge mistakes at the end uh when everything was falling apart so you know uh i think we all had it easy especially me because i was publicly known as part of the white hat group and and uh left harris wasn't publicly known as the white hat group and and obviously christoph wasn't so involved as a wise decision uh he has family and stuff i don't have any of those things you know so i can be a lot more risky yeah so i had it really easy there was lots of love being thrown my way and jordy's way the whole time uh because we were publicly known as fighting day in and day out to to save the dow the best that we could and uh jordy and i actually continued to work together uh to start a few different orgs uh went to dev con 2 and all that stuff but after i think it was after devcon we started giveth and uh we took a lot of the lessons from the dow we created a mini me token contract that kind of um uh you know took a lot of the learnings that we had and applied them okay if we want to create doubts for charity that that could eventually even replace government services then we're gonna need uh secure like people need to be running their own servers and stuff like that so we found a dap node and jordy is now really focused on doing z uh zk evm which is like a roll-up that you can run smart contracts on and i'm still focused on giveth and have also spun out more technic like token engineering focused uh solutions through the common stack and so gibbeth is like really pointed at nonprofits and the common stack is trying to take techniques of funding public goods using token engineering and apply it with the nerds of the nerds kind of applied research and then we hope to pull that into giveth so that's that's what we're working on so a couple of things so one thing i want to say is like people should definitely read the book to find out about the stuff on 12 situation um that is chronicled you know kind of how people perceived him and and what happened to him but one thing that i have to say before i ask you guys the next question is just thank you so much for giving me so much of your time and energy to tell the story you know as accurately as i could because it was a lot of time uh that you guys gave me because obviously just on a technical level this was probably the hardest for sure part of the book that i had to you know describe for people i mean you know i've been covering crypto for years at the point you know when i was reporting this and i had never come across a lot of the things that i was having to explain at this part in the book so you know thank you thank you thank you thank you for helping me with that because i just would not have been able to do it without your help um okay so we went through this whole thing together all these hours of interviews and you know i was working on your story and then the book was going to come out and very very very very late in the process when kind of the book was basically done suddenly there was this break that happened where my sources and i thought that we had figured out who was behind the dow attack so i reached out to you all about this and thank you for keeping that secret between then and when the book actually published because i know that's kind of a long time to keep a secret like that so when i told you that i thought we had found the person and i presented the evidence what were your thoughts and feelings okay let me start then yeah i was surprised i i never expected to hear about the dao hacker i just had given up completely on finding out who it is like to be honest the sapple that you mentioned for me still is the most stressful part i just thought okay the hacker did what he did it just what you know okay but to see the name that you gave there and to remember all our conversations especially the conversations in reddit that we had after the hack and during the towers to actually think that i was talking to the guy who did the actual hack pretending that he is trying to help us oh wait so that's what i didn't understand in the reddit messages with toby is that what you're talking about you thought that he was trying to help you oh interesting because the whatever the original post was was not clear yes it was probably something about i don't remember exactly but some of the attacks that we did and asked him to not go into details or i i don't really remember because he deleted everything later and there is no links to the posts anymore yeah but actually you know what i came across something where i think this came out after my article came out it was something about oh the i think uh actually i can't remember where i came across this i think his idea was to to break this split mechanism i think that's what it was i don't know how i figured this out i can't remember this came i've had the craziest week so at some point in the last few days i think i came across this but anyway could be could be but we were talking about something and he was giving hints out and uh he basically gave them to us no he gave them in public and i think i told him not to do that and then he the last message that i have from him i think i'd even have it in the book was i'm sorry if i messed things up and that's it like in the conversation with the attacker or something like that i'm sorry if i messed things up for you in the dar wars and something like that it's crazy to actually think that this guy pretended to he was talking about the hiking in the third person which of course like if you don't want to say that you're the hiker that's what you do but um yeah i never expected this i would not have expected this because i don't know i really thought that the guy who was the hacker would have been you know like precision strike just do his thing disappear not stay and i mean as you wrote in the thing he was trolling after uh he was being kind of an right so i really had the hacker there is no one in a bit higher regard kind of a guy who just did his thing disappeared and that's it like like satoshi but you telling me who satoshi is yeah so that's how i felt totally i i completely agree i feel like it almost uh took away the mystery that was almost kind of enjoyable to have you know oh no one knows who the doctor is i still you know it's really hard i haven't looked at the evidence yet like in depth i've been in denver and doing my thing for the conference here but you know it's it's really hard to prove unless someone's unless he straight up says oh yeah it was me you know i feel i feel like uh there's there's still a chance that it could just be some mistake that that he's being thrown under the bus and i just i hope that's not the case uh and i it's probably not i i really trust you laura and and your ability to to you wouldn't go out without a real a real person so but at the time like when you told me i just i don't know it feels like it feels anti-climactic honestly it feels like it i almost wish it were just always going to stay a mystery forever i didn't have any interactions with toby toby was more of a developer and we really divided and conquered concord i worked with the non-development side so i think kristoff had probably a lot more internal reactions with it well i was also absolutely surprised i did not expect this to come at up at all because i know that many people tried to find him you know the book by matt listening who really tried to and so that's why i thought this is over there was someone who really really tried and didn't get find him so over for me it was more i after the dow hack i did actually never care about him at all like even during the time um before the hard fork was to be like okay this is someone did it i cannot understand why i don't know him i i know that if he is sophisticated enough technically he can stay anonymous forever um there are not coins out there which give you the privacy you need and there are some ways to somehow cash out without um revealing your identity for me this was like we'll never know him also all the messages we got in between like between the hack and the hard fork i never 100 trusted if they were either true or also like this could completely be played like even if he would say i will give you the money back this could be just like an attempt of like making us do no work for another week or so so that's why i actually completely ignored him i never tried to go after him but nevertheless there were some people actually even before you this was a couple of months or weeks after the dow um even after the hard fought which came to us and say they think they know who it is and they gave us some information from i think was from poloniex where they try to find like some return address or some actually who gave the ether to fund the attack and they gave us some company names they gave us even some some persons who say they think this is the one but since i have not seen the evidence myself i actually said i cannot blame him i cannot do anything because i don't know you might that might be true maybe not and i had contact with some of those people and so i also tried to not blame them to not like say are you the hacker i just completely ignored it so and now you say you have much more evidence and i have not seen it personally but as chris said i trust you um that you have done your job you would not go out with an actual name if you're not humble but unsure so i just hope that i hope it's true like for you that you don't tell anything which is not right of course i hope for him just the best i mean i have no feelings whatsoever towards him and of course he did something which destroyed a lot sometimes i thought about what would happen if you have if you wouldn't have done this and i don't know if something good would have happened i just don't know maybe yes it's got big lots of money in it many people get funded by it yes could also go in a completely wrong direction and it could be like billions in it today and something i would hate all my life that's why i somehow was also relieved that the story was over so i tried to not like since this is out of my control i basically nothing i can do i don't understand the background so i didn't really try to find him or anything but yes i was very surprised that you found him yeah the best part is that the the people who were originally accused of being the dow hacker are no longer are are like free of that stagnation i mean there was there was one conference where left terrorists never accused that's the thing like i i had publicly probably haven't read about that part of the book yet it's probably in chapter nine i guess do you mention anything about your your interaction with one of the suspects yeah i wrote about it i actually i have very friendly relations with one of the co-founders of the original uh company and he he talked to me and said no no no there is no way later like we we came to know each other after that stuff and i mean the evidence that was shown to us was not really it was a circumstance yeah sure but as for the particular hacker like for toby that was unnamed yeah i'm actually really curious about the technical details of um yeah it'd be so cool to see his contract how you guys uh found it yeah that would be really interesting and also i'm glad that back then we didn't like make it public who we thought it was and also not going to them because those guys actually invited me to like a hackathon they met him in berlin i was like politely declining and didn't want to interact with them too much but i never like accuse them and i'm very happy for this today that i didn't so that's why i think also knowing that even people are accusing stefan to all and even us because they think we know what what this this is about so i'm kind of glad that we have this out that we know who it is who it wasn't i think that who it wasn't it's actually even more important yeah definitely there was this one time where jordy left harris and i are talking to one of the dow hacker suspects at a conference and it was it was very civil but we all fcc right we all felt really awkward about it but they're doing good work that's the thing like okay and and i feel like even with toby honestly like yes he destroyed a lot of things but personally i hope that nothing bad happens to him because of this because in the end everyone the only people who lost in the dow were the speculators as much of the chaos that was there like everyone who had dow tokens got eth back plus etc like everyone it's the only hack i know of where everyone made money except for slack of course we got really screwed but everyone everyone else uh really made out okay so i i guess i i just hope that uh you know nothing bad happens he doesn't go to jail or anything i don't i don't think it's necessary at this point it's hard to understand like how he felt back then in terms of like the cultural thinking we never thought about going like to court or asking a lawyer or anybody like this it was still kind of funny money in some way even though it had a real exchange course so it was it's not as criminal as if someone would have stolen that much in dollar like that's how it felt and you could also understand this position of code is law and this bitcoin kind of thinking and kind of even not seeing anything wrong with doing this like i can understand this way of thinking and i think no court no lawyer no normal guy out there can understand how we thought back then it's by saying it's very hard to judge him today based especially also in the amount and amount of money because you cannot really see how we thought back then the ideology the digitalization all of this i i don't know about that but i have a very very different opinion there i am i never was called this law guy i never thought that and i still don't and there is many instances of still of defy hacks and he did something bad i don't what he did was bad i just want to give this perspective how we thought yeah yeah sure i i get that but even back then i remember i still have the dao code is lost green tea said that you gave me man like this is my reminder of that of that that time i never believe cody's law is a developer that scares me if my code would be this makes absolutely i find it nonsensical i hate the term and there is people who are using it today i don't know if you know the index finance hack this this this guy so people today who steal money from uh companies and try to use kodi's law and they are going to court right now in canada somewhere but so for example for me it's a very personal thing after the dao and i think that if this field wants to go forward code can't be law it's my personal opinion and i really hope that basically uh he gets what he deserves that's all like i don't know what that means but i i'm not a forgiving person it's not in my nature i'm sorry well he did take other people money and this was and he did have the opportunity back then to give it back several times and he did not do this this is i think the most serious part about it yeah he could have done so many i think that you also mentioned in the book in the epilogue like grief's opinion on that at least according to the book it says that he could have done so much good and had up humble time like from the time of the hack until the hard fork so many times we tried to contact you said there were posts you know asking him to come forward but yeah he still can send the etc back to the withdrawal contract you know he still could wait there is no withdrawal contract on the ethereum classic chain so he'd have to convert it to the white the white hats we we still have this etc contract and he still could he he could still deposit etc into it and then all the dow token holders could get it back if anybody is listening from anybody who ever had the dow tokens guys you have atc there you can go take a lot of money is sitting there it's a lot of money and we just like guys just go take it it's there it's waiting for you yeah and by the way if you are one of those people please do that because i think that griff is keeping a lot of dow tokens in order he in order to do any rescues that he might need to do and he would like to sell those dow tokens in order to actually use that money for something else so go ahead and take your etc okay and and one last thing i want to clarify earlier just from some of your comments you know i'm not going to say that i 100 for sure know that it was toby hoenish you know what i was saying is the evidence is very good and i presented it all so um you know i wouldn't present it if i didn't think it was very strong and the other sources who worked with me on this they also believe it's strong and chanalysis takes credit for that step of the demixing which obviously that's a very complicated thing to do and that's their little secret sauce that they you know finally revealed to the world but from all the people who worked with me on this we feel that the evidence is is good okay so last bit this is just a funny silly question but people have already been saying things to me like who should play which characters in the movie so by the way just so you know there is no movie yet but people are saying this to me so if that were the case who would you want to either play you or who do you think should play you know the other members of this group someone suggested online not me did i should be played by i hope i pronounce it right check gyllenhaal jake gyllenhaal yes it's some it's not me it's someone else on twitter who proposed this idea so i'm fine with that love terrace now i reveal my complete lack of knowledge about american film actors i have absolutely no idea i know the big names but i mean i know i know i know brad pitt i know like bruce willis but tom cruise left tom cruise or something i don't know no yeah tom cruise no but tom cruise is probably what like 20 years older than left terrace oh that's true it was from the 80s uh maybe exactly the one in the underwear sliding on the ground you know risky business guy that's that's who i think you got okay griff what about you you know people used to say i have a man bun now but i used to have hair that was like kind of like ashton kutcher and people used to say it looked like ashton but you've you had you wore a man bun during the time of the doubt attack because i wrote that in the book yeah oh okay okay but we could still we could do actually with a yeah exactly throw him with a man bun and uh and i think i think he'd get the right vibes too okay all right well you guys thank you both thank you all so much for coming on the show i'm sorry for some of the traumatic memories that we had to dredge up here but i think also it was kind of fun to reminisce it's it's been a while now almost six years so um yeah i hope i hope this was yeah not painful and and maybe somewhat fun no let's also not forget about all the other people who are not here in the core like stefan to al yodi
