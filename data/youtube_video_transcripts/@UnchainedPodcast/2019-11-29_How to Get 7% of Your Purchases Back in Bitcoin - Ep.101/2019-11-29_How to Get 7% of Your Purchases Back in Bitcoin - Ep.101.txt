thanks for having me the day that the show will come out is Black Friday's so I figured it's as good as time as any for people to learn about your service what is lali lali is a easy way for people to earn free Bitcoin when they shop online so Black Friday is the perfect day to tell that to people and how does it work so we partner with top merchants like walmart.com companies like that and they pay us when our users shop their sites and then we send that payment and share that with our users sending Bitcoin to their Lalli wallet I know who are some of the stores that you have as partners we have a lot so we have over 750 partners and we just launched a little over a year ago and so yeah everyone from Walmart Harry's a lot of travel partners like Priceline hotels comm booking.com yeah people can shop for just about any category of groceries really big for us as well but yeah we've been working really hard to secure as many merchant partnerships as possible and I think to this day we have probably more merchant partners than any other Bitcoin or crypto company major major merchants at least and yet we're just really trying to lead the way in mass adoption of Bitcoin and percentage-wise how much can people earn back so our average percent across all merchants is 7 percent but people can earn upwards of forty five percent I believe was is the highest as of today so you can you can earn a serious amount back it's not like credit card points or anything like that we have these direct partnerships with these merchants and we negotiate these rates and because of the the nature of our relationships really what they're paying for is they're they're looking to attract new customers so we're able to negotiate high rates and really pass back the margins to the consumers that maybe want to shop somewhere and earn Bitcoin instead of any sort of other incentive mechanism and so it's free found money and we work really hard to bring that to our users how many users do you have at this point we're not sharing the exact number yet but in the high tens of thousands and okay and yeah you launched in August 2018 so I guess that's pretty good traction and how much have your customers aren't in Bitcoin so far so the average just past $30 on for the average shopper across all wallet so the thing that I think is really interesting about lolly is is the activity I think and you know correct me if I'm wrong but I believe that we have the most active Bitcoin wallet today because it's not it's not just a wallet that people are sending back and forth they're actually earning actively so every time they make a purchase it becomes an active Bitcoin wallet so it's a lot of transactions leading up to the average of $30 and clearly we have Wales you know on the platform that are earning a lot more than $30 but it's a lot of a lot of uh I guess Toshi's to add up to $30 as being the average Bitcoin back and then also a lot of our users you have come on in the last few months leading up to the holidays and our exponential growth over the last few months what percentage of your users cash back out to USD and what percentage holds their bitcoins that's a great question so the vast majority never take it out to cash we've had I actually would have been surprised with how many people don't take out cash so we do you know you can transfer to any Bitcoin wallet any Bitcoin exchange that you want will actually teach you how to do it because we're I really want to teach people about cold storage I want to teach people about you know paper wallets and and you know best ways to practice safety with their storage so you can transfer to any any address but you can as you mentioned transfer out to US dollar to any US bank account as of today the interesting thing is like it's been so few people that have used the USD transfer I think people you know they have the choice that they either use Ebates for cash back or they use us for Bitcoin back or SATs back so they make the decision so if they were gonna use Ebates they would that they would just take the cash if they were gonna use us they can get free Bitcoin and so what percentage just keep it in lolly versus transferring it to their own wallet the vast majority keep it in lolly I think that were we're sort of part a Bitcoin Education company and part of Bitcoin rewards company and I think it's important and we have to constantly remind ourselves of that because it's it's so important that like I we think that we're nearing 50 percent of our users have never had Bitcoin before and that were there first wallet which is really exciting and and there's you know I think that we get a lot of questions about okay what do I do with it now that I have like five dollars in Bitcoin or ten dollars in Bitcoin and I you know the honest answer is like you know we want people to hold it for now I think that bitcoin is not at a point where it should be spent in my in my opinion I think it's not a medium yet it's a store of value and Lolly works as a way to found you know a business model to create found money for our users and encourage them to hold on to it because the you know since we launched Bitcoin was at 3,600 a little over a year ago and it sends doubled actually more more than doubled in some cases so our users have earned two times the amount of you know what Annie Bates has or any other cashback company because they held the ones that sold you know as any of us you know sold when we bought Bitcoin you're sort of quickly discouraged to do that because you see the price historically go up and how did you come up with the idea for lolly it's I guess it's like with any any idea it's like it's never one thing and I'll be I'll be short with the the story but basis my team and I same team is lolly we started a company about eight years ago and it was we built the leading e-commerce gateway what we ultimately did is we were one of the inventors of the buy button giving people the ability to buy natively anywhere and we had this mission of democratizing commerce how do we give everyone in the world the ability to connect with each other and buy and sell natively anywhere how do we take you know something like Instagram and Pinterest and all these news publications and blogs and let people buy right there and my thesis was that the the best products would rise to the top and the best sellers would would make the most money sort of you know I think that's that was the the dream of cosmic I was like 22 years old and clearly you know there's a lot of learnings along the way but a couple years in I was at a bar crashing on couches in New York you know pitching a merchant selling the dream and I into Ryan Shay if you know him and I'd stack yes yes and and so I bumped into him and he had just sort of gotten into into Bitcoin at the time and he was I was you know asking him what he was into and he was some about Bitcoin and he had that moment that I think a lot of us have had where he was just so inspired by the principles of it and was explaining it to me and everything he said resonated so deeply with me because of what I was building with cosmic I Bitcoin is the democratization of commerce directly tied to a currency and we've never seen that in the entire world it's it's like an asset that everyone in the entire world you know with with an internet connection can own and everything that we were building with cosmic was working towards that so we actually like spent a little bit of time I wouldn't say we pivoted at any point but we tested the market by going to a lot of our top merchants and saying hey would you want this as a payment tool because you know we were dealing with five buttons and hooking into 90 different payment gateways so we were at this like core of payments and merchants just didn't want it there was no demand for it is interesting as I thought the technology was the volatility like really you know is still an issue and so we sort of learned then that Bitcoin I didn't think was going to be have the pervasiveness that a lot of people thought it was gonna have in the payments world even though it was amazing with no intermediaries the direct transfers the no middlemen I I think that it still has incredible principles for medium exchange in the future but as of today and as of five years ago it was not the best me of exchange so anyway fast forward we ended up getting acquired by our biggest customer which was PopSugar to come in and power 1.2 billion in retail revenue running through shopstyle one of the largest e-commerce shopping sites in the world at the time so we ended up coming in there we grew about 10x post acquisition really I think you know proved the demand for what we were building and about a year in Ebates the largest cashback company in the u.s. came and bought us away from PopSugar and a divestiture and and so we were at Ebates the biggest cashback company for a year and you know gave them our technology we we got to learn their business model we get to learn you know how their she works I got to meet just about every retailer in North America through the combination of cosmic through shop style with a lot of fashion merchants and eBay it's with a lot of mass merchants so after about a year we parted ways and I I just kept coming back afterwards to this idea of the biggest problem with Bitcoin was distribution a lot of my friends that had gotten into it had gotten into it because they had invested very few had gotten into because they mined and none of my friends that had gotten into it had gotten into it easily it was always like they had taken a big risk they had Tet you know they had survived a bear run it was like not pretty and I wouldn't recommend it to my sister my mom my dad my friends from back home and I think even to this day I've never recommended anyone buy Bitcoin so I ended up kept coming back to this idea of cash back but for Bitcoin as a way to distribute Bitcoin to more people and set people up with wallets so I you know reassembled my team with a very similar dream and we ended up launching about six months later I was unlike you know five years ago I was amazed with the amount of merchants that we got in the first six months one because we had a lot of the partnerships already and we had made them a lot of money over the last eight years but - I think they were like really interested in Bitcoin but couldn't quite rationalize using Bitcoin as a payment mechanism but they could use it as a reward mechanism alright we're gonna discuss how this works on the back end in a moment but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible are you interested in

interest every week join the over 1 million others and download the crypto comm app today back to my conversation with the Alex Adelman of lolly how does this work on the back end I'm presuming the merchants don't actually have Bitcoin on hand to give you as a percentage of each of the purchases are you just like constantly buying Bitcoin to transfer to your customers correct so our merchants pay us in in US dollars at this point the beautiful part about the the business model is that it scales I think way faster and easier than a cash back system so to start we you know we have to work with the archaic rails that were given but the beautiful part is that retailers can pay us in any currency and we can give out into the currency that has the most value for the consumers which for our customer its Bitcoin and because we can distribute it anywhere in the world hypothetically that makes it really easy for for lolly to scale so over the first year I think you know part of my learnings from my last company with cosmic is that focus is everything and building you know a company and we've really focused on the u.s. to drive as much gmv for merchants our top merchants in particular as possible to really build up leverage and it's part of a long play I would say a five to ten year play of building up trust with the merchants and proving value and and ultimately having leverage because in two three four years I would love to go to Walmart to go to booking.com and i would love to say hey we've driven you a hundred million dollars in revenue this is a real bitcoin is real the demand is real and we want to offer a way more efficient frictionless method of payment and one that serves you one that you don't have to use the credit cards companies you don't have to use the the banks for fulfillment you can you can accept bitcoin you can do it with little to no fees whether that be through the lightning network or whatever exists at that time and we can make a really easy way for people to not only be rewarded in bitcoin but also for people to pay with Bitcoin and remove a lot of the the underlying tax that we are we don't even know about on fiat rails and the way that you do it is you wait to transfer the bitcoins until after the return window of that particular merchant so you know in many cases people don't receive their Bitcoin until like 30 or 90 days later but so obviously because bitcoin is volatile let's say purchase something for a hundred bucks and then your service promises me five percent of that purchase back and so I'm supposed to get five dollars worth of Bitcoin back but if between the time I purchase and the time I actually get my Bitcoin from lolly let's say that the price of Bitcoin doubles then how much Bitcoin do I receive do I get five dollars worth based on the price at the time that I bought which would be worth ten dollars by the time I get it or will it be five dollars based on the current price which would then be two dollars and fifty cents of what I actually spent yes so it it basically it really depends on the merchant some merchants pay out immediately it really depends on the return period so if if a merchant is has a 30-day return period then you'll get your Bitcoin after 30 days and I think we're right but but did you understand my question like let's say within the 30 days the price of Bitcoin doubles right so I think a lot of our users just are excited to I mean it's it's one of those things where they believe in the principles and so they're getting Bitcoin so but I mean it could also dip it could increase so really it's like you're getting your Bitcoin back when you whenever the merchant pays us so it's yeah I think that that's like most of our users are okay with it very few they ask questions and then they're then they're okay with it okay so it's based on when the return window closes not when you actually make the purchase correct there's some creative ways in the future that we're planning for right now that we haven't announced or released yet where we can minimize our risk because really if we buy it and then somebody returns it we are held with the risk and due to the nature of us being just a small start-up I think it's really difficult to unless we want to go raise an absurd amount of capital and basically build a bank on top of Bitcoin from day one and dilute ourselves into oblivion there's really like not a lot of incentive to get really creative on the financial side yet when we become when we get to scale I think that there's going to be more creative ways like the more the more shoppers we have the more merchants we have the more you know money flowing through the system that we have the more we can do to reward immediately and and then clearly you know you wouldn't get that Bitcoin but at least it would be locked in at the price and then if you don't return then you get the Bitcoin at that price okay and one other thing I want to ask that about your is about your business model because similar services like Ebates and honey collect personal data what is your business model where do you make money on this yeah so to be very clear we we do not make money on selling data and we never will I think it's it's really important to understand I think that's one of the like I think one of the funniest things of working at Ebates is people's misconception they're just like it sounds too good to be true and that was the biggest problem with their business and credit they built a 5 billion dollar business but it was almost it was too good to be true was like sort of the the feedback like why are you where am I getting this money are you selling my data and the real answer is like you know I can't speak to Ebates but lolly does not sell data we do not we're not incentivized to it to sell data I think we would lose the majority of our customers if ever sold data and clearly we'd have to disclose that if we if we sold data at any point I think in the future people I look at like the control of data as people being able to opt in or opt out and people might want to earn more by sharing certain parts of their data that would be aggregated and anonymized so I might share that I am between the ages of 20 and 25 and that I'm a male and that I live in the US but I wouldn't want to share any more information and thus I should be able to share that and monetize hmm off of that that data so that's how I look at the future of data control I hope that we play a big part in setting precedent for data control and data management and you know ultimately personal data monetization but at this point no we only make money from our merchants we do not make money from selling any data and and if I as long as I'm in control we will never we never will we actually don't even store the vast majority of it because we don't want to even be responsible for it our merchants are literally just paying for the customer to transact and that's the only piece that we need to let the let the merchant know that user 1 2 3 4 5 is buying on you know site X and they need to get rewarded in that moment so earlier when you said that about 50% of your users are new people who never held Bitcoin before how do you know that a lot of it is from customer support and seeing like we get a lot of like requests that are that we categorize in internally as like what what type of user that is and so I think it's like a creative way of trying to figure out who our user base is and we can say like there's you know very clear names that are like female names and male names and so our estimate there is around 30% of our users we estimate our female and and clearly 70% are male and then I think that if I right in thinking that might be one of the highest percentage of female crypto users amongst all parties it's for I think the last public data that I saw which I am Not sure you know how accurate was but it was I think you know it was a it seemed like a reputable source it was 4% was the average crypto project was female four percent female so you know I think if if we are right about this thirty percent which I think we're it probably off by maybe at most five to ten percent up or down I I think that it's five to ten percentage points or five to ten percent if I like it like a like a variable of five to ten percent between thirty percent thirty percent so so it would like I think at its lowest we're probably twenty percent female and at our highest we're probably forty percent female okay and one other thing is that you did say that theoretically this could be done anywhere in the world but in your fa Q's it only it says that you only support the US which I didn't even know what that meant like does that mean that you'll that only US businesses are your partners or only people with us shipping addresses addresses can sign up or is this for US citizens or what does it mean that you only support the US and why if if and why theoretically arete eclis this can be done anywhere in the world yes it's it's a great question I think that the biggest thing is focus and and in scale you know we are a small start-up we made a decision not to raise an absurd amount of money to start to scale this thing but if you look at this as just a startup remove the Bitcoin side and remove the economies of scale that we have over the next several years from working on top of Bitcoin rails instead of fiat rails there's there's a lot of exciting advantages there to start we are eight we're a small start-up and I would love to see an example of a startup that is you know in structure similar to ours that has scaled internationally from day one so it's the biggest thing is like when every country that we go to we have to deal with new financial regulations in those countries the beautiful part about our business is that we don't have to deal with the independent banks for each country because if you think about the model for Ebates they're limited by the making partners to do like ACH transfers or to do big fat checks if you're familiar with their model and you know people wait they get four checks every quarter and you get your big fat check in the mail and that's sent by you know a banking partner and so there's so many things that have to be put in place every time they scale to a new country and so it actually inhibits their business from scaling quickly I mean there are five billion dollar company and they're only in a few countries to this day so I think it was four billion by the way that they sold for they sold for one billion but what they're valued at the estimated value internally honey was just sold for 4 billion oh oh right right sorry No okay thank you for correcting me of course I think it's like a neat space so it's I'd be surprised if anyone's really following it over the years but I clearly I've been in space for a while and been following it very very closely yeah but and so then can you define what it means that you only support the US yes sorry so we we only support US citizens right now because that's what we're legally required to do and we're we're trying really hard to like be compliant like legally compliant so that we can scale I think that's incredibly important for any any crypto related business right now and we're intentionally like you know waiting on the on the merchant partnership side to because we don't do any sort of like schemes or hacks we work directly with merchants we do need merchants that are international as well so that's the other component luckily I've worked with a lot of Canadian merchants in the past I work with a lot of European merchants and Southeast Asian merchants from the last eight years so we have the we have the relationships now it's about actually establishing the partnerships and then localizing our sites and then of course fraud is a little bit it's not a little bit it's it's higher when you go outside the US in a lot of cases so we have to be mindful because if you look at a lot of these reward type businesses fraud is is a big issue and we learned a lot of I think industry secrets that a lot of people who are just like building businesses in the space do not know that like Ebates is a fraud detection company it's a rewards company but part of the thing that makes it so unique is their incredible at fraud detection and those are some of the practices that I think break these businesses early on and we have to be mindful when we scale this business internationally to be mindful of that the other piece is you know regulations so you know getting fence and licenses in Canada is you know it is a big thing and a lot of it you can self a test but in some countries you can't so making sure that when we scale internationally we want to see that I think the exciting part about our business is that we built it very much in public we are very active on Twitter if you follow us there it's trial Olli is the handle and we have a massive international following so the demand is there and we are scaling internationally in the goal is January 2020 to launch our next country in 2020 okay and I you guys actually did and now it's a partnership with Alibaba but you didn't actually have a partnership with them so what happened there so no we did have a partnership with them and if you kind of look at like they said that you didn't look at every look at how they said it I you know don't want to get into the legal battle clearly with with Alibaba but there was a lot of creative wordsmithing there so if you look at the final article on on a coin Telegraph that published our response to their denial I think that it makes it very clear we have clear like legal documents that show that we had a partnership with them and if you look at everything going on in the last 3-4 months with China and everything they're doing to ban crypto Bitcoin and and as they push their own native government currency I think you can kind of like you know put two and two together and see really what actually happened and I think it's really interesting to see the sort of the sensor of media that we saw at least and just straight denial of facts that we presented so I think some journalists had to publish what Alibaba told them but we we presented clear facts that we had a partnership with them and yeah when we we had been driving sales tens of thousands of dollars of sales to Aliexpress which is clearly owned by Alibaba Group for the last three or four months as we were testing our first Chinese partnership then we launched on singles day with Alibaba calm and we did it through an agency that represents them and gave us full rights to use the Alibaba comm brand we have had a direct partnership where we have a direct partnership with them for three or four months whether that they communicated internally at you know what they're wanting in one of the biggest companies in the world I don't blame them for not communicating properly but it's it's it was it was a crazy week I'll say that okay all right well we're way over time but one last very quick question right now you only offer Bitcoin is there a plan to offer any other cryptocurrencies I'm waiting for another cryptocurrency to prove itself to be more valuable than Bitcoin I'm in no way dogmatic I try to keep a very open mind but I think Bitcoin is the the best store of that long-term store value and the most technologically advanced and distributed at this point so you know we're in the business of giving people something that they value and and so we if we just offer it a bunch of coins that were going up and down I don't think it would be a very good experience so right now we're hyper focused on Bitcoin I am a big believer in Bitcoin over a long period of time I think it will serve its value to society and I think in a lot of ways it's already served its value to society but in the future if something comes along that is better than Bitcoin or proves pros alia to society and in a deep way I would consider it okay all right well it's been great having you on the show thank you for coming undone confirmed thank you so much for having me don't forget next up is the news recap stick around for this weekend crypto after this short break will the world follow France and advocate banning privacy coins will government-backed stable coins become the new Fiat are distributed and peer to peer exchanges just a flash in the pan the answer is maybe virtual currencies can flourish and create a new private and more versatile economy but that grand vision can't happen without keeping crypto clean and that requires support of governments and accountability for bad actors

in to this week's news recap just wanted you all to know that I'm recording this on Wednesday so if some major news breaks Thursday well I guess I'll cover it next week also I wanted to say happy Thanksgiving to all my US listeners I hope you had a wonderful meal and took a moment to think about what you are grateful for I am thankful to all of you for listening to my sources for sharing their expertise and time and to my amazing staff Chris Anthony Dan Josh and the team at seal K transcription now on to the show the first headline this week Vitalik on hard problems in cryptocurrency five years ago Vitalik wrote about 16 hard problems in cryptocurrency and last friday he revisited the problems to see how the solutions to them are progressing scalability was number one and he says that since 2014 there's been great theoretical progress which is pending more real-world evaluation he also says ASIC resistant proof of work has been solved as far as possible if you're interested in the technical details on some of these other issues that have had less progress definitely check out his post Bram Cohen creator of BitTorrent and Shia took photonic to task picking apart some of his points beginning with quote for blockchain scalability vitaly talks about on chain scaling was is the only option of course it isn't the only option payment channel networks are much more appealing in many ways and are becoming a real thing Mustafa al Bassam had some good rejoinders to bram reasonable people realized the only scaling layer one or layer two and not both is done only in the Bitcoin space there are layer 1 and layer 2 opposing tribes in the community next headline tribalism incoherent nasty and immature without getting into too much detail on this the response to Fatah league's blog post basically devolved in this into this conversation about whether or not aetherium is a scam normally it wouldn't even cover something that's not only not news but essentially a baseless claim but it's Thanksgiving so why not just give voice to a sensible opinion placeholders Chris Byrne iski tweeted tribalism is the biggest drain on Kryptos human resources that I see today treble toxicity drives newcomers away has caused valuable talent to leave the industry and Klaus the thinking of the committed to do to those that aren't deep in crypto we all look like part of the same movement it makes no sense that a movement attack itself we end up looking incoherent nasty and immature who wants to join such a movement meanwhile traditional finance is trapped a negative interest rate experiment capitalism is no longer working for the majority and faith in our institutions is crumbling a perfect opportunity for us to unboard more contributors and yet instead we sit here bickering he concludes lastly unless something is provably a scam move on blog stream is on a scam just as a theorem was not a scam someone having different subjective values in yours does not equal a scam the market will do the rest save your time and energy for more valuable contributions next headline the by nan Shanghai office what really happened after the block reported last week that finances Shanghai office had been raided by police and enclosed by nancy EO cheng feng jiao threatened to sue the block eventually the block had to walk back the bit about the police raid but stood by its assertion that there had been a Shanghai office that had been closed first let's cus whether or not the office existed Rena Smith of crypto cent did some digging and concluded that one of the offices was registered to Bobby Finance which has some of the same executives his finance including co-founder and chief marketing officer yee-ha she concludes quote finance did have a hub in Shanghai through Bobby Finance though the police did not raid their offices the blocks underlying reporting holds up despite their misuse of words as PBOC authorities did visit the office based on reports from the shanghai state-run media now let's turn to the threat of lawsuits fortunes david morris said this about the kerfuffle quote the absurd contortions by finance make just slightly more sense in light of pressures from china's government finance is officially based in Malta but zhao was born in china and the company appears to be working to expand the business there but the lack of clear rule of law in China makes such expansion subject to the whims of CCP leadership that means that Chinese Communist Party leadership and the raid / visit came just days after the People's Bank of China order to crack down on crypto scams and exchanges by pushing back on the blogs reporting buying it finance may somehow be hoping to curry favor with Chinese authorities finally this week's fun bits I actually
