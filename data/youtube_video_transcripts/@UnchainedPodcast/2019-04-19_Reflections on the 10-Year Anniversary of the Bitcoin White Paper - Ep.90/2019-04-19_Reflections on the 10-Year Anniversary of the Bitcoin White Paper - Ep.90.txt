to discuss our two reporters who cover crypto nathaniel popper of the New York Times and Paul vania of the Wall Street Journal both of whom have written books about Bitcoin and crypto Nathaniel wrote digital gold and Paul co-authored both the age of cryptocurrency and the truth machine with Michael Casey also previous guest on the podcast welcome to thanyou land Paul thanks for having me hi I'm just gonna start with a really broad question ten years after the Bitcoin white paper what are the main thoughts you have about Bitcoin or crypto in general oh well let's see Nathaniel do you want to share what you were gonna be writing for the ten year anniversary i I don't have anything planned currently I guess maybe I should get going on something but I you know I mean I think the biggest picture it's sort of been more successful obviously than anybody could have imagined when that white paper came out and the first people were reading it but I think it's it's sort of gone in all these different directions then I think the white paper would have indicated so it sort of been successful but in in different ways than I think people might have anticipated and you know the ways in which things go and take their own form and go in their own direction is I think one of the most interesting elements of it to me yeah you know I one thing I think is very interesting is people like to compare Bitcoin to the Internet they always talked about the dot-com boom and I think what they kind of miss about that is if you think about the birth of the Internet and the birth of Bitcoin and then track their timelines out ten years well the birth of the internet was the late 60s so ten years on from the internet the late 70s nobody had heard of it it was still basically a project in a lab the difference with Bitcoin is that Bitcoin went viral and it became this sort of phenomenon and it became this big thing and I think that's why people kind of compare it to the dot-com boom so I think that brought a lot of expectations with it that weren't necessarily fair I don't think ten years on from Bitcoin being born as an idea you should have expected this thing to become a fully-fledged you know what we can argue about what it was supposed to be I mean person I think it was just supposed to be digital cash what it was supposed to be I don't think that ten years on it necessarily that you could have expected it would have been that fully formed and done and ready and it's out there but I also think that because of that that mania that a lot of expectations got heaped onto it and I don't think it was I just don't think it was necessarily fair to have some of those on but they existed they were there you had this big speculative boom and now everybody now there's you know however much money is involved in this sector right now is involved in it and people have expectations of it so I think it kind of like what in saying Hill said I think it kind of became more than people expected but not exactly what people expected yeah actually I'm gonna ask you about that in one second but I actually also just want to answer my own question a little bit because what you were saying about how you know that's comparison with the Internet ten years afterward nobody had heard of it like obviously with Bitcoin the internet already existed you know and so I feel like that's partially why the timeline got sped up and then the other thing is that when I just think back to the very beginning where you know this white paper was quietly released on this mailing list that nobody cared about a very obscure and even on the mailing list not that many people were interested in it and then here you have you know in on the eve of the 10-year anniversary of the white paper you've got fidelity saying like okay we're gonna allow you know we're gonna enable check institutions to trade it you have this new venture with the International continental exchange you know backed that's coming online Goldman's investing in bit Co like I feel like there's this kind of crazy validation that just I feel like is so unlikely that anybody would have predicted back when people were paying $10,000 for two pizzas or sorry 10,000 bitcoins for two pizzas so so I was curious actually cuz for both of you I know that you kind of covered I think like financial things before so it's just curious you know just as reporters how does Bitcoin compare to what you'd been covering before previously well I mean I've been covering its before that so you know they're crazy and rubbing it down and certainly if I was doing it I mean you know from like 2005 to 2013 until I found heard about Bitcoin yeah I saw a lot during that time so it's it's hard to say that it's not hard to say Bitcoin is definitely unique from what I was doing beforehand as big as what I was doing beforehand was you know what I mean the financial markets are obviously a huge global story but there are very difference I mean Bitcoin was just like nothing I really experienced before and I doubt it's like anything all over experience again you know kind of have this this front-row seat at something being born it's something just kind of coming together organically on this global scale it's it's sort of underworld but it's also sort of Silicon Valley it's it's a rebel currency but it's also this big tech innovation I just have all the aspects of it and there were kind of the things that once I grasped that I was immediately why I wanted to write a book about it but I think it's just it is like nothing I ever was around before in terms of a story to tell yeah I mean I was covering actually similar stuff financial markets Wall Street and I think I think the biggest sort of difference from sort of reporters viewpoint for me was that there were kind of institutions and authorities and the things in the in the markets I was covering before and you sort of knew where to go to sort of get good data and and sort of get good views people with historical knowledge of things who could put things in perspective and I think one of the things that's been so hard for reporters with Bitcoin is that it's not at all clear who is in charge obviously because to some degree nobody's in charge but particularly early on it was just so hard to know who you could trust and and not not you know just sort of who who had a good perspective but who even was you know who there was no there was no background there people didn't have reputations on the line so that they could cut you know somebody could come in and lie about what was happening or what they were doing and they didn't have as much to lose as somebody who you know covered the financial markets and had a job that they would lose if they were lie and they were people didn't have jobs and in 2013 in this space there was nothing to lose and so it was therefore sort of much harder to know who to believe and I think sort of trying to piece that together over time has been really hard it continues to be one of the hardest parts of this job it's just you know who can you trust I really to that unn so many levels is it going back to what Paul was mentioning Bitcoin is something of a Rorschach test as Paul mentioned he thinks that when Satoshi wrote the white paper he was proposing digital cash I mean obviously it does say that you know in the subtitle and now people maybe or or at least now the more the more likely narrative that you're gonna hear is that it's digital gold but some people also really push this motive of like using it to transact outside the legacy financial system or to evade their kind of oppressive financial regimes or capital controls so what do you think is yes what do you think is the main value proposition for a Bitcoin so I'm I'm a big believer in the idea that the one place where this has really had a sort of functional application is in the dark markets I mean I think I think you know it's funny my book is called digital gold and I think some people have sort of assumed that meant that that I I don't bind that narrative that it's this thing you can invest in and it's and it's a reliable investment over time I think it's not a particularly good at that I chose that title as just more of a sort of storytelling element than a statement of what I think bitcoin is but you know it's terrible at holding its value I mean it you know it goes up and it goes down I think I think in terms of that sort of the digital gold use like the online money play investment I think it's more like just a new digital lottery where you can you know or new digital gambling parlor where you can bet on this thing and hope it goes up and hope it doesn't go down but it does both of those things I don't think it's particularly good at being digital gold if it wants to be digital gold I think the one place where people have really used it to do things is you know to buy drugs to pay ransom and that's the one sort of enduring usage of it and and obviously you know you'll hear a lot about why it's maybe not good for that because police can track it but the reality is it's pretty good at that yeah people get caught when they're sloppy but it works for that whereas you know a lot of the other things that people talk about you know remittances investments sort of you know some of the more sort of blockchain centric things of tokenization they just haven't really worked they haven't really taken off so to me and part of what interested me in the story of Bitcoin was going back how how tied in the success of Bitcoin was with the Silk Road and a lot of the kind of darker uses of it Paul yeah no I I agree I agree Nathaniel and I think the interesting thing is is you look at Silk Road you look at it used in sort of the drug bazaars if you want to call it that II not if you want to call it that yeah but I think what it did show is that Bitcoin did actually work at the one thing it was initially designed to be which is digital cash I personally think that was the the best goal for it and I think it's still the best goal for it I as constructed as it exists right now I don't think it is a particularly good store of value I think any of the benefits that it does have as that that people talk about are completely outweighed by the volatility the speculative and the speculative trading around it the fact that it can go up or down in such wide wide arcs I don't think it's a good store value right now it could be a good store of value if it had use as a currency in and if it sort of had a daily underlying utility beneath it if you had X amount of dollars passing through it every day because people were using it as a currency that would give it a base that would give it something to build a store value argument on top of but right now it doesn't have that right now I really think all it is right now is a speculative asset it's a betting market really on the price of Bitcoin I mean I think that's all it is right now you know that's it we're talking about ten years of something that as I said at the outset is probably going to take a lot longer to build and figure out exactly what it should be so I don't think that it's all it ever can be but I really think it's its best use would probably be as a form of digital cash and if that doesn't happen I don't know that it is ever really going to become a good store value I actually think on a long enough time scale it can be which is why everyone talks about holding all the time you know if you think of the Bitcoin ledger as sort of like this digital real estate and you grab a piece of it you just sort of hold on and wait for the price rise I think that's what people are doing you're right obviously there is volatility year to year but I think a lot of these people especially the wealthy ones you got in early they're you're the ones who I think are like oh I turned my like million into you know 100 million and and you know whatever a year from now it's gonna be or not a year from a decade from now it'll be a billion so I actually wanted to also ask him we're just sort of level setting for the rest of conversation but I'm so curious just along the way as you've been reporting what are some of the biggest things you've changed your mind about uh Bitcoin yeah when it comes to I mean I will I will tell you honestly the very dis was I guess early 2013 the very first time somebody suggested to me that we should write about Bitcoin I flat out said no and I said no I said what was that it was 2013 it was early 2013 I had heard wait was it Michael Casey no it wasn't Michael it was somebody else exactly new Michael I will say toss I was a little bit ahead of Mike I was maybe a couple of weeks ahead of Mike in catching on to the fact that this was a good story but and now he's well in and now he's all in yeah but my first reaction was was that the word Bitcoin should not even be associated any way shape or form with the Wall Street Journal to even put it on the Wall Street Journal's website what it was was amiss I swear to god I'm not kidding that's what I thought well I listened I didn't think it was legitimate I thought it was a scam I thought it was a con and I didn't think that we should be giving it any credence so the biggest thing I changed my I'm being honest with you the biggest thing we we change I change my mind was Bitcoin itself it didn't take long by the way that make sense what about you Nathaniel yeah I mean I certainly for the first year I think I was in a similar place where I felt like this could just disappear at any time and it took me I think awhile to believe that this had any staying power and you know I think for me I probably its mark of my similar snobbishness it was kind of hearing hearing like the first academics and some of the first serious VCS in Silicon Valley who had really dug into the code and who sort of felt like this was you know there was something really new here and you know I think for me it was some of that institutional validation people who had some history I mean for me so much I just find it very important that to be able to have people who have looked at things like this that haven't worked to see how this is or isn't working and it took me a while I think to be convinced of that I mean I think since then you know I think my opinion is constantly shifting about like where this could be useful more broadly I mean you know I think that there is some germ of a new really interesting idea but what that means more broadly I think I'm actually constantly still kind of reevaluating and changing my mind and you know is it going to have some some some is it going to really break out into the world and some broader way you know I think we've talked about the fact that I don't think it really has yet and you know I think I'm honestly frequently kind of changing my mind on how likely it is that that that'll happen yeah I'm with you on that in particular how it will happen and let's walk through some of the main historical events in bitcoins life starting with a moment that the white paper came out which was in the midst of the financial crisis do you think that was just a coincidence or and also do you think that the coin would have taken off it if it had been released either earlier or after uh no and possibly no I definitely don't think the timing was a coincidence I think from what little we do know of Nakamoto you know we believe he'd been working on it for years I think he said that he started in 2007 working on it and I'm sure he was probably thinking about it beforehand so I don't think he you know came up with it overnight I think he had been developing it he had been building it it seems fairly reasonable to me to suspect that he saw what was going on in the world and saw this as a as an alternative to the syste system that he didn't like I I'm assuming he didn't like it and he got it built and put it out as soon as he could because he saw what was going on in the world I think the timing was was definitely deliberate in terms of whether it would have made it or not I mean that's impossible to say but what I do think I can say with some confidence is I think the fact that it came out when it did and what was going on in the world did help it without a doubt I think people were obviously hurt by what had happened you know I think a lot of people had suffered I think people were fed up I think people were open to the idea of some kind of an alternative and here comes an alternative and I think a lot of people were open to it and I think a really underappreciated aspect of the Bitcoin story is the degree to which it is a social movement the degree to which people were disgusted with what was going on and we're looking for something to latch on to and latched on to Bitcoin passionately and I've said this a few times I think Bitcoin is essentially the third big reactionary movement to the financial crisis and I think that I think the Tea Party was one I think the Occupy movement was another and I think Bitcoin was a third I think in a large to a large extent it is as much a social movement as a technological movement and that absolutely is because financial crisis it's interesting what about unit Daniel do you think it was a coincidence yeah that all sounds right to me I mean yeah I mean when you think of the financial crisis this came out right after Lehman went bankrupt but you know the the problems had been going on for months already you know the problems that at Bear Sterns and so you know there was a lot of time for people to sort of see what was what was evolving in the banking system the problems there in order to get this thing out in response to that and so I think yeah that was probably a pretty conscious response to the crisis and yeah over time you know this has just played into I mean a lot of the audience's that have bought into this have been people who were you know disenchanted because of the because of the the financial crisis so I think that really did lay the groundwork for him yeah I have had a few sources tell me that that was one of the reasons they were motivated to learn more about it and why they latched on and started working in the area but I wouldn't say it's it's as many as you would expect so that's kind of an interesting question but another question do you guys think that Bitcoin would have succeeded even if Satoshi hadn't disappeared I think it's been I think that that has definitely helped Bitcoin I mean that the anonymity the sort of whole nature of Satoshi I think has been enormous ly helpful to Bitcoin and has sort of a Ron eclis unexpectedly kind of increased I think the trust that people have in it because you know because there isn't a person there with all their human frailties that you can kind of attach this to and attach those frailties to who Bitcoin and it sort of made it a blank slate that I think people could attach their own you know visions ideas to and Paul what about you I think I mean you're definitely right about that I wonder though I really do wonder I think Nakamoto disappearing well it does kind of leave Bitcoin open as this thing for anyone to kind of reinterpret as they as they desire I also think when he left you know you can start marking it if you want to talk about the Bitcoin industry sector community whatever you want to call it losing its focus I think it started there and I think once he left you ended up with a lot of people competing to make Bitcoin to reshape Bitcoin in their own image and that eventually turned into the scaling debate and the scaling war and you had a big fight over it and I think that I I I personally think that kind of hurt Bitcoin I think if he had stuck around you would have had a more cohesive vision for what this is supposed to be even if he had remained anonymous or not anonymous and I don't know IIIi I tend to think it was more of a problem than a benefit Nakamoto disappearing I mean I you know I'm the sort of leadership question I think that there have been a lot of problems that have come up because Bitcoin hasn't had you know a leader to to sort of guide it and I realize a lot of people in the Bitcoin community thinks that's a good thing and that those problems are good problems but I think it's it is worth noting that when Satoshi left there was a leader and it was Gavin Gavin Andresen and I think Gavin did a pretty good job of keeping everybody together for the next two or three years I mean right Bitcoin was a pretty kind of coherent community and I think you know Gavin was I think a pretty good sort of open source leader and being willing to recognize his own failings and you know letting other people win arguments you know he wasn't at all and you know he called himself a benevolent dictator in the same style of Linus that you know the head of Linux and I think you know it was really when when when Gavin sort of stepped back that I think a lot of the problem came forward so I think you know there is you know there problems that come when you don't have leaders you know as I mentioned I think a lot of people sort of think those problems are good problems for a Bitcoin they're kind of a challenge that Bitcoin has to overcome but you know I think those kind of challenges really started more when Gavin stepped down then when Satoshi did yeah yeah I actually want to return to this governance question because I do agree with you that yeah I think since Satoshi did have this successor which was Gavin like that sort of kind of prevented this power struggle from taking place and then afterward I think Gavin did not really appoint somebody and so that was when when the political issues took over so one other question is there have been obviously many previous attempts at creating a digital money obviously many of them failed in fact they all failed prior to Bitcoin but Bitcoin itself like there have been you know all these price crashes and there have been all these people who've declared it dead and there's all these attacks from people and there's Forks and these other blockchains and everything but why do you think bitcoin has survived and not just survived but you know as I mentioned earlier come from nothing to being worth you know $6,000 or whatever it is today I mean I think one one simple answer for that is it's it's pretty well built I mean for what it is for what its core function is which is allowing two people anywhere on the planet as long as they have an internet connection to exchange value directly without an intermediary it works I mean it does that if I if I had a wallet and Nathaniel's a wallet and I wanted to send them five bucks I can send them five bucks I mean that absolutely works and I think that's it's built well to do that I think it's built I think another good feature of its software is that it is self-sustaining I mean he built it so that it could run using air quotes you can't see him but you know on its own obviously there are people running the software but essentially this network runs on its own that aspect of it also works and I think those two things together our big reason why it survived and I think those are a big reason that people saw so much potential in it and we're willing to put in the time to try to make it better or put in the time to try to come up with an alternative that was even better and you see that you know communities come around to do that so I do think it's I do think for what it is I think it's a very elegant system and I think it works well I tend if I focus maybe more on the sort of like the community element that that Paul mentioned earlier you know again I think Bitcoin survives as long as people want to use it and want to support it and want to plug into it and I think you know the idea that it's this decentralized thing also you know the open source element of it but also going back to Satoshi the idea that there is no leader there's no sense that somebody else is in charge gives everybody a sense that they really have a stake in this and you know that sense that people have a stake in it they're willing to sort of invest in this I mean it's it's it just makes people want to use it and makes people want to keep using it because once they have them they want them to be worth more and and so they you know it sort of turns everybody into to marketers for the whole thing and I think you know just getting people to market your product for you is is brilliant and you know to some degree it's also you know what Ponzi schemes do you know you when somebody's bought in they wanted to keep going because they want to keep benefiting from it and you know the it got those sort of incentives right I'm not necessarily saying it is a Ponzi scheme but it kind of shares some of the things that makes make Ponzi schemes work and and that's just getting people in who want it to keep working yeah I had a small thread about that in my TEDx talk and I saw that I think it was Kyle Somani on Twitter tweeted something about how Bitcoin is like a Ponzi it might have been re paw I forget it was one or the other and like people got really angry but but you're right that it does have that element Paul what were you gonna say I was gonna say you know I think sort of piggybacking off that I think another aspect of this is the fact that for what Bitcoin is it really does kind of fit in with the way we live our lives now our lives are lived online our lives are live digitally are through that we are able to communicate around the world I mean I'm old enough to know that when I was growing up my friends were all people I knew in town maybe you know I didn't have pen pals but you know if you knew anybody in another country they're probably relative or a pen pal and now kids are growing up and they have friends all over the world because they're online their lives are digital their lives are mobile and I think Bitcoin really fits in with the way our lives are going the direction that that our lives are going and whether or not it ends up being Bitcoin I do think that eventually there is going to be an accepted kind of Internet money I just think that that is you know again I think that's the direction we're moving in and something is going to fill that need it could be Bitcoin it could be something else but I think that's another reason why it works is I think people sort of intuitively get it because of the way our digital eyes evolved we're gonna discuss decentralisation Bitcoin as a global reserve currency and more but first I'd like to take a

vania of The Wall Street Journal so there was this period when the mantra on Wall Street was blockchain not Bitcoin what do you guys think of that idea now and what do you think the impact of blockchain technology applied to existing industries will be compared to Bitcoin and crypto assets you want to go first Daniel that's a good one I I think it's I mean I think one of the difficulties that I'm having with you know the whole block chain conversation as a reporter is that it's it's really hard to tell you know what are the sort of blockchain elements that somebody is putting into place and and whether those elements are really the thing that is making this new system that somebody's creating work so you know like that I think one of them the sort of biggest announcements on this front has been you know Walmart sort of forcing its suppliers to use they're kind of closed blockchain to to trace food and I think you know it's just gonna be really hard to tell how much they are just you know they've just updated their databases and now have a database you know you can have distributed databases before the blockchain you could have people updating block databases from different places before and it wasn't a blockchain now that may not be Walmart may not have had that and they may just be bringing something like that into play and it is really you know boiling you know really narrow honing in on what is the blockchain element of it what is this that distinguishes it from another kind of database and determining whether that is the thing that makes it successful rather than just somebody you know creating a better database I mean I think a minimum Bitcoin and this whole conversation is clearly making everybody really ate their databases and put money into it because it seems cool now and so I think stuff will come out of that you know companies will have better ways of tracking information and that's probably going to be big and may be big in the near term it's just gonna be really hard to tell how much the blockchain element of what they're doing is the thing that makes it different and I think you know it's going to be useful to try to come to some agreements that we're gonna have to figure out ways of determining whether it is you know a brilliant team that's making a difference in these contexts but I do think you know there is real I'm not one of these people who says blockchain doesn't matter I'm you know that it's it's just all hype I think there is something valuable to distributing databases update you know finding a way to kind of create consensus around databases there is something valuable and new there it's just really hard to tell you know how much how much new and blockchain e is really in there yeah you know it's interesting to think it really kind of gets to the very heart of what all this technology is about and I think that that big that blotching that Bitcoin mantra started coming out not 2015 probably you're on Wall Street is where I first heard it and I think at the time they thought maybe there's something here you know we don't want to deal with Bitcoin but now we can take the underlying code and we can rewrite it make it our own thing and we'll save some money on the back office and this is going to be easy and let's do it right Bitcoin blockchain not Bitcoin and I think as they tried that they realized that it's actually a lot harder than they thought to use this technology in a centralized within a centralized infrastructure and I think that's really kind of the heart of it there is definitely something valuable in this technology there is definitely something that it provides that we have not had before a level of transparency that I think is really important but figuring out how to do that within industries that have been built for generations and generations upon centralized infrastructure x' where that information is not always shared that information is not always open that is a real point of friction that is a real point of contention and i think the banks figured that out quickly they thought that they would just use it and they'd save money in the back I know we can make everything digital and we can record it and it's faster and cheaper and you know we'll we'll fire some bean counters and that'll be great and then they realize that actually to do it properly involved providing a lot of information that they had never provided before and they didn't want to provide and I know a lot of the early blockchain efforts did they fell apart because of that because the transparency and what the banks didn't want to share and now they've all kind of gone through an entire second generation of trying to figure out this technology and doing it in a way that that information is still protected even within a permission to botching even within a closed loop blockchain and I think they're starting to get there but this is going to be a really interesting thing to watch and this is going to play out over very long time is can we start to have a marketplace that is based more upon decentralized practices and infrastructures whatever words you want to use as opposed to the centralized ones we've always had and that's a lot about just changing people's mindsets and that's probably more difficult than the technology frankly yeah I said this in a recent episode where I answered listener questions but I think ultimately blockchain technology applied in existing industries this is just sort of fundamentally not revolutionary in the sense that if you're just making what they already do more efficient like then it's just you know they're gonna continue doing what they're doing whereas with Bitcoin and crypto assets you know you have these like user owned leaderless networks with this crypto asset that's incentivizing behaviors on that network we haven't seen that before however I do agree with you that you know I don't know if we can say for sure that those will succeed like there has there's been this idea put out there and there are a lot of projects that are trying to get such a network going but you know it's not clear yet how it will work or if it will work let's move on to governance which came up before that's obviously been this huge point of contention in Bitcoin which you know we mentioned of you know about the scaling debate and stuff we said what lessons do you think are to be learned from that and then leading from that there are all these block chains that are trying to do on chain governance what do you think the prospects are for those mmm I guess going back to that you know this this kind of taps back into that question you asked about where have you changed your mind I mean I think one of the things that's amazing about Bitcoin is how it has kind of survived I don't know if you could say thrived but survived the the lack of leadership I mean I definitely thought that you know that that sort of civil war was going to kill Bitcoin or lead to some new leadership you know somebody taking over the miners insisting on new developers I think you know I the way I understood the incentives I thought the miners had more control than they did and I think again this goes back to the community element and that and and the fact that users really did seem to like this leaderless structure that the new kind of group of core devs after Gavin has brought in like they like the idea of this of this leaderless movement and sort of push for it and kept Bitcoin sort of the software under the control of the core developers without a clear leader I think it's it's worked a lot better than you might have expected or you know it's kept its following better than I might have expected but you know it that has come with a bet that you know moving really slowly is going to be a good thing and you know so far moving really slowly doesn't seem to have hurt Bitcoin that much relative to other crypto currencies but I do wonder if at some point that's going to become a bigger problem if some of these things move faster and and do kind of start working and and being able to do more than Bitcoin can I mean you know right now etherium is still kind of confronted by a lot of the same scaling problems a lot of the same issues with growing that Bitcoin is it hasn't figured that out but but they're working very quickly to solve that and you know and as are many others and I just wonder if if some of those succeed will Bitcoin still kind of keep its place you know will slow development still be the best option so I think that's still an open question but you know I feel like on these governance questions you just you know it's it's one of these areas where I am sort of humble enough to say I just you just really I've learned from expecting one thing and seeing a different thing enough times that you just really don't know how these things are gonna work out yeah Tom yeah I it's funny is your turn the thing I was thinking about it and one thing that really just randomly popped into my head right now is there's as a guy named Edward Bernays I don't know if you guys ever heard of him do you know who I'm talking about okay so he I'm going really far afield here but I promise you I will come back he was a PR man in the 1920s and he was kind one of the you know the creators of the modern public relations industry and he wrote a book called propaganda and his whole point of the book was that democracy without elite without leadership democracy is you know is is complete chaos and you have to have people in charge and in his mind propaganda was a tool to be used to keep people to keep control and to keep democracy from just spinning out into chaos with a million people with a million opinions you had to have a way to control people's opinions you had to have governance is what he was really talking about I mean Bitcoin can survive without having one person in control or even five people in control but what it does need to have is and any of these projects you need to have a clear vision of what it is what it's trying to achieve and you have to have people dedicated to making that happen and who have the skills to keep that on target and those people can change over time the the tools can change over time but there has to be some idea of where this is all going and I think Bitcoin after Satoshi certainly after Gavin I think it's splintered on where it was going and what it was going to be and that was a problem and I think that is a problem and yet Bitcoin survives Bitcoin still here it's not going anywhere but is it ever going to be anything is it really going to grow and I think that's going to be interesting over the next year because now you are starting to see the institutional interest form right you're starting to see it become real things fidelity is going to start trading it they won't have a trading desk and you know the backed project but is anyone gonna buy it is anyone would be interested is that are they building anything that is going to be valuable to people are people going to be willing to buy this for any reason other than speculation I don't think we know what bitcoin is going to be yet and I think that if you don't have a group of people dedicated to that and building that out then it's a problem so I don't think you need I don't think you need a dictator but you need to have somebody who's dedicated to building something valuable you know any project that doesn't have that I don't think is going anywhere no matter what the governance mechanism is you know however clever it is that come up with yeah I look at some of the governance chains and I wonder if in a way you know they've recognized this fundamental issue which is that I do think these networks are sort of like like little mini political economies I guess you could call them or something right where like people have compared you know the formulation of governance for any particular one of these crypto networks as like formulating a constitution obviously famously used but I've heard you know some lawyers I know in this space say that watching the governance issues play out remind some of what they learned in law school about you know the founding of the country and stuff sure but then I do wonder oh if they do succeed in you know formulating governance via the blockchain then are we going to end up in these situations where the u.s. is sort of in right now where you sort of like veer from one direction and then like the next the you know the opposing party gets control and then you hear in the other direction and back and forth but I guess we're a super long way from let's see whether or not that one yeah do you have people that are dedicated to whatever the vision and the goal is and are willing to work towards that or do you have people who are interested in their own their own wealth their own you know using it for their own purposes and are they bending it - that one's a good governance ones bad governance right yeah well we'll see and I mean I think it's worth like this this sort of goes to one of my main questions at this point which is you know all this is we're sort of talking here about whether these bought Keynes and the tokens on them can incentivize people to to certain kinds of behavior and you know the governance conversation you know can these things be governed by voters you know some sense people making decisions on blockchains as a result of incentives you've set up and I think one thing it's sort of worth recognizing at this point is like there is very little evidence that the incentives used that you can set up incentives right in order to create the behavior you want to create the governance system you want I mean that like doing that is so far from from where we are today and you know economists have been studying this for decades like market design how do you create incentives to you know to get the behavior you want and it is so hard even in a kind of human governed system where you're just trying to control for one you know one element you know they're they're been markets they're been market set up for for you know kidney liver transplants and for charter school entry and those are really hard to get right in a in a kind of very limited sense so the idea that you know you're gonna set these things up and create incentives and then everybody's going to behave the way you want them to is just like really really hard to believe because we can't do that in the real world it's never really been done and the crypto world the only thing the incentives have worked for so far is you give people money to hook their computers into the network they will hook their computers into the network that's that's what the incentives in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have done so far and that's a pretty like crude incentive the idea that you're gonna like get specialized enough that you can you know create the incentive so that people will do this as developers and they won't you know the the these other people who are stakeholders will be able to vote on I mean it's just like these are really complicated systems and we have very little evidence that that they will work yeah this is why I always laugh when I think about how so many people before the before any of the big hard Forks said Oh like well I'll just upgrade because everyone will go along with the main block chain and then aetherium happened the the doubt hard fork happened and obviously that did not occur so I'm actually want to switch to decentralisation you guys may not have read Carlota Perez his book but it doesn't matter if you don't hadn't technological revolutions and financial capital but in it she talks about how new technologies generally enter and become successful at times when the previous technologies have matured and the downsides of that technology has become evident and so obviously in recent years we've seen stuff with centralized services being prone to hacking and manipulation like with the Equifax hack and the Facebook Cambridge analytical examples being some of the most notable on the other hand you know as we've just talked about like decentralized services are not necessarily easy to get off the ground and make successful and then on top of that people have to you know for instance like become their own bank manage their own security and so far people have been like pretty happy to sign away their rights for convenience so how much do you think these issues we're seeing what centralized services could kind of like help the growth of the coin or do you think that people don't care enough oh I can start and say that I think that it will not matter at all it will not help Bitcoin at all people want services that work and if your service doesn't work it doesn't work better than the competitor I don't think privacy is going to be the deciding factor other than for you know 0.05 0.5% of the population you know there's there is a kind of group that wants to use signal that you know once you keep email that that even that number is is is is you know like that that technology has sort of failed to take off it's amazing how even in the privacy community people can't get you know other people so encrypt and send encrypted email to them so it's just like I think you know there is a there's an audience for that it's tiny and other than that like you don't have a better product you're not gonna win you're you don't have a product that works better it's not gonna win I just don't I don't see people I mean I think people distrust Facebook and may move off it to other kinds of services but they're gonna not move off to decentralized services they're just gonna move off to things that sort of seem a little more trustworthy to them right yeah it's you know it's it's you're absolutely right it's and it comes down to defined better to most people better is going to just mean faster easier intuitive you know something more convenient falling right so if you're somebody if you're someone out there listening to this and you're think you think you know privacy is a big issue and you want to build a better Facebook make it better in terms of privacy and make it better in terms of usability like it has to be both of those things and if you did that then yeah maybe you could have it work but if you built something that is really secure and private and no you know North Korean hackers could ever get your information out of it but it sucks in terms of the user experience no one can use it no one's going to use it so this next question it's a little bit long it deals with regulation but I happen to see this speech that one of the CFTC commissioners Brian Quinn hence gave recently and he was kind of dissecting how the CFTC might regulate some of the illegal activity that might happen on these decentralized networks and he kind of talked about how there are different people who for instance is so the the example he gave was like prediction markets where there might be illegal prediction markets and so he broke it down into the people who contributed to that market which would be the core developers who created the protocol so like in the case of augur that would be I guess he aetherium developers then he said miners and users of that protocol so miners and users of aetherium the third group was the developers of the smart contract code so I guess that's that the developers of augur and then the fourth were the people who create the individual prediction markets and then he said that the appropriate question is whether these code developers could reasonably foresee at the time they created the code that it would likely be used by US persons in a manner violative of CFTC regulations and he says in this case the code was specifically designed to enable the price type of activity regulated by the CFTC and no effort was made to preclude its availability to us persons so and in that case a strong case could be made that the code developers aided and abetted the violations of CST CFTC regulations and so the CFTC could prosecute those people do you make of that interpretation and how do you think regulators can and should regulate smart contract code that is just sort of running on its own I will say for myself I am not nearly enough of an expert in the law or smart contracts you know although I think you know you've been hearing that kind of thing from lawyers for a while so the fact that people are so surprised by it is to me a little surprising I mean you know he kind of he kind of narrowed in on a very specific question which is you you didn't just create the system with the contracts run on but you created the contract and you know I sort of goes to the most extreme example you create a contract where you can plug in a name and say if X person is killed you know by this day you know this this contract will pay out this I think it's like who wouldn't expect that that law enforcement would go after the person who wrote that contract I mean you know even even if there was no specific law governing that of course people would of course law enforcement would try to go after that they would try to find a way to discourage people from doing that I think if you work backwards from that example you know if you create a contract that allows you to bet on something that you're not allowed to bet on in the United States I mean of course the law enforcement is going to come after you and they're gonna I mean they're they're going to try to stop this what maybe a judge will ultimately decide you know that's free speech and and you can do it but it's it's just it's going to have like law enforcement not going to let you know some market that's illegal and the rest of the economy just exists over here because like the underlying market is somehow decentralized you know if somebody wrote that contract they're probably going to be responsible for it and if they're anonymous you know or they're you know operating behind a VPN that you can probably imagine that law enforcement is going to try to figure out you know where the VPN is coming from what the real IP address is who that person is so it doesn't it doesn't seem terribly surprising to me but again and and I think you've seen a lot of lawyer out there saying that they expected that this would happen so I may be missing some of the nuances those oh so I'm not you know I'm not lawyer and I and I don't knows more contracts all that well all right we're gonna do actually like sort of a lightning round through the last few questions did you guys think that Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency could become a global reserve currency yeah if it's called the u.s. digital dollar sure but only if it's a digital I think at some point you really will have effectively digitized national currencies and one of them will be a reserve currency whether it's the dollar at the end here or whatever but I mean do I think an independent crypto currency like Bitcoin will ever become the world's reserve currency I have a harder time seeing that I don't want to say no because you know anything can happen but I have a kind of hard time seeing that yeah it's it's yeah I wouldn't I wouldn't bet on it but you know it's it's it's possible but it seems very unlikely yeah I think it could happen but just not in our lifetimes like will definitely be dead before before it happens that's what I think so in general there's just like a lot of shadiness in the space you know we've seen all this concern about tether which is currently the most popular stable coin but it's not clear whether or not as it is truly fully backed and a lot I see a lot of behaviors that you know it's not like outright fraud or scams but it's probably stuff that regulators don't necessarily have the resources to catch so what do you think can be done to prevent or stop such behavior well look I mean to to completely stop it nothing I think and that's one of the things that I think regulators going to have to learn to live with is the fact that when you're talking about these kinds of decentralized systems and you're talking about the there is essentially no barrier to entry to come up with one of these scams you're not going to be able to effectively squelch that 100% but what you can do is you can put up a set of rules for law-abiding people to follow and expect them to follow it and I think you're seeing that and I think what you're going to end up with is sort of a pronged market one which is made up of businesses and users that that want to follow the rules and are willing to do that and one of people that don't want to do that and I think the first one will be the larger the second one will be the smaller and you'll you're just gonna have to deal with the fact that both exist yeah I actually think the market is already like that yeah yeah I mean real markets are like that and that you're just gonna have it a crypto version of the same thing yeah so the other thing I wanted to ask about sort of leading off from that is we're starting to see bad state actors like Venezuela and North Korea and Iran trying to use crypto to evade sanctions or raise funds or whatever it is they're trying to do so what negative effects do you foresee that this technology could unleash in the world I mean I think a lot of it is kind of more of the same of like the kind of bad behavior that already exists so you know I you know money laundering that those sorts of things is definitely possible here I think I still think the sort of scariest things going on around this are that really weren't as easy in the old world are kind of ransom kidnapping murder kind of stuff I mean that that's the part that scares me the most when you hold your own assets and you know it just was a lot harder to send a ransom payment ten years ago and it just got to be a whole lot easier and you know it wasn't impossible before you could send it a suitcase full of cash but somebody needed to take the cash to deliver it and that's not necessary anymore and to me that that's still the scariest stuff that you know that goes beyond you know Iran North Korea they they were able to do a lot of this stuff before like they had digital banking capabilities that got around the United States but I don't know that that's a stuff that kind of scares me the most I'll tell you what I think is the the scariest and I don't think this is realistic but in a very dystopian way the the scariest thing is that a government a big government so the United States will figure out how to digitize their currency and will figure out that if you do that you actually can have an incredible amount of control over how people spend that currency because you can track everything because you can know where all the money is going and where it's flowing and you can have a government that was not necessarily and and now I'm not talk about the United States what I mean say you had a government that was not dedicated to the rule of law and was not dedicated to allowing its people the maximum amount of freedom without you know any civic harm you could have a current you could have a car a government that could use this currency and really control what their people and citizens do and to me that's pretty scary actually theoretically it is not infeasible at all I mean it could certainly could happen yeah in fact that may be precisely why we always hear that China is really interested in doing a digital yuan yeah I mean think if you're a government that didn't want their citizens to buy cigarettes or didn't want their citizens you know you can really now well you got a black market of course you will but you can have a government come down pretty hard on things that they consider important yeah so speaking of Asia obviously we did see that crypto took off in a huge way in Korea where I think now something like thirty percent of Koreans have bought crypto so based on either observations that you made reporting on what happened in Korea or just anything else that you see going on in the space what do you think it will take to make Bitcoin or or any other crypto house that widely adopted like we keep talking about how nobody's using it what do you think it will take to make that happen I think comprehensive and smart regulations the United States I don't think we have that right now and you have a lot of regulators so I think actually have very nuanced views on this I think the regulators in the US have really caught up and and they're smart about it but you you don't have a comprehensive set of regulations like you haven't say Japan and what you end up with is a lot of regulators trying to figure it out on their own so I think that's one aspect of it the other aspect is just the user interfaces I mean you still don't have a way to get this out to people that it becomes very easy for them to use and until you get that I don't you know that's what I think it would take and at least in the United States to really kind of send this mainstream I mean to me you know beyond any of that you just need something where this is useful like where money that's outside the control of this is useful right I mean that is useful and people will use it for that and and that's real I mean that's that's that shows that this can do something that other money can't but what else is this useful for I mean I feel like for you know I think the two things that seemed the most convincing to me at various points were remittances and micro payments and neither of them have gone anywhere and that may be because of scaling maybe because of user interface but I you know it's not that like you can send money not that expensively in a lot of these places or if it is expensive it's even more expensive to do it with Bitcoin right now and you know from smaller countries or smaller currencies but you know you just I feel like you just have to find somewhere where this is useful to people I mean it's useful to speculate on because it goes up and down a lot and you can make money doing that trading on it but you know again those are the two things that I heard about that at various points seemed realistic to me and they haven't happened and I I don't know what will be the thing that will happen or if there will be anything that happens but it's definitely not inevitable that it will happen I mean I'll say that like I you know going back to some of your first questions about the internet like everybody one of the things I always come back to is that like everybody loves this comparison to the Internet and the fact that you know the Internet's kind of sucked early on and so it got to be really good so that means that you know bitcoin you know which sort of sucks early on is going to get good I mean the thing that people don't recognize is there are a lot of other technologies that sucked early on that continued to suck and then they died and I feel like that's a very plausible path for this it's not it's not necessarily the only path but just because something like isn't useful early on but has big ambitions doesn't mean those ambitions will be fulfilled the fact that the internet worked is you know probably more the outlier than the sort of normal path that these technologies take yeah so badly IMAX Betamax lubbers would agree with you one other thing I would say on that point is you know an interesting thing is you you look at credit cards right and credit cards look at what credit cards offer to users in terms of loyalty points rewards the fact that if a transaction is fraudulent you can get it charged exactly supposed to be this great thing that everybody's gonna move to Bitcoin for I love charge bags exactly so it's it's you know open cut in an open marketplace of payment options Bitcoin has to out-compete those things and it has to have enough pros to it and right now it doesn't yeah yeah I just want to throw in my two cents which is I think it's gonna take off in investing or in games in some fashion because already obviously we did see like this sort of you know disruption of VC with icos so in that way like you can already see that this is useful for something in the finance realm and I also think that there are a lot of gamers who see some use for like crypto goods and other things and those people are already used to digital money so that's where I'm looking right now all right so one of the last questions I want to ask you is so far we've had all these people in the space talk about how crypto can democratize access to finance but so far a lot of what's happened is that people who got in early just have become very rich so do you think this is all talk and we'll never see democratization come out of this out of crap doh or do you think down the line we will see crypto helping to address issues of financial access and income and wealth inequality uh I I really don't know I will say I I hope so I think it's a really good again talk about goals I think there's a really good goal to to strive towards and I think the potential is there but it's a really big issue it's a really big question and again you have to have people involved who not only have that vision but can understand how to make it happen and then be dedicated to making it happen and that's just that's big that is really difficult to do so I would love to see it happen I just don't know yeah I mean it's it's gonna depend on it working and I think to me the the immediate question is like is this going to be useful to to people and and usable and it's you know again it is it is currently sort of available to a small elite but you know I think the other you know one of the elements of this sort of the way maybe inequality is built into this is that you do have to understand technology certainly now you have to understand the technology to make it work and you know when people talk about using it to democratize things they talk about you know creating better user interfaces but it usually is some more centralized service where you lose the decentralized element of it and I guess the question is can you get a kind of service that is useful to people who don't understand technology well but still somehow takes advantage of the decentralized elements of this and until then it's only going to be available to people who have kind of technical expertise and those people are going to tend to be the people who are already powerful and wealthy and it's just going to make them more powerful and wealthy and I think that's what you've seen so far so it's it's certainly a journey to get to a different place where it's kind of moving in the other direction yeah I think it is so easy to make money we'll have to find people who are not motivated by greed to do this ok so last question I'm going to make it easy for you guys instead of only asking for predictions I'll let you ask or I'll let you say what your biggest predictions are aunt or your biggest questions for the next 10 years about Bitcoin or crypto in general all right about that for a second for the next ten years I guess maybe taking off from the first ten years and where people were at the beginning of this is that you know there are all these kind of slots that people know they're you know these these kind of accepted narratives of what's going to happen and I feel like probably my main prediction is that they're all going to be wrong because I think a lot of the accepted narratives of where Bitcoin was going to go 10 years ago you know in those five people commenting on the cryptography mailing list like those were really smart people and you know they all ended up being wrong except maybe how Finney but maybe not but like people just don't know the the unexpected ways that things evolve and the the you know the sort of chaos in the way that you know this this little push here throws something that pushes something into totally unexpected direction so you know I think playing into my own sort of uncertainty I think my main expectation is that it's going to continue to evolve in ways that probably most people aren't anticipating you know I think I don't know about predictions but I think the things that I would look out for over the next several years to ten years whatever is is you know people love to talk about currency and the three character characteristics of a currency right that it's a unit of account means of exchange and store value right all right bitcoin is not a unit of account you know it's not going to be it is not currently a means of exchange it's not being used as so now you're at the point where people are pushing the store value narrative that's going to be really interesting to watch over the next year two years to see if that goes anywhere because if that doesn't go anywhere and the others don't go anywhere then I don't know what bitcoins future is all right well we'll leave it at that and I will sidestep my own question about questions and predictions for listeners who have not read the white paper I urge you to do so I actually really love this white paper I don't understand everything in it but it's it's pretty it's pretty interesting when you read it so if you've never read it definitely definitely look it up on the
