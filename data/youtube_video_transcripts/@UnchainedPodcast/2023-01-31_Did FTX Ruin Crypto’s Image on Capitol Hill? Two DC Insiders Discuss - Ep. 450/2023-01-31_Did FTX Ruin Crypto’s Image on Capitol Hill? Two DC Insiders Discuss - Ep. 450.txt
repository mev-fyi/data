Sheila Warren CEO for the crypto Council for Innovation and Miller White House Levine policy director at the D5 education fund welcome Sheila and Miller thank you thanks Laura the last time I did a show on regulation was back in early October when things looked quite different funnily enough the headline on that story was Kristen Smith on why crypto legislation could be passed by Year's End and in the episode she actually credited Sam vanquin freed with being the force behind a bill that at that point few people had actually heard of and it was the digital commodity consumer protection act or dccpa it's extremely notorious now in the crypto Community which is why I actually find all this kind of amusing um however obviously what happened is that first of all even before FTX collapsed Sam Pinkman freed himself came under Fire from the crypto Community for how that legislation proposed to treat D5 and then obviously post FTX collapse the future for crypto legislation probably looks quite different so I'm curious to hear from both of you and when we start with Sheila what would you say are the top line takeaways about the current state of cryptologists legislation in the wake of FDX well thanks Laura for the question I think it's it's not just about FTS it's also about the fact that we have a new Congress so now we actually have split Chambers we have a republican house which may or may not be able to come together in coalition to get things across the line that's still being sorted which is a very real-time active thing that's happening and a senate led by the Democrats and so we're in a world I think this is something at the crypto Council we had been warning about and thinking was a real possibility but I do think a lot of folks assumed we were going to have an entirely republican-led Congress which would have had very different potential outcomes than other things so it's not just about what happened with FTX it's also recognizing that we have a whole bunch of new actors and it's a very different situation in Washington now than we had prior to this election prior to the swearing-in of these new members too now to answer your direct question what that means for crypto legislation is it what it means for all legislation we've already seen it's going to be really tough to get things across the line we're looking actively right now at a debt ceiling situation brinkmanship that this is always kind of a dramatic moment in Washington but not this kind of brinksmanship and we actually have a handful of folks in the house that seem pretty committed you know to whatever deal they struck with Kevin McCarthy they seem pretty committed to holding up legislation that does not completely align with their interests perhaps which represent the interest of their constituents maybe not so everything is is in a different place than it ever was and that means that like all legislation crypto focused legislation is also going to have to run a gauntlet that we were not looking at in uh the the end of last year well wow and some of what you mentioned with the house or slightly alluded to I just wanted to kind of call out you're probably talking about how it was I forget like 15 votes or something before um Captain McCarthy was able to be sworn in as speaker so yeah that's I think you know historically obviously very aberrant so clearly there's a lot of hurdles to any kind of legislation being passed Miller what is your um view on how you know things look at this point yeah I think Sheila uh generally is 100 right I think that you know some foundational um Concepts or uh the landscape changed in some fundamental ways from FDX and from a new Congress I think that generally policy makers are taking a uh refresh look at the crypto industry and ecosystem broadly rethinking what they thought they knew given uh the shock of the FDX collapse to have everyone including lawmakers and as far as the Dynamics of Congress is concerned I completely agree with Sheila I think that post FDX some folks particularly in the house look at it the collapse as a failure of people and not a failure of the technology or the underlying Concepts itself and there are other folks I think particularly in the Senate that think the exact opposite of that or that the technology is for some reason a contributing factor to the to the collapse and other collapses last year so I think it's going to be tricky for those two groups to come to consensus on any particular issue which will make the prospect of legislative action remote so just building on what Miller just said I think that we we should draw a distinction between the activity we expect to see in congress with the crypto Council are calling this in the crypto Congress because I think there's going to be a lot of activity uh bills being introduced discussed new coalitions forming tons of chances for all of us to educate which is great but the ability again to get anything across the line not just crypto related legislation any legislation we're just in a very different world so the conversations are going to continue and I do think in the wake of FTX there were a bunch of folks electeds who were kind of like well you know that's not really my issue I don't have to pay a lot of attention to it I think that is now an unusual position I think most people feel like they have to have some baseline knowledge about what's going on here some baseline opinion about it and again that's an opportunity for us to do a lot of Education to folks who are more open-minded and the last thing I'll say as a reminder is that crypto remains attractive to people or interesting to people they're curious about it all across the political Spectrum this is one of the very few issues that does have bipartisan support and bicameral support from various people and it certainly has generated a tremendous amount of Interest so you know I think Miller would agree our work is cut out for us here there is a lot to do it's going to be very busy but I think the expectations around you know what's going to get across the line and the ease of doing that need to be calibrated in accordance with the new environment that we're dealing with okay so this is actually super interesting that you're seeing all that because I actually was very curious obviously Sam thingman freed was probably the number one most active crypto entrepreneur in Washington and he and other FTX Executives were huge donors to members of Congress it ended up being that uh coindust did this investigation and found that 196 of them had taken money from him or other Executives at FTX and that that amounts to one in three members of Congress and I was wondering if you felt that those members who took donations from you know FTX related people if that kind of has made them feel like they got burned and so has kind of turned them against crypto to the point where they want to be tougher on crypto or they're trying to distance themselves from the industry that they're now sort of even maybe anti-crypto or I'm sure you've heard the theories that because of the political favor they were trying to Curry that maybe Sam and other FTX Executives will get off with you know no jail no prison time or light sentences or whatever due to that I you know I don't know what you make of those things but or is it something else entirely I'm just kind of curious because to have the one person that they were sort of hobnobbing with be the one to uh allegedly perpetrate this fraud I don't know I just feel like that in particular might spark certain reactions in One Direction or another yeah I think that um well I think to everybody felt burnt you know no matter whether you're just an average crypto user or a member of Congress everybody felt burned because it was uh fraudulent I think the conspiracy theories about him getting off have this been proven incorrect given the fact that it's seemingly every federal law enforcement agency has thrown the book at him so to speak including uh for potential or alleged campaign Finance violations to to your point there so you know I think that members of Congress who received donations from him many of whom are already or have already given the money to other causes and which the which the debtors in the FDX case are are seeking to get back from certain Charities too all feel burned just like everybody else I think how people react to that with respect to crypto regulation depends I think on the person uh similar to the dynamic I I described previous honestly I think some folks view what happened with FDX as being an FDX problem others see it as being a crypto problem and you know to Sheila's point I think it has generally made folks have to pick a side so to speak you know it's not binary of course but to have some position on crypto and you know two congresses ago there was probably two or three members of Congress who who had positions on crypto and that you're not seeing that fall along partisan lines no not really to add to what Miller said I think there's some folks who really see this as a Sam problem right not even an XT it's like Sam and allegedly the small group of folks and so so the thing Laura I think is that this was so egregious like what happened here was just so wild right I mean just absolutely outrageously egregious and and I think people understand that they understand that it wasn't just to Miller's point like everybody feels burned by this right there are investors who feel burned users who feel burned employees who feel burned Regulators who feel burned in the Bahamas I can't imagine how people there feel you know they're just there's a tremendous a shock that that happened as a result of all of this and so I think there are a lot of folks that understand that you know this was again eight criminal counts were brought here this is not some mild you know here one day gone the next kind of thing this is like a massive massive perpetuated fraud on people all over the world so I think folks really do understand that I think they get that this was a case of one of the oldest crimes in the book you know it was the new incarnation of that crime of that kind of financial crime that's management that fraud again we'll see how all this plays out with the with the criminal justice hearings but I think people do understand this is not an indictment now those I do think people who had already decided in their brains that crypto was the enemy for whatever reason they are certainly using this to you know lean into that point for sure absolutely they're using it as a political talking point like for instance Senator Elizabeth Warren as an example I don't know that many new people that came to this are looking at this situation and saying well this one guy and a small group of people did this horrible commit these horrible crimes therefore an entire industry must therefore be suspect like that's it's a pretty big leap and I think that again it kind of hammer the point home it's because the the situation here is so extreme If This Were a more ordinary kind of crime crime I think people be like oh is everyone doing that because it was so outlandish so outrageous so extreme I think people are like wow that takes a particular kind of individual to even conceive of let alone pull off right it's not an ordinary situation but any stretch of the imagination yeah I I would agree with that so obviously I'm sure there's a lot of different ideas being bandied about but you know within the crypto industry itself right after the collapse of FTX we saw you know this movement to show proof of reserves and you know there was just a lot of discussion around how to prevent that kind of thing are you hearing about any lawmakers or Regulators discuss regulations or laws that could be implemented to prevent you know another FTX again it varies pretty widely and it varies jurisdiction to jurisdiction and how folks are approaching this it varies almost person to person in many ways and part of this is I think the domain that people feel they have either some kind of influence over or that they're deeply interested in right so some folks are saying and this is the kind of Point I've made before including in the Press like the system did work here right I mean the reality is this person was arrested there are these eight criminal accounts brought a Justice process is running and there's all all happened pretty fast so I've been comparisons of you know Sam bankman freed to you know Bernie Madoff or Ken layer whatever and the reality of those situations is those went on for like decades this was a pretty fast you know horrible act to getting caught to getting arrested situation all things considered so you could argue that the accountability mechanisms already existed in our current legal system at least here in the United States now what's interesting of course and what I think everybody has interest in is preventing this from ever happening again and there I think it's not just about a legal and Regulatory response it's also about how do we think about diligence how do we think about the fact that we've created a cult of personality around Tech Geniuses right that didn't exist 15 years ago like all these things play into what happened here and the ability of one individual to earn the trust of people from such a broad variety of spaces not just Washington but all kinds of other places too right so I think there's a reckoning that's happening with a lot of that that goes beyond just who should take money when and what and this kind of thing and I don't know that all of that could ever be addressed by any specific legislation or regulation that might come down but I do think the industry has expressed our own interest in making sure something like this can never ever ever happen again and that you're disincentivizing this behavior that you're making sure that if people do want to pull it off it's pretty easy to catch them right and that there's accountability built in now I think to the points Miller made earlier the great thing about of a crypto and blockchain is that the tech itself if you lean in to certain technical design choices and other kinds of things you can put some of that into place and actually make that incentive structure make that governance model make that accountability part of how the system actually works itself and this is a point I know Miller and I and many others are going you know really talking about and trying to highlight is we don't have to just rely on an external system of accountability or regulation although that is inevitable and also important we also need to be leaning into what the technology itself enables and that's something I think to go kind of connect this to the topic today folks in Washington or even in Europe or other places have a highly varied degree of understanding about how that works in the reality of it yeah I don't think we've even kind of gotten to that part of the conversation in any systemic way yet I think that Congress right now is uh in kind of a shell-shocked fact Gathering what happened mode and I yeah I expect there to be additional hearings uh on on what happened uh looking looking back but I think you know this conversation about what comes next how can we prevent this kind of thing uh I think it's very context dependent you know I think where the business model is centralized and custodial many of the uh regulations in traditional Finance can mitigate some of those risks in a in a substantially similar way in the crypto markets and then to to Sheila's points uh you know as I'll talk my book there are other ways to go about eliminating the need to respond to those risks altogether non-custodial exchange be they uh with with a centralized limit order book or uh with D5 protocols so I think that you know that's the that's the exciting conversation to come depending on how you view it but Congress in my opinion right now is still in the in the what happened mode yeah I've been calling it The Festivus season right like for those who won Seinfeld like there's got to be some Pulpit pounding and some some of that's gonna happen for you know obviously right that happens every time you have something like this that goes down we're certainly not the first industry that's had Senators yelling at people you know this is just a part of the process but then uh we it is going to transition and shift into something more more productive I think once some of that has been um completed and I agree with Miller we're you know expecting to hear more hearings about just kind of the forensics around like how did this happen how could this have happened and yeah and what could have prevented it all right so let's move on from the FTI stuff and just talk I mean there's so many different topics to discuss but why don't we just start with your overall goals for crypto policy this year for each of your organizations sure I'm happy to start um so I think you know number one to Sheila's point the odds of Congress getting something done uh might be slim but I think it's going to be a absolutely crypto obsessed Congress I think there'll be more bills introduced than probably uh you know every other Bill to date that has been introduced in aggregate so I think it's going to be incredibly busy and thinking about where this space is going over the next 10 20 years that work is absolutely critical in Congress to end up eventually with good policy so that is definitely top of the list I think um litigation is probably going to be more important over the next two years uh for better and for worse than it has been previously uh given that the the legislature might be clammed up a bit and then rulemaking I think is going to be you know a top priority for us I think that the SEC has some open rule makings that could be particularly problematic for D5 protocols the bipartisan infrastructure framework if you can think all the way back to August 2021 the rule making for implementing that new definition of a broker will eventually need to happen uh and that might that might be this year so I think that you know just keeping on uh doing the the everyday work with Congress is the top priority and then litigation and Regulatory work is going to be just as important and that's just domestically you know let's speak with you Sheila speak to what's happening all around the world and when you talk about litigation any particular litigation that you want to call out well right now we're involved in the ukidao case uh it's the first time a federal agency sued a Dao as such uh a legend that it's an unincorporated association so that's that's when we're involved in right now I think you know to the extent these rule makings uh are are finalized knock on wood in in destructive ways that uh is a deaf area for potential litigation too but we'll see you know I uh if you would ask me on October 7th last year I would not have guessed that tornado Dash would be designated an entity the next day so who knows what what'll come down the bike yeah this is probably where I disclose I'm on the steering committee of the default education fund so it worked very closely with Miller on thinking through some of the priorities um at the diva education fund and for CCI you know we're a Global Alliance so we are looking across the world really we're active right now specifically in Brussels in Europe in the UK which of course post brexit is a lot going on in the UK that I don't know that everyone's aware of in the U.S I also think we're getting we're stepping up our engagement at the state level in California where we are seeing a number of things happening that it could be good or could be bad depending on you know how industry engages right like these things always have a window where they can go one way or the other and be positive or negative for users of the of the industry of users of products and services in the industry um I think for us I'll add I think it's a good reminder as Miller calls out there are three branches of government you know the the legislature is the one that gets a lot of attention particularly in the wake of the dcpa and with Sam and all that people are I think a lot of cryptos like eyes are trained specifically on the hill but there are two other branches of government that are also really important and we are seeing the judicial branch there's a lot of changes that happened last year there as well that didn't get the same attention but you've got something called you know the Chevron Doctrine around How are federal agencies executive agencies uh how can they make rules and are those rules sticky or or persistent or are those rules going to be challenged in court and we're seeing that come up not just in our space but in a lot of other spaces that have implications for how we think about bringing litigation and here I'm kind of speaking as a lawyer right in this space and so I do think you're going to see a lot more activity in that space and part of the strategy now is is it more efficient is it more permanent frankly to take a litigation route and go through the judicial branch of government than it is to maybe seek a legislative solution and those are things that are now in play because of where we are with the legislative branch specifically on the hill the states should not be understated State activity is going to get I think more and more prominent and present particularly if as the perception that at the federal level there's going to be again this difficulty in getting really comprehensive things across the line uh so what's that going to mean and then of course Europe Europe is taking a vote soon the very final kind of vote on Mika and then that's going to move into implementation implementation is really where the rubber meets the road how is each country going to look at this of these rules how are they going to implement them will they be harmonious there's some of these you know principles that have been laid out in Mika you could drive a train through them so which facet is going to be the one that's sticky in any given country is all really important work and then of course you've got I mean like we just go on and on there's Mexico Thailand Japan I mean there's just so much coming I think at this space yeah a couple of things so first of all Mika is markets and crypto assets regulation that's in about to be adopted in the European Union and but we'll talk about foreign jurisdictions later on in the show so why don't we just discuss us for now so in that case I'll kind of run that down and say there's also all of the the banking Regulators right and so the intersection you're going to have there we've got engagement over last year we had the Department of Labor wing and on stuff we have the IRS weighing in on things we've got ofac to tornado cash to that point so there's a lot of activity happening in Washington out of these executive agencies or out of these other agencies that are even independent and I think that you know again we should keep an eye on the fed and what's happening out of project Hamilton other kinds of Investigations into a U.S domestic cbdc that I think are having influence whether it's a treasury or whether it's on how others are thinking about this entire space the digital asset space more broadly so one other thing that I did want to ask about though when it comes to Congress well a couple of things so first of all Congressman Patrick Henry is now the chairman of the house Financial Services committee and he's obviously extremely pro-crypto he's a previous guest on this show and I wondered how you expected his position in that role plus the appointment of french hill to lead the brand new subcommittee on digital assets Financial technology to affect movement on crypto regulation this year uh I think you know it's it's uh evidence of uh what she was arguing I think it's gonna be the crypto Congress that might not get comprehensive legislation over the Finish Line uh kind of paradoxically there yeah I think the importance of Patrick McHenry being the new chairman of the financial services committee is uh pretty important I think he's one of the most knowledgeable about crypto and D5 members of Congress that we have and I think that you know in that role he can play an outsized uh uh role in shaping uh legislative packages that will be enormously influential down the line um I think the best example uh being perhaps unstable custodial stable coin regulation that was a deal that the administration and both parties in Congress tried to put together so to speak last year and got pretty close and I think is one area where everyone's at least in principle and agreement that it's necessary and would be beneficial so I think that might be be an area Focus for the committee and I think that we've already seen they also will be keenly interested or at least Republicans on that Committee in conducting vigorous oversight of how the federal agencies are approaching their regulation of of the crypto markets the other thing about Patrick McHenry of course is that he has demonstrated ability to work across the aisle and also if you're watching the speaker hearings you could see Patrick McHenry you know really as somebody who is a mover and Shaker within his own party so not everyone is and so the the prominence of him both as an influencer in a bipartisan way is something that shouldn't be understated it's really important and I also wanted to check in on the status of some major crypto legislation that was proposed previously obviously we discussed the dccpa but there was also the Jilla brand lemus bill and I wondered if either of these were sort of dead in the water I have a sense they have to be reintroduced in this Congress but I didn't know what your sense was of current support for either of these so they would have to be reintroduced and I think the question is really what the appetite's going to be for the authors and and co-sponsors of those bills from the past to kind of bring them forward in their in their form you know what I always say is like just because whether a Bill's introduced or not introduced the language that's agreed upon in a bill is really important so if you get to a place where you have Coalition you've got participants and co-sponsors from across you know again I don't even know how I don't even know are we two parties anymore are we four-party I mean who knows but like if you've got this across the political Spectrum uh you've got some alignment on at least kind of high-level principles that have then begun to be grounded into concrete language that does have some stickiness and so I don't know that there's appetite necessarily for those bills in that form because of everything that happened you know Etc especially around dcpa to move forward and I think there's also considerations around the politics of that how they're how you know I now republican-led house is going to engage the Democratic Senate like those kinds of things are also complicated but I do know that some of the that language is very much active I would say or like live if you want to put it that way and it's ripe for being pulled into other legislation so I think as Miller and I have both said we do think it's there's going to be a flurry of activity and Drafting and all this kind of stuff I think a lot of folks want to kind of own their own bill in a way right so trying to create Coalition around that is going to be interesting given that this is a topic a lot of folks in this crypto Congress want to engage on as always Laura nothing is ever really really dead right like that's not how it really works so we kind of have to see how this plays out and what kind of coalitions are going to start forming as a lot of things get more baked and settled in the next few weeks and the next month in Washington all right so in a moment we're going to run through a list of topics that people are very specifically interested in when it comes to crypto regulation but first a

long time it was said that the first kind of crypto legislation that would likely be implemented in the US would be something around stable coins however obviously as we know last fall the dccpa sort of seemed to maybe Edge that aside um however of course nothing on either matter got passed but before leaving office Pennsylvania Senator or former Pennsylvania senator Pat Toomey did introduce a bill around stable coins and I wondered what you see currently in this Congress in terms of interest in passing stable coin legislation and also if there is still interest what will it look like and when do you think it might pass I think that that remains true that if uh Congress moves on one thing if I were a betting man I would bet on uh custodial stable coin regulation the treasury Department is quite focused on Congress moving on that uh in their reports pursuant to the executive order they gave principles for what that should look like and so everyone I think is highly motivated to get that done and anything that touches the dollar uh you know the Congress and the executive are going to be uh keenly focused on what it would look like you know that's the that's the billion dollar 100 billion dollar question in this instance trillion uh yeah yeah nobody quite knows you know I think Pat team is is a one of the more thoughtful examples of what that could look like I think that in this instance Congress would be prudent to keep that massive topic that's narrowly focused on custodial staple coins as possible and then go from there which you know those those being the the vast majority of the market but what that would look like you know who knows to that it's the most no-brainer thing that needs to get done honestly and and the only reason it didn't go last year was politics I think I think I think it's it's everyone who really cares about it has is informed about it as educated about it there there have been so many different folks in Congress on you know both Chambers and both sides of the aisle that have like weighed and waited into it and kind of understand it it's just it's it's no-brainer but again is it going to be the first priority I don't know that I necessarily I think it should be because I think again it's like no-brainer low-hanging fruit stuff that could just should be able to get across the line very easily uh but this we're just in this kind of world where I did not think it would take 15 votes to get a speaker in the most again no-brainer you know so it's really hard to say until some of these committees have been meeting and have put out some of their priorities it's really hard to know what might go first but so I'll just kind of leave it there and say I really think that that should but I oh I already I also thought it should have last year and I also was fairly confident and would not because of politics so another big question that's been hanging over the crypto space for ages is whether the default way to treat crypto should be as a security or a commodity and at the moment I was wondering whether you saw that there was momentum in One Direction or the other and amongst these lawmakers yeah I think that's probably one of the last questions that will be answered by Congress of stable points of the first yeah you know yeah I mean to Sheila's point it's it's an unfortunate situation because one would think that uh without classifying the asset as anything you could construct some framework where consumers are being protected and other public policy objectives are being met you know whether you've got a security commodity or or a doc in theory that really shouldn't matter but it does given how how our system works here so yeah I think that uh you know there is too many conflicting interests in this instance to resolving that question expeditiously so I I don't expect that to be addressed at least by Congress uh uh in the next few years I do think that is a question that could potentially be clarified in the Judiciary whether via proactive litigation on behalf The Regulators like the xrp case or alternatively through through some proactive litigation but we'll we'll have to say and when do you expect that xrp case might be resolved that's a great question you know this quarter that's what most people are expecting you know again these things wrenches get thrown all the time so it's very hard to know I'm sure there's somebody who knows who's like really following the docket extremely simply closely uh but we are expecting resolution of some kind this quarter at least on some of the major questions F7 of seven kinds they're some kind there will be appeals I'm sure yeah multi-year multi-year thing that's important that's right I know but are you guys reading the tea leaves as going one way or the other on that one I will say I've always felt it was a winnable case whether it is one by which I mean for the sac here for ripple for ripple I've always felt that it was a winnable case for ripple whether it is one is it is up to a variety of factors right so so we filed an amicus and I know others did as well because we did feel like there were issues there that were important and that were sufficiently unsettled I think is the right word right that they that they that this could actually provide some resolution and that Ripple had a very strong case All Things Considered on this particular issue that was brought right so looking at the narrow four corners of this particular case look I I do think I agree with Miller in that I I sure wish that this would be you know this would catapult up and legislative priority in there and certainly Patrick McHenry has said he's very interested in this topic and figuring out you know asset classification Market structure all these kinds of things but again because of the political situation that we're talking about I agree I think we're going to see whether it's the SEC coming out with more enforcement action seemingly out of the blue whether it's them shoving you know classifications into court into cases that are really hard to defend because of the way that they're brought up like the you know the um well he case I think there's things like this that are probably going to continue happening because I don't NEC I don't see this SEC under under this chair's guidance backing down if you will in any way I actually see them getting possibly more ferocious in some of this stuff uh and so I do think you're going to see a judicial branch it's going to be forced to kind of reckon with what is the boundary of what the SEC can do without formal Authority or formal rulemaking having been put into place which is complicated so and that's what this is about fundamentally right you have to mention the asset classification question is really one of authority it's a question of what authorities the cftc have over what and the SEC have and is there a default where if the cftc doesn't have authority the SEC does have authority that's not really how things are set up but that is seemingly the way that the SEC is trying to approach this is to say in the absence of guidance the default should be that it is our territory and we have authority I find that highly problematic as does everyone in crypto for obvious reasons right not the least of which is the SEC does have the ability to come out and put out some proactive guidelines that then could be discussed and there are rules around how to do that Etc that's not what we're seeing it's when we call for regulatory Clarity a lot of that has become if we're just kind of very Frank about it has become where does that boundary live right and who gets to decide so those are when you phrase questions like that those are right for litigation kinds of questions so I am expecting to see something that again I don't know that any of us will know until we see it that comes out of the SEC whether through enforcement or other kinds of ways uh where you basically have a ripe opportunity for litigation uh where we can kind of get these questions settled at least by the courts and it may be the courts say no you can't do that until Congress weighs in but at least then we'll know where we are right it may not I'm not saying that litigation is going to solve this but I do think it would at least help weigh in on that boundary question and almost like really put more pressure on Congress to really have to act to get this kind of settled once and for all you mentioned SEC chair Gary gunzler and there's been a fair amount of criticism of him uh from certain members of Congress but also I've seen commentary in the media and some people I mean just if you look at crypto Twitter you will see people sort of making fun of the SEC for going after Kim Kardashian for her Instagram story promoting a small coin but then missing the alleged fraud at FTX and also in particular because it looked like he and other SEC officials were meeting with FTX to I guess maybe exempt them from certain regulation or or something like that so I wondered whether you saw any of this criticism affecting his ability to to either stay in the job or lead the agency uh I don't think it's going to affect his ability to stay in the job I think that his position on crypto is popular among the base of his core supporters and uh therefore you know it's uh not something that I think is a political loser for M at the moment I think to your second question I do think you know crypto or not the SEC isn't functioning terribly well right now you know right now chair gensler's in a big fight with with the SEC Union uh his rule making agenda uh the the uh the IG of the SEC released a report last year pointing to an unusually high rate of Staff turn due to a variety of factors including the fact that chair gensler's regulatory agenda is quite ambitious uh trying to do everything all together all at once in the traditional financial markets so I do think that you know his approach to crypto may not be a core issue with respect to his leadership of the agency but how he's generally approached the job uh I think certainly has been so I think there's I think that the the criticism comes from a couple of different places so I think as Miller noted a lot of his core supporters are all in on this approach and don't seem to have much of a problem with it right so we can kind of leave that there I think there's two other things happening one is this General Republican push against you know quote activist agencies right and the idea that agencies should be narrower in their remit they should have pretty prescribed things that they can and can't do they shouldn't be able to step outside a congressional authority to make you know rules right and and opinions on that vary depending on where you fall on that Spectrum there are even some interestingly enough uh more Centrist or moderate Democrats who are uncomfortable with just the the way that this is going the way that the rule the quote unquote the rule making is kind of Happening Here Right which is not following sort of the usual process of things um and the fact that they haven't necessarily there hasn't been a consultative process necessarily from what I understand with some of these folks it doesn't sit super well with them then you've got I think others uh particularly those who are in general looking to shrink government for different reasons right just not related so much to like um excessive Authority within federal agencies just in general or like it should just be smaller why are there so many people there why is the budget so big like those kinds of just general like small government kinds of folks right who are just not a fan of this approach either so you've got a number of critics coming for different reasons and then you've got people who are just like look there just seems to be a pretty black and white approach to crypto as a general matter and that and of itself is problematic because how can you be engaging in such little black and white thinking around something that is still emerging and that is still you know in its relative adolescence at best if not infancy depending on the subtopic within our industry right so all these different things I think do come into play now to your question though I agree with Miller completely I don't think any of that affects you know share Gensler staying in the role right for the time being and or being able to lead that agency and I think the things that Miller cited like the union issues and other kinds of personnel and staffing issues which are to be fair you know the entire Federal government's having problems with Staffing right now there's a staffing shortage big time so that's that's an issue across the government but certainly something that we're seeing uh quite present at the SCC in terms of their ability to get and keep and retain folks who develop any expertise because the minute that they develop expertise they tend to leave not just for crypto but for other industries that are attractive to them so it's an ongoing problem and I think that's going to affect you look at the IRS right the defunding the IRS thing that just got through like you've got speaker you got the speaker vote and you got this like defund the IRS situation right so are we going to see some of those kinds of things happening well there's the precedent there at the IRS so it's interesting to think about how this Congress might actually act if the agenda is going to be pushing one part of this house is going to be pushing very very hard to limit government and to make everything kind of contracted and smaller there's been a desire for a Bitcoin ETF for a long time and some of some people believe that because the SEC hasn't yet approved if Bitcoin ADF that that's actually hurt the industry and maybe even played a role in some of the blow-ups we've seen this year what do you think the prospects are for a Bitcoin ETF to be approved anytime soon well this is also a question that is now subject to litigation uh I think rightfully so you know in in my mind there is a logical inconsistency between on the one hand approving Bitcoin Futures ETFs and on the other hand uh rejecting bitcoin's bought ETFs because the Bitcoin underlying Bitcoin markets aren't regulated and it just doesn't pass the smell test in my opinion given that of course the Futures markets are based on underlying Bitcoin markets uh as well I think that the earliest we would see a Bitcoin ETF would be pursuant to grayscale's potential success in that litigation the agency I don't expect to do anything on a Bitcoin ETF willingly agree completely and I I just on the litigation front I think that I think everybody's watching these two cases the Ripple case that you mentioned xrp and in this case because certainly if industry is successful so if it's one meaning by industry I do think you're gonna see a lot of folks thinking about this as a path forward um even though it's you know it's costly it's not ideal in many ways but it is seemingly the way to get things potentially done in with an agency that is not otherwise going to going to act so you know what do you do on some level so as we saw last fall there's also been concern over how crypto regulation could treat defy for instance whether or not it would force defy to have kyc or know your customer controls what's the attitude toward defy in Congress now uh I think that Congress it has is curious is D5 curious for sure I think it's uh drop down the priority list a bit in the wake of the FTX collapse in Congress at least the international Regulators in a notwithstanding Market developments in C5 last year are seemingly myopically focused on D5 for one reason or another be it the you know the bank of international settlements or the financial stability board uh they're they're all still talking about D5 but you're exactly right Laura I think that right now Congress or most in Congress appreciate that there's this weird cool new thing called D5 weird or cool I guess depending on on who the person is and it's different from C5 and for the most part I think that's uh that's where policy makers are yeah I feel like I need to clarify my question because when I say defy I mean something where you participate in crypto using a self-custodial wallet do you feel that lawmakers understand kind of how that works and how that's different from something like FTX uh well you could use you could self-custer your assets using a product like Ledger live but use fdx's Central limit order book that's like a unique kind of centralized exchange where self-custody was happening and those folks didn't no I didn't make sense yeah the the exposure is at the moment of settlement and so there's like you know almost that's a that's a market solution to this custody risk that FDX customers are are painfully aware of now overall yes I do think that folks understand the concept of self-custody and describing how the fact that a key is a key whether it's uh you know on a piece of paper in my wallet or being protected I hope in some more sophisticated way at coinbase custody is uh is an easy thing or at least one of the easier things that we teach Congress you know I'll say when I testified in front of Senate AG about this and and talked about the D5 Provisions or the language in the CPA being unworkable which I used very specifically as a term because I think that was kind of the takeaway was like this is even if the policy principles here are things that made sense this framework is just literally there's no way anybody can comply with the requests being put here because it's just not that's not how it works right and I think that that sparked a lot of conversation I think folks had been vaguely aware of some of this stuff but they really didn't get the details of it exactly why it was unworkable like why is this so different why can't you just apply principles that make sense or a process or practices that make sense in a C5 context or centralized context in this context and so it was a chance I think for a whole bunch of us to go in and have these detailed conversations about how exactly it works uh and some of that was about front end some of that was technical some of that was all kinds of things right but I also think it sparked interest from a variety of folks who hadn't heard about defy or just kind of didn't really didn't get that it was distinct right they just thought it was like a they thought it was like oh there's like Alta Vista Northern Lights right there's like Bitcoin and there's D5 like they didn't really get that it was a different thing thing or I think it heard of it but didn't really know so there was a lot of Education that happened what I think is even more than that on legislative studs I do think a bunch of Staff really do understand at least the basics of this or what I think they really need to know to kind of craft effective legislation whether that's politically viable or not is a separate question but then I think on the agency side especially over at treasury you know that I think is an interesting conversation it's a tornado cash sparked a ton of very detailed conversations with you know researchers with academics with with technical experts around how all this worked and why did sanctioning this smart contract not make any sense that paved the way to a lot of conversations it would kind of backed into a lot of them are fundamentals rather around defy and again how it actually works in practice so I think a lot of that work remains intact like I think a lot of those folks are still around they're still there they're still interested there's been a lot of sharing of things things you know out to other folks that we didn't necessarily talk to directly I've had we've had tremendous pings on when I was at the world economic Forum we published this D5 policy makers toolkit like in 2020 I think it was and that's gotten like a new round of Engagement because it just kind of walks through why is it so challenging and how do we have to reimagine regulation as a general matter like how do you regulate something that doesn't have a person at the middle of it or a corporate entity like how do you do that how literally how do you do that it's a really interesting question so a lot of that I think kind of more academic type of thinking has also started to happen and that's why I also feel like Miller feels that there is an understanding that this is new it's early the market is still shaping itself up so unlike centralized systems which have been around for a while which do have analogs kind of In traditional markets more so than defy does I think there's an understanding from some folks that okay maybe like we saw in Mika in Europe there's more that needs to be done here more exploration more learning more education before we try to land language on how to regulate something that is just so Innovative and so new oh that's so fascinating what you said about tornado cash you know obviously at this moment coin Center is suing the office of foreign assets control and I think they're alleging that you know the action that they took there was actually unconstitutional now that there's been all that education and so many discussions around this do you feel that people in government are kind of viewing what happened with tornado cash is a mistake or do you feel that they're going to stick with the sanctions and maybe even sanction you know other smart contracts or or you know impose regulations on other smart contracts in the future that the crypto Community maybe feels does it make sense I think that you have to look at what the public policy goals were at that time and how kind of unusual that sort of action was happening and sort of The Dead Zone in August like all of that right so what are the public policy goals around sanctioning anything they are multi-fold but at the core it's to stop Bad actors often Rogue States from getting funding to do terrible things with I mean you have to kind of look at that public policy goal we actually wrote a paper at CCI we actually um asked uh someone named Juan zarati who's a national security expert to kind of think about this and like what are those goals right so do I think that ofac is going to act differently if they feel there's a perceived threat on the part of a rogue State look I mean I say I've said this before like post 911 we did not see a lot of holding back in Patriot Act quote compliance with things like the no-fly rule the concern was not civil liberties and civil rights the concern was we can't have terrorists getting on planes right so you have to kind of imagine what the scope of the threat that they're perceiving might be now all that being said I do think that a lot of the education done there was very helpful and I think it was quite it was very productive and I think it was very helpful to explain why that was not necessarily achieving what other ways might there be to achieve the same goals or how can we think about those valid goals I think we can acknowledge legitimate goals in the part of like not wanting Rogue states to do terrible things I think is probably a good idea for society but what are other ways of getting there that don't involve this broad overreach and basically doing too much right like just boiling the ocean rather than being very very targeted so I do think there's an understanding that there are ways to do that but at that time my view and again like no one ever shares until classified but my take was always there's got to be something out there that was so scary that they would engage in this kind of action in this kind of time frame with this kind of you know this in this kind of way so all that to say you know I don't I I don't tend to have a very look I am a huge civil rights civil liberties person I mean if you like look at my background like big time but I part of the reason that I feel so strongly about those issues is because again I watched as a person of South Asian descent as a brown person post 911 I watched those be just totally eroded in a certain community in you know in favor of again end quote you know National Security right and I just think every time you put those things on balance the government's going to come out and say we'd rather not have bad people do horrible awful things and Rogue states do horrible awful things and if people get sucked up in that and if we violate some constitutional freedoms maybe that's a trade-off we're willing to make I think that absolutely merits a lawsuit but I think that it's the kind of thing that is not necessarily going to I think it's a position that isn't necessarily going to be easily undermined if you want to put it that way yeah you have to remember that action came after uh you know major acts like the Ronan Bridge act which were attributed to the Lazarus Group which is a North Korean acting group uh so I think the you know the perception was that this this group was using this uh you know I I don't I can't speak to the understanding of tornado cash that treasury had before uh you know designating them the smart contracts on the entity list but there is something through which the Lazarus group is moving a large amount of assets uh and I think in any instance where that is happening the federal government is going to do something be it you know focused elegant or not I think this instance being being one of the latter examples but I think at the end of the day you know if if that is happening uh the predicate issue of you know Mass effects and it going to the Lazarus group I think that as a as an industry as an ecosystem it would be insane to think the government wouldn't do something it's just it's not not it's just not practical but here's the thing I actually think what countered that more effectively than anything else was what happened with Ukraine and the idea that you had Russia trying to block receipt of any kind of tradify route to the Ukrainian government and then you actually had crypto donations going to wallets that were legitimate that were docs self-docs if you like you know buy Ukrainian ministers and that cat and I testified about this as well that Catalyst providing a bridge while the International Community could figure out how to get funding through the you know billion dollars or whatever it's but at this point in time in aid over to that government to provide a wartime defense I mean that is that's the kind of magnitude we're talking about here right you're talking about defense of a country against an invasion and you're talking Rogue State supplying arms potentially to that Invader like that this is the magnitude what we're talking about we're not talking about like Joe Allison Bob right like Alice and Bob in this case are like nation states you know what I mean so you just kind of have to take that into perspective and consideration and the legal issues are critical but I also think that what is the role of a government How do they see themselves what's the role of national security it is National Security and so again putting that on balance with other things you always have to take into perspective like what how are you going to make that argument how are you going to make that compelling and I just think that's that's a perspective I think some folks sometimes don't necessarily take into consideration the way they should let's dive into Mika we did talk about it briefly earlier on but I just want to unpack what the regulation actually says and hear your thoughts on whether that's a good standard for the industry or or you know uh just in general like meaning if it's a good model for other jurisdictions to adopt I'll take the easy part and start with D5 uh which is I think it takes a great model with respect to the D5 or C5 debate which is uh let's start with C5 come back to D5 once uh you know we we hit the books so to speak um and I think that's it at the exactly the right approach to take into the vast majority of the consumers that policy makers are interested in uh protecting via regulation designed for C5 are in centralized uh exchanges and uh so you know I think it's it's accomplishing their objectives to a large extent uh while smartly approaching to E5 which is to to figure it out first um so with that I'll leave the hardware to Sheila yeah I think the reason we were able to I think get some of that or you know I I think there was a openness to the conversation around defy was the understanding of how early in the development it is and so I think it's important to note that Mika there is this thing possibly called Mika 2 you know and I do think that that is a place where they are going to kind of look at the study that they commissioned in Mika one if you will around defy and look and see so I don't think it's over yet but I do think that that approach was very sensible and I think it is a sensible approach frankly for the us as well which is to say you have to kind of take a wait and see on this because again the market hasn't even decided which of these different kinds of offerings is really compelling and gonna be super sticky and like where are we what directions they can attract all that kind of stuff is still being sorted out right so it's just very premature I think this is an example in my opinion of premature regulation anything that came down on D5 now would just be premature but I don't want people to think that you can take your eye off the ball in Europe and think that D5 is fully protected that's not really what we have what we we have is recognition acknowledgment of where we are in the evolution of the Innovation and then let's kind of see what happens and then see what if any irregulatory response or legislative response might look like that would be constructive and that would achieve the goals of preserving Innovation and The Innovation space while also protecting users and consumers so that's kind of where that landed I think the same thing happened with nfts right so again scene is kind of new and so there's the distinction and makeup between fractionalized nfts and you know pull and people nfts and so again an understanding that this is a space that is emerging and evolving so not to say that there won't be something that comes down from Europe that is quite even maybe dramatic on those topics but it is that there is an understanding that we do need to do more education do more study you know and kind of get to a place where there's enough consistent understanding of what we're actually talking about before we try to get in there and you know influence the course and trajectory of of how the Innovation winds up being realized and I think I saw a headline saying that something about how Mika could have prevented FTX is that kind of what the core of the rules are that it's something around custodial exchanges well I think the idea is that there's not something specific in Mika that could have prevented FTX right so and the question is like well should there have been and what should that have been and so people talk about it as like the loophole or I think there's different kinds of language people are using around this and again I have to go back to saying this is again oldest crime in the book right the fact that eat criminal counts brought across a variety of different kinds of charges is a really big deal and so I don't know that it is I don't know that I would agree with the statement that there's something that that could have been put in in advance or that would have realisticated that would have prevented FTX from happening I think what you need to have is more um a thought about what are the ways in which humans are able to manipulate systems in ways that humans emulated systems since the dawn of time and what protections do we have either to make that manipulation very transparent uh to have either because you have all different checks or whatever there's all kinds of ways you could do that right um or to make it like functionally impossible to pull off and those are different ways of achieving those kinds of goals but again I'll go back to the point I made earlier that I agrees with which is or this third path forward right which is the technical solution and making architecture and infrastructure around it that actually makes all of that de facto or default visible or very very difficult to engage in without a measure of transparency that could lead to immediate accountability around it so all those things I think will be considered what I like about the approach in Mika again is that they did take into consideration the Innovations around the technology you can kind of see that sprinkled throughout the entire comprehensive legislation is this acknowledgment there is something here that is new and that we don't really know what to do with from regulatory perspective yet but we think that we need to spend more time thinking about that and and looking at and examining you know what is that new transparency or that new visibility or all those different kinds of things what's that going to mean the other thing about Mika that is not really widely known that I think is important is there was a big consideration of AI and the influence of how is AI going to affect the internet as a general matter how is it going to affect business models how is it going to affect processes all of that and so there's an awareness that there's a lot happening in the AI space as well and so Mika too to the extent that that becomes a thing is I think going to look at the influence and the impact of AI on some of the ways that blockchain technology is deployed and look and see is there intersection there so there's all kinds of commissions and other things in the EU focus in the EP Focus specifically on on artificial intelligence as well and so I think look to see some of that language or thinking influence the influencing the way that some Europeans legislators and policy makers think about the space as well China is moving forward aggressively with multiple different Enterprise blockchain projects plus also its digital U1 I wondered how you thought that could affect other jurisdictions including the US I I how long do you want me to go on because I have a lot to say about this topic you know I think uh yeah I think that it would be very foolish I think for anyone in any jurisdiction in the world to underestimate the influence of what is happening in China on policy literally everywhere else in the entire world I mean it is just a very very important set of developments that have happened there and I don't mean China on crypto it's actually somewhat irrelevant I mean China on cbdc's on Sunday by digital currencies and thinking about digital assets as a general matter right so all the mining and this and that that I think the industry kind of focuses on is actually I think policy wise secondary in many ways to what is happening with digital U1 and the reason I say that is I think you have to look ahead to a world in which China has moved digital Yuan Beyond its borders so despite the pboc saying over and over again like it's just going to stay within China and everyone in China will use it which leads to its own potential human rights issues and other kinds of issues that we you know we don't have to spend time on today but we can if you want to I think we're already seeing um the encroachment of the data surveillance kind of approach we're seeing some of the engagement in Myanmar that's happened around this stuff but the bigger and more important thing is Chinese government investment into infrastructure all over the world I mean specifically into Latin America and into Africa to the African continent particularly sub-Saharan Africa and so there's already been there was a story that came out a couple of stories I think they're like 2020 around Zambia even around India and Modi and China the Chinese government basically going to them and saying we will invest significant a huge huge amount of investment into your infrastructure into your roads into your railroads into your everything to help this crumbling infrastructure and in exchange you know you use digital money you would use the digital you want you would basically that would be the unit of currency that we'd engage in transactions with and both those countries were like nope no thanks but my question is given that we have a global economy that is not willing to a allow for default on debt and B is not willing to relieve a lot of these countries of their significant debt burden is that going to last forever we have climate change coming we have infrastructure that's crumbling all over the world and in many parts of the world in the global South we've got people that are migrating at increasing frequency in these Anis continents in South America and in Africa there is a need for this kind of investment how long are some of these governments going to hold out and say forget it we don't want a surveillance tool or whatever they think it is we don't want you know this kind of money and a requirement around using these payment rails to come into our country is that going to last forever I don't think so so I think we're looking at a world in which in the absence of that kind of debt relief or support in other ways and you know look at no further than what's the willingness to support Ukraine to think I don't think it's I don't think the case to be made for like building railroads in certain parts of the country or the world is other countries is going to like be a big sell right so you're looking at a world in which all those factors come together and next thing you know you've got this digital currency coming out of China with all the data capture other things that are part of it maybe maybe not right there's design choices that could happen there who knows and suddenly that is becoming a dominant method of engaging in cross-border transactions and so that is happening like it's it's it's a thing that is happening it's a phenomenon that's really important to consider even if you look at the fact that the in published in India is going to lap China India has its own you didn't ask about India but I'll go there because it's so related India has its own unified payments infrastructure and architecture there they already have most of their money happening in digital ways it's not a blockchain back system at least at this time similarly right they have no expressed interest in moving beyond borders but as India becomes the most populous country in the world you're gonna see out of these two countries tremendous activity in the digital currency space that I think is going to set the stage digital Euro great fine whatever you've already got these two massive populations used to paying in this way the cultural shift has already happened so what's that going to mean for everybody else so I just think that this is a part of the world it is a a massively rapidly moving phenomenon that's happening in real time that's not getting I think some of the attention that it should because of course that's going to have implications on how you think about policy in every space National Security banking like in everything in everything I think also another thing to keep in mind is that countries don't necessarily need to sign up for this because private businesses I think are much more likely to do so without you know being able to resist uh the Temptation or the or the coercion to use something like uh like an Erb you know for example China could predicate Market access on foreign businesses using the RMB to do business and to uh you know take their assets out of the country and I think you know given the evidence of of for the U.S business uh businesses approach to China that wouldn't be a terribly high cost in the minds of of many Business Leaders I think they like the broader poet here that I think Sheila hit the nail on the head with is that cbdc is like just saying that is like a very meaningless term in that it can really is a it's a tabula rasa you could have the uh in a Chinese r b uh ermb system which in my mind is almost like the the apotheosis consists of a totalitarian technology or you could design a cbdc that has the fundamental characteristics of cash being completely fungible being anonymous being peer-to-peer so I think that you know the the cbdc debate kind of encapsulates these broader or reflect broader uh societal debates about you know what do we value as a society is it uh in a centralized omniscience or is it an individual privacy and it's uh I think you know the the new frontier of that debate I think just one with given how fundamental to Everyday Life money is one with it a pretty pretty extreme high stakes yeah and I think it's important to note that the privacy issues are are they're kind of like spotlighted and in an extreme way you know in in Erb I mean first I think that's just true however you know we've got and I can't I still can't get over what's happened in Arizona right in our own country where you've had using subpoenas deemed illegal you've had basically seizure of personal transaction records by the attorney general which is outrageous to me absolutely outrageous so these kinds of things like we are we are in a battle over privacy at a global scale and we are seeing different nations come down with very different views on what they think the importance of privacy is what privacy even means right so you had Christine Lagarde in May rather May 2022 in Davos she was basically saying digital Euro in four years and you know the the ECB and others have said we do want to lean into privacy we do think it's important um they did put out gdpr right Europe does tend to take consumer privacy particularly around Financial transactions somewhat seriously here the FED has basically said like I don't really know if we're going to do a cbdc of any kind a position by the way I support I don't I looked at this for a long time I don't necessarily see what the point of such a thing would be regardless they're they're what what is going to be lost because not every country is going to issue their own as you're going to have a default privacy setting in the digital currency space and the usage of some of this stuff is going to wind up being fought at the kind of user level right and that's not always going to be People's Choice to Miller's point about private businesses saying okay sure if as long as I'm within China's borders I'll use your system because I want to be there and you know why not right those things are sticky and contagious and before you know it you kind of get that contagion of the orientation you have with something that's fundamental as privacy leading over to other parts of your system and that's just something that I think is really really important and we should all be paying a tremendous amount of attention to which I know in this space of course we are all right well it's sort of a bleak note to end on I guess um it's good to you know have everybody you know pay attention to these important issues and I should mention that um I had Michael Casey and Neil Ferguson on the show it was actually I it might even be like two years ago now but the point is that we actually discussed a lot of these issues in depth so I would urge you to go back and listen to that if you missed that episode we'll link to it in the show notes um Sheila and Miller this has been such a pleasure where can people learn more about you and your work I'm certainly on Twitter and so is the crypto council at crypto underscore Council and I'm Sheila underscore Warren yes find us on Twitter at fund underscore D5 perfect it's been great having you on on change thank you thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about Sheila Miller and what crypto regulation could look like in 2023 check out the show notes for this episode Unchained is produced by me Laura Shin with out from Anthony Yoon Mark Murdock Matt pilchard Zach seaward on iranovich Sam Shriram
