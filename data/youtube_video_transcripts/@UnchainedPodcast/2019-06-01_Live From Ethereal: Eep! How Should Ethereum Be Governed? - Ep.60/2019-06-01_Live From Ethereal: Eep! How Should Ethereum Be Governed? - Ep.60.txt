engineer at consensus hi everyone welcome to our panel eeep how should a theorem be governed I keep it as somewhat cheesy name and I was a little bit embarrassed when I looked at it earlier but they actually really liked it so I'm glad so we're gonna be discussing some of the major questions that aetherium is facing today around what to do with frozen funds whether or not to cap the money supply and other questions and all those things raise an even bigger question which is how should a theorem be governed and here to discuss this topic with me are Nick Dodson founder of govern X and a senior engineer at consensus and vlad sam farren aetherium researcher so why don't we start with a little background on each of you why don't we start with blood what is your background and what do you do in a theorem well I guess I work on consensus protocols and specifically proof proof of stake and charting and I also do some work on boxing governance which mmm it's still a work in progress but I'm happy to share what little insight I can I can I can garnish hey Nick hello so I work with with consensus and I've been researching and developing governance systems and organizations for like about three years so govern X is kind of consensus governance research and development body and so yeah it's been it's been a pretty crazy ride so far especially with the Dow and a bunch of other stuff my focus is more on internal governance mechanisms and kind of looking at systems that will work say inside aetherium but I think I have some insights on governance itself and you know protocol governance I'll shed as much light as I can on that as well okay great so let's start with the most basic turn it's our term let's define governance when you think of governance at Theory M what are you thinking of sure well I like to give a kind of three stage definition first I should I tell people governance is about making decisions and and then and then I just try to tell them as governance is about how we coordinate around our decision-making processes and then I try to tell them that governance is actually the way that which in which we legitimize and D legitimize the processes that we use to make decisions so it's kind of a decision-making process but kind of like super meta because it also includes all the politics by which we legitimize and D legitimize the ways and norms that we use to to actually make these decisions and what about you how do you think yeah I'd agree with that for the most part I think I I kind of divided into a few different tiers I think there's just broad governance in process in general which can be used in in any system and then you have internal governance systems like dows or organizations where it's fairly opt-in and then you have protocol governance which is you know effectively being communally and organizationally agreed-upon in many different contexts and with a lot of different people and players involved and you know so when I think about the three icon I kind of think of them like that yeah and so what models from traditional governance do you think apply here do you want to start well I'm not really familiar with traditional governance so it's a bit hard for me but but but I do benefit somewhat from conversations I have with people who are more familiar with traditional inner governance and I and I I think I've learned I'll kind of a lot from like lawyers and people with backgrounds and political science and sociology and but you know I think mostly the story is actually not so much about the particular decision making processes but about the humans and the politics and the the the kind of debate and like the that goes around actually legitimizing and getting people to actually agree to use and go with the decisions that that are made as opposed to the actual like you know voting systems well let's just talk about how aetherium is governed today how would you describe it well I mean so I'll provide my view but I how I think it's being governed so right now I see the foundation is offering what they believe to be their view of etherium and their protocol and the standard for that and as flat and I were talking before that you know there's a development wing that's gonna go and develop that as well there's VIP admins and they're kind of straddling between the the conversation and the community signals that they're probably getting privately let's just define a IP for people who may not know yeah so that's the etherium improvement protocol so it's just a basic application you know process to say I want to improve you know a particular standard you know whether it be token standard or actually changing lower-level opcodes or any aspect of the etherium you know ecosystem that the standards been a rule on or have have ideas about and so you know the the admin's do do effectively you know a vote and they draw in what ii ip's they think are most most relevant and then they're going to you know push forward on those and so there's more processes to it but you know that's in my view the current system that we have and there a lot of different consideration that goes into it I think the people who are currently doing it have to sit between miners actual community members community leaders people in the foundation business like there's a lot of different factors going into the considerations of those II ip's right now and of course the technological vision that you know was started by Vitalik and has now grown into this this bigger thing yeah but yeah way to jump into the weeds yeah so I just take a step back it's just a frame the EAP poses a little more I think blockchains are fundamentally distributed systems which means that there are software running on computers on some kind of network usually the internet and so we have like two things that fundamentally need to be governed just because of that right there's like the nodes that run the software and there's a software and software repositories Nick mentioned the software developers and the eeap's process which is a process by which developers of the different implementations of etherium and you know receive input from any basically anyone with a github account about maybe some proposals or requests for comments and you know things of that nature to try to improve the protocol so the etherium improvement for a process is like it's a place where you're making their own improvement proposals and that that eventually if you're lucky that developers will have will talk about your your proposal and implement it implemented into the implementations of the software and if they're lucky the people who are running the nodes of the distributed system will actually install the software and normally the developers kind of care a lot about making sure that the software that they write people will use and so they're worried a lot about making sure they don't do anything unpopular making sure that the things that they do basically follow the consensus and when there's a lack of consensus that developers have this kind of headache of trying to decide what to do given that actually there there are you know there are there are costs to failed upgrade so it is important yeah well I mean if they're in classic yeah I mean we have we we we somehow I wouldn't call it I wouldn't call it Dow hard work failed upgrade at all but there the theorem classic is actually a good example of Ilana there's a lot of coordination costs around a few things one of those like well there's a replate this transaction replays and then there's also the trademark issue which something I haven't bought up yet but blockchains are also identified by name and this means that they're that the trademark and the name by which people use to refer the ball change there's another resource that ends up being super important super important part of watching governance but what I meant in that regard was I think like the fact that aetherium classic even exists at all is because people didn't think that decision to hard fork after the Dow was legitimate am I wrong in thinking that so so basically when the Dow how happened and during the following kind of governance debate there was a tremendous amount of attention from a tremendous amount of people and definitely there are people who thought that the decision was illegitimate and didn't go with it but you know III think that for the most part people who started the tarrant classic community and joined it in the early days were not part of the etherium community and actually we're outsiders who were upset with the precedent that Aaron was setting and so yes but I'm not sort of that if that is a as to what didn't a theorem community as much as in the broader watching community know interesting well let's just go back to this question of how a theorem is governed because you describe this like super open system where you know anybody couldn't submit these different proposals and stuff like that so how do we funnel from that really open system to a decision like how do the different people make their voices heard who does a listening who makes the final call how does all that happen or how should it happen well it's really complicates a really complicated kind of process because there's no single decision-making there's lots of there's lots of little decisions but none of them are like the one decision that makes the change right so there's there's commits to software repositories there's software releases and software repositories there's like the choice of like at what height the change becomes activated there's people's decision whether or not to install the software and then people's decisions about which chain to call aetherium or bitcoin after the after the fact and so that all of these processes are kind of separate and each of them are involved in like kind of collectively pulling the trigger but I think that looking at each of these individual processes too closely misses the broader story of the political conversation and coordination that goes on around around this drama because everyone wants to be with their peers mostly the overarching driver is like I want to be where my friends are I want to be using to watching the devaron else is using but also people have you know different intentions for the future of the blockchain and when there's emergencies or things like a dower the things don't behave as intended they're people you know want want recourse and they want to use you for change covered Institute to to make these decisions but you know they can't do it themselves like no individual developer or node operator can actually Institute these things you need to coordinate with the community to get them to get so it's in such a way that it let me rephrase the communities to coordinator round up grades and it there definitely are people who are more well-connected in the community and in some way they naturally have much more political power and much more ability to convince people or to make people feel like everyone is going that way as opposed to this way and so I think there's a lot of soft power and there is some extent to which some people in the process have explicit power like for example there is someone who plans the all devs call which is every two weeks Friday call and they to some extent gets to get to decide like what this is what the schedule is going to be what to include in there and who get it to some extent who gets to show up on the call there are are eep editors calls so this year Foundation has been facilitating it from start right now as an early Hudson Hudson Jameson who's not here but you should all be familiar with he's a hero of aetherium governance and so keep going I interact oh so the eat and then there's editors eep editors have some discretion over which eeap's go when eats go from different stages and that's a little bit complicated but and that every known operator has discretion over what's often runs in their node every exchange has a discretion over which token take her to list next to which blockchain every Boston Explorer similarly but none of these people are actually going to be you know calling the shots for the whole system they're there they're kind of they have a limited scope of their decisions and gave each of those entities power like obviously the etherium foundation I guess is the one who said like okay Hudson Jamison will manage these calls but then like what about the EEP editors like is it all the foundation that's putting all these people in these roles or well so the Foundation has you know they have their assignment of the people they believe to be eep editors and you know ones that are ready to do that role of editing prioritizing and actually accepting based upon all the feedback in the community but there's also as Vlad mentioned a tremendous amount of pure literal peer pressure or networking that's going on constantly where if italic tomorrow just said we're putting a hard cap on it Syria there's a tremendous amount of pure coordination that would probably work against him on that and so even if he tried to do that and try to push it through both the processes of the EEP editors the the social community and all different peers that we have together in our system the miners and everything else would probably root against that and so some may be for but some may be against and so I think what we're trying to say is you know our governance is inherently social but most governance is actually the real work is social and I think out of all the research that I've learned right now with working with governance and working with aetherium primarily is that the contracts and implementations are fairly uninteresting it's more about how you're going to socially coordinate structures and just you're leveraging the mechanisms within a theory we're leveraging these new kinds of ways of thinking but primarily the majority of the coordination is still social and still just convincing people just like you would on a board or in a company to come to your side and we don't want half the immunity to be one way or the other on a particular EIP we want people to come to a broader consensus and a broader majority before moves forward and there's always going to be people who aren't a minority who will disagree with it but it's trying to reduce that pressure constantly in the minute minority role and when you set that Vitalik if you try to kind of you know laterally do something there would be pressure against him is not just because he was he would be trying to do it unilaterally or like well you know it's because of the it would be has the absence of the like preceding political discussion and settlement where we kind of have the public debate and we're like where were the ideas and are like you know fleshed out and we kind of get to a point where we feel like there's actual consent so right now it feels like there isn't kind of like an objective measure of figuring out what the will of the community is right like right there you know like ways to measure that or is it all just sort of this loosey-goosey like let's check the discussion boards and sort of see where we think the wind is blowing I think this is where an interesting conversation is gonna happen potentially about the fact that I think it's I think it's messy - like simplify it this whole this whole consideration process but the thing is is it's it's naturally forming and there's a lot of nice natural formations within it even though it is slightly messy wait so what are some of those natural formations I would say that the fact that the foundation is is actually deeply considering lots of different angles as the IP editors and they are acting in a way as a delegate to the whole community and that comes with a tremendous amount of responsibility and role and they take it very seriously and I think that that was not written into a system that was not derived or directed that they do that it's just what they feel because they care and they love so much about what we do and so I think these are part of the naturally forming things that the community brought together and that you when I joined aetherium I was naturally attracted to because it is the collective whole that's moving this forward and and I still feel like while our formal or objective process is messy that the collective whole is still moving forward in a really positive and somewhat objective way which is which is really interesting so is it the etherium foundations jobs it kind of like you know make these decisions and say like this is how we're gonna do things these are the processes we're gonna follow like are they kind of the ultimate decider I don't mean I definitely don't think so and I think I was like look historically or what's happened like for any of that it's like I mean the each process you know wasn't like it happened out of necessity the all devs call happened out of necessity they weren't really like official foundations decisions either even though they were made by people who were paid by the foundation the foundation mostly plays like a support kind of role where they provide a lot of administrative support and financial support for developers but even but the foundation isn't even I mean it like somehow I think the found people misunderstand and think that the foundation has a much bigger role than it does because it doesn't and like I don't think there's been like too much like clear communication about what those roles are because I mean we somehow we don't really know but also historically if you look at for example the Dow crisis the foundation was pretty much not involved at all it was completely unwilling to participate because of like fear of being legally somehow responsible for that for that and so we had to like it all coordinate extra protocol and it definitely is a huge challenge to figure out where people are we can think about different types of stakeholders in the community and some of our peers might be in some of those but it's very very difficult for example for us to get input from people who are buying tokens and who are don't really participate except for on a speculative basis but and they don't know about like you know coin votes right there's people who do know about the the kind of Cohen voting but coin voting if you were if we were to Institute that it would disenfranchise everyone who isn't a big coin holder ya know so and then there's okay mining is do we remember mining powers we can measure transaction fees there's a fee there's a but our I would say there are ability to signal to each other what our opinions are in a way that is Civil resistant and secure in crisis is kind of lacking and definitely could be improved I think the number one kind of way that we kind of gauge community sentiment around stuff is we participate in the forums we tend we talk to our peers and and when we watch the kind of discrepancy and think about and we think about like the kind of state of the conversation in public and we think about the state of the conversation in private channels and and and somehow the some people in the community have are much more connected than others so not everyone is able to tell and if you are super connected doesn't necessarily mean that you're not in a bubble here and so it is really hard to tell what the community kind of wants but you know we do always have contentious hard Forks yeah yeah well it's good that you'll answer this question about the role of the foundation as saying that they're not deciding everything because where I was going with that was if the foundation is sort of deciding all these things then that sort of lends credence to this argument that ether could be considered as security but since we didn't go that route and I won't push that yeah something about you know if if there is this reliance on the foundation then you know if a single entity has seemed to be in control of that so so this comes back to like what my view is on the foundation which is more or less that it's it's offering a very pure oriented view or signal to everyone of where they believe that this particular technology should be going but it's really up to minors and the entire collective whole to truly buy into that and believe in it whether it be actually technically running nodes or technically mining and you know miners after the DAO fork collectively moved forward in general with that particular IP now there was some that didn't but they were relatively opportunists in the sense that they were just taking the opportunity to mine classic and probably profit greatly but the collective hold the miners really truly made the final decision there and when we saw that there was mining on the new chain with the for we got further confirmation that the verifiers and the the huge stakeholders that put in the verification to to our network have decided that they were going to verify this particular this particular channel not the other yeah yeah well actually I want to go back to something Vlad also mentioned which was voting as we know in general in life not just in the crypto world participation and voting can be low and I worry that if we move sort of like toward a more on Shan governance thing that will end up in this sort of oligopoly where like people the big whales who have lots of coins are really the only ones to be motivated to to vote so what do you think of kind of these ideas run on chain governance and ways to improve participation in voting because as someone he mentioned in my podcast I think it was Ryan's or Poli chain and he was talking about how after the Dow there was some decisions to be made that should have been a no-brainer I think it was like to extend the the tire I don't remember the exact details but he was just like oh this is something where if anybody put money in like they should have wanted to do this right but they didn't have a quorum because people it was like difficult to vote and they just like kind of didn't care so where do you think you know that's gonna go and like what do you think the potential isn't on chain boating yeah so I mean I have a huge problem with Aunty and governance basically because Aunty and governance creates a default where there's something on the chain some smart contract system somehow which determines the default upgrade path for all the node operators which means that known operators are now kind of if they do nothing they will upgrade to follow the follow the signal of this on chain mechanism and so if they develop a norm or even if this happens a couple of times they'll build the expectation that donor operators just follow the denied the on chain governance mechanism and then node operators become disenfranchised of their role in governance like your role as someone who runs a full node is no longer than important because the full node operators have a norm where instead instead of having to coordinate on every upgrade and actually actively consent to them instead they're they're left with the default journey fault which basically is the tyranny of whatever coin holders or whoever gets the votes in that in the Unchained governance system I'm assuming you know for now just like that is a voting system but so the Archon governance system is gonna have to say who gets to like you know exactly formally specify what leads to a decision and that's going to empower some people and disempower others and it will definitely disempower note operators and I actually think that note operators are an incredibly important part of blocking governance because there are the exchanges the block explorers the you know they're there the services the people who actually have users whereas like coin holders and miners are you know don't have are necessarily representing users at all and so they have I think you know there's less of a reason to believe they're going to be you know that they're gonna have interest in line with user interests then note operators yeah I think so I also adamantly agree with the current ideas about implementing on chain governance and it's mainly because as Vlad beautifully mentioned in every way that it enforces a rigidity that is not going to accept a lot of the new social contexts and logic and different understandings that we have and it will not be dynamic enough to flex and flux with what the community is currently coming out with and also in general implementing these rigid systems it really it's you shoot yourself on the foot and in a big way and and so we have a tremendous amount of different stakeholders and different systems at play and different people who are shaping this this ecosystem and to think that you can write some code and put some logic in a chain that's going to somehow mediate between all those stakeholders effectively at this current time is really really immature and anyone or any protocol that's that's mentioning or enforcing or saying that their protocol is significantly better in any way because there's on chain governance they are truly not understanding the depth of social social consensus that is enormous with these protocols and I truly mean that so throwing shade at ethereal I'm throwing I'm throwing shade at particular protocols like to ship on chain governance mixing governance but I'm curious link do you think voting as a mechanism is also a yes so here's kind of my feeling right I actually don't think that voting is normally a decision-making process I think voting is a process by which we legitimize decisions yeah and so actually the vote of voting is meant to make clear for everyone what is the political environment that we find ourselves in and what what and and so somehow the decision isn't meant to be you know in the voting but it's meant to be in the political conversations that you have and the political debate before so in my kind of view like the main reason why people want to on 10 governance is because they want a source a clear source of legitimacy for the further decisions more so than actually because of their concern of making good decisions or effective decisions and actually they are so like the streamlining of the process to make decisions isn't you know is it really going to speed things up because actually the bottleneck is the governance is the political aspect the social side much more than actually the it is is the it's much more of a political problem than a process problem yeah I don't know if I fully understand so you want to incorporate voting in what way like well I mean I don't know who get the votes and so I'm terrified of that yeah but I just don't think that in general people use voting to make decisions I think in general it's mostly used to legitimize decisions that they make extra protocol make decisions that you Protocol coordinate to push it through the voting system you know so to legitimize decisions that are made extra vertical so so so like when we talk about voting it's it's in many ways what becomes the big flag in our head the like oh well no in votes or these particular problems are there but it's actually as well I've mentioned if voting is in many ways just the it's a final signified flag on a particular you know representation of what people are feeling or what consensus has happened and so really you know when we talk about voting systems being broken I think what we're talking about is is that representation is fundamentally being broken because the finalization process is not very good and and so a lot of people in the room have a tremendous amount of dynamic interests and preferences that are being factored in to what's happening and I think right now our current system with aetherium governance is actually more in tune with that being in its current status than if we implemented some rigid voting mechanism where we gave weight out to whoever we thought were stakeholders because we would then break the finalization process of representation process more than it's already broken now but I agree that we should move towards more objective systems and measures but it needs to come from a lot of good sources of debate and logic and and really understanding what everyone's truly feeling and thinking and it can't just be you know yeah we have this vote and now we're upgraded like not yet at least maybe in the future but but not right now in my opinion so the benefit of voting is that it lends legitimacy to any outcome yeah but yet you guys aren't in line exactly with that process and you know overall like what what would you prefer like what other system because I think like right now we all think this isn't you know the best way we could beat well so I think people are people are voting right now but it's implicit voting it's kind of like when nodes choose to run the new protocol they're voting in a way to choose that particular channel or that new thing when miners go to validate they choose by their vote of their resources and their power to move towards that channel but the thing is is is you know to flag some kind of explicit system what may end up happening is we improperly wait the various stakeholders and and we improperly wait the various people who can vote and then you're going to get a lot of problems with representation so so I think we actually are voting right now in many ways but we're doing it in many tiers and and in a more dynamic fashion and so it's and it's a more implicit than anything but the foundation does actually do between the IP IP editors like there is a vote there's a sign-off between them so there's some kind of voting the foundation but like that's not where that ends like there's a lot more voting or representation that happens to get things moving along it with the protocol yeah glad you thought sir yeah so I mean I mean I think though there's a couple things here one of them is like oh if people have like a formal system that they knew they could follow they could think it's more easier to participate and that kind of creates some legitimacy right and that's I think I and any other is when there's if there's a clear decision to be made and I don't can identify a decision it's you here to go with it and so like that crazy legitimacy also but I think that like we can get legitimacy for watching governance without making it owned by people who hold votes so I don't think that anyone should explicitly control the blockchain I think it's really dangerous to create a class of like blockchain owners which is what these who these voters would be if you did like an on chain governance type of thing where everyone had to upgrade effectively so so I I'm actually very optimistic that we can find legitimate or source of legitimacy that aren't votes with some like specified set of voters and I think I think just leaning leading on that to like all of this stuff that's happening right now in terms of what we're doing with this technology and where this space is shaping is is really a form of human expression and we're just moving towards certain direction of that expression and you know it's not it's not it doesn't have to necessarily be this explicitly scientific kind of thing it really is a lot of really critical thinkers expressing in a certain direction that we want to head towards a more fault tolerant or decentralize world and you know we're going to move there and get there and I think people get way too down in the weeds on the particular nuances of the system which are important to formalize and finalize but which are not the be attend all of the system or or how we collectively move forward so I think there's just there's just so much to it cryptocurrency is vibrant and exciting but it's not without its share of bad actors exchanges and

people who suggest code and that's primarily men I think I mean they're primarily men whether or not the power is there right like even if it's the cryptocurrency it's primarily my wait no I'm not saying it's just a theory M but I just was kind of thinking like you know for talking about block chains and about how they're gonna democratize everything and like more inclusion for everyone and blah blah blah and yet we've kind of got this power that's consolidating amongst this group in a way that just perpetuates the inequalities of our current society do you have any ideas around how to change that well I mean I think there's well I think it's actually much less bad than you paint it because we do have the offer you do have the ability to opt out and and and and everyone can access the system and the system is provided in a non-discriminatory fashion anyone can make a transaction it's like like really anyone and in a way in a way that is really super open and then that's the way in which it's inclusive really is that it's like super public like the salton is not owned by anyone and it's probably but the system are being decided by so so so I actually I think I think with this well once again what we're seeing is that you know there is a predominant male system here that's that's unfolding and I think what we're talking about is the shaping of the future of this form human expression is not being done with enough rep Zeb's of the diverse planet that we have because it's supposed to be collectively for everyone and it's not supposed to be just particularly directed by by men and I think I completely agree with you that women are not represented enough in all the processes and in tech in general and I think you know we definitely need to move toward a world where that's changed and that's addressed and I think you know when when we started doing this like it I it was basically a bunch of guys like that I remember and lightly you know and and so it does need to change and represent representation does need to be increased significantly I think I think we just need to allow everyone to believe that they can be a part of this and that it really is truly for all of humanity and just because it is a bunch of guys in general right now doing it that doesn't mean that it's the way that it will be or the way that it should be and I think like we'll get we're moving toward it and we can do more work to get there I think yeah yeah I just want to say it's the developers don't control the blockchain I find I like I don't even think the developers actually have that much power like can't really actually do almost anything contentious they they they are they're petrified by their by their fear of legal consequences that value petrified by their fear of the community not liking what they do developers are really much less empowered than actually you might think the ones writing the whole system I mean it's there they have the power to propose things but when if they propose something that people don't accept or don't like then that looks bad on them and makes it actually waste their time and effort and it gives them a lot of headaches and so what I'm saying is they're they're not even close to unconstrained and actually I think people who participate in the media actually have a lot of the times much more power over governance then then people do in the actual actually developers because if you can set public sentiment around whether or not a fork is good or not that is much more power like me or something no no not you specifically like maybe desk or someone like that you know coined us for example participates in watching governance all the time right they use trademarks they you they they don't and they do it without really noting that they might be confusing there's a lots of ways in which people influence outcomes in the Box chain space and actually the developers for the most part are just trying to get along and write code they don't even especially don't want to be involved in any politics yeah and I think that makes it maybe in some way hard to participate in in with the developers developers maybe don't recognize the power they have because the people that are writing the rules for the system they're the ones who really control it sure so developers of projects that haven't been released yet have a tremendous amount of power they get to set the rules but after the system is live yeah so it's a completely different story I think just just to talk to that for a second to so we have incredible engineers working on all this stuff and they're doing fantastic work but in I'm an engineer and the thing is is that engineers are great at getting you from point A to B but if you don't know what B is it's not very clear they'll try to get there but they'll  it all up if they don't know where the Northern Star is and trust me in my own life I've kept it up a lot because I had no idea what the Northern Star was but I was trying to get there was trying to engineer it engineer to worte but if you can't present the clear vision you can't present the trajectory at the direction engineers are great and they're incredible and they'll get you there but if you don't know where there is it doesn't matter how many engineers you have you don't know where there is so I think you know yes engineers are great but you need to present what what it's going to be and so that's more than engineering that's a lot more than just engineering so yeah you guys should actually check out a podcast I just released on unconfirmed which is my short podcast it just came up Friday but there's this woman who's been doing this research on like blockchain ethics and it's just all about how like you should be really intentional about thinking about these things because I think you're right like everybody's just like doing stuff but nobody's like being really conscious about you know where this is all going and I'm glad like you know I raise these questions because I think they're important but I think as you can see like maybe you guys are heads down just like doing work but you're not thinking about like big picture you know what I mean so I think the person tend to not think about big picture yeah agree the livers don't there's a lot of people who do right there's a lot of people in the blockchain space who are here most people I would say in the watching space are here for you know some because of some system they're unhappy with or because some distrust that they have or because it's something like there's people have really they're here for a reason even even though it's like that there was a lot of a lot of times developers just get into this mode or where where they're here to maintain the code base or they're here to you know just do engineering yeah the blockchain space is incredibly intentional I mean we are here for a reason yeah so so I just want to say that I think the buy-in for engineers don't need to be convinced to go change the world they just say yeah I think this could change the world and they'll go do it they don't need to be convinced but they they go heads down and then they start working because that's what they do and they're fantastic of that but the thing is is you know with aetherium in general like in my view and especially after working with it for four three years now and working a blockchain for a little longer most of this technology is a technology of ethics it's not necessarily going to make things more efficient in certain terms now of course if we come to fruition with what we want to build here it will be tremendously more efficient but the more blockchain you jammed down any product right now it's going to make it way worse and like and it just does everything makes it way worse but we're doing it because we believe it's going to democratize or make it more fair make it more ethical make it more inclusive and that's why we move towards the direction of using it and the thing is is like there are certain things that it will make tremendously more efficient and there's no debate about that and where a lot of us are here for efficiency but there's many of us in the room who here because they believe it will change the ethical state of our world it will change ethics or at least it will represent how we truly feel about the world and about ethics and so we're here to try and change the world I do agree there is a disconnect in many cases where you get your head down and you forget about the world you want to go see in the world you want to go change and then you just kind of you know wake up every now and then and go oh yes that's right we were supposed to change the world and then you you know keep working but the thing is is like I I do agree you have to keep your eye on the prize that you know this is about collectively moving humanity forward and so we're trying to get there as best we can I think there's just there's a lot of different stakeholders and people in the room but it's supposed to change the world in a positive way or at least prevent bad outcomes yes prevent bad outcomes which is still a better outcome in general yeah yeah I mean look at what's going on with the petrol and with North Korea mining cryptocurrency I mean I don't know if like only idealistic views about all the good that blockchain can do well you know come to fruition so it's not a foregone conclusion I do agree that like there's a lot of potential there but oh yeah but you know the story that is gonna prevent bad outcomes isn't the same as the story that the good will be more than the bad right definitely people can well you will abuse the blockchain and use it for things that the US government doesn't agree with but that doesn't mean that like the blockchain as a whole is something that isn't something we can justify working on and actually I think that there's a really good case to be made that they're like you know we want the blockchain to exist and we want it to exist and we weren't watching governance to be outside of the jurisdiction in the United States and we wanted to be outside of the jurisdiction of the EU we want to make sure that we have a system that is kind of globally when they be governed on a global international basis as opposed to it something that unilaterally can be ruled on by a single Court okay well let's talk about law actually because like existing laws because that's another topic that I wanted to discuss how to do existing laws intersect with blockchain governance well that's a great question and it's complicated a little bit because the different components of watching governance are in different jurisdictions different know it's exist in different jurisdictions and their note operators are presumably subject to the law in that jurisdiction and you know the people the software developers are in different jurisdictions and that presumably subject to the law and their jurisdictions all of the services you know you know who use the trademark similarly presumably are subject to their jurisdiction and so everyone is subject to the jurisdictions that they are subject to and every and and so like and the blockchain doesn't exist in just one jurisdiction right it has it's a it's a consensus protocol that where a lot of the value comes from the fact that it expands across many jurisdictions and that means that everyone will want to have a say on this you know and and and and then actually it's kind of complicated and it's super unclear to me how things will go but I but I'm excited it's going to be a lot of popcorn time so I mean if the blockchain is governed by multiple jurisdictions and how do you set up rules in such a way where it's not you know like where where it can multiply up right across multiple jurisdictions well I mean you have to we have to coordinate on a global basis yeah yeah I think so jurisdictionally it is complicated and I think the actual physical act of running notes or validators are mining or making a transaction from particular IP is going to be where you know the concept of aetherium the world of aetherium the computing machine of aetherium actually touches the earth and is then in an actual country's legal jurisdiction I think the thing is is when we talk about governance it is considered in a lot of the decision-making as well like would this make this particular thing tremendously illegal in most jurisdictions if it would then we shouldn't do it however we can't operate on a basis where just because it may be my newly or irrelevantly or illegitimately somewhat illegal in certain jurisdictions a big factor in our decision-making when we're trying to move this particular protocol technology forward and I think it is a bit of a balancing or navigation act but at the same time like you know this is a really formal instantiation of laws and protocol in our own opt-in system called aetherium that is moving towards a direction and is currently shaping laws and jurisdictions as well and laws have to be updated just like the protocol has to be updated and I think updates are coming all around the world to both better understand where this is headed and to better adapt to a more reasonable situation I just think some of us are definitely scared of certain laws or certain things where it doesn't feel like they've built a strong enough understanding of the technology and there you know prematurely regulating certain things that it clearly would present huge hassles huge inefficiencies and would definitely ruin this particular benefit of the technology in that jurisdiction so it's a very complicated balancing act but I think it's shaping law it's changing the way lawyers think about law it's changing the way lawyers think about every day of their lives and and lawmakers as well and so just like any new technology that that mean rapidly changes society you have to build laws that are going to adapt and change to that so yeah but it's a complex it's a really complicated story and there's there's a kind of perverse thing that happens also which is that the lack of legal clarity means that everyone's petrified that no one's willing to take responsibility for anything that happens yeah and that means that the probability that there's gonna be some blowback that actually brought warrants legal action is much higher so like people in blocking governments just don't want the bar chain to be were their responsibility because they're afraid and about what that would mean from a legal point of view which makes them like directly unable to do the thing that they should be doing watching governance because they're too scared actually I think the lack of legal clarity is a pretty big issue and if we had legal clarity then I think it would be easier to say think about whether or not you have liabilities as Annie Pettit err yeah and I would also also say too just to that that there's a lot of businesses and a lot of a lot of new concepts that when they started were in what was effectively a legal gray zone where lawyers and the project has to carefully navigate what they believe to be the most ethical or best practice to move forward in this legal brazen and because there truly is laws that are going to either directly interact or not interact so sometimes it is just a navigation act between lawyers and their best interpretations and so I think with the theorem in many ways there is going to be a lot of legal Gray's on that there they're constantly trying to clear and it is a huge navigation act between many different you know you know legal analysis of the situation to move there so yeah it's tremendously difficult intramural tourists alike I think everyone in the community has to you know they have to feel comfortable that we're navigating that well and like especially the EIP editors right now one of them left because they felt they were somewhat responsible for the protocol and to be honest I can't sit here with legal clarity and that makes me uncomfortable I want to say that that's not true but at the same time we we have to we have to gain more legal legal clarity navigate the gray zones yeah yeah so I'm gonna ask them one last question but we're gonna take Q&A after that so for those of you who want to ask questions there's a microphone there and I think there's another one maybe over there somewhere I'm not actually sure but just so you know also this is being recorded for my podcast we're gonna release in my podcast so I just want you to know that you know when you state your question please speak into the microphone but also we'll go out on my podcast so just before we take the questions last question is just about the GDP are like this right to be forgotten and how does that intersect with watching just quickly because there's a lot of people lining up yeah it's a great question is one of these many questions that we don't really have an answer to because basically the I mean the law is hasn't really been tested and we don't really don't really know we don't have that much clarity and also we certainly are not set up in the Bakhtin governance to comply with GDP our and and that means both that like what well-known operators may be prepared to take their notes offline the developers definitely are not prepared to Institute GDP our compliance into the core protocol partially because that's incredibly contentious and it's absolutely not something that it's clear that people would accept okay let's let's move to questions go ahead first question with regards to the recent parity issues do you think there will be a heart fork and if a heart fork will happen do you think there will be a chain split because of the heart Fork and if there's a chain split do you think both chains will be live or one of them will fade into obscurity great question oh well okay so I think right now given my current understanding of the parody wallet situation which to remind everyone a wallet exploded people want to change the theorem to fix it it happened again but in a smaller way so I don't see the sentiment to actually hard fork or to fork in general I see that certain projects that have a lot of community involvement definitely support it but I think in general the sentiment is not there to to support a hard fork and I think in general the motivation to push towards that it's not really there because with the Dow it was I think 7 or 9 percent of all the ether was trapped in a contract 14 yeah 14 yeah 14 percent yeah 14 percent and so that was a tremendous amount of the ecosystem and not only that you know a tremendous amount of believers in the system and it was just a different time it was a much more mature an earlier time I think right now we're at a different stage where given the amount given the size given what happened given the nature of it given the sentiment I don't see a hard fork happening and if they did I mean once again everyone's welcome to hard fork at any time and create their own for can go do that there is a trademark thing that like you know you have to deal with but yeah let's let's try to move a bit quickly how do you feel what I give 10 seconds on this yeah I mean I actually don't entirely agree with your neck I came not prepared to read the sentiment and so I don't really know okay but what I will say is that I think this conversation should be escalated to a broader conversation about like irregular state transitions the eeap's like our responsibilities in governing the platform and me and basically to make sure that whatever decision we make now is follows a process which we'll be happy to follow in the future because as an accept there's not a certain level of attention that we had in the town and because there's not everyone paying attention to this conversation the process that's followed is super important because it can't really be secured just by by like a huge threshold of attention okay great thank you as individuals that think very deeply about governance what is your opinion on the United States governance system and do you think there are any small changes that we can make to make it better fun I mean I do say I can't say that from like my outside perspective it seems like there might be a crisis of legitimacy of some sort of some branches of government and maybe the media but I don't it doesn't seem like mmm there's like a crisis of legitimacy the Constitution just of particular branches of government so maybe maybe just like a reset but honestly like I'm not on this is not my area this is a little bit off topic let's take the next question also we're two Canadians sitting here so we have you know we have a wall of hugs yes it's different I'm interested in the life cycle of the ERC process so and there's a theory request for comment mate can you go through the whole life cycle who requests it who makes it how has taken who votes on let's go through maybe for example in ERC 223 and and how did it originate and and and what happens to it I'm actually not too familiar with the ERC lifecycle I tweeted a flowchart that has it on there yes so I mean like in broad strokes you're you're submitting on a github not joking an application that follows a general format that I even yelled at Vitalik because he didn't follow it initially when he made one recently but it was more fun than and then seriousness but so what happens after it's submitted on github right so once you submit it it's it's discussed and debated initially I think by whom the initial the initial AIP admin's are gonna they do consider they do consider all of them I think I think actually they would be better people to to tell you all the formal process of it because I'm not an EIP admin but I will say that an applications made discussion happens the IP means look at it it's considered and weighed by a lot of different people in the community if there is an enormous amount of sentiment around changing it and the foundation does feel the need that they need to move on that EIP then they come to a vote every now and then on new IP so they're gonna bring in and they vote on them and they they bring it into the system ok which means that they become a pull request that's merge into the EP repo as opposed to being an issue in the EBS repo yeah so you move from an issue to a pull request but it's technical and talk to the eeap's people yeah okay yeah let's move into next question hi I'd like to ask so existing net neutrality regulations are scheduled to end in early June and you Sykes yeah sorry this is better yeah okay sorry so existing net neutrality regulations are scheduled to end in her in the United States is this something that the etherium foundation is like is the etherium foundation from a governance perspective worried about the future of net neutrality and the implications of that for aetherium and public blockchain technologies not as far as I'm aware but I'm also not the guy to ask if I try to find I ask somewhere yeah I couldn't tell you the foundations like formal view on that stuff but I think like some of us are very worried about net neutrality and some of us are also very market oriented and oddly just in favor of letting things happen and so I think I think there's different views on that but it's hard to know what the Foundation's formal view on that I don't think they release anything it might have been I don't know okay well we're all out of time but thank you so much for all your questions and thanks for joining our conversation you [Music] [Music]
