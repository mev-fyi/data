[Music] hi everyone welcome to Unchained the podcast where we hear from innovators pioneers and thought leaders in the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency I'm your host Laura Shin this is a special South by Southwest episode recorded at the founders Organization unofficial South by Southwest event called the initial taco offering a full day of cryptid talks and tacos during this session I interviewed Michael Casey and Paul vignette co-authors of the recently published book the truth machine the blockchain and the future of everything Michael is a senior advisor at the MIT Media Lab and a former Wall Street Journal reporter Paul is a current Wall Street Journal reporter who covers crypto full time we have a great and wide-ranging discussion on everything from the SEC subpoena as to how crypto could be used to solve problems like climate change thank you to the founders organization for hosting the initial taco offering and thank you to everyone who came out this special South by Southwest episode of Unchained has brought to you by appreciate founded by Ted Stevens appreciate is building the most valuable relationships on Earth today preciate is recognizing a group for a big achievement in the crypto space who will be recognized today for their achievements stay tuned to find out this episode is brought to you by quant stamp quant stamp is building the first smart contract security auditing protocol designed to secure all smart contracts in a cost-effective and scalable manner being developed by a team of PhDs with over 500 Google Scholar citations they're about to finish Y Combinator's winter 18 batch to learn more or a question on it visit www.youtube.com this on yes√∂ I'm Michael Casey I am a senior advisor at the digital currency initiative which is at MIT Media Lab I was formerly a journalist at the Wall Street Journal where I worked with Paul and then just decided that I had to get out and get my teeth into this this thing so about three years ago I left the journal and and joined MIT there's a dark side yeah I mean I left you now I'm actually also an advisor to I'm the chairman of the advisory board at coin desk as well as one of my one of the hats that I wear so I've still keep my hand in journalism indirectly I can't believe it I can't believe that this microphone isn't working I can't believe that that was three years ago guys doesn't seem like that long time it was blockchain time moves usually it's like ten years yeah so you guys are out within oh sorry yeah so I am Paul vania I am still a reporter at The Wall Street Journal I've been writing about Bitcoin since 2013 since like the spring of 2013 Mike and I have written out two books together and I have stayed at the journal and I am somebody who just finds this entire sector and Industry fascinating from the perspective of somebody who's looking for stories to write from the perspective of somebody who's outside of it and trying to tell interesting stories for an audience and I just think it's absolutely amazing the the potential of the technology which i think is great the scams and and frauds which I'm sorry they're good stories so I think those are interesting I mean I just find every aspect of this really fascinating and I am NOT looking to leave the journal like Mike did because that's where I am I like telling these stories so you guys are out with this new book it's your second book you had previously written the age of cryptocurrency the new book is called the truth machine the blockchain and the future of everything the promises the title promises kind of a lot why did you choose this name for your book yeah both of them are a little provocative in fact I was I was I think I'm wearing there's a bit of a badge of honor but when I put out the announcement on Twitter that the book was out when one guy replied and said worst title ever so and I think the reason why people will think that is because that they they think they're we're making this hyperbolic you know hand wavy statement that we are what oh yes yes you can actually the blockchain will basically uncover the mysteries of the universe it is the path to absolute truth that is exactly what we're trying to say well I'll reach out we will reach to devour on the blockchain right no look I mean people are concerned that like you know that we might be misrepresenting the fact that data that is in entered into a transaction that will be reported immediately is always going to be true and that's also not always we're talking about what the title refers to is this concept of consensus truth and it's actually as important a form of truth as absolute truth because when we reach an agreement around what the numbers are I keep using this line is like who knows exactly what absolutely truthfully the u.s. GDP is right it's always an estimate it's an estimate based on a consensus of what we agree upon and the process by which we've arrived at that consensus this shared truth has traditionally been done by a centralized institutional educator now we have a machine a decentralized machine that is enabling this consensus to arrive at hopefully you know a more reliable fashion where there was a broader agreement and whereas there is also you know this this sense that it can't be tampered with afterwards so in that sense it's a truth machine but I don't know if I know where you're going with that if you're talking about GDP like there are certain authorities around that right like you wouldn't calculate that innocent a decentralized fashion would you no no I was just using GDP I was just saying that so many numbers that we use in finance so many whether it's economic data is whether whether it is in a corporate result the the process of determining what a fact is in finance when we say okay what is apples you know earnings per share right it's an estimate that was that that was gathered together by a bunch of accountants and we all kind of come to an agreement once the order to subjected out that that's what it is but it's it's a process of consensus so it's nothing to do with GDP per se it's I'm just trying to say numbers that we use for the purposes of entering into economic contracts and agreements come from this process of consensus that's what they do right and and and what we think is what we feel is the reason we call that the truth machine is because we feel that this technology will will provide people with a way to get closer to objective truth than we have had before not that you would you would necessarily get to complete objective truth but it's just it's it's a better way to get at the truth to your closer to the truth than we have had before and that's why we called it the you know in some ways this operates as a truth machine it helps you to discern the truth and the whole point about the feature of everything which is yeah that's a very broad title and it's very hyperbolic but there are very very broad potentials and there's a very broad potential you could make the argument right now that there is nothing you could absolutely cross off and say blockchain could not help this area this industry so in some ways it is the future of everything yeah the other thing I'll just say is that yeah this is dealing with record-keeping record-keeping is fundamental to human existence like in fact you know the Code of Hammurabi in the early moments of Mesopotamia in Babylon the first recorded form of writing the first first you know and that became the foundation of that civilization so record-keeping as a as a process by which we enter into exchange it's very very important for how we form money but how we form all sorts of agreements in that sense it covers everything right it's it's and that's that's kind of what we're saying I mean there it's you can't get away once you start operating with one person with another person one company with another company there has to be this process of figuring okay what do we agree on what the transactions are so yeah it covers everything and and now that we've got the title over the way can we go to the inside flap is that how we're doing this we're gonna do everything inside flap let's go to what everybody's wondering about these days which is regulation I was really kidding you broke the news on the sec subpoenas I broke one piece of news I mean I mean yeah look I think the it would have been obvious that the SCP SEC was looking at this for a long time and querying a lot of companies whether they're sending out actuals poenas or requests for information I mean look yeah we wrote the first story just saying that yes P SEC is doing this on a very wide level but I mean you know I think it's obvious they've been doing this I don't you know yeah it's we broke it but you know and what do you think is the significance of this of the subpoenas I think well no okay so now we're talking bout the ICO market and I I think you have a market where this is a really fascinating new thing this idea of it and you guys all heard Rob I don't have you all heard Rob talking in the last session about this but the idea of this ICO or token offering or whatever you want to call it I think it's fascinating the idea that companies can raise money they can have access to capital that they never had before that can allow them to do things that they couldn't do before I think it is also highly speculative a lot of it is doomed to failure because these are bad projects that are kind of slapdash put together and I think like anything investing is has inherent risks and the job of the SEC is to create the the most level and the most transparent investing arena that they can I think that's what they're trying to do and I think they're trying to do that with the ICO market so they're trying to figure out what is this token what is this thing is this a security is it a utility token is there can there be such a thing as a utility token so I think they are trying to just kind of wrap their arms around what looks new and try to figure out and this is where it can can become kind complicated is do the traditional laws and rules and regulations that we have do they fit this new world can we figure out what they are and if they don't are we going to come up with new rules and regulations so that we can ensure that this is a level transparent playing field and you don't have a lot of fraud because you know I think what fraud is fraud and fraud is bad and I think fraud is really bad for people who are in this field who are trying to do this honestly and trying to do this well so that's where I think the SEC is going with all this and so the way that you just described that sounds very measured and like there's no reason I'm a journalist Laura of course it was measured well so in I kind of like that amongst the everyday people there's a lot of fear uncertainty and doubt foot as they call it a lot of people who maybe 80 subpoenas and they freaked out but it seems like you're just saying they're gathering information of course they want to you know take action if if you have been subpoenaed by the SEC they are investigating you does that necessarily mean you did something wrong and they're gonna come down on you and charge you with something no of course it doesn't I think from our reporting what we're seeing is that they are sending out some subpoenas they are also sending out requests for information and again yes I'll tell you the SEC is not really commented to us directly so we don't have on the record comments from the SEC you're asking me for my opinion my opinion is that they are looking at two things broadly they are looking at frauds outright frauds and we've seen them we've seen them crack down on a number of them and I think they will continue to do that and they are trying to figure out what this new market is what it looks like and how it should be regulated so I think they're kind of moving on two tracks there so define a subpoena because I thought that was a request for information well you know it's funny because I'm not our SEC reporter I'm a Bitcoin reporter I've learned this recently too they can do this in two ways they can one send you a letter which is a request for information you can choose whether or not to reply to it if you reply to it you are still under obligation to tell the truth if you lie you can be held liable for that but you don't necessarily have to answer it if you don't answer it of course the next thing I need to do is the kind of subpoena you and then you absolutely have to answer that so it's kind of a shade of a difference but but it's it it's an important distinction I think when you're under when you're subpoenaed you are being investigated without a doubt Oh interesting because I spoke with somebody who used to work at DOJ and said at least at DOJ if you're being subpoenaed it actually means you are not the target so it sounds like for a sec it's different again I'm not the SEC reporter so I don't want to speak about it and say I'm the final okay thora t but I mean my understand is that if they subpoena you they're investigating you okay see reporter tell me so we'll put a pin in that and maybe I can come back later and find out exactly what that means but I just want to also hear generally like what's your take on how the regulators have been proceeding so far like you know judging on what they've been doing okay I'll be quick because Mike isn't getting a lot of air time here I mean I think they are approaching this as constructively as they can I think I see shaking his head already the one thing we really we really we do we really disagree on this but I think they are they are dressing they are approaching this as objectively as they can I don't think their intent is to just shut down the entire market I think they're trying to figure out how they can can best address it that that's how I think there are approaches Michael well I think it's you know this is the classic democlass Ord approach right I mean where you just have leave this sort of doubt hanging over their heads and you know by fear nobody does anything and and that's the way the SEC always works by the way I mean they've never been institution to sort of give very clear statements they like to leave this ambiguity I think the problem with that is that now that we're dealing with a brand new technology in a completely different way of conceiving of how we actually you know build systems of exchange Network effects and the like where tokens become not only you know this fundraising vehicle but this important component of a utility function then that level of uncertainty is problematic right because you can see how it might work if you all agree this is obviously security there's a whole world there very normal world of equity deals and SEC says I'm not going to be a little bit vague on this and they just keep everybody on their toes but there's already an established regulatory market there's all this sort of structure around it but doing it now as we are still trying to work out what the thing is I think it's problematic and it's problematic because the signaling has become more draconian they started out making stronger statements about here about their willingness to promote innovation that they thought this was a very interesting technology that wanted to be constructive around that they've come to a much I think harder position on it and you've got you know companies are saying I'm just not gonna do with Americans I can't I can't sell our Americans and the thing that worries me most is that they seem to be signaling that they don't believe literally that a token there's such a thing as utility they couldn't it be utility token what means do you think that the way that this after the way that they've approached the shaft concern this they shouldn't have concerns necessarily about the shaft I mean the son said this huge discussion about whether the shaft is a viable instrument but the notion that the shaft is a as a problem isn't really an SEC issue because it's being sold as a security to accredited investors it could be a really crappy idea for those those investors but that's not the concern right now right and so what they're signaling by saying we don't think this this whole framework makes any sense is that the that most is my interpretation again they don't tell us very clearly what it is so this is just interpretation that they are signaling that the whole concept of utility token that can come out of that is difficult and I've heard this from others as well and there and therefore now you've got this up against what Wyoming is doing by deliberately trying to carve out a space and say this is a utility token and this is the legislation that will back that at least if we have that right we can start to say let's recognize the reality there's a whole chapter in the book called the token economy which talks about there are the power of being able to embed into our mediums of exchange this this mechanism by which we can align incentives with the public good I think that's a really powerful idea that well we have a lot of work to do before we can make it work but I'd hate to kill the prospect of something so promising by by sending these really draconian signals in this vague way so I think we need clarity I think that you know it this might be an opportunity for the CCC to step out of their usual mo and and give some clarity of that very point itself yeah I just I I've said this before but I don't envy the regulator's I can understand why they one would want to go through this sort of like information gathering phase because as we saw with the bitlicense in New York in 2013-2014 clearly that regulation was done like well before the space was fully even developed and that's had a really bad effect and so I do understand maybe why the SEC it's taking its time I do understand on the other side why that's also kind of to the detriment of these teams that want to pursue you know these innovations and you know realize their dreams and yet at the same time it's like oh what if we do that and end up in jail so I totally get all that I just feel like what they're trying to do is just walk this tightrope that it just feels like almost impossible so I can see it on either side but my personal take and this is actually something that happened at at a conference I did with some members of the SEC which was very fascinating this was right after that the Chairman first said something like oh every token I've seen as a security and it was such a contrast in tone from the DAO report which I felt was very measured and kind of like seemed to delineate Oh like these are virtual virtual currencies as they call them air quotes by the way for podcast listeners and then and then what they were saying were securities like they'd out token and so I said something about it to one of the SEC people and she was like oh but the way he phrased it was every token I've seen and then she goes to how many has he seen maybe one maybe two maybe three and so she kind of seemed to be sort of like walking back what he had said and I was like oh that's kind of interesting maybe like you know they felt like he had spoken out of line but then you know later at the hearing we heard him say that again and so then I was kind of like okay like maybe he's signaling that he wants to take a more draconian approach but perhaps within the agency there's agreement I'm sure there is you know just even as there was amongst us but yeah so I think that's like the biggest question that remains is like I mean to me personally and maybe you guys disagree but what do you think are the biggest regulatory questions that need to be resolved oh that one I mean well yeah that one's a pretty big one a utility token and Kennedy exists I'm really surprised that they had come down against the south because the staff could be a way for them to think about resolving this problem are you certain about that because it's it look I don't know you did the reporting on it there is some concern about the staff that's in that in that in that story I've yes certainly heard that that's that's that's being questioned and so you know if that's the case and it's legitimate question well a little bit question from a perspective of whether or not the the token at the end of it is gonna be delivered I I think a big part of the problem in this is that last year and has continued this year this has become a out-of-control speculative investing mania and if you had a situation where you know you had companies raising reasonable amounts of money and you didn't have this kind of mania to create these projects overnight that you know it's basically just a plagiarized white paper and two dudes putting up a website and raising thirty million dollars if you had a situation where this was all moving at a much slower pace maybe you would have a situation where regulators were looking at it differently but when you have a situation where companies that didn't exist a year ago six months ago two months ago are raising tens of millions of dollars for products that don't exist that stinks of speculative investing mania and the SEC is going to look at that very hard and they have to so I think part of it is if this had developed differently you might have a more measured response from regulators what I think actually is the most interesting thing and given the way our Congress works these days is not going to happen but I would love to see the federal law makers US Congress address this entire industry on a federal level what kind of like what you had in Japan I mean just Japan addressed this on a federal level and put in rules around the entire industry and I think it's absolutely fascinating I think the way this develops in Japan is gonna be really important I wish we had lawmakers here who were interested in doing that I know we have a couple lawmakers in Congress who have a blockchain caucus but I mean you know I don't see US Congress acting on this anytime soon which puts the regulator's at the various agencies kind of in a bind they have to address it from their person they have to you know that whatever their remit is their little part of the world they have to address it so you have different regulators looking at this from different angles and calling it different things and I think it's kind of a mess I would totally agree with one issue the rest of the book is very harmonious every once in a while Mike and I have one in order to get a good panel is one way this am you know fractions friction so it's rare that the co-authors are the source of that but okay yeah that's absolutely right I mean we'd love to have that addressed at that level yeah but the other thing to say about this though of course is you know it doesn't happen in a vacuum no there is Japan there is what they're us with Swiss solutions there is Swiss Singapore right and this is a very mobile technology we all know how many people are in zhuge for this reason right so does the u.s. care maybe they don't remember that's just a tiny industry why why do I care about being part of this sort of new innovative movement what we obviously think that they shouldn't care about it because this is you know a big part of what the future is gonna look like and the US doesn't want to be a part bebe apart from that and so you know and I think that there will come moments when fairly big developments that have an impact on the u.s. are gonna happen I think when China has a digital fiat currency which it will have at some point suddenly there's gonna have to be this scramble around what the US is doing within this technology and it might not be so happy to have seen all these developers disappear to xub oh interesting but I mean I don't see fiat currencies as being on the unblocking I don't see them as being a big threat to decentralized no but I'm not talking I'm just talking about like so you can't make a decision around anything distributed Ledger's you know crypto currencies like Bitcoin in isolation from anything right one of the reasons why Venezuela is don't spell these things B are manifestations of Bitcoin in some form they're completely centralized they're by no means in any way like Bitcoin but they are if they're a product of all of the global competitive pressures that have been emerging around this thing the most important thing become has done in that sense is but sort of raised the idea to central banks about how things might be different every Central Bank around the world is exploring digital fiat currency now precisely because of Bitcoin and they are also talking about distributed ledger functions behind this a lot of them are trying to build some of the modeling obviously permissioned around that the bigger issue though is that you know that that digital fiat currency will have smart props my contract properties within it to to effectively bypass the dollar and that's going to be a major threat to the US you and I talked about this once right right that's interesting yeah you wrote an essay about this - I did yes yeah about China about how you think that this will be a play to kind of not the US dollar up yeah I think it's absolutely feasible and it's certainly something that China would want to do China talks all the time about you know wanting to internationalize the remember and you know remove the dollar from what was once called this sort of exorbitant privilege as people called it and the way that I think they would do it is that there would be a digital remember there would also be a digital ruble and through an atomic swap and a smart contract you would lock in the right through through the currencies themselves and effectively therefore avoid the exchange rate risk that is carried over time when you were to ante in an importer and exporter entry into an invoice so now you've got the importer an expert on either side able to just like forget about having to invoice in dollars and hold dollars as a intermediary function the hole corresponding banking system is no longer needing to be there and then arguably central banks themselves don't need a whole dollars as reserves because the only reason they hold them is as a protection against their own exchange rates so you know exchange rate solutions through smart contracts and digital fiat currencies is a is something very real and feasible and we do know the PBOC is working on a digital fiat currency so when this idea comes forward I would be I'd be very surprised to think that the u.s. is not going to want to scramble to do something to address it atomic swap is the name of my next album by the Oh awesome malwan name now a word from one of our sponsors appreciate founded by ed Stevens ppreciate is building the most valuable relationships on Earth today appreciate is recognizing a whole state legislature for a big achievement in the crypto space the Wyoming legislature passed House bill seventy which exempts various types of crypto assets from securities laws kudos to the corporate law trendsetters of Wyoming for working to clarify regulations for crypto listeners if you know someone in crypto who should be recognized take action and go to ppreciate org slash recognize that's appreciate org slash recognize founded in the aftermath of the dow hack quant stamp is building the first smart contract security auditing protocol designed to secure all smart contracts in a cost-effective and scalable manner relying on humans to audit smart contracts is expensive and error-prone and with the exploding growth of smart contracts that solution just won't scale the team at quan stamp is developing a solution to audit smart contracts on the etherium network in an automated and decentralized way that can scale with the growing demand being built by a team of PhDs who collectively have over 500 Google Scholar citations quant stamp is paving the way for safer and more reliable smart contracts that will power the decentralized world to learn more or request an audit visit w-w-w out after countries but I wanted to address something earlier when you were talking about the bubble I just wanted to get your thoughts on the telegram ICO what do you make of that eight hundred fifty million dollars for a white paper from a gbc's like not even from the crowd I mean look telegram is an obviously viable product is it something you're gonna make money off of I don't know because they're not charging any money for it right now but it is obviously a viable product is 850 million dollars an outrageous amount of money for them to raise I don't know they raised it they've got it I mean they've got a couple hundred million people using the product so I think it is an awful lot of money I think it is an eye-opening amount of money does that on its own make it a terrible thing not necessarily but what is interesting is you have a situation right now where this company really doesn't have to worry about making money now they've got 850 million dollars that they can do whatever they want it's and no strings attached basically you know again this is this is one of the interesting sort of wrinkles of these token offerings are they investments are they donations only what are they did he just get eight hundred and fifty million dollars you know no strings attached to do with whatever he wants it kind of looks like that and if that's the case then he can keep that thing running for a very long time just you know it all goes into operating capital so and they're gonna raise more but they're planning to raise more look it's an astounding amount of money on its face is it necessarily wrong I don't know but what is it is it a donation is it investment if it's an investment I gotta tell you it's a terrible investment because they have no revenue generating business so they're you know you're gonna lose your money on that investment unless you trade the tokens and you know and again that's a speculative investment I don't know it's a lot of money and so I mean I like to just it is we all think about the money it's always about the money how much money is being raised right the bigger question and it's not one that I necessarily feel like like telegram or answering very well is what actually is going to be the utility the token how is it going to function for the purposes of it of is this this platform and it could be really interesting right it could be a means by which they build on top of of telegram this sort of app development system right it might be that that's where it is the question then is how are they going to seed those tokens amongst the right community to make it work and if it's just being sold to these big fat cat investors then how an NN we've got concerns about how you are whether you are Ricky and other regulatory structures allowed to actually you know move to then a public sale so that you didn't spread the the network effects that you want how do we actually get to that platform right how do we get to the point where this interesting functionality becomes something that's very important I want to have the cover social focus on that right for every every single I know that we can't avoid the massive amounts of money it's it's inherently gonna get all the headlines but we don't spend enough time talking about okay what is the actual solution in this token what exactly right it's a great question and I don't quite know what missing should try are gonna do with it that's the thing I also worry about it being seen as a centralized token I don't know it's not any RC 20 token so is that they building their own decentralized blockchain or is it gonna run over their own internal platform which is a really interesting no you're gonna give them all this money that they then have complete control over what the actual token that you own does yeah oh interesting I wasn't wearing that I don't know I don't know there's been resolved what the actual I have not read the white paper so my sense of it is not that it's necessarily going to be a permissionless blockchain right I think it's like I could be wrong but I think it wasn't my look if anyone of the room knows you guys feel free to join in lucky did anyone buy into any fat cats in here bought the telegram I see oh they must be in the other room so the other question about this I find what are we gonna do about the terms of these pre-sales I mean they are unbelievably generous to these first well I think the rule well my personal opinion is no pre-sales should be like no discounts it should be you know this if these are truly decentralized networks as truly public infrastructure is truly a utility then it should be for the people it shouldn't be like oh insiders get a sweeter deal I mean it looks like they've tried to say oh this is the way that the VCS work right and and therefore it's just modeling the old venture capital model but but it's not because you know the minute these things are on an exchange you can admit you can get out right so there's also merchants that should we have vesting rules and and all sorts of other things that you could work into this I think that there's an enormous amount of work that needs to go into structuring these deals and ways that are not so harmful to you know to the majority holders so does the SEC right yes I'm sure they do actually talking again about the SEC well I wanted to ask about the exchanges issue which they sent this letter I think two changes and we're probably gonna see a lot of tokens you listen it just got me thinking about decentralized exchanges like is that where all of these tokens that might be deemed securities up with is that where they're all gonna go and are they just gonna be like freely traded or you know will the real Ayres need to become registered exchange I'd like how do you think that won't work it could end up going that way I think it kind of shows you know how different this entire sector is from what we've had before and it also raises a lot of risks I mean you know you're gonna put your money on a decentralized exchange the ones that are centralized now if they get screwed you're you're out of money like I think you could see I think you look I think you will see people attempt that I think you'll see people try to do that and that seems like a natural outgrowth of where this is all going I don't know if that will end up kind of achieving any large-scale I just don't know but I mean someone's gonna try it and if they can make money off it then somebody else will try it and I think you will have I think you will have that at least be an attempt I think this advise exchange this is a wonderful idea I mean it will be just really cool if we get to the point where there are no more mount gox's and you know that that risk is removed and you gain the atomic swap but when use that word again I think the this dysfunctional you have me twelve yeah I'm looking forward to it where you're gonna was your first gig know the that that this model but there's still a lot that has to be proven out to make them work right so I'm not sure that we're ready to to do it I do hope that we get there just just simply for the ending of the centralized third party problem but it will be very interesting from the point of the question you just raised as to what the regulator's do about that right I mean you know and that may be where this whole thing goes I mean we're in a kind of a bit of a cat-and-mouse game really between regulators in this sort of constantly evolving technology so yeah they create decentralized models that somehow no one can shut down then all of a sudden these these tokens are just moving in amongst you know dark pools and we don't know who owns them and and that may be the way we actually you know end up seeding utility because that's how you get it out in the public gets or not maybe it becomes these big whales of deep dark secret guys we never get to talk to I don't know but it is it isn't interesting but I mean yeah it's like think about the Dow right the doubt was decentralized autonomous organization they they wrote the software they thought others a great idea let's launch it and they launched it and they raised 150 million dollars and everyone's all interested great and immediately somebody finds a hole in the code and takes a third of it yeah like a decentralized exchanges a lot of the ones we have now are are risky places to put your money a decentralized exchanging you don't know who built it who wrote it that's how security safe it is but these are a lot of questions ransom hold at versus I agree with you in the sense that we are nowhere near ready and the Dow was a very strong indicator of the risk that we have but I don't think we can say it's it's it inherently is riskier I mean the whole point about that the risk in Mount is because there is a party there that's in charge of those funds right you don't you're not there's risk either way right there may be risk but it's not risk about the founder or the holder with the money you've got you you do retain control of your funds in a decentralized exchange so the risks are different that's absolutely true but I don't know that we could sort of suggest that somehow it's it's it's gonna be worse than what we've already got I I think that we have to think about it as a natural evolution about where things are gonna go I think that's it's ingrained within the way this sector wants to go to decentralized solutions that is absolutely it so but we've got to get it right obviously so I actually want to move on to nation-states that are before us yes we'll do that at the very end so we were talking a little bit before about things like the petrol and obviously we've seen that you know North Korea has been trying to mines and Bitcoin there's been talk of like Turkey and Iran issuing their own cryptocurrencies your book and actually I think both the yearbooks have been largely about watching for social good but here we see that these bad actors are trying to get in on it too like do you think that this could be a way for bad regimes to consolidate power is that something you guys ever worry about or have it's reading but investigate I mean I think that along the lines what I said before to the extent to which some elements of the technology can be expropriated by them and used then yes I mean that's what we're saying with Venezuela Venezuela is just trying to you know avoid all of its obligations which which of course in its failure to to meet has led to the after impoverishment and destruction of its country and but they're not they're not building a cryptocurrency you know decentralized sense right they've taken elements of it to build a centralized solution so but but yes in that sense there is there are all sorts of pieces of this technology that can be taken and used in you know interesting ways and certainly you know privacy solutions will be exploited by by bad actors without a doubt I mean that's that kind of goes without saying is that does that warrant therefore sort of draconian responses from regulators or from anybody toward that technology you know I think this is the nature of all technology right there's always good and bad uses for it and I and I and I definitely we need to recognize that it is a moral it really doesn't have values in itself it's just a tool and that tool can be used by good guys and bad guys what is the net effect of it what is you know how what will what does it drive us entirely as a society it does push toward the disintegration of Barratt of borders right at some point not saying tomorrow about any stretch but but ultimately these ideas this concept of decentralized trust and decentralized open-source transactions does break down the power there's there's nice and say so the might get to a point where really doesn't matter where the North Korea is you know working on this because North Korea itself will have a have had its power diminished by the effective you know how how fluid this this economy has become but by the way how great is it going to be the day the sec bus to Venezuela for running a scam me I see oh yeah that would be great waiting to write that headline let's actually move to a new topic let's have a governance um this has been a big issue in Bitcoin it's now becoming a big issue in aetherium here we've got like a hundred million dollars of etherium that have been frozen accidentally by somebody who like randomly hit a key somewhere favorite screw-ups yeah so so there's a big debate in the community now like should we you know freeze the mind should we keep it frozen should we unfreeze it but also like how should we decide what to do what do you guys think about governance issues like do you think there's a lot of promise and some of the unchain on chain governance solutions that are being proposed or do you think it should continue to be sort of more in this typical like off off chain world where people can discuss things in forums and then there are certain leaders who decide like what do you think sitting down with Kathleen Brotman from tayzaw so we'll have some some strong opinions what do you think I think some of the are the the early travails in Bitcoin or not even early but you know I mean things that have happened in Bitcoin things have happened in aetherium I think at the very least they kind of show that there's an almost naive belief that you can just kind of write some code that is going to take care of everything and I don't think that's true I don't think the idea that you can kind of just write code and then get humans out of the way in in terms of governance or every issue that's not going to work that's never going to work I think you can certainly you can write code and come up with programs and platforms and systems that are clear but I think you will continue to see this evolve and I think you will continue to see that there is going to be a need for some human conscious oversight of any system any group community of people ultimately you're going to still have to have humans people making conscious decisions how they come together to do that it is up in the air but I just I don't think you can you can completely get rid of people from any platform that is going to bring together a group of people I don't know I mean it's actually a theme in the book quite quite a bit actually this sort of this fact that we can't get away from the need to trust somebody or something so so in some respects that's an extension of that and I think it's in I think you know as Paul said there's always that human layer you know and I think it's also other reasons why we need federal getting back to the same topic all the time a federal regulation because then there is a sort of a legal framework that I think you know is is useful precisely for this this issue about okay when things go wrong how does it get resolved it's interesting because it is the human layer that has led to both the intransigence within on the Bitcoin side and the failure to you know get get governance which some people see and we cite in the book I think it's a reasonable argument as a feature not a bug right that the sort of the acrimony is just a manifestation of the the inability to reach agreement which then keeps true a sort of a robust immutable system and aetherium which was also you know resolving these challenges through the human level but had the the more you know founder led solution that that sort of then became very contentious for the sake of whether or not they were in breach of of the immutability you know consistency and it's interesting because bitcoins Genesis was such that there was no you know Godhead other than Satoshi who we didn't know who he was whereas we don't have these identifiable figures who have a significant influence in aetherium and it's that issue as much of anything else that has led to the different governance solutions in those two places because it's quite reason if you could just equally imagine that Bitcoin simply if there were five or six guys that we knew were the founders of Bitcoin would have potentially done exactly the same things and some of these is as has been done with some you know they could have rolled back the mount GOx coins or something like that who knows right it could have been similar to what would happen with the etherium so there's interesting questions about what that what that means I in terms of the unchain solutions whether they're talking about delegated proof mistake or you know the the the the various voting mechanisms and the other forms of governor's that tells us have I think it's early days you know what it is an attempt to bring into the blockchain what we might call a Constitution right or a form of democracy and you know can they be gamed I think this concerns certainly about the the - super nodes and these things being you know is that there's a sort of a black market in them and things like that so you know I don't know it's it's it it's early days I would like to think that some of these solutions could one day be pretty pretty valuable yeah look and I think that the goal is always to create a more perfect union not a perfect union I think we have to understand that we are probably never going to create a perfect union we are just trying to do something that is better I think this technology has the potential to allow us to do a lot of things that are better but can they be perfect no which is why you are always going to have to have people involved in them trying to help them become better all right so we're gonna we have very little time a night so many other interesting topics to discuss but why don't we do like panelist choice between climate change using tokens it's all climate change and ubi universal basic income which would you rather talk about I would go for climate change okay let's talk about that how do you guys think we can use tokens to solve climate change there was a section in your book so this is something that sort of emerged out of conversations that I've had with people and you've been present at them I think on a certain Island I I think that it's not easy but I do think that there's this idea of natural capital and natural currency whereby once we've created the concept of a digital asset we've now got a digital representation to which we can assign value so right now you know people are talking about tokenizing real estate for example right so we've now got a claim on a piece of property this is an external thing of value what we're talking about then is saying how do you actually assign value to something that doesn't trade in the free market as it is now in any case like water resources or the quality of our air and I think the interplay between verifiable data because there's a lot of work being done on sort of reliable IOT and sort of a decentralized structure to that so that China can't manipulate the data the data becomes so ubiquitously collected through little tiny sensors everywhere and we have a you know a decentralized blockchain managed model for it when we know that data we can start to do very interesting things with tokens that participants in in economies that are related to the particular environmental concern that you have will will then trade and own and use right so if we can build an economy around a token let's say it's a coral reef and you've got the fisherman and you've got you know an NGO and you have you know various other you know many different stakeholders who have a real interest in this and if the data is proven to improve around that reef through this reliable you know data source there's things that can be done to improve the value of the token so you can burn tokens that are held in reserve reducing the supply having this impact therefore on the pond that on the value and therefore align the incentives with all these players to that to that process there is why I get excited about is because I think that there's this tragedy of the Commons concept that I think is is it actually an integral part of how block drains work the the the core idea is that through this mechanism entities who don't necessarily trust each other can be incentivized to act in the common good even though they're acting in their self-interest which is the interesting thing about Bitcoin right because miners mining for Bitcoin but they're building a public ledger which is which is a common good transferring that idea to this obviously more elaborate structure around common resources and environmental issues is is an exciting concept it's obviously needs some hike or develop another aspect of it is is just the whole idea of the energy industry itself and what I think is really interesting is this is where you can start to see where blockchain technology can be combined with other technologies and you can create something that is very interesting and so look for basically what the entire Industrial Revolution we have generated the energy by burning oil burning fuel or you have centralized utilities creating it you now have a situation I know we're running out of time so I won't go too long but I mean you can you can see a situation where you can have renewable energies you have renewable sources of energy you can have which are can be broken up into these micro grids these small solar arrays right like you have solar panels on your house you can have those connected you can have micro grids an Internet of Things layer to it where your house is you know you've got your little nest things for all your energy and then you have a blockchain layer where people will be able to exchange energy back and forth trade energy back and forth you have the trust layer so that you don't necessarily have to have everything held by the utility age and you know the central PS E&G or whatever it is wherever you guys live you can it did not connect all my power for a week you know human right experience I think that's kind of an interesting way when you start to talk about how renewables could be connected via say a blockchain based network and and the entire energy infrastructure decentralized I I really think that is gonna be part of our future and I think that is going to have a massive effect on certainly climate change but also just you know how we supply our daily lives you know I guess my energy I agree I want to end on just one last thing which is I want to get your opinions on how the media has been covering crypto and try to make us this thing to be literally have like two minutes great I think they're all doing a fantastic I think to be honest you still see some outlets that have reporters who have been doing this for a while now and kind of understand it and some outlets that have reporters that haven't been doing this and they're still trying to get up to speed on it you have some that see it for the potential that it really does represent and are trying to get at that and you have others that see this as a sensationalist thing and a way to generate traffic for their websites in there you know and they're doing that which is to say that some media outlets are good and some are bad and it's always kind of been that way I think from my personal perspective at the Wall Street Journal we are it's really interesting we're now at the point where I used to do this as a side gig to my regular job which was markets and because I was interested in this they'd let me write about it and Mike when he was there too now this is my beat I am the Bitcoin reporter at The Wall Street Journal but not only that reporters on basically every other beat are starting to become not only interested in this but they have to report on it because the companies that they deal with are looking at it so some of them are really interested in this and they're learning about it on their own some of them come to me and ask questions it is become something that we are addressing basically on an institutional level I mean the Wall Street Journal covers this now so I don't we have time to be to weigh in because I just think that of course when the narrative is still too focused on the wrong things you know it's all about the price it's all about how quickly rich everybody's getting and how many Lambos there are out there and that's obviously a story and it's obviously something but we're creating this impression and and you know it it is certain to get people in the space as well who think that's what it's all about the most exciting thing of all is how quickly their token you know went from 10 to 100 and and that seems to be unfortunately still the dominant narrative and mainstream press so getting underneath that which is what we've been doing over and over again you know has been trying has been a trying and difficult process I think polls right yeah sophisticated publications and now starting to write some pretty deep dive II type reports and getting it but you know they and the broader Pinar P of all these other ones as well still still very much focused on stuff that is only instead of one little element of what this is all about yeah and I would say sometimes when I see those articles I think to myself is this outlet single-handedly trying to create the crypto bubble and it's very frustrating you see the tenant country I did I did billionaire I just wanted to say for the record is that I was the first mainstream reporter it's a cover crypto full time and you are the second policy should do a little high-five across the table okay alright thank you guys so much this was such a big conversation no thanks for having us yeah I just want to say very very self-interested Lee will be doing a book signing tomorrow room ten C at the Convention Center at one o'clock one to 1:30 so if you're interested in come on put your name on it do whatever else draw a little picture if you want it yes call the truth machine very good yeah all right see you guys thank you thanks so much for joining us for this special South by Southwest episode of
