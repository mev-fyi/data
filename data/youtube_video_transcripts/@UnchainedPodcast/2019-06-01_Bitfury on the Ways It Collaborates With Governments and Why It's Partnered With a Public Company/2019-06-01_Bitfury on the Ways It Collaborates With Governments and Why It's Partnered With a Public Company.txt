your secure Hardware wallet today today's guests are Valeri bevy love the co-founder and CEO of bitfury and George kik vod's a vice chairman of the board welcome Val and George hey Laura hey Laura let's start with Val how did you get into Bitcoin in what were you doing before oh it was in 2010 when I was introduced to the Bitcoin first time and I learned the technology and understood this is not just another cryptocurrency but this technology can really change this world and really digitize everything what is not digitized yet because if you look at this world right now we live in a digital world but and we can send in for all across the world and from one hand everything is digitized but from another hand anything of value and all our assets are still on paper your house is the paper your car is a paper your company shares is a piece of paper even all of us it's a piece of paper of piece of plastic it's your identity card or your passport so why it's happened because internet was not designed for secure transactions and blockchain and the cryptocurrency and all this technology is by default designed for secure transactions so that's why this technology will be able to digitize the most important part the assets and anything of value once understood it I put a site on my project and went in only only to do this thing and so 2010 is super super early obviously the coin the software only started running in 2009 how did you get introduced to it so early and what had you been doing before so before I spent many years to create different kind of registry systems for lottery and municipalities and did some consulting can startups okay and George what about you how did you discover Bitcoin and what had you been doing before well well and I have a common friend who now runs bit here capital Murata Chico and Murat kept telling me and bugging me about Bitcoin as early as when price was 1020 dollars and you know obviously it was early 2012-2013 that time period and he kept coming back and coming back is that you know that there is this Latvia entrepreneur I'd like you to meet to discuss this cryptocurrency and we finally met and you know I really liked the idea and the concept and I did spend a little bit of time diving into it and called couple of my friends that were in Silicon Valley and actually the first person that I got connected was Wednesday's of Zappa and after a brief conversation yeah exactly and after talking to winces you know I realized we had very similar backgrounds and experiences and you know got a lot of comfort and obviously then there was a lot of deep diving into you know online resources and I realized that this could be something really huge and decided to join up well in his journey to to embark on on this project so I have a somewhat burning question for you guys and it's surprising to me that I've never asked you before because I know you both you know pretty well and also because people may remember listeners may remember that one of my first podcast guests was built I and near the beginning of his career he was a chip designer and during that episode he told me that the way he came to invest in bitfury was that he saw Val and I guess the other bitfury co-founders on this message board and he noticed that they none of them had a background in chip design but they wanted to design an ASIC which is a chip built for a special purpose and they wanted to build one for Bitcoin mining and he saw that what you guys built was something truly unique and novel and that you were able to do that because you didn't have this sort of background in conventional chip design that someone like him would have had and I just I never found out later whether or not that story is true or whether he had you know because obviously he wasn't like in the middle of it and so I just always wanted to find out from you guys how bitfury got founded yeah you know and this this story about chip design is really interesting because it was our first cheap and we went all in to create this full custom cheap and full custom chip it's very hard to do because you literally need to create your own transistors and because we didn't have we didn't have experience before we just didn't know what it's impossible and you know when you don't know it it's impossible you think it's possible and you just do it and we did it and it worked and yeah but it was very interesting journey and now now we create a tell rating I think a sixth generation of chips but this voice chip was EF was very interesting story and we collected money from friends and family so the first investment was very hard to get because I reached to some of the investors created the business plan thought told about Bitcoin and about cryptocurrency about blockchain but nobody believed nobody believed in back in 2012 2011 so we just collected money from friends and families who believed in our story and yeah went all in and here we are now we're company global company with the people from 16 countries and more than 500 people oh wow yeah that was actually gonna be my next question how many employees you have and so you have more than 500 and how many and you have 16 offices or not really 16 offices but people from 16 countries offices in Amsterdam san francisc DC London Tokyo Billy C Canada Norway and so on yeah and also where are your mining operations so our main mining operations are in Republic of Georgia in Iceland in Canada and in Norway and how do you choose where to locate a mining Center so first of all is energy price business climate cold weather but the most important parameter is the energy price and green energy because we as a company are committed to lower the carbon footprint that's why we're choosing locations was the cheap energy but green energy and how do you define green energy green energies during renewable energy for example hydro thermal and everything renewable okay well yeah I was gonna ask you about that so I noticed that you have these new mining centers that you're opening in Canada and by the way they're in what I think are some of the most interestingly named towns I've ever seen like the city of Medicine Hat and the other one that caught my eye is Drumheller which is actually nicknamed the dinosaur capital of the world and I was so excited by this and I wanted to publicly ask you guys to to invite me to do some sort of story that involves me going to the dinosaur capital of the world that would be amazing but I I actually was curious about that because I think in that area what what kind of energy is it I looked it up and it looked like in those areas they use a lot of natural gas and I wondered how green that was in Canada they're using a lot of natural gas yes so I don't know the carbon footprint of natural gas but I presume it's not zero carbon footprint for Britain natural gas I think is not zero but it's less - okay and it's much better than the dirty coal that is being burnt in you know in many locations around the world unfortunately right like China which is I think so I've not looked into this but obviously one of your biggest competitors is bit Maine and they have a lot of operations in China I actually so I don't want to make any claims as to what types of energy they're using but let's just talk about kind of the moves that you are making in general in the wider context of what's going on in the mining world you now have a 49% stake in hut 8 which is a Canadian that now controls or will eventually control 35 Bitcoin mining centers in North America and it's also now publicly traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange why did you decide to partner with Hut 8 and how does this move fit into your overall strategy that's a very good question so you know I think you know if you go back four or five years ago when there were a lot of chip companies key to success where two factors Laura it was execution on the chip and keeping the promise it was very important but also nor less important was the access to capital and I think it was very tough for us to go and convince investors in Silicon Valley and you know other institutional investors to invest because they would see other companies coming in claiming they had better technology we now know that you know all of these companies are extinct or have pivoted away but they have costed us a lot of traction and that costed us a lot of resources in order to accelerate the deployment and you know global expansion as a result of that if you look back for the last four years we have really funded ourselves through angel investors such as Bill Thai and in France as well as bootstrapping in other words taking the bitcoins that we've mined selling them on exchanges and then reinvesting in a business we calculated actually that had we found someone with deep pockets that believed in our story and bet on our technology in the same way that bill Thai has has done so but with large stash of capital you know we would have spend roughly 350 million US dollars on chip designs on wafers on electricity cost on the capex of rolling out but we would be sitting right now on eight hundred and sixty thousand bitcoins Wow so that is that is the equation and you know to all the VCS that didn't believe or didn't take that bet you know understand was early in the game but at the end of a day you know that is an outcome so in this case where you keep executing but you don't have an access to capital it's as good as you know moving down the highway at at 2030 miles per hour so I think one of the success stories of our Chinese competitors has been not only you know executing but also ability to access the capital from local much more risk tolerant sources whether it's government non-government it's a different story but you know at the end of the day they've been able to do that and that's the difference between ordering 10,000 wafers or 50,000 wafers so what had a does for us is for the first time allows us to partner up with credible institutions and in this round we had some 57 you know large institutions including you know some extremely well known and regarded international players it allows us to go and raise capital from institutions and for us then to take that capital and to deploy that to build out the world's largest crypto mining facilities in Bitcoin and in theory I mean you know z-cars more narrow and other sort of major protocols that we believe will you know will be of interest to institutions so hot eight is in essence is creating an institutional structure whereas you know long-term capital can come in and fund the acceleration and development of bitfury in locating the crypto mining in places where there is rule of law in places where your assets will not be nationalized in places where your assets will not be brought down some corrupt bureaucrats and in places where you will be able to build around their know-how centers the excellent centers and develop really long-term relationships with local academia and and god to embark on this amazing story of blockchain it's interesting so everything that you said makes sense to me and and sounds smart in terms of strategy against your competitors but one thing that caught my attention was you said you want to build the the largest mining operation so how do you do that at the same time that you don't add to the centralization of these cryptocurrencies because one thing that's a little bit different from you guys as a mining operation compared to your competitors is that you don't operate what's known as a mining pool in the sense that you don't have individual investors or other institutions that rent or I don't know for enters the word but you know kind of own a slice of of what you're mining and then get a payout from that everything as far as I understand all the block rewards that you mine go to you so that is even more centralized than one of these pool operators were the the components of their pool are individuals who can easily move to another pool if they feel like it and therefore reduce the power of that mining operation that's a very good question so from from the standpoint of centralization obviously we are super cautious about this you know we learned through our mistakes if you remember four years ago there was a debacle with G hash i/o and you know that that was a learning experience and you're absolutely right these the the philosophy of you know the Bitcoin protocol is decentralization so obviously we're not talking about developing through hot 8 a you know a super dominant you know crypto mining facility that will commence some 40 30 or even 20% you know I think the target would be to shoot for something at 10 15 percent and in regards to the pools we will be announcing our you know public pools and actually if you look at the hash rate that's attributable to bitfury it's actually it's a magnitude less than all the equipment that has been sold to the third parties primarily to the you know family offices and you know more of the institutions and those that have been allocated to throughout the network via other pools so we actually are super conscious of the decentralization and we're super conscious of spreading around the mining capacity you know across the across the border tell me more about that about I guess institutions that are buying are you talking about your block box is that what they're buying if so explain what that is because I don't know if I fully understand it I believe individuals cannot buy mining equipment from you but at the same time I believe you do sell these block boxes but I'm not sure what the situation is so we are focusing mostly on a b2b business and you know the minimum entry point is a million million plus so from that angle we have several wealthy individuals that have bought and located this block boxes around the globe as well as we have you know teamed up with some corporate players you know that have bought five ten twenty forty in some cases we've built you know large data centers for sort of a corporate players so we are not selling you know our equipment to you know mom and pop so to speak we're now we're not on a b2c side I think there are you know they're players that are addressing that market but we are building the capacity and expanding on capacity working on it on a b2b and you know addressing a corporate and increasingly looking to address the government sector given our reputation corporate governance and the relationships that we have I think there's a place for everybody we're gonna discuss your summits on Necker Island in your new

research visit WWE as investments calm / unchained I'm speaking with Valeri Vavilov and George kick vazhi of bitfury so let's talk about your expansion to other cryptocurrencies as you mentioned before you will be mining other crypto assets from dick although I do believe at least up until now it's it's been mostly Bitcoin or maybe even only Bitcoin that you've mined how will you decide which other cryptocurrencies to mine and have you decided which other ones to mine yet yeah we're working on solutions for other cryptocurrencies so we can we will update on this once it's ready but we are thinking about this and we're working to deploy these solutions for other cryptocurrencies and why have you decided to expand now I mean you were very much focused as a company on Bitcoin for quite a long time because because we see there is a need for equipment for other cryptocurrencies and we see what in the space of public blockchains there will be no not only one public blockchain there will be several public blog chains so that's why we decided to move to this direction as well and did you are you going to do the same as you did with the coin where you develop specialized chips for each block chain either specialized chips or specialized custom equipment that efficiently mine and process transactions of different health coins here and you plan to do the same where you open your own data centers and maybe you tap the B&B b2b market a little bit or the business model will be the same as as now we will sell to high net worth individuals to institutions and and the most likely we will mind some small part to ourselves as well the price of Bitcoin at least right now is of at least at the time of this recording has fallen from the highs it saw in late 2017 of nearly $20,000 to around 8,000 and as we know from like the 2014 and 2015 years there have been periods where Bitcoin has sort of dwindles down after a big run-up what's the lowest price you can mine and still be profitable so it depends of course the location because the price is dependent on energy price but just preliminary calculations shows but it's something like 2500 mid $2,500 per bitcoins 2500 maybe $3,000 per Bitcoin it depends on the location oh well okay so it looks like you guys still have quite a bit of runway well I was curious do you normally sell your bitcoins immediately after the 100 blocks okay I know I guess a few mine then you can't sell the the block reward the bitcoins that you win from mining a block you can't sell them for at least a hundred blocks so do you normally sell them immediately or do you keep them as long as you can or what's the strategy there no I don't have particular however let's say strategy we're not we're definitely not not selling immediately but we are selling from time to time to keep the cash balance as far as I understand after starting and hardware you expanded your services to software services and I believe you were selling them mostly to governments for instance you have been working with the government in Georgia to put the land titling system there on the Bitcoin blockchain or to develop a system that you know can at least put a hash of the records on the Bitcoin watching why did you decide to go in that direction of offering blockchain services for governments you know because when we started to talk to regulators and decision makers we understood what they will be there will be no fast move of institutions and governments to public blockchain just like the same happened 20 years ago when internet was created the institutions and governments didn't switch to internet immediately yeah yes then they told the technology is okay the technology is perfect but we don't know who is using this technology we don't know who owned this technology we will use this technology and will our own intranets yeah and after a lot of internet was created they interconnected it using Internet when they become more comfortable with the technology the same is happening in the blockchain space there is a public block chains but to move the public blockchain institution need to be to become more comfortable and to become more comfortable they need intermediary step an intermediary step is the private blockchain so that's why in 2015 we decided ok there is a need for such a solution and this solution also will help to to expand the awareness of public blockchain we decided to put some money and create the framework for private blockchain and that's how we created the platform called exonym and now using external platform you can use it to block Chennai's any government services institutions and user and different kind of organisations can use it it's some kind of operation operating systems that you can use to easily deploy blockchain private box and solutions to your organization but still you know every private blockchain is just a software that's why we're using Bitcoin blockchain as a security layer to secure the private blockchain with so-called enkaran earlier you were talking about how for your mining business you've decided to focus on the b2b business and you could have done the same here and it sounds like exonym you know was a step in that direction but I know exonym was announced I believe last year and your work with governments started quite a bit before then so why did you focus on government's initially you know because government you could you could put it this way you can put put the government as the one of the biggest service providers for the citizens because every government provides thousands of difference of services to its citizens most of the services are very inefficient for example land title registration to to do the land title registration you need to go to different third parties you need to get different type type type of checks and balances papers and so on and so forth and from country to country this process could take from a few days to few months just to do one operation why it's happening because you don't trust the systems you don't trust the data in the systems and every time you do this transaction you need you need to do these checks again and again and again what blockchain and how blockchain can help blockchain can add this trust because once you place data on an on a blockchain it cannot be deleted and it cannot be altered by this you don't need to check the same operation again and again once the data on the blockchain and this is not only fallen teitelbaum but for any other service what you are getting from the government and we believe but this was the help of the blockchain any government could reduce first of all the cost of each service and could reduce the time of each service that will make the government much much more efficient and well I believe you have personal experience with government not working for the citizens and I've heard you talk before about how you believe that at least in some in some governments or in some countries that is it's always the case and can you tell listeners your personal story with government not working for its citizens yeah you know I born I was born in Latvia laterade small country was population roughly 2 million people it was part of Soviet Union now it's part of European Union and when Soviet Union collapsed I think I was 12 by this time my parents and parents of a lot of my friends I just literally lost everything money become paper and they lost the pensions and so on and so forth and I was very small but I felt it yeah because one one day my mother told me okay no matter is so but ma'am but as a technologists and I am in computer science since I'm I was eight I always fought okay how can I use the technology to to make the systems to work for the people because many many years after the this this happened with me it was my family and and with a lot of families in our countries I understood okay why it's happened because of the systems that were not designed to work for the people and you know when in 2010 I learned about cryptocurrency and in 2011 I understood what this this technology could be used not only to move money but to digitize the assets and to add trust into untrusted networks and this is the perfect technology to make any institutions to make any system work for the people and to make any system to be trusted because what is happening right now for example in a lot of countries I I know in us in Europe all the systems working plus/minus fine yeah and you can trust land title registration and so on you can move from a monic quite quite fast from bank to bank but in majority of the countries in this world and from the part of the world what where I am from people can lose properties and land titles just because somebody changing records in a database and this is a huge this is a really huge issue because if you if you have for example some she said men your take making small sale salary in the country is corrupt and the system is corrupt somebody can can go and negotiate with you and you are just changing crackers and the owner of the Adreno company the owner of the property is the different owner and there are a lot of such cases all around the world so was the help of the blockchain it became impossible so it is solving this global a global global issue so this is the perfect segue for us to talk about the Necker Island blockchain summit that you co-host with built-i and which i've had the honor of attending now twice thank you for those invitations so for me obviously I've been to a ton of different crypto and blockchain conferences but as I've definitely I don't remember if I've told you directly but I've told at least some of the other organizers that this conference for me sticks out because you guys don't invite all the same people that attend all the other crypto conferences you get pretty creative and strategic I think with your choices for instance at the most recent summit there was the president of the of Conservation International who you know was wonderful but you know she fully admitted oh I don't know a ton about blocking technology there was an officer from the Rockefeller Foundation and these people were mixed in along with crypto insiders like Vinnie lingam and Sandra Rowe and Michael Casey but how do you select who you're gonna bring in what's your goal in bringing together a group that's not eclectic first of all we want to create the mix of the people part of the people who clearly understand the technology from different angles and the second part of the people who are the global decision-makers or regulators or in just a very important person who can make an impact and the education is a key year so the biggest issue in our industry and in new technologies such a disruptive technology as a blockchain is the lack of education so you need to educate people you need to explain them why this technology is so important how this technology can change our lives better how this technology really can make systems work for the people and change this world to be a better place and the Necker Island is perfect location because first of all of Richard Branson energy itself creates this island so that you start thinking completely differently your your mind your mind on this island just opening and when you're living in this island for the four days with all the people a lot of interesting ideas came into action and one of the most important component of course the education exchange of ideas and when all these people from let's say two different worlds here from world of technology and different world they come together and discuss different cases some some good ideas happening here yeah well let's talk about some of the things that's that have come out of the summit because there have been so many and it's kind of interesting to look back because you know at the time it's just kind of like oh we have this idea we're gonna try to bring this group together for I mean I can list a whole bunch it's like the blockchain trust accelerator which so I'm just gonna list all these and you know please to find them for the listeners there's the global blockchain business councillor there's the blockchain alliance I feel like there are others I probably missed but why don't you for the listeners kind of list what they all are and what these organizations are doing yes election Alliance is the perfect example the blockchain Alliance is the organization that literally was born on Necker Island and why this organization was created because when such disruptive technology is happening the worst thing what could happen is the not smart regulation regulation is good but regulation for such disruptive technology should be very smart it's like you know you have rails you have an old train what is using these rails to move around some something and you create a completely new train Hyperloop with magnetic fields very high speed and so on so for the new rail for the new train you cannot use the oil or old rails otherwise this new train will be as efficient as the old one so for the new train you need to create completely new rails yeah and this organization was very important to join together industry experts and law enforcement and regulators so that when law enforcement and regulators have some questions or have some issues they always have industry experts who are ready to help who are ready to answer the questions who are ready to find the solution together and who are ready to help how to solve it without doing some random things what not need to be done yeah actually say listener should go back and listen to that episode I did with Jason Weinstein and Ellen Cohn of the blockchain Alliance because it was a very interesting episode and they talked a little bit more about the origins story of it and apparently I think the idea literally came about while some of some people on Necker Island were hanging out in a bath in the UH in a hot tub I almost said bathtub definitely not about but anyway so yeah it's it's a very interesting story and actually this also now is a good segue to talk about your new product that you announced crystal which is a blockchain analytics tool for law enforcement and as you described it in medium it quote uses advanced analytics and data scraping to map suspicious transactions and related entities so how do you know if a transaction is suspicious and then what data are you scraping there we analyzing a lot of public data on different forums on social networks and we created some sophisticated algorithms to analyze the transactions to untangle mixed transactions so with this kind of algorithm you significantly increase probability of understanding where these bitcoins are coming from but this tool also we spent almost two years to create this tool and the idea of creation of this tool was after discussing with banks institutions and different companies after discussing Cuates Bitcoin here and we understood okay Bitcoin is from one hand it's very transparent system all transactions are fixed on the blockchain but it's so hard for institutions to use this it's like using ms-dos comparing to win Windows or Mac OS and that's why by with the help of this tool you're just creating very easy to use an instrument to to give a comfort to give a comfort to law enforcement to banks to hedge funds to insurance companies and other organization who just want to see where those bitcoins are coming from and I think this this tool will help to to get discomfort to the institutions yeah I mean I think one important thing here is that the gene is out of bottle you know we are in hundreds of billions of value for the crypto assets and increasingly more and more individuals are sort of asking their financial institutions to allow them to buy cryptocurrencies to trade cryptocurrencies and obviously post-2008 financial institutions have been laden with you know a lot of compliance and they have they do have a lot of headaches in terms of dealing so if you come up with a product that you know works that is you know that adds value we see a humongous opportunity to go in and address you know to basically solve a joke point with financial institutions with you know insurance companies there are some healthcare applications you know data analytics you know and obviously law enforcement and what we're seeing is one of the myths of bitcoins has always been you know Bitcoin for criminal money but actually if you dig deeper the Bitcoin usage of Bitcoin by criminals as you know Jason Weinstein our board adviser has you know said you know if you're a criminal you should not just walk away we should run away from Bitcoin and surely the illicit activities of the cryptos have moved to other protocols which are much more anonymous than Bitcoin but Cristal is really a solution for you know for a huge you know financial industry opportunity you know alongside the law enforcement which we believe is is is there is a need for that and there will be an in you know there's a lot of synergies in that work and know what are the financial institutions wanting to do with a Bitcoin blockchain because as far as I understand at least from the headlines that we see on CNBC and other sites like that a lot of the heads of these companies are sort of disavowing Bitcoin and you know saying they won't let their customers trade in it and stuff like that so who of them are interested in using yeah you know that this evolving that they come back and apologize for that so but you know at the end of the day you see uber ization of the industry right I mean you can have a head of a post office of saying that you know I don't like email but if the constituents are coming and saying hey can you install you know pcs in your post office or I can be sending email you know in democratic countries you know it's a bottoms-up it's the grassroots movement and that's what we're saying so when you have you know massive amount of folks coming in and bugging their bank officers from the standpoint of buying kryptos and such you know there is obviously a demand from the population and I think you know it's it's a it's a matter of coming it with a solution to the compliance officers and to the banks that addresses those needs that you know allows them to satisfy their demand because if that is not satisfied in one jurisdiction you're gonna have regulatory arbitrage and I think everybody is aware of that so we believe there is a huge opportunity to be pioneers to entrench ourselves and to you know build out this industry yeah I guess we are seeing that already at least in ico space where all not all but a bunch of our SEOs are moving to Switzerland um but I actually wanted to go back has Val said something about looking at mixed transactions and I wasn't sure what he meant by that what how do you define mixed transactions I mean there are different mixers where people send transactions from different wallets to one wallet and mix it from this one wallet started to send it to different other wallets so in trying to you know mix the transaction so I don't know if I explained during or something not really but just - yeah exactly exactly yeah and but I heard that they were improving that the mixers were improving and it was at least I mean this was a while back but Kathryn Hahn on my podcast who you guys also know she said that they were improving to the point where law enforcement was not able to to untangle them but but obviously that was a year and a half ago and so now is your technology good enough to untangle those so it's not hundred percent but it was dis to acknowledge you can increase probability of untangling the transaction and so I know the product is fairly new but do you of customers yet and if so who are they for crystal we are not disclosing our customers right now but we have several customers who are using the tool in azzam as a bet bet bet aversion yeah okay so I did see online there were some critics of the tool for privacy reasons what do you say to people who criticize this product for that depends what kind of privacy reason well I I didn't pull any quotes but obviously you if you are tracking the transactions and scraping data and stuff like that I think maybe that's what they're referring to but bit convulsion this tool is doesn't do anything new yeah because Bitcoin blockchain is transparent by default so you can do it without this tool but it's much more complicated this tool just provides you user-friendly interface to do so so that you spend for example for tracking not hours but seconds okay yeah I guess I guess that does make sense this reminds me of how in that episode with with Katie she basically said yeah it's better if if the criminals use Bitcoin the best days for law enforcement will be when all the criminals of this world which will will start using Bitcoin it will be the best days for law enforcement because starting from this moment all of the bad guys will be traceable yes and actually for anybody who didn't listen to that episode you should go back and check it out because Katie did track down a few very very interesting crimes with live watching and she described how she actually realized that the crime she was seeing were being perpetrated by two people not one because she could see a difference in their behavior using the blockchain so it was it was very interesting um but let's actually circle back to EXO Nome which you had charged about earlier this is your enterprise blockchain product who is using that so right now we have does of pilot projects going on it's still early stage we launched a land title registration in Republic of Georgia we launched few projects in Ukraine and we have a dozens of commercial projects what happening in pilot stage right now and the way you described it earlier it's a private blockchain where they secure it by maybe putting hashes of the transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain yes so how it's working from time to time we are doing snapshot of this private blockchain let's say every 10 minutes or every hour and we're putting the hash code of the full snapshot of the private blockchain as a Bitcoin blockchain transaction to the Bitcoin blockchain and by this Bitcoin blockchain becomes so called independent auditor of the private blockchain and if something happened inside private blockchain for example all the notes negotiate between each other to change the records they cannot negotiate with bit conduction and you will see immediately but something happened wrong in private blockchain yeah not in five years yeah not in three years when it's too late but in ten minutes yes so one thing I was curious about is is it difficult to persuade companies to use this blockchain software or to to adopt launching technology or even use something that touches the Bitcoin blockchain because if I look at the piece of innovation in the public and private block chain spaces it's like no contest the enterprise stuff is moving at a snail's pace generally there isn't a ton to show for it yet and then you know obviously with a Bitcoin or it's not a nut bit going but the public bar chain space just things take off at lightning speed often so do you think enterprise clients are moving at a pace quickly enough to keep themselves from being disrupted yeah a lot of enterprise moving to use blockchain because a lot of them understand the value of blockchain blockchain can significantly improve all business processes because you will not need to spend time on papers you will not need to spend time on third party checks and so on of course there are companies that are concerned about the technology that things but it's some kind of hype but it's always like this with new technologists there will be always first movers and they will there will be always followers but the companies who who will be first in the line they will get competitive advantage ok yeah I mean it makes sense they're in it for the efficiency gains so one other thing I wanted to ask you about in this department was you're helping with the pilot that the State Department in coca-cola are doing to use a blockchain for labor rights and as far as I understand I think what problem they're trying to solve is that migrant workers sometimes sign contracts that promise one set of working conditions in their home country let's say and then when they move to the other country where they're supposed to work they are they can be subject to worse working conditions but then they have no recourse or proof that the employer isn't holding up their end of the agreement and you know maybe I mean they're just not in their home country they're maybe they don't know what resources they have or they don't speak the language so this you know obviously these are big names Coca Cola and State Department how do you convince large institutions like these to test out something this experimental well I mean I think this goes back to the one of the projects that was born out of Necker and blockchain trust accelerator and I think one of the important aspects of blockchain is really social good you know we truly believe that this technology will transform the world will make it more transparent open and accountable as such you know one of the key projects that emerged out of this was BTA and in partnerships with National Democratic Institute as well as the New America Foundation and the team has been very successful bringing in additional players and one of the projects that you know are part of the BGA is exactly the the one you just described Laura I think this is a very important project you know it will be impactful to you know thousands of migrant workers and we believe that it will act as a template for many other companies that are responsible and are looking to address these issues to take on and spread it like a wildfire cream so let's now switch to talking about this new blockchain that you guys have been talking about a lot which I believe is also involved in the cocoa Hollyn State Department project and it's called Emmer coin what is Emmer coin and why are you guys so interested in it sure so basically Emmer corn is a technology which allows you to provide services on blockchain very efficiently and our chief security officer Alex Petrov is really the guy that got to know the technologies behind this project some two years ago and got fascinated by what they were doing and I brought this to our attention I think from the standpoint of bitfury the investment it's a strategic investment for us we see that Emmer coin can be complimentary to Exxon oh and what we also see is that Emmer corn is a platform is the one that's being merged mines to Bitcoin blockchain is something that you know is very interesting and from the security standpoint I just wanna point out also we are big support of the rootstock project which also you know enabler of the smart contracts but it's also merged mines with a Bitcoin blockchain so as we are expanding and we're looking at various protocols and applications we really look at the teams we really look at the value that can add and Emmer coin stood out from the standpoint of what it can accomplish and we took on this project some three months ago so I know you guys travel the world quite a bit obviously you have offices all over the world and if we listeners didn't hear but before the show started we were joking about how they were the International men of mining I think I think I was saying um but then we were joking about how they like to call themselves a transaction processing company but decided international men or transaction processing does not sound anywhere near as sexy but because I know you guys have this big global view of what's happening in a lot of different areas encrypted right now I was curious to hear where you see the future of crypto headed what do you think the next one - Terry - years in the space will look like you know next few years I think we will see exponential growth or the implementation of different blockchain systems and use of cryptocurrency and yeah we are traveling a lot we're meeting with a lot of decision makers in different part of this world different countries and you know what is interesting I never see any person who understood who after after understanding what cryptocurrency is and what blockchain is say it's some kind of I don't know hype or something every single person who understood this technology said yes this is great this really can change our world and the systems in the most efficient way yeah I think Bitcoin has sort of a past a point of no return you know now it's about a speed of adoption and what is so powerful about this technology that it's really not driven by Silicon Valley if you look at about it it's really a global phenomenon and it's driven by you know coders from you know China and Japan and you know Europe and you know obviously America and you know Middle East and many other parts of the world South America so you know it's a global phenomena it's open source and it's it's really amazing to see you know we have some 100 coders and programmers that are working day and night on you know various applications or blocks and you just see you know these young brilliant kids you know PhDs in mathematics winners of international chess Olympia's that are coming and coding and and creating so you know this is the technology I believe that is going to have much more powerful impact than Internet and I believe it is a technology that will transform the world in a significant way the most important innovations to answer your question I think the implications of lightning Network we have an even fathomed what will be the you know the connect significance of this information we think that it will have paramount influence on numerous industries from payment rails to you know media advertising to IOT sector and the promise of lightning is is gathering a lot of speed you know we are huge supporters and contributors you know to this and I believe year 2018 will be the year of the Lightning and year 2018 19 will be an inflection point where Bitcoin starts going from oacd countries really to the billions in emerging markets because we truly believe this technology is meant for the emerging markets where the friction of payments and assets is the highest where the friction of corruption and lack of transparency is the highest and we really believe that this is a technology for the billions and next two years you will start seeing that shift occurring where the benefits of this technology will start being enjoyed by the peoples in India and Indonesia and in you know Argentina and Brazil and you know Russia and you know Nigeria and you know in huge huge numbers well actually before we go one other thing I wanted to ask about is I believe we're seeing kind of a wide range of reactions from governments to cryptocurrency and I noted that obviously you just opened this mining Center in Norway and it appears the the Minister of Trade or something was even at the ceremony and I looked up where the mining Center is located and is very it's not like near Oslo or anything it looks like it was kind of a trek but it's in a remote area and you know I feel like the fact that he went there was pretty significant so that sort of shows an openness on the part of the Norwegian government and then at the same time I know that recently there was the small town in New York Plattsburgh that banned Bitcoin mining because I guess a number of miners descended upon the small town and some of the people the residents were contending that the mining operations were raising everyone's electric bills so what is the range of reactions that you are seeing when it comes to governments so we've been super selective in terms of identifying which countries to go and you know which partners to partner up and you know in many cases like you know in Norway for example we will be bringing jobs we will be bringing know-how same thing in Canada same thing in Georgia so we have seen governments super receptive you know welcoming with open arms and seeing that this is the technology of the future and you know the investments are creating jobs the investments are creating transfer of you know knowledge and technology and in our cases we have had very very warm reception huh and you haven't had any I mean I guess you're you're choosing the governments that you think will already be open to working with you that's correct okay well we will see how the government reaction unfolds over the next few years well thanks so much to both of you for coming on the show thank you thank you both and
