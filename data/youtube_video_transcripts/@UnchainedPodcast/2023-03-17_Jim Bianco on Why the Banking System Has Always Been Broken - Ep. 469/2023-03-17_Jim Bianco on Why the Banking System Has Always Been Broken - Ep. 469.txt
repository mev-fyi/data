with the code Laura Link in the description today's guest is Jim Bianco founder and president of Bianco research welcome Jim hey thanks for having me Laura we've seen three Bank closures in quick succession it seems each of them had different causes but since you're a macro expert I wanted to ask you about one of the causes that has been much discussed which is the current High interest rate environment do you think that that played a role and if so what was that role no I think it played the primary role in in what's been happening I'm going to use a fancy term and then I'm going to try and Define it this is a liquidity crisis not a solvency crisis now what does that mean this is nothing like 2008 in 2008 Banks made loans and they bought Securities then they lost a ton of money on them and they were unable to meet their obligations because of losses in 2023 Banks made loans and they owned Securities which were largely good there was no real problem with Securities I know people trying to make a big deal about this unrealized loss but that's not a real problem what happened was everybody wanted their money back on the same day and a bank can't turn to a loan in a mortgage and a bunch of Securities and sell them all in the next four minutes and raise cash in order to meet those in obligations this is what causes Banks to fail if you want a better explanation of this go watch the bank run and it's a wonderful life this is exactly what happened in the 1930s uh so this is from 80 years ago what's been going on in the markets this is not from 15 years ago it's a liquidity problem it's not a solvency problem now that I've defined it the problem was interest rates in both directions both zero interest rates for 14 years I think was the bigger problem in raising of interest rates what happened with banks coming into a year ago was they had enough deposits they didn't need any more deposits so when the FED started raising rates you might have noticed I have noticed that your bank never raised your rate your savings account your checking account are still somewhere near zero on your interest rate a lot of people think that that's because they're supposed to be there no they're supposed to follow the market your checking account should be giving you four percent on your money your savings account should be giving you four percent on your money it's not uh and that's because the banks didn't need to attract any more money so as interest rates went from zero to one to two to three to four nobody really did anything about it and at five percent the world changed people logged on to their bank yet they started to understand that there's a treasury bill and I can buy a treasury bill through treasury direct to my brokerage account and hey guess what it's really easy to do there's money market funds that are yielding four and a half percent so they started demanding their money back from the bank and they started putting it outside of banks in treasury bills and in Money Market funds and this all started at all banks but it really hit on the weakest Banks the the three s's you know silvergate uh Silicon Valley Bank and signature because they also were getting outflows because of crypto or because of tech and all of that combined together to put them in positions where they couldn't meet their obligations and they were forced to close so hopefully that's a explanation that this is not about Bankers making bad loans this is about everybody wants their money back in the same minute and they can't provide that money in the same minute and when you say that both crypto and Tech uh started these Tech encryptos customers were withdrawing their deposits why was that because crypto and Tech are well you know I know that every Tech I know crypto people are degens and they think they're cryptos in a bull market because it's gone up for a week but it's been terrible for 18 months and Tech has been terrible for 18 months too they've been about the weakest areas in the entire economy right now Tech can't raise any money I know the VCS will tell you that they're that they're raising money yeah two guys are raising money and 500 can't uh the the crypto has been getting liquidated left and right we've had protocols blow up we've had FTX and people have been afraid of it and they've been pulling out so silvergate signature and even to some extent Silicon Valley have had outflows because of the problems in Tech and the problems in crypto they knew that they were managing that what tripped them up was they were losing deposits and they were managing the decline I believe what tripped them up was the yield Seekers weren't paying attention to Rising yields through two three four percent they thought that money was stale stable wasn't going to go anywhere at five the floodgates opened and everybody started leaving and like wait a minute wait a minute over here the yield Seekers are leaving now and my tech guys are leaving and my crypto guys are leaving and they all want their money today at noon I couldn't I couldn't meet those applications and that's why I think that they were forced what I'm describing is why all this led to say Silicon Valley Bank a week ago Wednesday had to sell 40 billion dollars worth of Securities and realize a 1.8 billion dollar loss and then their stock fell 60 and then there was a panic and then everybody started to run for the exits and so for the you know on the bank side um they were uh making certain Investments which you know they were doing obviously to try to make a return on the customer's deposits and as you pointed out uh that kind of only works when interest rates are at a certain level so do you think that the traditional business model for banks is broken the traditional business model the fractional Reserve System for banks let me be clear on it it's been broken since it was invented in Venice in the Renaissance it's been broken for 400 years it is the ultimate levered system that is highly unstable it has always been that way we have had nothing but Bank instability for hundreds of years now what we try to do to offset that is we have Deposit Insurance we have central banks we have Myriad of Bank Regulators that crisscross in this unstable system to try and force it to be stable and even then it doesn't always work and then the and then the taxpayer has to wind up bailing out the debate system over and over again so yes the fractional Reserve banking system has always been broken it's just been a level of Brokenness that it has been over the last um half a millennia or something we've had Bank runs in the 17th century and in the 18th century we had Wildcat banking problems we had Bank runs terrible ones in the 1930s we had the 2008 financial prices and lots in between the savings a loan crisis this happens over and over again the banking system is never sound the banking system is always unstable the banking system is either in one of two states it is blowing up or it is about to blow up but other than that I have no opinion about the banking system well do you think that there is a sustainable business model for banks that would be different from what we currently have a fully reserved banking system model would be would be a much more sustainable uh business model that is the University of Chicago plan from the 1930s that they tried to do after the 19 after the bank runs in 1930s they tried to do away with uh the reserve banking system by promoting a fully reserved banking system now since we're talking on a crypto Channel if you want an example of a fully reserved banking system that's avayan compound and so that's exactly what they do they don't lever they take in the money they reinvest the money and there's a little bit of spread in between for um for the for their trouble so yeah the the sustainable system is what decentralized Finance is attempting to give us right now um that's why I think that you know you've seen such hostility by Regulators for the current uh defy system and stable coins is because it is the alternative to this unstable system that we have right now well I find it fascinating that you're pointing uh to those as the models that should be followed but I love it can it be clear about one thing um Ave in compound I think are good models now that doesn't preclude that they could be on other l1s that doesn't preclude that you could have it on the Bitcoin blockchain as well but that is essentially the model is a fully reserved model and that's what their model is they're not fractional reserved I mean the closest you've got to fractional reserves might be fracks but then they're trying to go fully reserved uh as well so that is the model that is very stable but of course that is also the model that makes Bankers not have private planes in expensive cars because it just it it survives as a utility a bank but it doesn't become a place where you can get very very wealthy as a banker but as an investor or a lender or borrower you can rest assured that you're not going to accidentally lose all your money because your Banker made a mistake all right so in a moment we're going to talk about certain other factors that affected these Bank closures but first a quick word from the sponsors who make the show possible ever wanted to use D5 without being

app at railway.xyz to find out more back to my conversation with Jim so I am definitely not a macro person but I have seen a number of commentators point out that quote the net worth of the US Federal Reserve is in the negative by over a trillion dollars um and people have been saying the FED is uh losing money for the first time since 1915 I saw that in a tweet by RAM alawalia and um others are saying the only way for the FED to backs off the system is to print more money so like I said I'm not a backup person but that doesn't sound good to me and so I was curious for your thoughts on where the macro environment is going and what the FED will do with interest rates and how that will affect the banks I think you described it well I mean it doesn't sound good to anybody listening to it because you and me and everybody else listening to it unless Jay Paul's plugged in here don't have a printing press in the basement so we don't we don't get to just print up money whenever we make losses to cover it and we also don't have the ability to write down in a piece of paper I owe the treasury five billion dollars and hand it to Janet Ellen she says very good when you get the money you can pay me back no hurries uh and that's what that is the special privilege that that the Federal Reserve has so are they running at a loss yes should I be concerned about the financial stability because they're running at a loss and they're not particularly it's just poor Management on the part of the Federal Reserve I'd be more concerned that by printing money that they're going to wind up doing more QE and being stimulative to an economy that's already suffering from higher inflation that's where that was is a bigger problem but the Federal Reserve will never go bankrupt um it's it's like the it's like the bank it's like the bank in Monopoly if you've ever seen the rules in the bank in Monopoly never runs out of money just write down 100 on a sheet of paper there you got another hundred dollar bill the Federal Reserve has the same ability to do that they are as my friend Paul casual the former Chief Economist Northern Trust used to say they're a legal counterfeiter so they can just basically counterfeit up as much money as they want um you and I do this if you and I practice Central Banking we go to jail for being counterfeiters wow wow I am definitely getting a lesson in economics today all right so I actually want to dive into each of these Bank closures because I think the um you know each of them has like a slightly different picture so I was curious for your thoughts on silvergate what do you think was um you know were some of the particular causes that they uh for them to close my guess is a loss of confidence because of three letters FTX that people that were dealing with silvergate didn't trust management because remember when you're walking on a fractional banking system um you know there there's a lot of Leverage and there's a lot of uncertainties and it really comes down to confidence and trust and it appears that in the case of silvergate there was a loss of confidence and there was a loss of trust and that's why people were exiting they were demanding their money back to the point where they couldn't continue as a going concern okay and so we kind of talked about Silicon Valley Bank I don't know if there's anything additional you wanted to add on that one no just that you know a large part of their business was was uh financing VCS uh startups VC startups so you know they financed some start some VC raises a series a for some startup and all that money gets put into a bank account at Silicon Valley bank and then they have a burn rate right so that that bank account goes down down down but in this Tech environment with the how difficult it's been for the last year year and a half in Tech it's hard to raise series b or series C to replenish that account it was very easy in 18 and 19. um to to raise that so those accounts were bleeding out they weren't at risk but Silicon Valley Bank knew that that was happening it was trying to manage it it was more the yield Seekers that really kind of snuck up on them but I would also add the yield sneakers that at five percent said you know what I'm out of this bank I'm going to put my money in a money market fund and buy t-bills that's happening to every Bank in the country right now but they were in a particularly vulnerable position so while it's happening in other Banks they're not going to be squeezed as much as Silicon Valley Bank did and out of curiosity because so many people have been saying that VCS fomented that crisis at svb what do you think of that theory um unless you think they want to commit suicide that they were they were for many it does not serve any VC's purpose to blow up the bank that they use I mean unless you're unless you were referring to Peter thiel's argument that all the founder uh funded companies need to pull out of svb I still don't think that that's the case uh in even in that case because it didn't serve it doesn't serve anybody's purpose in in Silicon Valley that that bank blew up I also saw some theories that one of the causes is the repeal of certain parts of the Dodd-Frank law uh back in 2018 and do you think if those regulations had not been repealed that Silicon Valley Bank would have survived no I would have gone sooner it would have it would have been made it it would have they would have gone sooner this the 2008 laws all what happened in 2008 let me try and explain it this way was Banks made bad loans and they lost money so we put together a bunch of rules so that they can't make bad loans again and lose money so we also then forced Banks to buy very high quality assets like treasury Securities and then they took some duration risk along the way so what we did was we forced Banks to take interest rate risk at a time when they should have had taken credit risk because credit has been doing much better than interest rates but we changed their laws in order to do that remember that all Regulators are generals that fought the last war you know so that uh they're they're looking at the last war in 2008 and they're going to make sure that the next war is not 2008 it won't be it'll be something different I don't think that the problem was Capital requirements the problem was liquidity and very few of the rules that they had would have addressed that and also they can't deal with the speed of what's going on by all accounts 30 days ago maybe 20 days ago Silicon Valley Bank was a fine Bank there wasn't any problem with it it was just in the last month or so as interest rates got above three five percent and people started rolling out also I'm going to hold up my phone here's my phone like your phone we are in the world of Mobile Banking and I think people need to understand that 42 billion dollars was withdrawn from Silicon Valley Bank last Friday in one day oh my God how did 42 billion dollars get withdrawn if there was nobody lined up in front of the bank they were all laying in bed using their mobile banking app and so if Regulators have got to learn now and I think they're learning the hard way and they're scared if I could say it they're scared shitless that the velocity of deposits is much higher than they've ever imagined it would be it is so easy for me to just log on to this thing and say I'm done with your 30 basis point savings account I'm going to a money market fund that's going to yield me 475. I'd be done in five minutes uh and uh and so the money is moving around the banking system faster than anybody could have ever imagined and this is the thing that I think shocked them in terms of the speed of money that is coming out of these Banks and is going to continue to be a problem for banks like First Republic Pac West and the like as well these are other big West Coast uh uh Regional banks that have been rumored to have some kind of issues as well as a matter of fact as we're talking it looks like um First Republic might be getting a bailout from other banks at this point they're essentially a failed bank but they're not being bail out by the government to Prevail a lot by Wall Street but they couldn't make it on their own as a standalone well so the One Bank closure that seems a little bit irregular is signature why do you think it was closed Ah that's a that is an interesting one because by all indications no one was talking about signature well we were talking that Signature Bank had some issues but not had the limitating issues there was no worse or better than First Republic or some of the others and then they were summarily closed and the board was fired on Sunday night now I'll just repeat what Barney Frank said Barney Frank the former congressman from Massachusetts who's the name Dodd-Frank he's the second name on it was a director of Signature Bank 110 Billion Dollar Bank maybe 80 percent of their business was traditional commercial real estate lending business loans and the like and they also had the sidnex Signet platform as well it was only 20 of the business it wasn't a large part of their business well after silvergate failed they were having problems that a lot of their real estate borrowers and a lot of other people knew that they had the Signet digital platform and they don't understand crypto and they just know crypto bad they they believe the fud that crypto is all you know terrorists and drug dealers and they just wanted away from them so they were having an issue but Barney said that by Sunday night they thought that they had the issue patched up enough that the bank could open on Monday but then the FDIC stepped in and said nope you're done we're going to fire the board we're going to take over the bank and uh he thinks it was intentional to bury Cigna and he and so is the CEO has said that as well too I would like to see some evidence that that bank was incapable of opening on Monday morning I've I I don't maybe they've published it and I haven't seen it but I haven't seen that evidence now what I do see is the New York State Attorney General saying well they were under investigation fine if you're going to close every Bank under investigation I expect 2 000 Banks to be closed tomorrow lots of banks are under investigation for lots of reasons we don't run in there fire the management and have the government immediately take them over we only do that when there's a bank run or there's a or there's a widespread systemic failure not that there's an investigation so I'm waiting for the evidence that that bank was incapable of opening Monday morning because the director and the CEO said they were capable of opening Monday morning and The Regulators should have given them an opportunity to try and survive so yeah it does smell does it does smell a little fishy hear what happened with that bank maybe it isn't but I'm waiting for evidence that no they were in a much worse shape that Barney Frank has been misrepresenting the actual financial position of the bank when he said that they were able to open on Monday morning yeah and I should point out that Reuters reported that um there are bids uh being taken to acquire the bank but that apparently they uh the bidders are not allowed to offer crypto services so that means Cigna will be shut down if it's reopened so um again the depositors the depositors are owed 100 cents on the dollar uh and Cygnet is something of value and if they if they are not going to sell Cygnet then they better make sure that they could pay the depositors 100 cents on the dollar without dipping into the uh into the bailout fund the FDIC deposit fund because then there's then they're ripping off the taxpayer by not selling Cigna and but of course by selling that you are de facto saying somebody else could continue to offer crypto Services I also wanted to ask about stable coins because Circle revealed on Friday that it had 3.3 billion dollars in USC reserves held at svb and so over the weekend we saw the value of that stablecoin drop to as low as 88 cents and I wondered what you thought that whole incident said about the viability of reserve-backed stable coins going forward uh it I'll tease I know who we're going to have on it it teases that the the egregious mistake was not letting Caitlyn long open custodia because it needs to be opened yesterday and that they should not be holding their money in a fractional Reserve Bank but they have no choice because it's the only place they can I would actually argue to you that first of all what happened with usdc was pretty orderly and understandable that when the news came out that eight percent of the the backing of the coin was in silvergate bank it traded down to 88 cents as you said for a hot second but it pretty much leveled out at around 92 cents okay eight percent of the money is trapped in a bank that they can't get so the new pack is now 92 cents that's you don't like it if you owned it at a dollar but that made sense then as we realized okay they're probably going to get 50 cents on the dollar back on Monday get traded back up to 95 96 cents okay that makes sense and then as the get the bailout came in and they were going to get 100 cents on the dollar by Monday morning it traded back to its Peg of one dollar so it wasn't chaotic it to me other than that brief hot second it went to 88 cents it seemed to be I I hate to say another example that the crypto system works you may not like the price but it worked it worked it was it was rational it was understandable if you had eight percent of your money tied up in somewhere where you couldn't get it then your new pack is 92 cents when you were able to get that eight Cent eight percent back your new pack is a dollar that's the way I kind of see what happened with usdc and I might add that yet again I'm a big fan of curve finance that the three pull on curve Finance worked like a charm to allow people to move between them and tether and die there was probably more misunderstanding about die that die traded down too low to around 91 cents it is die has some backing by uh usdc but not a hundred percent backing it shouldn't have traded 92 cents with circle trading 92 cents because it's not fully backed by only only Circle so there was a little bit of misunderstanding there but then with three pool if if some of the dejians want to you know put a wrong price on it then they're going to get their pack Pockets cleaned and they did the system worked and it has been working one of the things I've been very impressed about for the last year or so is defies worked it doesn't go down and they had a little bit of a problem 21 with that going down but not not last year and it works you don't like the prices but that they don't close and demand a bailout uh all that closes and demands of bailout are all the C5 firms that are that are doing that um with the exception of maybe UST uh that might be that might be one exception but mostly it's worked much much better than the unstable tradfi system that we have right now last quick question fed now which will enable instant payments Around the Clock 24 7 365 will launch in July how do you expect that to affect Banking and the possibility for these types of closures well let's remember what fed now is is that in is that right now we have the ACH system and the ACH system you've probably seen it and I've probably seen it when you go and you pay your bills online that you know it's going to get to the money they're going to get the money in two days because we have this system from the 70s that is the Fed is allowed 40 year old technology to still be the order of the day what they did in 2020 was they announced that they were going to take they were going to revamp the system in the FED now so they took 2015 technology in 2020 because they wanted stable technology and that means five-year-old technology and it took them three years to do what most developers can do in 60 days because they're the fed and they're now rolling out fed now in 2023 so now we're going to go from 40 year old technology to eight-year-old technology and then they won't update it and eventually that'll get out of date as well too they're going to roll it out in various forms where it's only going to be available bank to bank and then it's going to be available for large customers it's going to be a while before you and I could actually go online pay my utility bill and the utility will get that money immediately and not without that two-day lack we'll eventually get there uh but we're gonna have to see where we go now like I said the problem is you know they're going from 1978 to 2015. and that's better and that's going to be and that's going to help for a lot of transactions but there's going to be no innovation after that the Innovation is going to come from D5 and it's going to come from stable coins and it's going to come from fintech in terms of the payments I think if anything what you what uh fednow will do is it'll be a boon to some of the fintech companies because they they're building shiny slick absence shiny slick protocols on 40 year old rails and so now at least I'll have eight-year-old rails and it'll help them you know to process payments a little bit faster look um let me give you a quick example there's a a payroll Processing Company called riplink their VC startup they had their money with sale uh with svb Silicon Valley Bank um they were in the process of processing payrolls for hundreds of companies for March 15th which was the day before we're recording um and they put out a letter on Sunday morning that because they were in the process of doing the payrolls and the bank failed the companies can't get their money back and they can't finish processing payroll so no one's going to get paid now that got resolved Sunday night when the FDIC said we're going to release all the money Monday morning but why did that happen because the ACH system means that you have to give the money to the processor and then they process it and they give it to the bank and everybody holds their breath for two days to wait to make sure that the bank says okay now you can release the funds to to all of the uh all of the payees and then they have to wait two days to once they try to transfer to their Bank in order to get the money and if in that two-day period somebody fails everybody loses and that's what happened fed now an instant payment system now I've collapsed it down to five seconds then hopefully in that five second period the fact that the bank doesn't fail and everybody still gets their money so definitely is better it is definitely an improvement but it's not the fix um you know the FED is trading in their 40 year old used car for an eight-year-old used car an eight-year-old used car is better than a 40 year old used car but it's still a used car okay well yeah this this has been highly Illuminating thank you so much for explaining it all thank you
