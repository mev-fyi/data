its recently quarterly report grayskill announced record inflows tell us about that so on a quarterly basis our team puts out a report that looks back at investment activity across the greyscale family of products um over that most recent quarter and we try and break down for the investment community which products have inflows which products are more popular than others what the breakdown is of different types of investors any other trends that we're seeing amongst our investor base and the regularity of these reports have really allowed them to become almost the de facto sentiment indicator for investment in the space and in q2 of this year we raised over 900 million dollars in just that second quarter and that was on the back of raising over half a billion dollars in q1 this year so we're really seeing inflows into the grayscale products at a record pace and that's you know almost double what do you think accounts for the massive increase in interest i think that the macro environment is causing a lot of investors to focus on crypto in a way that they perhaps hadn't before i think one of the most topical things that investors are talking to us about is unlimited quantitative easing and as they look at how much the fed and other governmental bodies are printing they're really starting to drill into the verifiable scarcity of assets like bitcoin and when you think about that very important attribute that bitcoin has and then you combine it with bitcoin's uncorrelated nature and it's not just bitcoin right it's other digital currencies as well investors are really starting to appreciate that there is a new and uncorrelated return stream that they can maybe get from having exposure to digital currencies and now is really the time we're seeing a lot of investors dig in on the space and so when you talked about the quantitative easing that does of course immediately bring to mind bitcoin because of the cap on its supply and when you started your answer you were talking primarily in bitcoin or about bitcoin but i wondered how the interest in the other currencies with spread out is it 80 in bitcoin or you know what are you seeing in terms of the interest across the various crypto assets so you know grayscale now has 10 different investment products and the greyscale bitcoin trust is our flagship product it's been around the longest it's our largest fund no question about it um we've seen a market uptick in interest across the other products so in particular i'd highlight in q2 we saw a lot of interest in the grayscale ethereum trust and really seeing more investment really coming in across the board and i believe now of our returning institutional investors we now see over 80 percent of them having now invested in more than one grayscale product meaning they now each have exposure to more than one digital currency and it's interesting to think about that audience because for many of them bitcoin is their first foray it's the place that they're most comfortable with they've done the most research on typically it's what gets them comfortable and gets them to dip their toe in the space and we're now really seeing a growing trend of investors not just wanting bitcoin exposure but they actually see diversification benefits of having more than one cryptocurrency exposure in their portfolio and when you said that ethereum was another one of the assets that was gaining a lot of interest what's driving that because ethereum does not have a cap on its supply so i was curious to know why they were focusing on that out of all the other non-bitcoin assets well i think for a lot of investors ethereum like bitcoin has a lot of staying power um it too like bitcoin has overcome a lot of adversity and i think investors are really starting to drill into some of the use cases around ethereum um powering d5 and a lot of other new applications for which ethereum is really targeted towards where i think for more investors thinking about bitcoin they're really thinking about it more along the lines of a digital gold or a digital store of value and who is coming to you now are you seeing interest from new groups and what types of investors are coming to grayscale well so grayscale raises assets um primarily from institutional investors um so we deal primarily with accredited investors so it does include a lot of high net worth individuals and family offices financial advisors but really the vast majority of the actual dollars that we're getting are coming from hedge funds um and then other types of institutions endowments and pensions and i think one of the most interesting things that we actually broke this out in some of our reports this year is that the allocations aren't coming from any one kind of investor i think you know for a lot of folks bitcoin and digital currency investing it's it's for momentum traders or it's for funds that really only are experienced in investing in technology or um in venture capital things that are really on the riskiest end of the spectrum and for us when we look at the actual mandates of our investors it's everyone from global macro funds to value funds to risk arbitrage funds i mean every single kind of investor mandate is represented in the grayscale investor base which i think the takeaway is digital currency investing is certainly not for everyone it's risky it's early days you know a lot of investors need to have a patient and kind of medium-term horizon for their investment but it does then mean that it's something that everyone should at least be considering and we're already seeing empirical data that it's making its way into the portfolios of investors of all different kinds of mandates there was also huge validation from paul tudor jones around this time amongst that institutional set he announced that he had gotten exposure to bitcoin in his portfolio and i was wondering are you seeing any impact from that on investors well i think investors are certainly always going to be looking at the price of digital currencies um as a as a metric to look at when considering when to or when not to put exposure on and that's not something we'll ever be able to draw investors away from right they're always thinking about when to put on risk and when to take it off i certainly think that the environment around the asset class has created a lot of there's been a lot of recent tailwinds around that so you can definitely point to paul tudor jones you can definitely point to renaissance technologies a lot of these more storied investors who are coming out publicly in support of the asset class is a huge point of validation for investors and when you combine that with the types of on-ramps in the infrastructure being developed around the asset class when you think about the development of the derivatives market how much you know there is in the way of lending and borrowing and really seeing all of the on-ramps provide investors with that know your customer aml really all those protections they're used to seeing it really forces more people to you know no longer really have any roadblocks that would prevent them from participating in the asset class which i think for a lot of folks long has been the reason they've been on the sidelines they wanted more regularity more regulatory clarity or they wanted to see more infrastructure built up and at this point those excuses don't really hold up and so what percentage of your investor base was new this quarter so we expanded the investor base by about 24 25 uh this past quarter and so what i think that means is number one we're certainly seeing a lot of returning investors as i shared a lot of them are now utilizing more than one grayscale product um but we're also moving into new audiences and new areas and i think that a lot of investors continue to be attracted to greyscale for its you know long-standing track record and the breadth and depth of its offerings and how would you say the growth in the space compares this year from last year and when i say that i don't mean just because of the macro forces due to the pandemic but i wondered if there was anything more inherent to the development of the crypto space as well that has changed that narrative for people well i think certainly one thing is that it's just generally been you know orders of magnitude easier for folks to get the right resources they need around crypto you know whether you're reading coindesk.com or listening to this podcast as frequently as it comes out reading books reading articles reading papers that the grayscale team is authoring i think today there is a more ro probably the most robust library of resources available to investors and i think that that's been a huge benefit because for our team we actually conduct a survey um almost every year in the middle of doing one now where we actually go out and try and determine using a third party provider what are some of those holdbacks what are some of those sentiment indicators um in the investment community and we're not just talking about sophisticated hedge funds we're talking about just average investors as well and the last time we did this in 2019 for most investors the biggest thing holding them back was a lack of education so our team has really started to engage the financial advisor community we just launched an entire digital currency toolkit for financial advisors they need to be armed with the information to have those conversations with their clients and be armed and ready and not kind of caught flat-footed so i really think you know not just grayscale but the industry as a whole is doing a really good job of getting those resources out there in a moment we'll discuss some news regarding the grayscale ethereum trust but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible how much in fees are you paying for crypto purchases now crypto.com is waiving the

nexo token at nexo dot io slash token that's nexo dot io slash token back to my conversation with michael sonnenshine grayskill filed a form 10 with the sec for the grayscale ethereum trust what is a form 10 and what is the significance of that filing so i think a lot of your listeners and viewers may never have heard of a form 10 before so let me unpack that typically when a company goes public company xyz ipos on the new york stock exchange or the nasdaq they're already subject to being an scc reporting company that means they file their financial statements as 10ks and 10qs and make periodic updates through 8ks um so you don't hear about form 10 often in our case grayscale actually voluntarily filed form 10 which actually allows if it becomes effective for the greyscale ethereum trust to become an sec reporting company so grayscale ethereum trust is already alive and well and is an active product that now has over 500 million dollars of assets in it it's the world's largest ethereum vehicle um world's largest ethereum investment vehicle and by filing form 10 we are voluntarily asking the sec to have this vehicle become a reporting company so its financials become 10ks and 10 queues and we file 8ks and really the motivation there is to really provide investors with that additional disclosure and that additional reporting obligation that again we're voluntarily doing this is what investors want this is what investors deserve and this is what investors candidly already have when they're looking at lots of other investment instruments across other asset classes and we really think this is a really really big milestone for the product and why did you decide to do that for this investment vehicle at this point in time well this is on the heels of our successfully having the grayscale bitcoin trust become an sec reporting company in january of this year and so this is the vehicle that next seemed to be the most likely candidate um to become effective as an sec reporting company and i think with the added attention this product has gotten with the added investment it's received um we've seen already such a positive reception and around greyscale bitcoin trust you know we want to expand this into not only grayscale ethereum trust but over time we hope we can bring this same level of reporting um to other products within the grayscale family so time will tell and does the interest in ethereum have to do with the upcoming transition to a proof-of-stake network which will perhaps also have an impact on the value of ether as a digital asset i don't think necessarily i think you know my takeaway around the potential transition from eth to eve 2.0 and some of you listening and watching may have no idea what laura and i are talking about but it's a pretty material change to the ethereum protocol if it goes through and i think what i'm most interested in sharing with you is that we have been amazingly amazingly impressed by our investors who are coming to the table and asking questions about this that they're smart enough on this asset class and smart enough on ethereum to be doing their homework and again those resources are now available that we're now having those kinds of conversations with investors about eth and eth 2.0 so certainly something that's coming up in conversation but not necessarily something that i would say is driving investment uh your parent company digital currency group and grayscale i believe were initially proponents of ethereum classic and it seems however by filing the form 10 for the ethereum trust that the priority has switched why is that i wouldn't say our priority has switched um you know i think that at the grayscale level we try to identify protocols that investors are a telling us that they want to be able to gain exposure to um and trying to identify opportunities where we may see certain value and want to bring that to investors as well and obviously that includes both ethereum and ethereum classic because we offer products around both digital assets i would say we again would want to file um you know more products to become sec reporting over time um and there's no real prioritization so much as um you know the products that we're able to work on with the sec and so as you mentioned you do have a suite of products for other digital assets what metrics would you want to see for any of those whether it's bitcoin cash or horizon or a litecoin uh to determine whether or not you would also file form tens for those well so i think some of the most meaningful updates around some of the other grayscale products are uh one the grayscale bitcoin cash trust as well as the grayscale litecoin trust um both of those products have now satisfied the obligations to become publicly traded and so both of those products were recently assigned ticker symbols and are now just awaiting their dtc eligibility before they'll begin trading um and i'm also happy to share that grayscale is not going to stop at the 10 products we have today um we're working on and always maintaining a list of other products that we'd like to bring to market and i think for us again it's towing that line between where we see opportunities and where investors are telling us they want to deploy capital but there are some pretty fundamental things that we're always looking at that can help us screen in or screen out products or rather digital currencies as to whether or not we could create products for them and so we're thinking of things like is there a transparent market that we can access around the digital asset is it possible for us to create a reliable reference rate for the product is there a sound custodial solution for the product those types of real implications are very very meaningful um to us continuing to you know utilize the best service providers we can and really structure these products in a way that that works for investors and when you said earlier that the bitcoin cash and litecoin investment vehicles will be publicly tradable is that on the over-the-counter market like gptc it is yeah it'll be on the over-the-counter market so now um with the additions of the bitcoin cash and litecoin products now six out of the 10 grayscale products will be on the public market which is really really exciting and something i know the team is very very proud of and so we've really only talked about your single digital asset products but what about your diversified kind of index type products what is the interest in that and where do you think um when investors expressed interest in that where does that come from like why are they interested in that as opposed to a single asset so we have one diversified offering and it's called the greyscale digital large cap fund this fund was created a few years ago and it was really meant to meet the demand of investors telling us we'd like to invest in digital currency maybe we missed bitcoin and we should invest in ethereum or you know i don't know how to pick winners and avoid losers and if there was a product that i could make a singular investment in and it would give me broad-based exposure well then that would be something really attractive and so grayscale digital large cap was created to satisfy that and it has as its holdings the assets which constitute the upper 70 of the crypto market and it holds them on a market cap weighted basis so today that's five assets that includes bitcoin bitcoin cash ethereum litecoin and xrp and the constituents inside the product get re-evaluated every quarter so we'll be able to screen in or screen out certain assets from being included in that basket the digital large cap fund began its public quotation late last year under symbol gdlc uh grayscale digital large cap and the pickup has been tremendous um there are a lot of investors now who yes still may be interested in bitcoin or maybe inserting ethereum you know some of those better known digital currency networks but we're now facing more end investors that we would consume more as allocators um those types of investors that want to make a more broad-based um investment in the space versus picking individual currencies around which to have exposure and so we're really excited about the digital large cap fund and um really happy with the the investor reception around it you've been with grayscale from the beginning when interest in cryptocurrency was much smaller i think you joined in january 2014 and now here you are grayscale has more than 5 billion in assets under management how does it feel to have come this far well i will say that it is a team effort uh when i joined uh we just had about 60 million dollars of the assets under management um in just the the grayscale bitcoin trust and so to be a part of building out the team and building the business um as a group we've really come together as a group of smart forward-thinking hard-working individuals and you know now speaking to you tonight we you know we have five and a half billion dollars of assets across the family of ten products and so um i think i could have never imagined the growth um would be at the pace that it's been or that digital currency um would move as fast as it has but you've been in the space a long time too and i'm sure you'll agree that you know a week in the digital currency world is like you know three months in the real world so i'm a little tired but um i can happily say that the team at greyscale is just getting started great well congratulations on your record quarter and thank you so much for coming on unconfirmed thanks for having me don't forget next up is the weekly news recap [Music] hi everyone thanks

swindled for 50 or 100 dollars he later got involved in cryptocurrencies and joined an online forum called og users where he described himself as quote a full-time crypto trader dropout but he was later banned by the community after failing to pay bitcoin to a user from og users he entered a hacker community that focused on sim swapping people's phone numbers so as to get access to steal their

recovered 100 of his bitcoins additionally the blog reports that clark currently has 300 btc worth 3.5 million dollars a friend of clarks said that the run-in with the secret service frightened him but within two weeks according to the government affidavit he convinced a twitter employee that he worked in the social media company's i.t department and from there the hack began next headline square's cash app bitcoin sales more than doubled to 875 million dollars in the second quarter of 2020 the square cash app saw a revenue of what 875 million dollars which because it's based on the

nimbus lodestar and lighthouse if you're looking for a good overview of the state of ethereum today delphi digital released the first of its monthly reports on ethereum going over pretty much every major issue on the network including everything from whether ethereum's proof of stake system can compete with yield and defy to the details of ethereum improvement proposal 1559 the report shows how defy is leading ethereum's momentum gives an analysis of demand for gray skills ethereum investment trust and breaks down the various attractions of defy in areas such as decentralized exchanges yield farming as a token distribution mechanism and what the growth of bitcoin on ethereum means for the security of the bitcoin blockchain one of the more interesting charts shows that 58 of ether has not moved in over a year another shows that d5 protocols that introduce liquidity mining saw fast growth amongst users although uniswap which currently does not have a token still has the most users overall next headline ethereum spot and future volumes are growing faster than bitcoins the block reports that bitcoin's market cap is roughly five times out of ethereum however trading volumes for ether in the spot and futures market is rising faster since september 2019 on the spot markets the eth btc price ratio has more than doubled and the trading volume of ether is about half of that of btc whereas in september it was at 19 the ratio of e futures trading volume to btc futures trading volume has increased from eight percent in september to 29 today next headline two 51 percent attacks on ethereum classic the first nets the attacker 5.6 million dollars after several days what was initially thought to be an innocent mistake on ethereum classic turned out to be a 51 attack by a malicious miner in the end the attacker double spent 807 260 etc which is worth 5.6 million dollars while spending just 17.5 btc worth slightly less than 200 000 to execute it the way this person carried it out was by sending etc from an exchange to his or her own wallets then back to the exchange on the etc blockchain but then the attacker used what amounted to more than 51 percent of the etc hash power to mine thousands of blocks in which he or she he or she sent etc from those wallets to other wallets that he or she controlled instead of back to the exchange the attacker then broadcasts those blocks which reorganize the chain replacing the blocks containing the traction the transactions to the exchange with the transactions to the other wallets it seems that okay x may have been the exchange that was targeted and if that isn't crazy enough on thursday ethereum classic experienced a second 51 attack with a reorganization of more than 4 000 blocks coindesk reported that the majority of ethereum classic miners are continuing to mine the shorter version of the chain though the reorganized blockchain is currently longer next headline four house members ask irs to not tax proof of stake block rewards four members of the congressional blockchain caucus wrote a letter to the internal revenue service requesting that stakers not get taxed for receiving block rewards but only on their gains when they sell representatives david schweiker of arizona bill foster of illinois tom emera of minnesota and darren sota of florida wrote it is possible that the taxation of staking rewards as income may overstate taxpayers actual gains from participating in this new technology it could also result in a reporting and compliance nightmare for taxpayers and the service alike one of the concerns is that staking protocols could release new tokens every few minutes which would create hundreds of taxable events every year another is that gains do not always reflect income because an individual stakers tokens may increase by six percent but that may be because the supply of tokens on the network has increased five percent coin center advocates that block rewards not be taxed as income but quote like crops minerals livestock artwork and assembly widgets they should be taxed when they are sold not when they are created the advocacy group says validating on a proof of stake blockchain isn't like being paid revenue but instead like creating a valuable item through labor the way one might quote grow valuable crops on one's own land or extract minerals from one's own minds next headline this is a roundup of defy hacks scams and blunders some users of defy options issuance platform open lost 371 000 usdc due to an exploit on its eth put contracts the

reported that zhong chan jiang shut down the tokens website and social media accounts the asuka token plummeted from sixteen hundred dollars to nineteen dollars next why vaults a new product put out by wyon was a bit luckier when trailer bits caught a bug before any exploit occurred that could have allowed an attacker to drain most if not all of the pool's why usdc assets meanwhile the block
