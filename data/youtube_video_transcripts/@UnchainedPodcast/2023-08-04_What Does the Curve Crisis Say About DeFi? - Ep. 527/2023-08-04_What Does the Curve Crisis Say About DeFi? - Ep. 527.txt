guest is Sam casmian founder of frax Finance welcome Sam hey Laura it's good to be with you this has been quite the week in defy it started with a pretty small hack of some so-called factory pools on curve what happened and how did the exploit work yeah so to kind of give some background here curve and kind of uniswap are probably thought of as like the most Blue Chip kind of protocols in all of D5 right in fact Brax uses curve extensively I'll kind of get into that in a little bit but one thing that set this kind of exploit apart was that it was a compiler level bug and so what that basically means is it was not something typical that you might see where someone who is writing the smart contracts you know forgot to check some condition or they you know used some kind of uh poor rounding situation or something like that the actual contract was coded properly it was you know it it had everything written properly the the curve core developers who are you know some of the most veteran and kind of OG in the space they know what they're doing um there's a specific type of you know thing called a re-entrancy bug which a lot of just libraries have re-entrancy guards that it basically allows basically make sure that essentially the token accounting for when you withdraw and deposit tokens is done properly and obviously for something like a amm pool right you want to make sure that swapping tokens lping tokens which means depositing two sides or one side of a token is done properly that was all coded fine so so just to be clear about this it was not someone forgot to do some kind of uh re-entrancy check it was the Viper compiler and so the Viper is a smart contract language that's written in Python so a lot of people probably know python if their developer everyone's heard of it before that compiles down to ethereum evm byte code most people write things in solidity so the solidity language has a compiler that compiles to bytecode all of Curves software is written in Python other you know big projects that use it as uh urine Finance but Viper is not as popular by a long shot obviously as solidity so the Viper Lang developers who write the compiler and make sure to app keep it well realistically don't have a lot of resources compared to kind of the solidity compiler right and this bug essentially for specific versions of Viper just to kind of simplify things down made it so even though if you write the correct code right you write you know ad re-entracy guard or lock the actual slot that checks the a balance of tokens one actually compiles it does not compile into that which is very very scary right you write the code as like a developer and then you compile it it does not actually do what it's written and and by compile it's sort of like taking the kind of human readable developer language into something that's like machine readable and can be executed is that sort of yeah exactly when you compile it you you compile it into op codes of the ethereum virtual machine executes right so and then that's basically what is running uh the evm on chain right like people execute transactions that basically run a bunch of op codes right and that's not human readable but they write code exactly as you said it's human readable so the the crazy thing is I think this was July 30th yeah and uh I was traveling so it was a little bit hectic basically I think it was the curve devs and uh some other guys they've they found the issue right and I think the pools that were affected were alchemic schools and a few other ones and they were trying to save them because anyone that could actually come and knew what was going on they could just drain all the money from the pools because the accounting wasn't right the way that it was compiled you can just basically for example uh send one token take two out something like that right and um I think the the issue at hand was they weren't fast enough to actually do it before the attacker or attackers managed to actually hit some of these pools I believe some of the funds were returned by a different addresses that were able to essentially white hat and remove the uh the value there right and what's uh what's important to note is only specific versions of a viper that were used in some of these contracts as you said the factory pools of a specific version of a factory deployer were vulnerable so none of the you know um the the frax pools or other pools or even the the pools that have us SD stable coins were affected the the type of contract that was affected was one that had eth in it the actual L1 token of the ethereum blockchain because the way that it actually checks for entrancy is slightly different than erc20 tokens and that was where the actual compiler level bug was and so that that was kind of what started the whole thing is to say that said about the security of defy generally you know we had these multiple protocols that were hit I think it was about more than 50 million that had been stolen um interestingly it wasn't even just that white hats rescued some of the money but Mev bot operators also stepped in to kind of take money from the hackers as this was going on um but what would you say you know this does about defy yeah I mean what's uh kind of crazy right is that it was obvious there was just value there obviously it was value that was uh not supposed to be leaked in in that way so there was a lot of both Mev happening as well as just people racing to save or other people raising the racing to steal value and stuff like that but overall I think the the main thing here is that we've never seen at least I haven't seen and I've been in kind of the ethereum web 3 space for a really long time a major compiler level bug which means that the code was written correctly uh it was just not compiled correctly that is different than 99 of uh issues that you might see where value gets stolen whether it's anything right whether it's for example a bridge hack right where like the the actual solidity code you know didn't check something properly like the person writing it forgot to check something or like the classical stuff um you know like the Ronin Bridge hack right where the the keys from some employee or something you know that was running the bridge were compromised from some phishing attack or something like that or they got access to their servers that validated transactions or whatever this was much more different I think this is just a different class of vulnerability and into different situations so obviously I think there's a lot of you know people shocked about it but thankfully it didn't basically empty all of all of Curves uh tvl and not all of the pools are or were vulnerable and I think obviously the thing afterwards that I think you might uh possibly ask you yeah that's my next question ensuing uh situation in terms of the value of the CRV token how this affects tvl and just the overall defy landscape right and because the hack was kind of the Prelude to some stuff like that but let's talk about that function with the fact fact that Kerr founder Michael igorov had taken out really large loans on Ave on Fox there I mean this just generally created this issue that he might get liquidated once the price of curve started dropping so talk a little bit about you know how all that yeah for sure and and so one thing uh I I want to point out before all of this hacking stuff which is where we started and stuff is the the loans themselves were taken out uh a long time ago so basically Michael igorov which I I think is probably one of the smartest people in the entire space a very long-term oriented he's actually I think embodies a lot of the ethos of what people think in in terms of what Founders should be like for example I try to spend for example all all the time in the community on telegram channels on Twitter answering everything I can I'm actually in the uh our telegram which is the Main Place everyone asks questions and I'm right there both working on on the protocol design code everything as well as just always conversing with you know the the Greater frax Community Michael is exactly the same way he's a developer he writes the code he designs stuff he wrote the original curve uh white paper he's also arguably one of the few people that I would say is as active as I am and so I don't know when I kind of think about people who embody you know the the founder mentality in crypto right you think of stani from Ave you think of Robert leschner from compound think of Michael higra from curve um and I like to you know embody that as much as I can there's a lot of people that say for example oh like it's it's so refreshing Sam is always here and everyone can talk to him and stuff and I always think isn't that how it's always supposed to be but it seems like it's not right it seems like there's kind of a lot of the CEO mentality which is like you're kind of off in like your your own kind of higher place and then you have like Community managers or something that are supposed to take care of everything for you and I never really bought this I never thought about anything like that I always wanted to be part of the actual action on the ground floor both building talking being a part of everything right and so um I think Michael is exactly one of those guys like technical social and everything and it's kind of the Prelude to this obviously was he did not want to sell his CRV tokens right he took large loans on Ave fraxland as well which is a lending platform uh on frax finance and then also I think MIM uh Abracadabra and maybe a few other places that I might be forgetting and what's kind of extra painful here is a lot of the on-chain CRV token liquidity was on curve and it was against eth and like I said before the primary thing that was vulnerable and this compiler hack was uh eth token reentrancy the the token that if it's paired against ethereum itself and so part of the hack not only drained all of the liquidity on chain of of the CRV token it actually gave a large amount of CRV tokens to the exploiter address whoever the the hacker might be right and it also drained the liquidity so it's like almost a double whammy right the liquidity is gone and the the curve tokens now are in an address that presumably wants to dump them and and sell them for either something and try to get away right and so all in this chaos in this situation right you have these loans that before the exploit might have been a little bit eyebrow raising I know there was a lot of kind of a few Ave threads on their governance form and things like that that talked about oh is this too big of a loan is it all right you know should we change the parameters and stuff but nothing uh brutal right nothing like holy crap this is this is like an implosion waiting to happen right but then precipitated with this you know extraordinary situation the liquidity is gone it was drained the the curve tokens not only is it liquidagon but now what the curve tokens are in some unknown entities hands all right presumably very malicious entities hands right and so this became very critical and different lending protocols work slightly differently so one of the things with fraxland that we designed that's very unique to prax lens system is that instead of the protocol having some fixed interest rate based on how much utilization is used in in a lending pool it also is time dependent as well so for example if the utilization is above 85 percent for example if that's the equation then every 12 hours or every Half-Life is what it's called the interest rate will double or it'll 1.5 x uh or it'll you know 2.5 x or whatever and and the idea behind that is the interest rates Dynamic and it'll fluctuate based on time so that it's reactive both the borrower will think okay this is too much interest I'm going to repay some of the loans or uh lenders will see oh wow I get a lot of interest for for depositing and being a lender here right it's not like Ave or compound or other places where some of them have fixed interest rates and others have linear interest rates on uh so like for example if 90 of the assets are utilized it's like a six percent interest rate and it doesn't Double 12 24 48 you know and and fraxland is different in that way and so what happened was obviously as this situation basically kind of spun out of control everyone there was a lender in the CRV fracs blend pair they rush to grab their frax stable coins they didn't want to lend in this situation right they didn't want potentially there to be a liquidation of CRV that wasn't enough to buy back enough of the the dollar for expect stablecoin and so what does that do that starts doubling the interest rate of uh the CRV borrowers predominantly Michael uh every 12 hours right so it started out as a yeah relatively like at 10 and I think it got to like 20 30. and every hour goes up right because every 12 hours it has to double so everyone was just kind of refreshing the page you know it was uh 60 70 80. I think it got over to like 120 or something percent at it at the peak or obviously some good things happened wow so in a moment we're going to talk about how this all got resolved but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible overtime markets is your Premier web 3 sports book overtime is an industry-leading web 3 protocol where users can immerse themselves in the thrilling World of Sports leveraging the benefits of decentralization and blockchain Technology overtime leads the charge in Innovation all the while offering fans juicy token rewards for sports events overtime supports over 40 leagues and utilizes Advanced smart contracts to ensure a seamless user experience discover the future of sports trading at overtimemarkets.xyz ever wanted to use D5 without being tracked railgun is the leading D5 privacy Solution on ethereum it's available on BSC arbitrum and polygon 2.

layer 3 or an orbit chain Propel your project and Community forward by visiting arbitrim.io today back to my conversation with Sam so what was the resolution to this situation well so far the the resolution uh was that obviously Michael had to repay some of the the debt right on fraxland at least in other places too but predominantly the the time sensitive one was for excellent and so which you might have noticed there was a large uh OTC deal right over the counter for Michael selling some of his CRV tokens to predominant people in in the space like Justin Sun like Machi I believe c2tp the founder of convex also bought some and and a few uh others I believe today was also said that the CEO of Ryobi uh Hobie exchange also bought some I'm not sure but I'm trying to keep up with it um and then the a lot of the debt was was paid down so that the utilization rate on the fraxland pair was not something so high that it would double in fact the opposite happens where it slowly halves instead because it's it's a mere image the equation so actually now the interest rate is going down which is very manageable right obviously the entire situation is a little bit concerning right because I think Ave uh is also thinking about what what they can do overall I just want to also say for example these loans obviously weren't were not like something that was like nefarious it's just that this unexpected absolutely crazy situation with the compiler bug and Viper basically not only shook confidence and curve and also the CRV token obviously it also took away the liquidity of the CRV token on chain and gave an unknown entity a bunch of CRV tokens of the entity that drained the pool right so it was almost like a triple quadruple whammy all all on top of each other and that's really unfortunate so what does it say that a large part of the solution here was these OTC deals like what does it say about defy or do you not you know agree with how I just you know phrase that I mean yeah so I'm sure a lot of people feel this way and uh personally um I obviously as like like a founder and stuff I feel I understand both sides I feel slightly differently and the reason for that is as as a Founder I I always have this Viewpoint that you know it's it's always the Founder's role to take things and and like all the all the bad stuff that happens is is kind of the responsibility of the founder and all the good stuff that happens is everyone else and belongs to the community and that sounds really unfair but it's almost kind of like I'm not religious or anything but it's almost kind of like a Christian like a like a Jesus way of thinking about it or it's your responsibility to kind of suffer the consequences if you're a Founder but if you succeed it belongs to the Token holders the community and just everything that kind of the the world has accomplished so to speak but all the bad stuff is kind of your fault and I actually think that that's just the territory with playing the role as like the creator of something and the the first thing is like I I think what would have happened otherwise right like first of all people would have said if he sold CRV tokens he's a scammer right and then he's just dumping on everyone If he if he takes out a bunch of big loans he's secretly just a scammer he wants to sell a bunch of CRV tokens if if uh he locks them and participates in governance he's a scammer taking control of the protocol right if he if you think about it there's just no way out of just being labeled as kind of the the bad person in in like a situation uh when when you're a founder and I don't even say that in terms of in a bitter way I just say that in terms of that's just the responsibility that's what you're signing up for right and so for example in this situation the loans were fine overall um obviously maybe some of the sizes were big but they were overall fine uh before this whole situation obviously no one thought what if a compiler level bug happens then then we're all in trouble right um and so I think that the fact that there's still a lot of OTC demand and a lot of people that want to participate in the curve ecosystem is actually a good thing to actually highlight and the fact that curve is one of the you know large backbones of D5 right I I think overall the situation will be fine obviously there's people that say well this proves like you're saying this proves that D5 doesn't work or this proves that there's just a bunch of stuff that has to happen behind the scenes for it to work and first of all uh I think that if the lending systems other than fraxland for example Incorporated more things like fraxland's Innovations like time dependent interest rates and and actually were more autonomous this whole thing would overall just kind of fix itself right it would oscillate to to the right kind of uh market system and a lot of it was just because for example MIM has fixed rate interest rates they have to just actually go in and change interest rates Ave has to vote on them per recommendations of like their I think it's gauntlets uh safety of reports and and these kinds of things I think D5 could just be a little bit more autonomous it would be better but I don't think there's anything wrong with a a Founder trying to you know take out some loans obviously there's a there's the meme that uh I think a lot of people were fixating on I think Michael had bought some large properties in Australia right and regardless of of what you do for forget about the specific thing like I said you're always the playing the role as the founder of it's it's your fault if something happens but if something good happens it's not really you can't use it as a defense when something bad happens you're always supposed to take kind of the the beating so to speak right and at least that's how I view it a lot of Founders think that's unfair a lot of people think well that's not right they're treating you wrongly or they're you know doing this or that I try to make sure my my own view is just it is what it is right but so going forward like what do you think the D5 Community will do differently to prevent this type of situation in the future and you know really what I'm talking about is two things it's the compiler level type bugs and then you know what happened with Michael's loan situation yeah the compiler stuff is just very scary because it basically makes it so that people for example don't wanna uh try any different kinds of things other than solidity um I I personally know code and Viper um I think over all the the Viper language will be stronger you know uh with more security Audits and more attention paid to it after the situation but um obviously that's a very tough question and and I'm not sure in terms of loans I think uh lending markets haven't had a lot of innovation to come to them and so for example fracks we're trying to do our part with braxland in terms of how everything works there everything is isolated there's new types of interest rates there's actually something called Dynamic debt restructuring which means there can't be bad debt everyone just it's gets socialized if there's a liquidation that doesn't cover everyone's debt so no one needs to run towards whatever's left and then kind of brick the pool for what's uh remaining for for everyone that doesn't act fast enough and I think that this kind of you know Innovation and just new features uh are very important to make make it so that this kind of stuff doesn't really happen again and I know there's a a lot of uh Oracle lists lending protocols and some of them you might have had on your show or uh other shows and these are supposed to be the new generation of D5 that's even more autonomous that doesn't actually require meeting on Zoom or putting a governance vote on on a forum to fix the you know the curve Founders loan situation and and like convening like a risk counselor or something like that right and so we kind of need more D5 stuff that's similar to uniswap right both in terms of the lending side and kind of the stable coin side where they're just autonomous and they work all right well this has been a really fascinating discussion I mean there's just so many issues we could have touched on because there I feel like there's even more stuff in there but um this was a really good primer thank you so much for explaining it all sure thanks for having me don't forget next episode Weekly News recap which this week will be presented by

plan the bankruptcy estate of crypto exchange FTX has unveiled a draft reorganization plan that includes a potential restart of the crypto exchange for non-us customers the plan proposes to categorize claimants into specific groups with offshore exchange users classified as.com customers and U.S users as U.S customers non-us users could potentially receive non-cash consideration in the form of equity or tokens in a new offshore exchange however the plan has been met with criticism from the official Committee of unsecured creditors they expressed disappointment and not being consulted on the plan saying that the proposal was more a collection of ideas than a concrete plant they have called for control of any post-reorganization company to be placed in the hands of qualified parties selected by the creditors the committee also criticized the high professional fees incurred during the bankruptcy process which have already exceeded 330 million dollars making it one of the most expensive corporate bankruptcies in history judge disagrees with ripple ruling in a significant development this week a U.S District Judge denied a motion to dismiss the case against terraform Labs brought by the SEC which alleges that tfl's crypto assets qualify as Securities judge Jed rakoff rejected terraform's argument that a recent decision in the sec's case against Ripple Labs invalidated the agency's case against them in his order judge rakoff disagreed with the Ripple decision stating that he declines to draw a distinction between tokens sold directly to an Institutional Investor and those sold through secondary Market transactions to a retail investor this stance contradicts the Ripple ruling where judge Annalisa Torres deemed that xrp sold to retail investors on exchanges did not qualify as Securities transactions Justin Browder a partner at Wilkie Farr and Gallagher commented on Twitter that judge rakoff's opinion in the terror case is quote far from a complete departure

promptly disposing of these frivolous claims end quote and one last fun bit for you A New York Times report revealed that besieged U.S congressman George Santos used his political connections to promote an alleged crypto scam it's better if you hear it from comedian Ginny Hogan there's some sort of law in physics that all things that are inevitable must come to pass and everything that must be will one day be all of which is to say yes of course George Santos is now involved in a crypto Scandal a campaign donor told the New York Times that Santa sent two others tried a Nigerian prince type scam on him they approached him saying that there was a wealthy polish citizen who wanted to buy crypto but couldn't because his assets were frozen and then asked this donor to start an LLC to gain access to the funds and Santos's defense the intersection of the Venn diagram of people whose assets are frozen and people who want to buy crypto is pretty big the donor didn't go through with it but I do believe his story because it's honestly really really really really vulnerable to admit that you donated to George Santos you wouldn't just make something like that up I don't understand why George Santos can't just get into insider trading like a normal politician at least then he'd still be welcome in the Hamptons but honestly I've always believed that if George Santos wants people to believe he's innocent he should just say he's guilty and that is a wrap thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about the stories mentioned here check out the show notes for this episode if
