lee jin and jesse walden co-founders and general partners at varian fund welcome lee and jesse thanks so much for having us laura it's great to be here yeah thanks for having us variant's tagline is a first check crypto fund investing in the ownership economy can you each talk about your background before crypto and how that led you to occupy this particular niche in crypto and when we start with lee sure um so i guess where to begin um the high level is that i've been a consumer investor for a number of years um i started in consumer investing in 2016. before that i used to be an operator working as a product manager in silicon valley but essentially since 2016 i've been full-time in venture um investing in consumer platforms marketplaces social networks etc so that's the high level and the through line of that entire experience has been really focusing on using technology as a tool to increase access and opportunity for people so when i was working on marketplace investing i think marketplaces are this really powerful democratizing force for work and dollars like it doesn't matter where you're from or who who you know as long as you can join one of these platforms you can connect to end consumers and so that's been really the theme of my investing over the past few years i started my investing journey at e16z which is where jesse and i overlapped for a number of years and that's also where i started investing against the thesis of the passion economy which is the idea that new marketplaces and platforms would arise that would help people earn income independently on the internet and as i invested in a lot of those businesses including sub stack and patreon um and many others i realized that there was a further step that we could go in terms of enabling that vision of allowing people to in earn income freely on the internet and that was through actual user ownership of the platforms themselves so naturally i began to invest more in web 3 platforms found myself crossing paths a lot with jesse when we were investing independently throughout 2020 we co-led a number of deals when i started atelier ventures and he had started variant and then ultimately decided that our two theses of the passion economy and the ownership economy were really two sides of the same coin and that by joining forces we could be a much stronger team for really backing these types of platforms that we're giving people an opportunity to achieve financial freedom on the internet and jessie what about your background sure yeah so yeah i'm i got into investing by by way of building a startup and in this space back in 2014 i co-founded a project called media chain labs and what we were doing back then was you know trying to do what bitcoin had done for digital assets which is make them ownable independent of any third party um we wanted to do the same for a different kind of digital asset instead of a financial asset we were focused on digital media assets like images videos and songs and so today that those ideas have been realized by nfts back then you know ethereum didn't exist the idea that you could easily create tokens that represent all kinds of different uh assets including media was was not a widely distributed idea but it was one we were exploring about seven years too early and that was sort of the era of enterprise blockchains um or blockchain not bitcoin was sort of the narrative at the time it's not the narrative that we believed we were building for developers like the developers who were you know working on nfts today but all the interest was coming from big companies one of them was spotify they ended up acquiring media chain labs and i led blockchain r d there briefly before joining andreessen horowitz or as we mentioned we we overlapped i was on the crypto team um and helped to launch the first crypto fund there and um at at that time there was very little overlap between the crypto and consumer team because you know 2018 really until 2020 most of what was happening and crypto was developer facing it was sort of an infrastructure build out phase and so i was i was focused on that um and and i'll similarly focus on a developer platform with my startup but that sort of afforded me the privilege to to sort of understand what it is that developers were doing in the space or nights and weekends and and what i started to sort of zero in on was the fact that they were able these developers were building networks that they actually owned in exchange for their contributions and of course you know bitcoin and ethereum are the best examples of this where they are multi-billion dollar networks built by you know developers and technologists who contributed to the code base and ran that code on machines all over the world and then in return earned the network's native asset a bitcoin or an ethereum for those contributions and you know chris dixon who is my partner and andreessen has this great saying that what developers and technologists do nights and weekends is what the rest of us will do in 10 years and so i started to to you know play out that scenario where you know what what does it look like for consumers to own and operate the platforms and that they use every day and that was the spark for the ownership economy thesis that we mentioned and that we invest against here at variant and so during that period where you guys were kind of focused on different areas but then you gradually began to realize you were working kind of on different sides of the same coin like tell me a little bit more about that process about how you realize that like what were some of the either like key investments that made you realize that or like how did that transition come about yeah i can speak to it from my perspective i think it's it's very interesting because i've had a number of conversations with lots of people about how they got into crypto and i think the common theme is that there's no like there's no singular aha moment instead it's a number of different realizations and introspections over probably like a number of different years that brings people into crypto and for me it was no different where as i mentioned ever since 2016 and basically for my entire career i've been focused on technology as a tool to expand access and i was approaching that from lots of different angles initially when i started investing in 2016 the trend at the time was to was to build uber for x type of marketplaces like uber for grocery delivery uber for dry cleaning there was a whole wave of new marketplaces that were trying to foster new jobs but in an on-demand very accessible easy to use from the consumer side perspective and so over the years i i had a number of realizations that gradually led me to where i am today i would say that the the thesis of the passion economy as mentioned was really rooted in how do we enable people to not just do really rote task based gig work but to actually allow themselves to express their individuality leverage their creative skills leverage their intellect and education in order to make money on the internet and i wasn't prescriptive about the underlying technology that was needed to to do that and so as i started investing against that thesis i started to see web3 companies that were using crypto to enable that vision um so for instance one of the first deals that we co-led together was actually mirror which is the crypto based creative platform that enables people to publish on the internet and also do crowdfunding and a number of other interesting monetization mechanisms and then and then i just continue to do more along those lines i invested in foundation and then um syndicate protocol and a number of other web 3 projects that were helping to realize the vision and the mission that i had and i gradually had this realization that this is actually a very dynamic area of technology where people were not just earning income but they were actually earning ownership in the underlying platforms and that was so much more powerful for each of the participants than the former case where they were just earning income i would say another big moment in in my journey was a course that i taught in early 2020 i developed um designed and taught this cohort based course for social media creators to help them learn how to become angel investors i had this theory that some of the best investors of our generation were going to be content creators who had big audiences online and could represent built-in distribution for the startups that they were backing and i also knew that these creators contributed a ton of the value to these companies yet we're seeing very little of it in return because they weren't owners of of the actual company and so i wanted to bridge that gap and bring them into my network teach them how to invest teach them what to look for you know how to parse consumer metrics and all of that and the course was such an eye-opening experience for me because i realized that most of these creators were actually not accredited investors even though they had big social media followings their financial status actually lagged behind their social capital which was really interesting they struggled to translate their social capital into financial capital so a lot of them were not accredited and couldn't actually legally invest in these businesses and then if they were accredited they were investing maybe one thousand dollars two thousand dollars something really small and not getting as much ownership as i felt was fair in these platforms they had to you know do an outlay of capital that they were really short on in order to become investors at all um so i felt like that dynamic was just inherently quite broken and i felt like it was there were all these bottlenecks to them being able to participate in the ownership of these platforms and so that that naturally then led me to explore well what are the other ways that we can actually make creators and participants of these platforms owners and obviously tokens are represent one such tool and when you say that their social capital um was you know far ahead of their financial capital was that because of the platforms that like the platforms weren't compensating them enough or like what what was the issue there yeah it was a mix of everything so i would say like the status quo on a lot of these social media platforms is that the platforms don't compensate the creators directly uh youtube might be the only one that does any sort of revenue sharing with its creators the other platforms the the dominant model as a creator is really to go outside of the platform and to seek revenue yourself whether that's from brands or sponsors or from your fans directly like setting up a patreon page in most cases these creators weren't being paid from the platforms i would say that the second issue is that today like in like our accredited investor regulations are really predicated on the stability of income and so a lot of these creators they had shot to fame relatively quickly and they were earning a lot in the moment but they didn't have necessarily two years of history of earnings at that point in time tick tock had been around in the us for maybe two years total and so a lot of these creators who are really famous just didn't have the history of earnings that is needed in order to be accredited well and jesse do you want to talk a little bit also um about like well i have to just call out a tweet that uh you tweeted that i found fascinating which was you said music is the most criminally undervalued and under monetized media type relative to its consumption which definitely seemed very spot on and i wondered if you could talk a little bit about the problems that you saw in the music industry and how you think that the ownership economy slash web 3 can solve them sure um well yeah so the the part i didn't mention about my background at the outset is before i got started in crypto but as a founder i was working in the music industry as an artist manager and um i so i was founder of this this management company was called cool managers we we used to wrap um artists like solange knowles who's beyonce's sister blood orange magical clouds and and the goal of that management company was to help those artists use technology platforms which were emerging around the time this was sort of like you know 2010 or so so instagram and you know facebook were sort of just well instagram was just coming on the scene at that point the goal was to help the artists use those platforms to reach their fans directly and run their business independent of sort of the major label infrastructure that was you know more traditionally leveraged by musicians and you know so that um whole experience was illuminating because it on the one hand had a lot of promise right it seemed like we would get out from under the thumb of the major labels there's there's three major labels they determine how you know prior to the internet determine how music got distributed how it was monetized what the what the artist deals look like and artists didn't have a lot of choice so the promise was the platforms were gonna sort of disintermediate that and they did to a large degree but they also became the new intermediaries and you know to the points lee was just speaking to you know they became the sort of blockers for artists to reach their audience monetize and it was around the same time that i first learned about bitcoin i you know i had no background in finance so the idea that there was this you know digital store of value this financial asset was was cool to me as a technologist but i wasn't that interested in the sort of you know global macro implications of that at the time what was interesting to me was um that bitcoin as a protocol was very similar to a lot of peer-to-peer protocols that came before it like bittorrent and you know ftp and you know the way i got into music in the first place is through piracy um you know as a teenager in the early 2000s i was using those peer-to-peer protocols to pirate all the you know all the world's music and that's how i became such a huge music fan in the first place and so when i read the bitcoin white paper and realized this is very similar to bittorrent in a lot of ways it's a peer-to-peer protocol it immediately clicked that there was one thing that was different about it and and that was really important and that was bitcoin as a protocol has this identity and attribution system built into it such that you know that you know laura's bitcoin is in fact laura's and when she sends me one i have one more and she has one less and that kind of attribution system was fundamentally missing from bittorrent where you didn't know who created any of the files in the network you were just downloading stuff that was out there there was no identity for any of the purchases no no means to communicate with other participants in protocol and bitcoin changed that you you you didn't know their real name but you knew you know whose bitcoin belonged to whom and i thought cool what if you could take that primitive and apply it to a different kind of asset apply it to you know a digital media asset you could know who the creator was and then that creator could monetize their work directly without having to depend on the platform to intermediate that relationship so so that was sort of the straight line from artist management to to getting involved in crypto world and it was the spark for my startup and and then that idea just started to snowball i started to realize we're you know we're all creators online everyone who posts content to social media is is creating something of value to the platform it's not just musicians and you know artists in the traditional sense we're all creators but there's never been a way for you know every everyone with an internet connection to sort of participate in the value they're creating for these platforms and that's to do with a lot of the reasons we touched on but but also the fact that you know the the concepts of like employee stock options for example which is one way that ownership of these platforms is distributed to contributors those those like stock options are limited to people who can work you know for for the company based in the us who have the means to you know parcel legal documents and you know and then sort of receive those shares and then waiters and execute them on the soccer chains a very cumbersome system it's very costly to maintain and it doesn't scale to everyone on the internet so as i got further and further into the crypto world i realized tokens are this internet native way of distributing value it's it's akin to the way internet the internet protocol itself turned all the world's information into packets tokens are a way to turn all the world's value in into an internet native vehicle that can move just like packets instantly to anyone anywhere in the world and it's starting to click for me this is how we distribute the ownership value of these platforms to anyone with an internet connection who's able to participate and that that was sort of the spark for for our thesis and and sort of you know my motivation in the space and it's very much aligned with you know where i started my professional career which is trying to help creators capture more of the value that they create so we'll definitely talk more about how these different crypto networks uh enable these user owners but let's also first just touch on nfts which it to my mind and you can you know agree or disagree um are maybe the first building block of this ownership economy and last year obviously was kind of the first full year i guess i would say of like real traction with nfts and actually so at the time that we're recording the month of january hasn't quite finished yet so i'm not sure where we'll end up but already it looks to me like openc is going to surpass six billion dollars in trading which is by far its highest volume month ever so let's just talk a little bit about like where you think nfts are going and then what stage of this cycle we are right now in their development sure i'll start with the second question which is you know i think we're very very early in in where this is going that's that's because i i believe and i published an essay about this in early 2021 um i believe nfts are going to be the sort of default port of entry for every single piece of media on the internet it's just it's it's that sort of natural tendency of what this technology wants which is you know it nft is a metaphor i've used to describe what they are in very simple terms it's sort of like taking a file and uploading it to the blockchain that's that's technically incorrect but it's it's a good sort of metaphor to just you know talk about extra abstractly what we're doing by uploading a file to the blockchain you make it sort of tamper proof and you make it ownable like just like you can on a bitcoin or own an ethereum you can own a non-fungible token an nft that corresponds to you know any kind of file any piece of media that you want attributed and ownable and the benefit of doing this is you can make money from uh selling it selling ownership just like you can make money from from selling you know personal item or house or any piece of property that you own in the physical world so you know that's what's pulling creators towards nfts is historically they haven't been able to do that you can't sell you know a jpeg on facebook but now you can you can monetize your media directly um by selling it to a fan and it's more than just sort of you know patronage and you know which is something that's kind of familiar in web too it's um it's a model that i call patronage plus which is you know a fan of your work can support you by buying it from you but they they too can also benefit from the possible appreciation of value of that work by reselling it in the future and that that's a function of um you know a property rights system that is internet native um and it's a function of the traditional art market too right it's if you have property rights collector can can buy an artist's work when they like and if that that artist goes on to become world famous that collector can resell it at a profit and the possibility of being able to profit from your work is um a really great incentive to become a patron in the first place so so my view is you know that that's another reason nfts you know will become a port of entry because the collectors the by side of the market it's better for them too and thirdly it's it's better for developers than legacy models be for for an important reason if for example if you if you were a developer and you built on top of sort of legacy social media platform like facebook or instagram you know on top of their apis and you built something of value there was a very good chance that facebook would say wait a minute you you can't capture the value of the thing that you made that's awesome we need to capture it and we're going to shut off your api access and we can do that because we're facebook but the thing about these um these files on the blockchain is nobody can shut off the blockchain so developers can continue to build new experiences around this media that's getting uploaded to the chain i like to think of it as sort of like a universal media library that's that's what we used to call the startup i was building media changes that our goal was to build a universal media library where all the world's media would be openly accessible for anyone to consume just like you know it isn't in web 2 you can find any image and any song out there on the internet but critically developers could build on top of this media library and sort of extend it create new experiences for us to you know to consume media to remix it and and nobody would be able to stop them from doing it just like no one can can turn off the bitcoin or ethereum network so for all those reasons that that you know creators collectors developers can all sort of make more money and innovate permissionlessly in this new environment i think you know nfts will like become the port of entry for every single piece of media on on on the internet so that's that's where we're going in and i should out the last thing i'll say is you know i've been talking about media in a very sort of traditional way images video songs i think there's also going to be sort of another dimension to this which is these aren't just images videos songs they're programmable assets so they're more than just the the media itself you can program them to do things like share revenue that is you know between two creators that collaborate that can be programmed into the asset itself you can program um a piece of artwork that's responsive to whom has collected it because it can be aware of that and so i think there will also be sort of net new media types created on on this new platform or you know or the medium is sort of the message and that's really exciting and we're in the very early innings of that and i did want to ask you actually because um and i don't know if this is what you mean when you say like nfts will be the port of entry but i know that you've said like in other interviews that you think every photo somebody makes on their iphone will be introduced to the world as an nft and i was just thinking you know obviously like my friends and i or my family and i like will share photos all the time so are you saying that every time i create one of these i'm gonna make it as an nft because i don't know who's gonna buy that or is it just i'll give the nft to like you know my mom or my my friend or whatever like like yeah i was i was kind of skeptical of 100 of all i was a little bit like really yeah so okay so first it's important to distinguish that you know the photo like the jpeg it still exists and you can still like text it to your friends and your family and whatever like the jpeg it can be infinitely reproduced just like you know today you don't think twice about you know copy pasting it into another message sending it but that that can be true and it can all simultaneously be true that that original photo the the the as soon as you take it it's registered on the blockchain and and that registration says larson took this photo on this date and it's hers and that's what is you know what's actually uploaded to the blockchain when i when i say you know uh nfts or files on the blockchain it's not that the image itself is going onto the chain rather it's the registration that this is yours you created it and you're saying this is this is this is the you know canonical representation of this idea so like to make this more concrete it's helpful to think of like the mona lisa where you know the mona lisa has been infinitely reproduced all over the world um it's on postcards t-shirts and then there's the canonical mona lisa the one that's hanging in the louvre right and that's the one that's valuable owning the mona lisa you can't really put a price on it um it's not for sale as far as i know but you can imagine it'd be extremely valuable if it went to auction in spite of the fact that it's reproduced everywhere and and i think you could even extend that argument to say that the more something is reproduced the more value in owning the original and that's why you know jpegs being copy pasted and shared all over the internet is compatible with the idea that you can own the original one that laura signed in the corner and said this is this is mine and and that's you know the distinction of why i think you know every image will ultimately be registered this way it's an option on it becoming valuable what if your photo goes viral becomes a huge meme that someone wants to own you should have the option to monetize that and you should have that as a default okay and then because obviously i'm literally thinking about the exact photos that i take and i'm a little bit like i definitely wouldn't want all of this registered on the blockchain but so i was just wondering would it be like default private where like if later on i wanted it you know because like i can't imagine the data is just going to be public right because it just makes me think of yeah like tor bear's secret network where he was like blockchains will eventually be default private and so when you were talking about that i was like uh well hopefully if if all my photos end up on the blockchain i would like them to be all private yeah so so yes i i think you will have like options here for sure i think as we go look right as it seems today like if you look at on chain at the data that you know associated with an nft what's actually there is a a representation of the image but not the image itself it's a hash of the image so the hash is derived from the zeros and ones of the image file if you change one pixel you get a different hash so that that's how you can you know sort of authenticate you know is this nft does it correspond with with this image or this idea um it's based on the zeros and ones in the data but it's not the image itself so there's one layer of sort of abstraction there but in the future i think there will be totally private ways to prove um that this was your file without revealing anything about the file itself not even its fingerprint or hash so so that that's like there's this whole exciting field of zero knowledge proofs that will allow you to make these sort of claims without revealing any any private data and i think that will become a big part of nft world for sure and again one i feel badly because we're talking about images video songs but so much of the innovation happening in nfts is is again it's like around game assets and like new kinds of you know collectible you know worlds that that people are building where there's these character universes like you know kind of like pokemon but where um you know there's this like internet scale collector base and people contributing to develop the story for that character universe not as opposed to some studio so there's lots of like net new things enabled it's not just like buying and selling art it's it's a it's a brand new medium for expression and monitor you know monetizing that expression and so it's much much bigger than you know sotheby's or whatever can i just add something here by the way yeah i so i totally agree with everything that jesse mentioned and the fact that i think we're very much in the early days of the development of what we'll see nfts eventually get used for i think like backing up from the specifics i think it's helpful to think of nfts as the first instance in which we could actually own digital goods digital goods that have ownership and verifiable scarcity and why that's important to frame it as digital goods is because we are surrounded by physical goods in the real world that are also non-fungible like everything in this room everything around us like what i'm wearing these are all physical goods that i also own and so from a user perspective that analogy is important because then you can think of like well what are all the possible digital goods that people might want to own online in the future with nfts and you can decompose on the consumer side the rationale for why people desire ownership there's a bunch of reasons why we just why we want to own things offline that also translate to online so in the real world the reasons why we want to buy things and own them is for investment like we buy things because we think the price will go up buy things for status like buying something showcases something about me to everyone else who can see that i own this thing um another reason why we buy things is for community like having a thing gets me access to this group of like-minded people like having a tesla automatically enters me into a community of people who also love tesla and then i think the biggest reason why people own things offline is for utility like we consume goods because they actually bring value to our lives they do certain jobs in the clay christians and framework there's a job to be done for every object that we surround ourselves with and transposing that to the online world of nfts i think we're still really early because the types of consumer motivations that nfts tap into are still really scratching the surface of those different rationales where today nft purchases are very much driven i think a lot of the market is driven by investment and by status and less so driven by community or utility there's almost like very there's very little utility with nfts today but utility is the main driver of why we purchase goods offline and so it's natural to envision that in the future we're also going to buy digital goods for the utility that they bring us in all of these different applications and online worlds that we spend a lot of time in yeah yeah that's such a good point and it goes to you know what jesse was saying about the gaming because obviously like with actually infinity certain of the axes are like better than others or things like that or well i mean ens ethereum name service domain names are like an obvious example or these like token gated discords are another example where you know you need those nfts in order to gain membership to this club but so we're going to talk a little bit more about the different types

actually before we go into some of the kind of like different variations and and also frankly into more of a discussion around than how the nature of work will change i did want to make sure to touch on music nfts a little bit more um jessie i you know have i obviously have you know asked you about your background here and i've just been hearing from so many people that they feel like this is the year that a music nfts will take off because for in the last several months at least jpeg has been like another word for nft and i'm like well it's not only that um so what's yeah a conception of like what music nfts will be and what they'll look like yeah i'm realizing i totally failed to answer you earlier when you asked and asked about music nft is i launched into my background and then nfts more broadly but yeah so i'm i am super excited about about music nfts um you know i think it's it's very similar to what we saw play out in in 2020 2021 which was the you know the it started with digital art and then it became you know profile pics and digital collectibles that were mostly visual in nature really really took off and started to grab sort of eye-popping numbers on primary and secondary markets i think that culminated with people selling you know a piece of digital uh art for 69 million dollars at some of these and what's important about to like you know notice there is it was a very reflexive sort of cycle where you know initially you know there was a headline an artist sold a meme for like a million dollars and people were like oh my god what no that's that sounded crazy um because no one had ever sold memes for that kind of money because you know it wasn't possible before but that um that headline was you know very reflexive in that it then solicited more creators to jump into the market and list their stuff for sale as nfts and in turn like more collectors came to market and that just really snowballed and as you started out by saying like open seas now doing six billion dollars a volume in a month i i think the the same thing is very likely to happen for for other verticals not you know just visual but other verticals where there's a large sort of you know audience for for the work and music as you quoted me earlier music is like criminally undervalued for um the relative to the consumption right like people are are listening to music all day and at work and at night to you know relieve stress whatever we all enjoy music and consume it kind of like um from from a faucet from streaming services it's always on but yet we you know we only are showing out at most ten dollars a month for for streaming services and many people are not paying anything it's it's free and ad supported it's really difficult for recording artists to to make a living from from that model so i think the same sort of phenomena is likely to play out here where what what i expect we'll see in the coming year is you will see an artist release their music um as an nft and you will see a headline about it's selling for an on you know outrageous amount of money and people will balk at that um because they're not accustomed to seeing music you know transacted and at that scale just like you know digital art was was not um transacted at at those prices prior to nfts and that will kick off the same reflective cycle that ultimately sort of reorients um people's view towards the value of music and and wherein it becomes a collectible item that that people want to own you know you can imagine kanye west for example like dropping his next album where each song is is available to buy as an nft and i bet there's a collector out there that's willing to pay top dollar so you know that's what i think will ultimately happen i think this is really good for artists because it allows you to monetize your true fans and allow them to to sort of become patrons outside of the cookie cutter mold of platforms like spotify where you pay this fixed 10 dollars a month no matter what you consume here in this model you can pay whatever you think it you know the the it's worth to be the you know the collector the biggest fan of an artist and i think that will be really really good yeah something else that just fascinated me was i saw uh when nas did his drop on royal what the nfts were the like 50 of the future the amount that he was going to earn from the streams of those songs and you know i mean who knows how much that could be like it just seems really interesting because it kind of makes the buyer more like a business partner or something yeah what was your thought on that because like the idea of just like releasing each song as an nft is maybe like very obvious or something but like that was a really creative twist i thought yeah so it's cool and it's actually it's actually not a new idea there's david bowie in the 80s um created what he called the billy bond which was actually a very similar idea was a way for his fans to invest in the future publishing royalties for his the songs that he wrote and um i forget where they traded but you know it's sort of financial it was he was the first artist to like financialize his fandom in this way and and what nas just did with nfg's is the same idea just sort of a new vehicle for it which which is you know a an asset that's on chain but linked to the publishing royalties off chain so my my personal view on this is like i i think it's great i think this will hap this will exist and ultimately i think all sort of traditional assets will be traded on chain because it's just a more efficient sort of 24 7 global way to do it but it's also a little bit skew morphic right it's it's you know copyright and the whole concept of artist royalties an idea that belongs to like um to nation states right so like you know um nasa's royalties in the us are administered by ascap and in canada they're administered by socan and so on there's different agencies all over the world it's it's kind of a really difficult problem to get them all in sync and communicating with the owner of the nft on chain i'm more excited about sort of internet native royalties that are possible because of the you know the paradigm of smart contracts where you know i can sell an nft where any secondary resale of that nft has a royalty baked into the creator or to the first collector for example all that can be programmed into the asset itself and that's completely distinct from you know the world of of copyright which again is sort of a nation-state construct as opposed to an internet native construct so i'm much more excited about artists exploring that and and how they can sort of leverage the the sort of native transactions happening on chain to benefit their their fans and and so we're starting to see that happen too where like we have we're investors in in a startup called bonfire which gives tools for for creators to create dows with their fans where essentially their fans can own an nft alongside the creator and help them monetize it and benefit from you know the the revenue that comes in from you know from the creator's work so it's sort of like the same concept but with internet native royalties so lee i wanted to ask you about some writings that you've done on what you call like in how income insecurity and job and security in the giga economy is like something similar that creators face and how you feel like web3 slash these user owner networks can help address issues like that as well as even things like economic inequality so how do you see that happening right uh so a theme of um some of my writing from last year has really been about the parallels between the creator economy and the gig economy in the gig economy obviously i think we've all been exposed now to the downsides and the impact that they've had on their workers in terms of mental health and income instability how they can be de-platformed at any moment and their livelihood essentially taken away in an instant without any recourse and i think a lot of those negative effects of the gig economy also apply to the web 2 creator economy as it exists on the large social networking platforms the parallels are very clear to me in terms of the creators being beholden to these platforms being able to be de-platformed at a moment's notice without any explanation and without any recourse thereby stripping them of their livelihood they also similarly to gig workers don't own their customer relationships they're intermediated by the platform and so if they you know if they get banned or d platform there's no way to reach their end consumers anymore they also don't control their own monetization they don't get determined to determine their own pricing as we had mentioned before the platform is really dictating unilaterally how it earns revenue what portion of that gets shared or not with the actual creators themselves and so um i think the the creator economy is becoming gigafied in that way even though i i think the popular narrative tends to be at least as espoused by these platforms that that these creators are being empowered um i think there's actually a lot of negative trends that we're seeing and this has come to bear in the fact that we're seeing an increasing number of creators going on strike and actually organizing themselves and employing some of the tactics of the labor movement to actually try and campaign for better platform policies and product design and so where this then intersects with web3 and and leads to a vision for what can be improved in a healthier creator economy is basically to remedy all of those things to check the power that these web 2 platforms hold we need to have creators having a seat at the table in terms of how these products are governed how monetization works how the product roadmap is designed and also to give them ownership of their end customer relationship such that they are essentially in control of their destiny rather than being beholden to one given corporation so let's though talk maybe about some of these criticisms of web 3 because i'm sure you have seen jack dorsey the former ceo of twitter now the ceo of block he says that actually you know web3 is something that's really vc owned so it's not truly decentralized of course you two are both vcs investing in web3 so what is your response to that take chris dixon obviously we we both work within andreessen and had a great response which is he pulled up the sort of ownership of jack's square inc um and it it showed you know the bulk of holders are certainly not users they're like large financial institutions and and so you know that that's not to say i'm not trying to make a direct you know web 2 versus web 3 comparison here but i think certainly i i'm very confident saying web3 offers users the opportunity to participate in the platforms and the products and services they use every day that is certainly a new net new thing that was not possible in in web 2 until companies went public and and once they did you know large financial institutions typically bought up most of them so i would say that is directionally a lot you know better in align with what lee was just talking about in terms of giving more meritocratic or equal opportunity to to participants um to get involved at an early stage that doesn't mean though that you know vcs are not involved um obviously we're you're investing in the space and that's because these projects need to start somewhere right i i wrote a um an essay about progressive decentralization which sort of describes a playbook for founders building in the space wherein it's still really important to build a product that people want um and that's useful and and typically you know building a product is not something you want to do with with a lot of people shouting over each other in terms of you know their strong opinions of what the product should be you need sort of an opinionated leader to come in and say this is how it should work even bitcoin had satoshi with the white paper that described how the system would work right and um so you start with an idea or product and and then you build a community of users around the product and then finally you effectuate a distribution of ownership to the users through a token and that is how users come to own these platforms in order to get from step one to step three founders need capital to hire people to build out the initial product build the community and that's where the role for vc is comes in but typically when we invest in a startup in this space we you know we own a minority of the company and we own even less of the eventual token um that they might produce and in fact we go so far to say that in our a lot of our deal documents that the the founders and the investors of the company should own a minority of all the tokens that come into existence to ensure that the network is sufficiently decentralized and actually owned by the the contributors who are you know who are contributing as it grows and and one framework to think about this is we can we can compare some traditional vc to to crypto bc in traditional vc a company will raise a c round a b c d e f g round and each round is more and more dilutive to the original founders and early investors and that dilution is sort of taken on because it's seen as a way to grow the pie for for everyone right like more capital in the door more growth in crypto what happens is typically projects will raise a seed round and then maybe they'll go on to raise a series a round but then they'll go through this process of progressive decentralization where they exit to the community of users and in so doing roughly like 50 or 60 percent of the the tokens in the network will end up in the user's hands and that is very dilutive to the to the rowing cap table but again that dilution is taken on for the same reason it's it's seen as a way to grow the pie because if your users are aligned with the success of the platform we assume that you can build a network that grows much bigger much faster because the the users are economically aligned to see it succeed so the whole like thesis is predicated on this idea that if the users own the network it's a better outcome for everyone that doesn't mean there's no role for investors early on and that's why i think jack's um jack's criticisms are you know frankly a little on nuance what is the ideal allocation then to vcs when you say it should be a minority like what do you generally recommend i mean i think there's a spectrum for different kinds of projects but typically what we see is is the users owning the majority of the network which implies more than 50 and you know in terms of how how networks are governed that's a critical threshold right because you want the networks to remain aligned with users over time to the extent you know that that you know you don't want to i think a network is kind of dead on arrival if vcs or even dc's plus the early team own cumulatively more than 50 of the network out of the gate so that that's what we sort of every investment we make we aspire to have the the users of the platform own more than 50 because that's how the network many of these networks are government typically uh for the deals that you do you recommend that you and the early team i guess own fifty percent and then the users own fifty percent yeah or sometimes even less depending on on the project again like the uh the whole theory here is that these networks benefit from their users contributing to the platform and the incentive for them to contribute is that they own it and so for some projects it can make sense for the users to own the vast majority of it um and for early investors tone 20 because the the network is so dependent on their contributions out of the game okay let's actually also discuss one other um criticism was which was uh the signal former ceo uh again these people like both left their jobs around the same time um a former ceo of signal took web 3 to task for not actually being decentralized and he wrote an essay where he talked about how he created this nft and he designed it so that it would appear different depending on where you looked at it from and when you looked at it in your own wallet it turned into a poop emoji nft and he says that then openc removed it from its platform and then he was shocked to find that in his own wallet it appeared as if he didn't own it and i guess that was because like metamask calls the openc api so he concludes that you know web3 is actually centralized so what's your response to that yeah i'm happy to take this and we feel free to weigh in too but it's very early in the infrastructure build out of web3 so today it's true you know openc is the big player in nfts and metamask integrates their api and that's why moxie you know saw his nft go missing in his wallet even though on chain he he did actually still own and it just wasn't being shown to him in his wallet because openc had removed it from their api um so the issue here is there you know there are centralized players in the mix there's the blockchain which is decentralized and then on top of the blockchain there's sort of infrastructure built out the key thing to note is like this is how the early internet sort of web one was built too we had you know open protocols like ip and you know email is built on top of an open protocol imap and smtp and then there's services built on top of those open protocols like gmail and gmail provides a great service which is you know it's filters for spam it lets you search your inbox really well um and so you know people use gmail but the thing that's critical is like google can't abscond with email protocol and say you know what we're not interoperating with um with this protocol anymore it's only email because effectively they'd be cutting off all their users from contacting their friends who are not using gmail and there's just not you know that's not a benefit to users that's that would be value destructive for them so their protocols sort of force the platforms to play on um the protocols terms and i think like you know open c today has outsized influence because they're the the biggest player in the market but that's a function of just them being so early i think as we as we sort of scale the ecosystem there will be more players and um if opencs competition and and you know the competition is not shutting off that um you know moxie's uh nft because it's a poop emoji or whatever openc will have a harder time doing it they'll be forced by competition to sort of you know honor the protocol and and interoperate with it as specified so i think what moxie's describing is sort of a short-term phenomena in in the build-out that we're we're sort of undertaking which is a you know going to take years to mature so this might be a bigger hurdle right now it looks like web 3 is also sort of losing kind of the uh the pr battle amongst kind of normies or non-crypto people we've seen different gaming platforms when they announced nfts they experienced a big backlash we saw um discord when they kind of hinted at an ethereum integration big backlash they they even backtracked bts uh the k-pop group i think saw big backlash when they announced nfts so why do you think this is happening and how do you think people like you can overcome this pr issue yeah we were just discussing this topic this morning as a team um internally and and kind of like just yeah reflecting on it discussing what could be done i think as for the underlying reasons to me what it's reflective of is a lot of latent resentment broadly in the world and in this country around income inequality and financial disparities i think that a lot of what people see publicly around nft is a lot of the headlines that they see a lot of the very vocal news on on twitter and and elsewhere is really around like the huge headline numbers of sales or how much people bought their profile picture for and in a world in which in the wealth gap is becoming wider and wider i think that kind of news can be really distasteful and cause people to feel this mix of like sadness jealousy resentment um unfairness because they are not personally benefiting from that and it it feels like inherently unfair that someone who locked into just purchasing one of these you know jpegs as they would say like early on is now a multi-millionaire whereas they who you know this person who has been working for 30 years couldn't possibly earn the income that would be equivalent to to that one stroke of luck there is something kind of unfair and luck based in that and i think compounded with that issue is the fact that there have been unfortunately like scams happening in the nft space there are people who are creating these collections promising all of these things and built out in terms of product which then never comes and so they are able to realize that chunk of revenue at the beginning um from selling out of their mint and then they don't uphold their promise and so over a large number of cases of these instances i do think that for a lot of normal people it's easy to look at that and say like wow like on one hand like people are getting mega rich and two there's all these scams like people who are winning are doing so at the expense of other people who are losing and that obviously brings up a ton of emotionality so i think all of that is happening right now and probably the way that social platforms and the news is incentivized to sensationalize stories also doesn't help with that and help get people exposed to the full nuanced picture of everything that's going on in the nft landscape um and i think ultimately how we get out of this and how we ultimately change the tide on the popular sentiment around nfts is just to continue building to focus on building end user applications that actually deliver them value in their lives going back to what we said around why people would run would want to purchase things a large motivation for buying things in general is just utility having it benefit your life in some way so i think i think the way that we get through this is really just to continue building and iterating on applications and use cases that are going to actually make people's lives better on a mass scale jesse did you want to add anything on that yeah well i think one other dimension of criticism of nfts in particular has been the sort of environmental impact of of blockchains broadly and i i i've talked about this before i think on on another podcast but um i i find that um it's it's a worthy critique because it's true that um bitcoin and ethereum which are both proof of work blockchains today are very energy consumptive so it's it's a question worth asking but i think the a lot of the sort of mainstream critiques are really unnuanced in how far people have probed into you know how bad for the environment the blockchains um that back these nfts actually are you know so i and and i'll admit i'm not an expert here myself but i think you know often the the comparisons are you know the the amount of energy consumption relative to a small country but what you don't see are comparisons of you know how much energy does a blockchain consume versus for example like the global banking system and all the bank branches and all the lights and those branches right um and you know if you start to sum up like you know energy consumption of the financial system or energy consumption of for example all the free ports that store physical artworks and all the jet planes that fly to art basel every year to collect um you know multi-million dollar works then the conversation is is more complicated and harder to you know to measure frankly i'm of the view that long run the the technology is moving away from proof-of-work ethereum plans to move to proof of stake which would be far less energy consumptive and and you know if you if you compare that future to all the you know the consumption and emissions from the physical art market or the you know the physical financial system it starts to become clear that this is actually a lot more energy efficient but of course you know it's hard to fit all that into 140 characters and so that nuance is lost and so um unfortunately there is this perception that nfts are like extremely destructive for the environment and that's stopped a lot of artists from engaging without you know digging further and i think that's that's something we need to overcome all right well there's so much uh more that i could unpack with you both but um we're just gonna have to jump to my last question here which is uh obviously we're still at the beginning of 2022. you know when after everything that happened with nfts last year and even you know we started to see a lot with dows i was curious for your predictions as to what we'll see in those areas and in general in the ownership economy this coming year so i think that as i mentioned a big part of how i got to being a crypto investor is through the future of what work angle and interest in how people are going to be able to access income and wealth permissionlessly and so i think that's going to be a huge area of development in the future like we're still very very early in terms of how many people globally are earning income through crypto members of different dows collecting nfts and i think those figures are only going to grow in the coming years a stat that i often times cite to support this is the fact that in surveys of americans usually upwards of 70 percent of people will say that they want to be self-employed um 70 of americans want to be self-employed the actual number of americans who are self-employed is far far below that and it actually doesn't change that much over time so about 30 percent of americans are actually self-employed and that gap between that 30 and that 70 is not changing that much um year over year and what that tells me is really there's this underlying desire to be self-directed to have freedom to be autonomous to be able to do work on their own terms but the lift historically in terms of actually starting a small business quitting your job becoming an entrepreneur setting up a company figuring out how to do marketing and acquire customers that is too high of a barrier to entry for most people to actually realize those goals and to me the really exciting element of crypto is that people can kind of gradually transition in through participating in some of these networks and starting to earn and ramp up their involvement over time so one can start as for example a dow member then over time start contributing then become a core contributor and earn ownership in the actual dow itself over time and so i think it's actually a much more accessible path to that dream of earning income in a self-directed way that most americans have than what has historically been available to them yeah i you probably don't know this but i did a tedx talk back in 2018 and this was the exact topic of my talk because i yeah i um have always liked working for myself and i um don't do very well if i were i mean i do find they like me as a worker but like i personally don't feel fulfilled working for their people so when i learned about crypto and understood that this could be an effect like i got very excited because i i do feel like i know so many people who would like to work for themselves who don't for various reasons mostly having to do with security and like especially in the us like worried like everybody is like what do you do for health insurance so um yeah that's definitely one of the things i'm most excited about with crypto um okay well this has been so fun uh chatting with both of you where can people learn more about each of you and variant on our website variant.fun and we're both on twitter you can append our twitters to the end of the we'll put them in the show notes but you can you can see what they are if you want sure yeah mine is is kind of tricky it's jesse wldn which is my last name walden with no vowels and then i'm lg 18 on twitter and then i also publish a lot on my newsletter leigh.com perfect all right thank you both so much for coming on unchained thanks so much for having us thank you for having us thanks so much for joining us
