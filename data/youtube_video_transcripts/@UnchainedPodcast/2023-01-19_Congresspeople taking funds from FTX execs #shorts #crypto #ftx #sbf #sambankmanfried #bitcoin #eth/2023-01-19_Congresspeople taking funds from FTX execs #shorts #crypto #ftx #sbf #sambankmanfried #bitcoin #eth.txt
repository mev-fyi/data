so it turns out that 196 members of Congress got direct contributions from SBF or other FTX Executives whoops yeah that's over a third of all Congress people and the other two-thirds are pissed that they didn't get the memo that he was handing out cash I'm not surprised by this development I mean SPF defrauded the public violated campaign Finance laws and is refusing to admit to any guilt or as politicians like to say he's relatable but these politicians are not happy about it now because SBF committed the grave grave grave sin of getting caught in fact a lot of them are now denying any specific connection to him representative Lou Correa claims he never talked to SPF which is weird because SPF literally does not shut up seriously wander around Palo Alto for 10 minutes and you will literally bump into sandbankment freed wearing a shirt that says fdicus is solvent I'm innocent most of the politicians who've received These funds have said that they're going to hand it over to Charities to avoid being associated with SPF no word get on whether or not SBS legal fund is technically set up as a charitable Foundation
