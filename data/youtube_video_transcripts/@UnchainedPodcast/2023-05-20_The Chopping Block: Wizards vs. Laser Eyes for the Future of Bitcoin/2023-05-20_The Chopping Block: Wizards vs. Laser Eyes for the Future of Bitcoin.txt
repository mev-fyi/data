not a dividend It's A Tale of Two fun now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet generally speaking airdrops are kind of pointless anyways um I named trading firms who are very involved I like to have the ultimate D5 Protocols are the antidote to this problem hello everybody Welcome to The Chopping Block every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry insiders perspective on the crypto topics of the day so we're going to try this first we've got Tom the D5 Maven and master of memes next we've got Robert the crypto connoisseur and captain of compound today we've got a special guest Eric Wall the wise wizard of Taproot and then you've got myself I've receive the head height man a dragonfly so we are early stage investors in crypto but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice legal advice or even life advice please see chopping block that XYZ for more disclosures Eric it's good to see you sir how are you doing I heard that you're uh about to shove off for Bitcoin Miami which is like the those are the notes the big Premier Bitcoin event that happens every year very true thanks for having me on man yeah how are you um I I imagine that this right now is basically ordinal season so it's your time to shine what's what's the vibe over in Bitcoin Miami given what's happening on chain this time of year so you know I think that this year there's probably going to be a significant clash between the laser eye Maxi tribe and sort of The Magicians the Wizards so Mia and my co-founder Udi were sort of thinking about how can we amplify that situation even more so what we've been doing with this nft project that we have is that we in order to get white list in our project you know we don't usually do the usual thing where people are people are like active in Discord or stuff like that we have a specific thing called The Wizard school so in the Wizards school people do quests like sending a lightning transaction interacting with a Bitcoin system and the most recent Quest that we launched was to where a wizard hat to the Bitcoin Miami Conference so take a picture of yourself with a wizard because I think what's happening right now is that the uh the the sort of existing laser eye tribe they really blame all this ordinal stuff on the Wizards even though that they were the ones that sort of went developed deployed and went too bad for Taproot for years and then didn't find a use case for it for years until someone thought okay why don't we just why don't we just treat uh this upgrade as an arbitrary data blob and just feed any random stuff into the blockchain and that's where sort of the Taproot Wizards came in and said like okay let's do some magic with this with this arbitrary data so they think that we are destroying the chain which like I mean they're they're the ones that sort of got the upgrade into Bitcoin um so we just we we've already been seeing like a lot of animosity from their camp and like there's there's been tweets that they've made to the effect of like let's hunt a wizard if you see one in Miami so we thought like let's just let's just flood the conference with Wizards let's show them how many we are let's make it a part of the wizard school to show up in a in a wizard hat so that maybe like we'll make them feel outnumbered wait so what what exactly do they get if they show up in a wizard hat and take a selfie they get a slightly higher chance at a white list for our NFC collection you should see these people like people are crazy about the collection there's no way to buy it the only way to do it is to like be a part of the community so there's there's tons of Interest there's already people there's like I think I've seen maybe like three or four hundred pictures of people putting a picture of putting their wizard hat in their um in their luggage so it's already like the hype is already building for that okay so it sounds like this is a Lord of the Rings style conflict going on between like the Wizards and the trolls and I I guess I'm trying to I'm trying to understand like in your understanding and I know you obviously you know Bitcoin Miami I think it's starting tomorrow or today uh soon what percentage of the Bitcoin Community would you say is in the troll camp and how much would you say is in the magician camp there's some pretty interesting data points on this right magician Wizards that's it you know it's youth magicians and Bitcoin Wizards right that's the support magician others are Wizards got it so there are some pretty interesting data points on so bitrophil is a service that uh you can use to buy gift gift cards with Bitcoin and it's one of the more popular like Bitcoin Maxi companies actually that's one of the things that if you ask in Bitcoin or what can you do with Bitcoin they'll say oh you can buy gift cards uh on BET refill to charge your phone uh it's so Earnest right so they do track like statistics of who's paying uh with which wallet actually so you can do like Affinity Printing and look at the metadata data and how it interacts with your web server and try to figure out which wallet is actually uh connecting to our website and making Bitcoin payments so they had a conference I think it was on Pizza day uh last year so May 22nd May 22nd is the pizza day it's celebration of when Laszlo bought two two pizzas for 10 000 Bitcoin so there's an event for that and so he usually goes there and usually demonstrates some sort of interesting data on like who's using the service so he did like a raise of hands like a show of hands and he asked people like how many people do you think are using lightning versus ethereum or lightning versus Litecoin and so one of the interesting data points is that Litecoin is more popular than lightning so Litecoin which is like a cryptocurrency that apparently anyone uses so like some random [ __ ] coin is more popular than lightning and then if you go into looking at the Bitcoin payments uh he asked like what do you think is the most popular wallet here and so the Bitcoin Maximus they raised their hand and they said they named a bunch of different wallets like box frame green wallet a bunch of different was it they like and that they think are popular uh so they were like maybe seven or eight different suggestions and then in the end it turned out that the most popular wallet was a wallet called Exodus wallet that no big Bitcoin Maximus has ever heard of hadn't even heard about it either and that's just because like when you go to the App Store and you search for search for Bitcoin wallet Exodus wallet comes up and it shows sort of how big the distinction is between through the Bitcoin Maximus thinks that they are the Bitcoin Community but there is a huge a user base of bitcoiners that don't even know that the Bitcoin Maximus exists and they certainly don't use their product so if you're asking me like what the split is between Wizards and what the split is between laser Maxes I think that the main thing to realize is that the biggest Bitcoin user base doesn't have anything to do with Maximus maximalism at all they probably don't even know the about the conflict between Wizards or maximalist and the question is like if they are presented with these two two narratives or one is like in order to be a bitcoiner you sort of have to be a conservative you sort of have to be anti-vaccine you sort of have to be anti uh climate change and you sort of have to be thinking about the core nucleus family there are a bunch of different weird things that have been associated with Bitcoin culture that doesn't really have anything to do with Bitcoin and then on the other hand you have sort of the Wizards which is like [ __ ] it this is this is Magic internet money we're trying to make uh Bitcoin fun again uh so the most successful what what logo for our sort of tribe is uh the same logo that was on the um the Bitcoin Reddit Forum 2013 there was a picture of a wizard that said magic internet money join us and that was the most successful Reddit ad answer history of Reddit app that's people like that sort of playful idea the picture of a wizard magic internet money didn't take itself too seriously so I think that you know that sort of message where Bitcoin is like you know we're doing magic internet money join us let's let's see how it works out that's a that's that's a known uh well uh working strategy for sort of making the uh Bitcoin Community attract more people I don't think that's sort of the the laser eye Maxi tribe has been successful at any metric at all to bring more people into there's not uh hundreds of thousands of people are like holy [ __ ] I gotta change my eyes to to laser eyes and be very and only eat steak and and have a very conservative ideas about politics and science like that's not that's that's a weird thing you can do that and look we're not we're not actually in the business of trying to like eliminate the laser eye tribe I think that the Bitcoin can have room for many tribes I just think that the the magic the wizard one is probably a more appealing one we know that it worked in the past we're trying to bring that back and sort of the uh The Tap Root sort of the ordinals uh upgrade became possible in Bitcoin has given us that wiggle room to create a sort of Rift in the cultural divide in Bitcoin and we're just trying to fuel that basically so just to quantify it really quickly how many official wizard nfts exist and how many ordinals in total exist so a funny thing is that so because we were one of the first ordinals collections we what we did that was sort of um unique in a way was that we collaborated with a miner and got that minor it was Luxor Mining and we got them to mine a single Bitcoin block uh that so usually most Bitcoin blocks are like 2.3 megabytes large or something like that sometimes even less like 1.7 2.3 but if you uh sort of artificially engineer a block to sort of max out the the consensus rules for block you can create a block that is as big as four megabytes it had never happened before in Bitcoin history but we did that and we filled the entire block with a picture of a bald wizard it's a sort of a meme about Udi wertheimer so we took that original picture of a wizard we turned it into Udi and we put some sunglasses on everybody balding now he had such a beautiful head of hair is that what yeah no he is 100 bald um like you pretty much yeah um no no no I'm joking no I'm joking there's no there's like an intern there's a long intern joke about Udi being bald for some reason people call them bold I don't know why but anyway so he's sort of owning the joke and so we we took a picture of a of a bald Wizard and we uh took that original meme of magic internet money join us and we turned into magic internet jpegs join us so that was the inscription number 652 and in my opinion like I don't know for a fact but in my opinion that was such a like a landslide moment for the ordinals hype that it sort of set a trend in the in the ordinals lower overall so so that many collections are sort of inspired and based off of different wizard Concepts so there are a bunch of different wizardy related Originals collection that has sort of become a side brand to the whole nurse ordinal story but uh to answer your question more explicitly so there are two 1100 roughly uh Wizards that are inscribed and in total last time I checked there were four million different ordinals but it could be 5 million or 6 million now because they're just it just went parabolic very quickly after this how much did it cost for you to get the miner to fill four megabytes of a bald wizard so I think we paid around 12 or 14 are in the range of 10 and 15 000 because the the um the the fees in Bitcoin at that time were basically non-existent transactions at one Satoshi per virtual byte uh were getting mined so there wasn't like there were some blocks uh in that were getting mine the total fee Revenue uh was 600 for all the transactions in the block and then we came and said hey minus one big wizard will pay you twelve thousand dollars and then um that was so that was more lucrative for them to do and and I've heard that since then you know there are there are uh people see that as a sort of Big Marketing opportunity to make an entire block about something special so it's like Bitcoin is sort of monetizing through ad space at the moment and there are people are paying now thirty thousand dollars per for for one JPEG to cover entire block whereas before it was sort of in the range of 600 800 so mining revenues for some blocks have gone up like 100x that's great I remember there was an ethereum nft collection that did something similar although of course ethereum blocks not you know not quite as scarce as Bitcoin blocks for obvious reasons um so I wanna okay so so let's let's take a step back I I kind of want to get maybe just a little bit of a kind of Devil's Advocate situation or maybe actually get you to do that can you give us a steel man for the Bitcoin Maxi position that uh it is not wise to have ordinals on bitcoin that they're bad for Bitcoin and that they really shouldn't be operating what do you think is the best form of the argument that maximalists have um Advanced to you well so the the Maximus haven't really Advanced any great arguments but I can uh Advan I can come up with a much better argument for them that they should be using that they haven't really figured out yet okay let's hear that so I think that I mean the the criticism that they're doing right now is the same one I mean this debate has been going on on for ages and Bitcoin most people just don't remember it it was the same debate around counterparty back in 2014 uh we're having the exact same like I have a thread on Twitter where you can see that I go through like what are the different sites saying now back in 2014 they're saying the exact same things now the discussion is around what should the Bitcoin blockchain be for should it be for Bitcoin transaction data or can there be any meta layer or any arbitrary as long as a transaction pays for the fee is it a valid transaction and there are a lot of bitcoiners that feel like no uh Bitcoin is for Bitcoin transactions and if you uh put a bunch of other stuff there you're sort of squeezing the available space for transactions out by filling it with other non-relevant data that's sort of the Crux of the um of the debate but what I think is going to happen now the the biggest problem with all of this so I'm Pro organelles I'm Pro this trend because I think that the one of the major problems that Bitcoin has is that there's not enough demand for this box space there used to be a lot of demand for Bitcoin block space because people were using Bitcoin to transfer funds between centralized exchanges so you can sort of think of it that there were not necessarily Mev in Bitcoin but there were certainly urgency if you want to transfer funds from polonix to bitmixed to avoid getting liquidated on bitmex and you wanted to fill up your collateral you had to use the Bitcoin chain that's not the case anymore people use stable coins or ethereum or any other faster chain to transfer funds between exchanges uh their spin now for a long time since like 2018 there's been just the transaction fees has just been going down and you have some of the primary Bitcoin researchers and spokespersons well maybe I shouldn't say spokesperson but like core developers like Peter Todd that is has been making a serious case for why we need to introduce tail emission so basically inflation into Bitcoin in order to have a strategy for when the housings make the block rewards go down that there's enough of a security budget to secure Bitcoin and removing the 21 million uh cap would be like a disaster a big a huge disaster for the the mean of Bitcoin the story of story of Bitcoin the immutableness guarantees let me interject here because I think this might be a new argument for some people who who don't know what it is that you know Eric Todd and sorry uh Peter Todd and all these other people are worried about so the the idea for Bitcoin is that uh Bitcoin right now is secured by mining fees those mining fees go down in terms of the size of the block reward every four years in Bitcoin and eventually those mining fees will get smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller until they basically approach zero in the year like 2100 or something or I don't know some time very fun in the future when those block rewards get small enough then the only Revenue that miners will get in exchange for securing the network by doing proof of work is fees and if those fees are not very much or if they're very volatile then basically you're going to get situations where Bitcoin miners are not actually giving very much security to the blockchain and therefore uh Bitcoin is just going to end up being insecure a lot of the time when people aren't willing to pay fees uh in a given block and that's very bad because it means that people can't use Bitcoin safely because they'll be worried about double spend attacks or a minor you know mining one block and Mining another block instead and the hash rate going way down so that's one of the problems that many people in Bitcoin are worried about it's a very far future problem but uh there's there's an argument within Bitcoin one of the ways to solve this is with just having continual emissions the akin to the way ethereum does so sorry uh yeah I just wanted to Define that for the audience yeah yeah excellent so that's that's one of the most like controversial opinions that you can have as a bitcoiner about the Bitcoin system that this is a problem like just recognizing it recognizing it as a problem is extremely controversial you're usually so even Peter Todd even though that he's one of the most like respected core developers in Bitcoin struggles immensely like it's I'm actually surprised that he didn't get like ousted from sort of the Bitcoin Maximus Camp I really thought that you know had it been anyone else they would not have made it very long and and sort of the Bitcoin ecosystem for raising that as a potential problem uh so I think that ordinals are great because they do um now we have like we can monetize we can if we can create a security budget just from like ad space basically in Bitcoin with these pictures but I think unfortunately it's not going to stop I asked you the steel man I asked you steal the argument again yeah I'm getting there I'm getting there I'm getting okay you're getting there all right it's very roundabout yeah very roundabout argument here okay yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna explain what I think the big problem here is uh so I'm excited for the payoff so what what maybe we can just explain what what Taproot did that's probably a good idea everybody's heard the term Taproot but most people probably don't know what it even is yeah so Taproot was an upgrade to sort of the signature scheme in Bitcoin to Schnur signatures and it also introduced something called merkelized abstract syntax trees which are a way to create for for a Bitcoin to be able to be spent in a number of different Fashions and you don't have to disclose up front how the Bitcoin is actually encumbered because sort of the the spending script is hidden in a Merkel route basically and if you can prove that you have a script that that belongs in the same Mercury then you are allowed to spend that transaction so that's that's Tap Root that was a very high upgrade to the Bitcoin system because people felt that it gave greater scripting capabilities to bitcoin transactions and sure signatures themselves are pretty powerful because you can do you can make a multi-signature look like a single signature transaction so there are efficiency and privacy and also scripting flexibility advantages to Taproot however one year after this upgrade was rolled out to the to cheerleading crowd of Bitcoin Maximus who said that ethereum is now dead because Bitcoin is going to get smart contracts through Taproot one year after we don't even have like we don't even have a wallet that supports this sort of multi-signature version for Taproot so there wasn't really any consumer demand for this tiny tiny small uh privacy and flexibility upgrades we had less than one percent adoption of Taproot one year out but um what Tapper did do like in order to Leverage The new scripting capabilities in Bitcoin they also relaxed certain scripting limitations and standards limitations so without getting too much into the nitty-gritty it made it easier in Bitcoin to sort of sort of fill out a whole block with one transaction one transaction containing just one input could fill out the whole block it was easier to propagate it in the network because miners according with this upgrade miners the standardness rules for transactions are standards this policy by which a transaction is valid in the chain but not valid to send around to other people so sort of a soft spam filter that was softened as well so it made it possible to create a protocol that created bigger transactions that were still in alignment with the standardness rules and there was a developer called KC rottermore that figured out that he could just use the scripting language of Bitcoin to create a branch of the script that wasn't executed and therefore because it was never executed it didn't trigger any other of these sort of script limitations in Bitcoin it was just like an OP if op Falls so it's like the statement basically starts with OP faults which means that this everything that is comes after here is false you're so so when a when a minor or a Bitcoin node is looking at this transaction data they don't even validate the rest of the script so it basically created a form of call data like in ethereum you have call data it's a raw data blob that you don't execute or you don't do any computation on by doing this little he called it an envelope it's a way to sort of just fill a transaction with transaction data that doesn't really get executed by the system so by doing that it was able to fill entire transactions just with jpeg data that didn't have to abide with any to any normal Bitcoin transaction format rules so you just create a transaction and inside the transaction he had this envelope thing and then he just filled the rest with arbitrary data none of the standardness uh limitations got hit on the script limitations got hit so basically is for for inscriptions is it actually the metadata or sorry for ordinals and is it actually the metadata like the same way it is on ethereum where you're pointing to some hash of the image or you literally you're like basically for encoding the image or something like that yeah so we're we we are uh we are 100 dumping the raw uh heximity I mean that's that's the way that that we do it uh that's just became I mean that was how the ordinals protocol was designed yeah and that became sort of a differentiator uh also because we don't want like you see on openc sometimes collections the the images of the collections of the jpegs change because what they're pointing to is a web 2 server somewhere and then someone changes what that thing is pointing to uh so what we wanted to do to sort of stick true to the Bitcoin ethos without upgradability Rod admin keys or anything like that we just dumped the entire uh raw data into the transactions themselves and so there was one thing that I did uh that I think so I wrote a couple of tweets where I highlighted just how cheap the Bitcoin blob space was and I together with another guy I made the inscription number 134 which was a you know these really stupid Trump cards like Donald Trump is an nft collection of trump cards I mean they're not stupid they're popular right yeah so I had a couple uh as one does and I uh okay Robertson's collector right and I have one because it'd be you know no which one do you have um I think he's throwing money in the air it's very Uncle Scrooge that's great yeah so I have a cool case for Trump nfts we can talk about it later anyway so um I took so one of those Trump cards was 360 kilobytes large and we put the entire raw data of that image into Bitcoin for just 20 bucks so the the entire network costs for putting a 360 kilobyte image was just twenty dollars that was cited at on January 29th and after that you can see how the whole original trend went parabolic from that day and just straight up because people were like holy [ __ ] twenty dollars to put 400 kilobytes like 400 kilobytes is a big high resolution image uh anyway so let me get back to my let me get to the point that I was kind of trying to make so uh arbitrary so the ordinal system as it was sort of initially conceptualized and conceived was designed pretty much to put videos text images like any arbitrary data but sort of the it was designed sort of for web content like something that you can display on a website some voice snippet that you recorded but the thing is that when you make it this easy to embed arbitrary data into Bitcoin there are more things that people are going to want to do with that are arbitrary block space so one of the things that people have been doing for the last couple of weeks is they created a meta token protocol so the brc20 standard is it's a semantic it's just it's a bunch of Json files that people dump into the Bitcoin chain and then you have uh external software that sort of interprets those jsons and creates now a brc20 token standard inside of Bitcoin so you basically have a shitcoin protocol that is now living inside of this arbitrary data space so uh I don't think that people yet can see sort of the danger here but there are already people that are working on extensions for the BRC or any protocol to add things like yeah because now you can now you can create a shift coin inside of Bitcoin it's not that new I mean you have you have the Omni layer for example did that in the past but now that there's been sort of a huge tremendous interest in these and these brc20 tokens have had tremendous market demand and they're worth like hundreds of millions of dollars and there are people that are minting them uh what's the next steps for these tokens are there just going to be dummy tokens that you can't do anything with no people are gonna want to start trading those they're not they're going to want to start creating those on automated market makers they want to get started get yield on those tokens they want to use them in governance systems they want to use them in the same way that people use any token in D5 so this is your bear case this is why it's bad yeah because the 20s yeah yeah so why is that I'm getting there so um so what we're gonna what's gonna happen is that there's gonna be Mev on bitcoin what was the reason that uh 80 of all the block producers in ethereum were uh censoring transactions due to ofak regulation in ethereum what was the main route what was the main source of that problem Mev was the main source of that problem because of Mev we had to uh create a system like flashbots in order to democratize staking yields basically in the system so uh it we had we created a different type of pipeline for transaction uh propagation and transaction Creation in ethereum in order to make sure that all different validators in the system had sort of access to high yielding block creation but that did also create centralized pipelines inside the system so that when ofac regulation came in they had a specific entry point to sort of latch onto and that was the reason why we reached 80 percent uh centralization in ethereum so yeah it's it's done a lot from there for what it's worth I think flashbots is only like 25 and you guys don't have to build flashbots you can just spike your hands forever um and pay your miners that way like I don't think it's fair to say Med causes uh you know ofac since [ __ ] no I'm not look yeah well if we don't do anything then it means that the miner who is the most prolific in extracting Mev in blocks is going to become the biggest mining pool so one mining pool who's way better than everyone else doing sandwich attacks and back running and front running now can provide mining yields that are 30 times higher 40 times higher and we're talking about one of the most uh competitive like it's even worse than in staking because in in proof of work mining Everyone is always living on the edge right everyone is sort of breaking even or dying so you're gonna have to join the most profitable mining pool and if the most profitable mining pool is one that is very talented at extracting Meb has the access to the best Searchers and sort of can do multi-block Mev across many many blocks then you do get a situation where hash rate sort of centralizes around a single mining pool and that's why you have to invent things like flashbots to make sure that any mining pool whoever they are have access to equally powerful block creation strategies so it doesn't centralize so I mean I'm not saying I'm not saying for sure 100 this is going to happen I'm saying that the whole domain of problems that the ethereum system has been fighting with for years and Bitcoin has sort of been isolated from that all of that crap is coming back into this Bitcoin system and the Bitcoin the current bitcoin core developers like sorry to say it but they don't have any idea about how Meb works like they have some very primitive ideas some primitive understandings of uh how Meb behaves and operates but it's like it's kindergarten time it's Amateur hour in Bitcoin compared to all the lessons that you guys have learned in the ethereum okay so there's okay so it's very it's a very interesting perspective the one one also a big difference between Bitcoin ethereum of course is the block time is very different right so ethereum it's very often that you're getting into latency Wars on ethereum just because every 12 seconds uh or at least you know in in proof of work land every 12 seconds with some obviously you know distribution of of when blocks that mind um there's a race and you really want to get into this block and you really want to make sure you capture this particular piece of Mev when you see it in Bitcoin with 10 minute blocks there's just an ocean of time it's just like you're sitting around you know things stuff is in the mempool and you can you know you can do this stuff by hand and like you know literally write out exactly how you're going to front run stuff and so I do think there's less of an advantage across mining pools just because of the latency difference uh it's gonna be so small compared to somebody who's a much you know better wired up mining pool than somebody who isn't at this but you're absolutely right if Searchers for whatever reason are choosing not to partner with everybody like there will be I think because of the fact that blockchains are so much longer on bitcoin my guess is that it would be pretty easy for Searchers to just be like cool we'll just work with whoever and you know I I don't think you would need in principle a situation where one uh mining pool just vastly outperforms its competition um that doesn't seem likely to me I don't know yeah I think General consensus is that actually like shorter block times basically create more Mev you could because there's like more opportunity for co-location instead of private information whereas like yeah I mean if you have 10 minute block times then yeah information should be public and I think even in ethereum you know pre-merge and pre-flashbots even like it was not individual mining pools ever doing the extraction because they were getting paid more by by Searchers and they're sort of a gentleman's agreement not for like the mining pools to uh you know front-run their their transactions I think you're missing one thing though which is the disaster for a Bitcoin mining pool to so that what the one of the attacks that you can do in Bitcoin mining is that you can do something like selfish mining so you find a block you don't release it to the rest of the network you start mining on your own block and then you at least two blocks reworking out someone else's block uh if they had found one before you because you have two blocks to attach to the side to the main chain if you are that other mining pool that found that block and then two blocks now come in kicking your block out the amount of Revenue that you lose from that from that event because you lost the block is like a huge deal that's a disaster like that was the block that was going to pay for the next three days of like food free family and they threw it out yeah I mean that's that's a function of fee volatility though right and that's not that I mean that's gonna be true regardless of whether the rc20 or even ordinals create a lot of free volatility right um but if you are on sort of in the in the mining pool that is engaging in selfish mining instead and that's you're splitting your Revenue with then it's going to be even today that's even without ordinals right it's always the case of selfish mining uh at a certain threshold of of uh hash rate obviously it's quite High uh so if you're like I think below 25 it's not profitable to selfish mind yep just intuitively like these big variances uh harmonize themselves out if you have very many blocks and very a lot of different Meb situations like oh you lost some there but you made some there but if it's like a couple of blocks that you mine in a span of a week those blocks really really matter so so if Mev comes and [ __ ] up uh your block inclusion that can be disastrous through your mining mining pool so it's the stakes are higher when the blocks are slower sort of my argument if that makes sense okay as I I get I get the shape of your argument it's very Galaxy brain um if you think that's the best counter argument to uh what you guys are doing well here's here's what I say okay so the most interesting thing to me about this whole debate is this is this the word spam because it's a word that gets thrown around a lot and we don't really examine it very closely of like what exactly does it mean to spam uh we just kind of know when we see it right it's kind of like porn I think the the baby I should explain that there's a famous uh Supreme judge uh Supreme Court Judge who once said that uh what's the definition of porn he says I know when I see it I can't remember who's who it was I said this um but I feel like that's kind of the way most people think about spam is that spam is like well obviously of course a Spam exactly exactly it raises kind of a philosophical question of like what exactly is Spam if spam is paying fees what makes something spam and not spam is it is it purely in the eye of the beholder or is it is is there really some way to you know Eric is there something that could go on the Bitcoin blockchain that you would say okay yeah you know ordinals is legit uh Wizards are legit brc20 is like okay kind of stupid but whatever but that thing is Spam that thing shouldn't be there um do you think there is such a thing as spam on the Bitcoin blockchain if it's paying fees it's a very interesting it's a very interesting uh question and I have sympathy for both sides I have sympathy for those that are saying that you know uh arbitrary data as long as it pays for the fees that's the what the market the size is the most relevant piece of information to put into Bitcoin uh if you want to compete with that transaction then you have to find a more valuable use case for uh your application that competes that other transaction out that's one way to look at it but I can also understand people who feel like there are a bunch of different use cases for or sort of chronologic data ordering that can be valuable but the system that I'm building here has to do with censorship resistant money transfer and the the most censorship resistant money transfer that I can think of are just normal Bitcoin transaction that actually transfer Bitcoin value and doesn't have to do with like [ __ ] coin auctions or anything like that so I understand people who feel uh you know who feel um either way actually the reason that I'm sort of on the side of the ordinals camp here and sort of so I'm an accelerationist I believe that if there is an issue with the protocol let's [ __ ] around with it as much as we possibly can so that there has to be a counteraction like let's have this debate now let's not wait uh let us let the protocol ossify even more and then have a situation that we can't even reach consensus on how to handle so like we're we in the crypto industry we believe that we're always like three years away from Mass adoption right um and so if if that's like around the corner and the staff route upgrade made it very easy to productize the block space and insert arbitrary meta layer protocols let me [ __ ] around with that arbitrary data as much as humanly possible so that all the different attacks and and issues can sort of arise and we can have that conversation early on and then decide how do we actually want to treat this issue so I think that you know maybe you know I I think that you know I'm very split here because I think on the one hand I do think that one of the biggest problems that Bitcoin has is that there's not enough demand for its box base and we need this security budget problem solved on the other hand I am kind of low-key worried about bringing in the entire domain of ethereum problems into Bitcoin when people find out that they can use this arbitrary data space to build any type of metal layer protocol so uh things are I think this is one of the biggest like Crisis for the Bitcoin system that it's ever been in but I don't think that people realize it yet um because bitcoiners are going to have to come up with an understanding for how to uh strategize around Mev and we're just so far behind we are so far far behind that even like an average ethereum researcher can come in and become like you know the the best possible like the you know can control the entire dialogue and be like no because you you have people like like um Matt Corolla is going in like I saw him when so I was I was in Tel Aviv uh at the Stark star Square sessions and I was talking about how you can build a sovereign role up on top of Bitcoin now uh using bitcoin's data availability layer by using inscriptions as sort of the mechanism to dump in these uh the the the data that you want for your roll up and very quickly after that roll kit from the Celestia team built actually a module that leveraged that and now you can build using rolekit you can build a sovereign roll up on top of Bitcoin and Matt corello sort of jumped into their GitHub repository and said like hmm this actually you know you're you're there's a risk that Mev is created here could you perhaps randomize the order in which you in which your roll up inter like regardless of how they're ordering the blockchain could you just randomize in your client how they these transactions are interpreted I was like holy [ __ ] map you solved Mev with like one ID let's just randomize the order that we look at transactions why didn't the entire ethereum Community just think about just looking at the transaction ordering randomly so Bitcoin bitcoiners in the Bitcoin Bitcoin core developers don't have the faintest clue about what to do about Mev so if this thing like blows up and becomes a problem you know I think that you know Bitcoin core as an organization is going to have to restructure itself either they're gonna have to learn really really fast which I don't think they can or they're sort of gonna have to be joined by people who do have expertise in in Mev and the top experts come from sort of the rest of the ethereum world and then these two words merges with each other and I think that one of the other things that we've sort of seen here is that now that we have sort of spam the blockchain with all this ordinals data we have seen that the Bitcoin layer 2 Protocols are sort of collapsing because apparently so this is one of the other things that ethereum people have figured out in a high fee environment uh State channel-based systems aren't really that great at solving the situation because if the fees are very high and you need to create a state Channel then making the state channel is very expensive so like managing channels on a very volatile fee network is difficult and I had like multiple lightning wallet developers that are like actually lightning uh ceases to function in a high fee environment because the challenge that we have all the all the payments that we are making all these micro payments that we're making if the fee to settle those transactions on the mainnet are are higher than what payments inside the channels are it means that there's no incentive to settle to the mainnet which means that we're basically treating we're basically sending around Credit in our second layers and this is something that anyone that was working on state channels in ethereum realized that oh you know we we have a volatile volatile fees in our chain on the base layer State Challenge is not a great idea let's not do that so that's something that bitcoiners are realizing now so I think that we're going to have to build other layer 2 Solutions on top of Bitcoin too and how are we going to scale those so if we start actually building Roll-Ups inside of Bitcoin how are we going to scale those well we're probably want to do something like Proto deck charting so we're probably going to want ephemeral data blobs uh that that we have so what what is happening now Eric I feel like you're writing a Bitcoin meets ethereum fanfic right now like this is I feel like this is going really really deep in an area that seems very unlikely to happen if not I mean because I don't think the problem we're describing are real like you're describing basically look like there's going to be a convergence between Bitcoin and ethereum and all the ethereum problems are going to become Bitcoin problems they just don't know it yet and they're gonna have to like call all the ethereum experts to come in and like save their old broken blockchain and go through all the growing pains that ethereum has gone through I I appreciate the story let me pause you there so one you didn't actually answer the question I think what is the spam transaction I think you're mostly just going off about how ethereum is is like the future of Bitcoin but but I I want to stop you there because because we also we want we want to give some time to talk about the letter hack but there's one thing that you said that really brought to bear this one uh idea that I've had for a long time uh and I want to get your reaction to it so so first of your caveat like I'm so far away from everything that you described like I don't really follow the Bitcoin World very closely uh you know like I think dick Carter talked about this like as an investor there's just not that many investable things on top of Bitcoin I mean ordinals just kind of breathes a lot of new life into it recently but historically like there just aren't that many things that are Bitcoin only to invest into um and then as far as nfts like I've never been much of a collector of anything much less you know not or not whatever not nfts but the interesting thing is that you know there's there seems to be this big conflict now between people who are pro ordinals and pro Innovation Pro things changing on bitcoin and pro you know as you mentioned sort of flippancy and levity and like hey let's like have fun uh and the the sort of Old Guard right the Bitcoin Maxes were like this is all stupid you guys are spamming the network this is a waste of time like this screw you screw you kids I feel like the question is like why are they doing that and like what is the what is the why behind the why uh there's the why of like what they say on Twitter and then there's the why underneath the Y uh and like why do they also you know only eat meat and own guns and you know deny the efficacy of vaccines or whatever um I I don't know that I have a full theory of why that is all true but I I was actually um I once took a a class on the sociology of religion or I guess yeah the sociology of religion and one thing they talk about is how um in early religions right yeah if you think about Christianity as an example Christianity was a Messianic religion and so there's this belief that the world was going to end very soon uh at the very beginning of Christianity right so the people who came immediately after Jesus Jesus said basically the world's gonna end so you know leave your job just follow me look let's do stuff and everybody was very convinced that the world was gonna end um and the ethic that Jesus preached and this is true for many religions right the ethics that is originally preached by the founder is very restrictive it's very very difficult for normal people to follow that kind of Life unless the world is literally about to end right if the world's literally about to end you're like okay sure fine I'll leave my cars I'll leave my stuff I'll just go on the road and I'll you know follow the life of Salinas but as Generations pass people realize like wow that's really hard to live that way like it's kind of not really doable and so the the compromise that religions come to is they basically create monasteries and they have people like monks and nuns who are kind of separate from society and they sort of live out the religious ethic in a way that's unrealistic for everybody else too but because we have it there because there's some people somewhere who are doing it we're all kind of free to live a more you know loose existence that that can still coincide we can sort of look at the values that are encapsulated by then say oh yeah you know we we could be Bitcoin Maxes too we could like totally say that we'll never use any other chain than Bitcoin everything else is a [ __ ] coin all you know I I insist on all my savings being in Bitcoin at all times and maybe like there's some other weird stuff that just gets stuck on there like you know carnivorism and other [ __ ] like that but the main thing is that like Bitcoin only Bitcoin forever um and if you believe that like that religious end of the world thing is kind of like hyper bitcoinization right it's like the moment that Bitcoin takes over everything and we all just you know everything collapses into a black hole of Bitcoin um and the fact that there are some people doing that is what gives the religious I guess I would say permission to everybody else to continue operating in the religion even though they don't embody the full ethic of Bitcoin that's my argument what do you think of that argument I think that there's definitely like an element of a scathological system I don't know if I'm pronouncing that correctly but you when you believe that there's if you just follow the Bitcoin virtues correctly it doesn't matter what happens now as long as there's this end state where you become rich and everyone who [ __ ] coined lose all their money um so if that's sort of your world view um then you can do a bunch of different insane things as long as you believe that if you just like salvation the the you know the the Armageddon is coming and I just gotta live my life this way and then I'll be saved like it is it does very has very strong resemblance to religion um but what I do think I think that the confinements and the restrictions also shapes the religion so you know I'm when I'm studying sort of the hex cult uh you know things are and then you have to spin narratives around why are the things the way that they are and why is that great like why is it so for example in HEX in the hex system Richard Hart owns 90 of the supply but this is actually great because that's so bad that it scares out all the VCS what it what even is hex because I think I've never heard of X um very briefly one sentence one sentence uh it's like one of those food policy tokens uh where you stake your Ponzi food token and then you get more of the token but somehow uh this is like a huge financial in the hex world this is like the greatest Financial innovation of all time and Richard Hearts is a genius and uh so so that's sort of their relationship yeah and but so so they have a lot of stories around how owning 90 like the benevolent dictator is better than a democracy and uh scaring away people who don't trust in the religion by having these things like 90 of the spies owned by a uh like it's almost like a Nigeria letter it filters for the for specific people that that again that get in there so it creates it creates a community where there's extreme Mev and like you know there's so there are people doing a lot of um I think one of the reasons that like pulse chain who's which is now like a fork of ethereum where all these uh hexagons have gone to live the reason that people are really building for that is because they have a community that don't really follow sort of the The Logical laws or mathematical loss when they're thinking about valuations of things so um so when I'm looking at the hex Community you know they have weird things going on there and then people have to come up with sort of religious uh narratives around why this is actually good and why the other people are doing it wrong and I think that Bitcoin has sort of been in the same way that because we can't do smart contracts smart contracts are evil and the only way to build a good system is by doing it the way Bitcoin is doing it but if Bitcoin had like the moment that Taproot was supposed to make D5 possible then everyone was like we're getting D5 in Bitcoin [ __ ] ethereum like uh Bitcoin has taken over so like the moment something changes with like what you can do then the religion and the narratives also changes so I think that the religion is sort of um derived from the restrict the restrictions if that makes sense so the Bitcoin culture is the way it is because of uh how the protocol ossified very early on [Music] I'm being totally honest like you know it's like I've you know been in space a while and I've similarly seen a lot of promises on a hype and just like nothing has really manifested um other than like number go up which seems to be kind of the only thing um like I've also been trying to get like lightning data and it's like okay look the usage stuff is really weak even like ordinals I think is like kind of interesting but like you said it's like it's sort of being like jpegs right or Diamond jpegs just encoding some images and now and now it's like you know sort of [ __ ] coins and so it's like you know what is sort of the story here people really want to trade [ __ ] coins but like they don't trust ethos like a you know base settlement layer because it's not like pure like come on um so I I just you know I've been tired tired of kind of waiting for a Godot here and uh like you said in the in the in-around like these other chains have kind of just uh surpassed it in terms of usability and Tech and applications and whatnot sorry Robert what's your take on this okay Tom so Tom's a naysayer Tom doesn't give a [ __ ] about Bitcoin Robert what's your take on this whole drama so my take is and this is going back to the spam argument there's no such thing as spam whatever transaction is willing to pay the most to miners is the right transaction and you know I don't think a picture no offense of a monkey or whatever is like necessarily the highest value content and data that you can be adding to the chain but I think that the ability to add actual like images and content directly into this immutable forever record for all of humanity is actually incredibly diet you know I don't think you know necessarily you know a picture of an ape is a good idea but what if it's the next Wikileaks like you know important geopolitical document right that could be important for recording in the history of humanity forever or something like that like I don't know what the right content is but I don't think it's a bad thing you know that people are putting whatever images and funky content they want you know when it comes to being able to script you know higher level things like [ __ ] coins I don't think that's bad at either right like I see it's good for Bitcoin because if that's what's willing to create the most transaction fee you know everyone should theoretically be happy you know I don't really think it actually eats into the core argument for Bitcoin that like Bitcoin itself is the only you know application and like the whole point of it is it's like I think if you want the Bitcoin blockchain to win you actually want people to use it to its maximum degree so and I say this is not a maximalist of any asset but you know I J and maybe it's naive but I see this a good thing like all of this is being good for Bitcoin like period full stop I don't see it being bad I see it just being more demand to use and now one that most people didn't really want to use all of you know a couple months ago that should be on its face just awesome yeah I I totally agree with the sentiment Robert I think I I actually the the spam question I I don't actually have a very well defined answer to it so maybe something I should think about more um because it does feel like there is such a thing as spam like spam does seem like a coherent concept so to say that there is no such thing as a fee paying like something that that clears the the market for fees can by definition ever be spam that feels wrong to me but I don't know that I have a good way to describe spam uh or it could be like advertising okay so like you know spam in my mind is because it's basically free and there's no transactional cost so my inbox fills up with like non-stop garbage and nonsense because there's no transaction cost Market to regulate it right but if there was essentially a fee Market that like regulates this and says only the highest paying thing can reach you know the public right maybe that looks like advertising not spam right in a sense but it's you know whoever's willing to pay the most to get their data out there and yes that could be an advertisement in some sense but I don't think it's spam I can say one other thing that can maybe impact your your opinion on on the whole thing um so first of all in Bitcoin we have the block size limit right so yeah you can Spam The Chain but the uh how uh how how the resource requirements are to run a node doesn't change right because that's the block size limits make sure that you're only storing this decided upon amount of data on each note per 10 minutes right then the other interesting thing is that the more of that data is filled with jpeg information which you don't even have there are no signature uh checks or like computation that has been has to be done on that data the higher of the percentage that is just dummy raw data blobs the easier it is to verify that block so the more spam the more percentage of the block that contains spam versus hard to verify or signatures and all that the easier it is to sink the chain so I'm not aware of that many systems that the more you spam them the more efficient they get and actually also if you run a full node you can prune all of that data after you download it on your node and check sort of the Merkle tree computations work out so your node actually can become way leaner from the spam so it pays more in revenue and then no no hold on hold on one of the arguments that people make against this is the fact that it increases the unspent utxo set because of course these inscriptions they happen on a single set you take that set off you you do something to it and you probably are never going to join it back together with anything so it does it yes in one sense no in another sense if you're looking at the state size the state size increases but if you look at the actual computation cost in a particular block yeah that decreases um but one of them is forever and one of them it depends on how you use it so with the the big the big four megabyte bald wizard that we made that's one utxo and entire block that's Tiny But if you yeah so that that is way less okay let's let's um let's cut this line of conversation but this has been this has been fascinating I just let me let me end with this note it does feel to me like the concept of spam is a real one right there probably should be such a thing as spam like if North Korea was filling every block on bitcoin with just like death to America um I'd be like okay that seems like spam you know even if they're paying fees I feel like North Korea is spamming Bitcoin right now um and that feels right I feel like I'm describing something real if it's people on bitcoin who are having fun and they're you know doing jpeg parties like that doesn't feel like spam to me but I can understand why I would feel like spam to somebody maybe you know older and kind of more set in their ways than I am um so I I I think there is some eye of the beholder of what is spam and what is not spam what is socially valuable and what is just you know somebody being an [ __ ] um but it it does seem I I had not thought about this idea that you that you mentioned Eric about there's going to be convergence between Bitcoin and ethereum because of all the that gets created if brc20s do go big and we start adding more and more things to them Beyond just transfers because of course if it's just transfers then there's no real Mev right that's it's going to be the pretty vanilla the same way as Bitcoin is today uh but if there's more complex stuff happening on chain and there's uh uh you know you create amms which is no reason you can't it's a state machine just like ethereum uh then uh you're gonna get a bunch of annoying nonsense uh happening on on bitcoin same way you have been on ethereum with respect to TV okay we're we're running about time I wanna I wanna talk about one other big story that Eric I would love to also get your take on so uh this week There's been this huge debacle by the company ledger so Ledger they are the biggest Hardware uh the biggest Hardware wallet manufacturer in the world however while basically you know a physical device very small carry with you and you can store your private keys on there and use it to sign transactions uh without having your private key directly exposed to the internet now on Tuesday they announced a new feature which is a subscription service for users who want to have their private key be recovered by Third parties so basically they had three third parties that signed up to uh split your key into three shards and uh if you you head to kyc with Ledger themselves in order to use the service prove you are who you say they are and then you can get two of the three charts back together uh recover it using your passphrase uh which I think is like your eight digit code and then you can unlock your own uh you can you can get back your Ledger even if you lose your physical device or something happens to it and so this feature which was upgraded in the firmware so the firmware itself would allow you to encrypt your encrypt your private key and then send it over the internet to these three parties and do the splitting and all the stuff directly within the firmware of your device um this freaked a bunch of people out for a few reasons one uh is that most people did not even know that it was possible for a ledger to spit out the private key at all they thought that okay well Ledger it's like you know kind of like a secure Enclave like on on the Apple device and the keys go in and they can never come out that's what most people thought was the way it worked turns out that's not the way it works um and second is just the Optics around this whole thing of okay self-custody but then you know kyc with the company that sells your wallet and then they will make sure that you know you really are who you say you are when somebody asks for your your key shares back um that seems like kind of a crazy security model and kind of against the spirit of self-custody let's say uh and so a bunch of people freaked out and got very upset and this caused a huge Stampede of people saying that oh my God Ledger is terrible Ledger's evil uh and they've totally broken the security model for Hardware wallets and people are like I'll never trust letter ever again so we we actually had a big debate about this yesterday between Tom and myself uh where I thought that this was terrible I thought like oh my God not because Legend offered this feature I actually don't care about this feature I'm like I think it's fine if Ledger wants to offer this you know unsophisticated people will say like hey this is this is great and for all I know it'll probably save people from losing their key material but I don't think anybody sophisticated is going to use this for obvious reasons the thing I was I was freaked out about was that what the hell I thought that a ledger could only basically write to transactions right it could sign transactions that's it basically like it's a signing Oracle and in reality it can actually spit out the key and if you know that the trust model or the the threat model for your Hardware wallet is that it can spit out the entire key that a lot of things that would otherwise be mitigations don't don't work right so uh things like a time lock if somebody can can steal your key out of a hardware wall then a time lock doesn't save you or you know spending limits don't save you like all the stuff that you can do to mitigate transaction level maliciousness can't save you if the key can get exfiltrated and so I was like this is terrible and Tom I don't speak on your behalf what was your take at the time when you're reading this of like why you don't think this is a big I think it really comes down to like what your previous mental model was of how this was supposed to work and I think obviously there's you know people have sort of different standards um in my mind um you know obviously if it's sort of like getting physical access to a device um and in this scenario it would be busy upgrading the firmware on The Ledger it's like if that happens then like that is sort of beyond the level of protection that you can provide through your design and so for Ledger um you know they sort of have it it has to there is a piece of Hardware that will only allow firmware upgrades to The Ledger that's been signed by The Ledger Corporation so there's not even really a chance that like you can actually we download malicious firmware off the internet and you have to approve it on your device and so you can literally only add firmware to your Ledger that ledger has approved that you opt into um but once you do that like of course they can kind of they have to upgrade you know the HSM over timer they have to add new types of cryptography and new signature schemes as they add new chains and so it can't sort of be fixed in place you could obviously build a ship that only does that but then it's very kind of limited in what it can do and so it's kind of this trade-off right between like you know ux and greatability and sort of how Ironclad and resistant do you want but I mean to your point I see like that was just my mental model but I think a lot of people on on Twitter had sort of your mental model and so I think this is kind of like everyone was feeling was like diving into like um chip design schemes for Ledger and different Hardware wallets and like try to understand everything works and uh there's a very funny uh 24 hours but I overall agree with the point which is like this should not have been done through a former upgrade it's terrifying that this is actually being released and like this API is being has been built effectively um if they want to offer the service fine but like you know do it through an alternate uh Channel yeah it seems like a pure disaster like regardless of whether it is Justified or not justified like clearly they have freaked out their yeah it seems like a pure disaster like regardless of whether it is Justified or not justified like clearly they have freaked out their core Community which is you know people who are rightfully paranoid about their keys leaving their device uh Robert what was your take on this whole thing yeah I I definitely think that you know Ledger should have rolled us out differently or should have built this product differently you know I think the core challenge for them is that there's eight billion people on Earth and a small sliver of that I think are up to the task of private key self-custody without you know hosted backups in some sense you know their target market is not 8 billion people right now with the prior product Suite so I think it makes sense that they want to go in the direction of your keys but in a more whole world friendly security model right I think it's a very different product and I think that the sliver that uses Ledger today is much more crypto sophisticated and the idea that the private key can even leave the device through you know uh you know a firmware update is terrifying because the whole reason they're even buying a ledger in the first place is so that the key can never leave the device period and that's the expectation of that customer base so I absolutely think they should build this product and I think it should have been a separate product from their existing devices and I think if they want to go in that direction they should but I don't think it should have been one in which they were basically rolling out through a firmware upgrade for customers who don't want this Eric what was your take on this whole debacle yes I've spent most of the weekend actually making wizard costumes for the Miami party [Laughter] about this yeah so I caught up on it last night and the thing that you know strikes me the most is that I actually have like tweets on my phone where Ledger the main Ledger Twitter account says that no firmware upgrade can make your key uh leave the device so that they've said that in 2018 they explicitly said that no firmware upgrade can make the so the a big part of the reason that why people believe that is because Ledger explicitly said that they said that that's how their technology worked and now they said well but if we upgrade the device and we want your data to leave the device then it's a different story but you trust us right so it's more than a disaster it's outright deceit they [ __ ] up big time and of course people are going to be mad about mad about this uh there are some people that have like deeper insights about how secure enclaves on hsm's work that aren't as surprised um but there's certainly a lot of people that have all the right to be extremely frustrated because the people making those devices said that the private Keys could not be the any despite what because it feels like you get a call from like a ledger representative speaking in some weird accent and they tell you oh it's because you haven't uh upgraded the firmware on your device and then all of a sudden your private gaze is gone what are you doing there that's right that sounded very French that sounded very French it is okay so I I spent a lot of time on this yesterday evening uh because I was just trying to get my head around this and we're trying to figure out like should we be telling our portfolio companies to stop using letters and uh my first reaction was like yeah obviously like this is such a this is such an egregious breach of user trust like oh my God I can't believe they did this the more time that I spent on it and the more that I talked to people who know a lot more about this than I do the more I just I I came to believe that I just overreacted the same way that I mean almost everyone into it overreacted for for a few reasons so I also saw the Tweet because it's been going around everywhere of like some screenshot of Ledger support uh or whatever the social media channel like this is not actually like Ledger copy right not not their actual marketing go to their website doesn't say anywhere that like it's impossible to export trade your private key there was one tweet they did in 2022 that everybody's screen capping everywhere that says you know it's impossible for the firmware does not allow your uh keys to leave your device the correct answer is that uh the only way that firmware can cause the key to leave your device is if you install it and Ledger signs it which presumably Ledger was like sort of implying look we would not sign such software so obviously can't run on your on your firmware because it's not signed by us and the secure element enforces that the code is signed by our key um it can be infiltrated right the lecture can be interpreted yes and you install it then yes you can sort of get fished by somebody pretending to be Ledger who steals their keys that's totally possible right and that's in the trust model of pretty much all trusted Hardware I was spending a lot of time looking on this uh looking at this and like basically all trusted Hardware everywhere whether it's Tes whether it's um you know the secure Enclave is everything all of them are upgradable there's basically nothing almost nothing that is not upgradable in some way and what is the upgrade process the upgrade process that the microcode or the whatever it is that's running in that uh processor is signed by the manufacturer right that's true for almost every single form of trusted Hardware um and so you may not have access to it yourself and maybe like Intel that can you know push upgrades to your sgx or whatever or with some other manufacturer that can actually push upgrades but of course all software has bugs all software everywhere forever since beginning of time has bugs and so just on the most basic level um you always need some upgradability to some to to some software running somewhere uh because you know openssl has been broken lots and lots of stuff that's been around since forever has been broken um there are sometimes you know some things that use like sha-1 and shot one is like basically broken at this point right and says okay we got to go in and and in the software layer we have to change the hashing algorithm because the action algorithm is broken all the sort of stuff that just leads you the fact that upgradability is essential generally for security but more specifically for blockchains and this was the thing that I that I realized after uh again chatting with people who are much smarter than me it is basically if if you had a situation where a ledger was the way I was imagining it the way I was imagining a ledger is that it's a box that you put your private key into and that box uh has a bunch of algorithms already in there that are all the algorithms you would ever need to interact with your key um and uh that's it you never put anything more in the Box the boxes comes with fixed functionality of signatures and that's it there's no way to read out the private key or to put a new private key in there that can't be true because if that were true then it would be impossible to support any new upgrades to a protocol that involved any changing in the way that signing is done you could not support any new blockchains that you didn't have the algorithms already in there from inception so you couldn't support near you couldn't support Cosmos you can support you know Solana anything that has a different signing algorithm tough [ __ ] you know you go throw this away buy a new letter buy The Ledger that supports near buy The Ledger that supports this actually sounds like a great business model that you know the reality is that like consumers would [ __ ] hate this right like they want one thing one key every blockchain and the only way that you can do that if you're not throwing away your Ledger every time a new blockchain Comes live or there's some change in the way that the signing algorithm works then the only way that's possible is if there's some way to modify the Box and so it's always been true for every basically every Hardware wallet that there's some way to modify the box that the private key sits in and the security model is that the the modifications of the Box have to be signed by the manufacturer right or you have to side load it which is you can also side load things into a ledger that do extract your private key uh but you're you're really you know most users are never going to do that and it's very difficult um so if you understand that's true and you've ever used any other you know signing algorithm with your letter then you were trusting because the moment that you do that other signing algorithm you have to derive another key that touches the master key and then when you derive that key that app touches the derived key and does all sorts of other stuff with it and one of the things it could do is it could just spit it out you you can do that because you're specifying the signing algorithm in code um so that's what made me change my mind sorry the other issue that you brought too which I agree with is like you know we only know this um was going to be added because they told us um but Ledger firmware is not open source and so it's very plausible that they add this or something worse in a future upgrade and like yeah the firmware is legit and it's signed by Ledger but like you don't actually know what is all in the firmware and so either our you know Hardware wallets like trezor that do have open source form firmware so we we know what's in it you can verify that the firmware that you're loading matches the source but like you just can't do that with Ledger right now yeah I agree that does seem like the best path forward to ameliorate a lot of the concerns that people have is the ability for the the firmware upgrades themselves to be open source it's already the case by the way that most uh not I don't know of most many of the applications for Ledger like when you install you know the Solana widget on on Ledger that is open source you can go and see the code that they wrote for Ledger and the apis public but uh it's not the case for the firmware itself and I was reading somewhere that there may be like NDA restrictions It's like because of um because you know your Hardware is like full of ndas like India is just freaking everywhere in the hardware supply chain and so there's like what I read somewhere with somebody I don't know if the speculation or confirmed that there's some NDA that they have somewhere that like kind of infected their code base that makes it difficult for them to actually open source the uh the firmware which is easier if your treasure because trezor uses all open source stuff um same thing with one key which is a dragonfly portfolio company they're also built on top of the treasure stack so that everything is open source that makes it's really easy but you know pretty much all the secure stuff right like not sorry I don't mean as in not using the secure stuff is insecure but like if you want to use like a secure element or secure Enclave or anything like that all these things are closed Source there's not a single open source version of them as far as I know that's been commercialized and it's kind of the security model is that there's some physically unforgeable function on the device and it still it hosts some key that is owned by the menu or that you know corresponds to the manufacturer and the manufacturer signs uh any microcode changes and that's how it works and that's the only way that the Thing Remains secure in perpetuity as far as I understand Eric what's your what's your what's your what's your take on on this back and forth I think that we gotta learn how to do like a elliptic curve mathematics with pen and paper uh that seems like to be the only way that we can be selfish there we go we needed we needed some Bitcoin maximalism to come back I don't know I don't have anything else I like that I like that wait so Eric so are you a reformed Bitcoin Maxi or are you still a Bitcoin Max he's somewhere deep in your heart or like how do you how do you describe yourself with a respective relationship with maximalism maybe it's more like you're starting a new sect of the religion and it's kind of what's animating so much of the excitement around it yeah no so um uh the ironic thing is that I really did appreciate the Bitcoin and ethereum were two very separate things like I used to describe it as so the like ethereum is the octopus and Bitcoin is like a revolver with one bullet in it and depending on which enemy you're gonna fight like maybe your enemy is one who's scared of octopuses or like you're fighting him underwater then you want the octopus the revolver won't work there uh but in other situations like the the octopus isn't going to help you and you just you need to shoot the guy so and I think that the enemy is the state right and I want both an octopus and the gun to shoot the state and throw the octopus app um and so depending on where I'm fighting them in which situation it is I really want both of those sort of weapons at my disposal and uh so I that's why I've been like you know if if the state says uh that you know everything in ethereum our Securities and olfac regulation becomes a problem for like me before for transaction creation like if if those are sort of the how they try to bring down the theorem system then Bitcoin is less affected right but if what they're doing is saying that uh Bitcoin is an uh unenvironmentally friendly it's consuming too much energy and we don't like Bitcoin for this reason then you say well we have the octopus here it's not an environmentally unfriendly like what are you gonna so I think that we need we want I mean the end goal is to create a sovereign non-sovereign form of money basically uh that state can control I think that the main goal is still to like create a system of money that is wrangled out of the hands of the government if that can be a financial system too that can do stuff like D5 that's great but at the end I just want one system that the state can control therefore I need Bitcoin and ethereum to be sort of different uh beasts um so I'm not a Bitcoin Max some of this but I do appreciate certain aspects of Bitcoin I like for example that you know bitcoiners care extremely much about being able to verify the supply on their notes and being able to run their notes in Raspberry Pi's and ethereum communities though is more like oh we want a security budget and we want uh decentralized exchanges and non-custodial ways to have good user experience for swapping around those assets that's also important I think both projects are working on really important things and so I want both of them to sort of survive and I'm a big Champion for both of them this is why when I when you ask me to start a steal man my argument against against ordinals is is that they're sort of converging towards each other each other that's what my worry is and yes it's true that maybe I'm like a futurist and I'm maybe painting demons in the future that aren't really here yet uh but we can't say like Bitcoin is dramatically changing like we had a [ __ ] coin auction that made the fees uh uh go up so high uh from one Satoshi per V byte to 600 Satoshi purvi bike because we were basically running a gas auction for getting access to an airdrop basically have a [ __ ] coin uh we they haven't had so that's that was like an other side mint uh style event that was happening on Bitcoin now that is like inherently in a more AVM type of problem and I think that we are just seeing the the beginning of that Gary I mean there are reasons to be optimistic like one one of the great things is that I'm also seeing people price things in Bitcoin for the first time in ages like you have nfts that are getting priced in a like how many Bitcoins is is it worth so you Bitcoin is sort of coming back as a unit of account in the same way that ethereum has been a unit of account for nfcs there so they're both good and bad sites to all this uh I'm just trying to stay on top of things and try to accelerate all all the things so that we can get to sort of a conclusion of what we should do with them well much respect for you for that Eric you're always a beacon of light in this world of uh this world of Darkness that that is well that is sometimes the Bitcoin Community I'm glad to hear that you have such love for octopus octopuses and guns I don't I didn't totally understand the analogy but I I hope that it I hope that it takes off uh anyway we got a wrap we're up on time Eric it's always a pleasure to chat with you man thanks guys thanks for having me on all right until next week thanks Eric see y'all [Music]
