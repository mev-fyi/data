solicited from twitter next time if i get my act together in time and i'm not juggling five bajillion things at once i will solicit questions on the show so you can record your questions via audio and send them in anyway here it goes first question comes from cryptopia film how is the book writing going great question thanks for asking because this is pretty much what i'm spending most of my time on these days i have to say that actually it's super fun working on it i'm in the revision phase i will be turning my revisions in pretty soon and i'm kind of working like mad so i have as much time as possible to make this book the best that it can be and i really am excited to share with you all brandon zemp.eth asks what's your biggest tip to offer aspiring podcasters i would probably say just don't be afraid to make mistakes and learn on the job when i first started i remember one of the early reviewers in you know like not like a real reviewer just like a person making a review wrote that i sounded like a print journalist who had a podcast and they you know gave me some kind of low rating and i just started laughing because yes i am a print journalist who now has a podcast and i was just like okay well i guess i sound like myself um and then the funny thing is that so yesterday i recorded an episode with the digital artist people and you know we were chatting before the show and then um then i hit the record button we started the show and at the end when i turned the recording off he was like whoa you're so professional he was like when you started the intro it just seemed like you were another person and i thought is this like pre-recorded but i realized it was really you and i was like oh okay so clearly i guess i've improved since i started the podcast four and a half years ago um yeah so don't be afraid don't be afraid to make mistakes in the show and learn as you go um one other funny thing is there's this like little checklist of things that i do right before we begin recording with any guest and sometimes the guests say like oh i'm so impressed with your little list or whatever and i'm always like oh you're just listening to a list of all the mistakes that have been made on the show before which is true so anyway okay next question from paul above it what's it like being an independent journalist content creator um if this is what you aspire to do with your life it's pretty much like the best thing you could ever imagine doing i love it i feel like um yeah i just feel like the luckiest person in the world so um i don't really know what else to say about that other than that yeah if you find something that you love covering it and you can do it on your own then yeah it's just so rewarding i mean you call the shots you don't have to have a boss and you get to do all the fun things that you want to do and yeah i don't know it's it's really great you know i mean obviously there are a lot of things that a bigger company will do for you that um you need to you know hire people to do for you or figure them out yourself or whatever but um that's not the part that i think about when i think about my job you know what i mean it's like i just get that stuff done it's the best that's that's basically the uh the gist all right brent shuck asks oh well so this wasn't phrased as a question but he um just kind of gave a topic which i think is based on some current events we shall say happening in twitter so not actual events but just like you know um fighting on twitter on crypto twitter um he asked me to expound on further increasing the division of satoshis as a form of inflation lack of scarcity well you know i don't think there's really much to say about this um other than what somebody else already tweeted and unfortunately i'm not gonna be able to credit this person because i don't remember who it was but they were like oh if i just slice the pizza up into more slices then suddenly there's more pizza okay no that's not how it works people um you know yeah that's nothing more to say other than that okay brent also asks asks how do you spend your time outside of crypto so i actually answered this question before um what in the previous ama that i did i think this summer when i went on vacation you know i i used to be a yoga teacher and uh like a big portion of my friends are from that world the spiritual world i'm into meditation so um i spend a lot of time on spiritual stuff like uh yeah like meditation yoga uh wellness that kind of thing i love all that stuff i also just in general love music and dancing which i also mentioned um in the times of covet though that's not really something people are doing too much of right now so um so i've really ended up um connecting a lot more with kind of like my spiritual communities um all right mika warsaw asked do you send bitcoin to north korea okay um mika i don't know if you know anything about north korea but their their internet is like not connected to ours unless you know you're like kim jong-un so um no it's really not possible to send bitcoin to north korea um there might be people uh this would be a question for alex gladstein although he probably wouldn't reveal what what the answer was of the human rights foundation he's the chief strategy officer there and is well known for talking about bitcoin you know maybe they're doing something but yeah no that's not uh something you know that like any normal person can do you would have to uh basically be i don't know bringing flash drives into north korea and then training people how to use the bitcoin and it would probably be like a really uh difficult effort okay tegan klein asks how can we better incentivize our reporters without pay to play i don't like seeing the folks that are helping to make crypto mainstream not being brought up with the rest of the ships in the industry okay so first of all uh just the way the question is phrase how can we better incentivize our reporters without pay to play no real reporter is incentivized with pay-to-play like if anybody is doing pay-to-play then they're probably not actually a reporter um in fact i know of several other crypto shows that do pay to play um and yeah those people doing those are definitely not journalists so um at the same time i also do know that there are some publications that at least used to do pay-to-play that uh people think of as being crypto media outlets all i'm gonna say about that is you know i never really link to those websites and i don't anybody who works for me knows like we at least uh from any of my shows like we would never link to one of those websites um at least if i know that that's what they're doing i think basically the best way for this to happen is just for reporters to um and media outlets to use the same business models that traditional media has used which are you know what i do with ads um you know subscriptions work really well for some of the really big um mainstream outlets like a place like the new york times i think their subscription base is the highest it's ever been once they've once they introduced the digital subscriptions um you know i think some of the other really big media outlets like the wall street journal and the washington post have seen quite good numbers with their subscriptions you know unfortunately for smaller outlets subscriptions are really difficult and not super lucrative or or even like sustaining i i think well i don't know if you know but a lot of local journalism pretty much has been decimated with the internet and that's it's super unfortunate you know i saw this happening in my own hometown you know i think advertising people claim they don't like advertisements but i think that like they don't want to pay for subscriptions so that's pretty much the best way to do it and um and yeah definitely pay to play is not going to be how true journalism is funded um okay oftentimes this is an additional question from tegan often time mainstream press gets it wrong how do we help mainstream get the story right example xrp example cnbc is still talking about litecoin you know i think there's a couple of things first of all you you know people can cultivate relationships with reporters i've had different people reach out to me um to introduce themselves or you know to comment on my work or you know to say hey i can offer this perspective or whatever so if you feel like there's a reporter that you want to cultivate a relationship with like that's totally something that is possible especially if you you know have the kind of position or stature to do that um you know obviously journalists do vet their sources and try to figure out who are the most credible sources so um part of this is you know just about becoming an expert and then being able to leverage that in the right way you know but the other thing is one thing that i have noticed and this is kind of a broader tech thing um although you know obviously this does percolate into the crypto industry um i think that there is a tendency for p for entrepreneurs in tech and also in crypto to say that any critical uh media is you know just has the story wrong or is out to get them or whatever and i do think that you know if those people wouldn't take things personally but would instead kind of look more objectively and say okay well you know these criticisms are valid like here's how we can respond to this or that like i think that would be more helpful and is just um it's just a better way to have a dialogue with the press rather than to just get defensive and immediately dismiss everything that they um they put out um all right so i'm going to answer a few more questions but first we're going to take a quick uh pause for the ads today's episode is brought to you by block native block native is the easiest way to build and trade with mempool data hundreds of the top d5

what's in your portfolio and give the percent breakdown so um no i'm not a bitcoin maximalist um i'm not any kind of maximalist as a journalist i try to actually have as few opinions as possible frankly because i don't want to miss a story and so i don't want to get too fixed in my thinking about anything i want to be able to see the stories as they're happening and to be open-minded that anything could change at any moment and so yeah so that's why i um people actually ask my opinion on a lot of things all the time and the truth is i really have much fewer opinions than i think a lot of people would expect as for the part about what's in your portfolio um it's it's just nothing fancy or special it's definitely not crypto um and this actually leads to the next few questions uh mark nunes asks you once mentioned you don't only own any cryptocurrencies is that still the case if so why not um and someone else also asked thomas 83 uk asked do you still owe no btc right so and and somebody else also asked uh yeah so i don't and i'm sorry i didn't explain that earlier i thought people knew about this i um did own btc when i worked at forbes forbes has a policy that if you cover something that you own then you just have to disclose it once i quit i actually have only ever written one freelance or two freelance articles since quitting forbes but they were for the new york times the new york times um does not have that policy their policies you can't own something that you disclose so at that time i did sell giveaway and um donate some of the bitcoin or all the bitcoin that i'd owned and and i think i owned a little bit of ether as well so um at the moment actually though for reporting purposes i do own a little bit of ether because i needed to bid on one of those dot east names or something anyway i know that there's some remaining after that but i don't remember how much it is it's probably like i i actually i have no idea um uh anyway so yeah but that was just uh you know for for work basically for work purposes um okay kathleen brightman as of tazos asks in the next five years if it grows more mainstream do you think bitcoin culture is going to lose its weirdness um and then for example she wrote the vernacular the cult worship etc um the truth is i hope not um i would say that most likely it will just be the same mix of weirdness that has always been because i actually think from early on it's been kind of like you know the cypherpunks and then you've got kind of the silicon valley entrepreneur types and then you have um you know the libertarian people and then you know you've got all these billionaires who just want to make more money i don't know that's it's it's really just um a really fun mix of people and so i actually think it's just going to continue to include more of all of these different types of groups and um yeah like i said i really hope it doesn't lose its weirdness um ed rod rodriguez asks in your opinion will public blockchains ever disintermediate banks or is banking's grip on governments just too strong are private blockchains just more expensive centralized databases or will they predominate in fintech okay so this question about whether public blockchains will dis intermediate banks is super interesting to me so you know gut response is of course it's going to disintermediate banks right um just because it's sort of like i mean just everything crypto always takes off so fast when it happens and um the technology itself is just so much faster than um you know what you can do with the banking system and so just by sheer virtue of the um the vast improvement that the technology represents over existing banking infrastructure like that alone just makes you feel like of course um however the reason why i wouldn't give that as my answer is not necessarily the way you described it as banking's grip on governments but i would just say that compared to the way that the internet so easily disrupted media i would say that you know when you're dealing with money obviously regulation is going to play a bigger role and i think it already has and um will actually continue to play a bigger role um which i think we're starting to see uh by the time this episode comes out there should be some word on regulation that's coming down um unfortunately at the time of recording i you know i don't know what that is but i think we're already starting to see that regulation is going to take a bigger role in shaping how much blockchain technology can disrupt and disintermediate banks you know one other thing i would say though is like i think something that's interesting is kind of what i was saying before about how the internet really uh decimated local journalism but has helped some of the really big media companies grow bigger you know something similar might happen in this situation where the the banks that are big enough to use the tech to institute the technology in such a way that they can compete with public blockchains they might um just sort of you know retain their foothold that way whereas we might see that like smaller financial players that can't compete against public blockchains might have a harder time something like that um you know i'm not really sure but um it's just something that i was thinking about however you know on the flip side i think you're all probably well aware that there is a trend of journalists kind of like me going independent and being able to say to sustain themselves as their own little publications there's this whole um trend of journalists moving over to sub stack and actually there was a big article on that trend that i meant to read but i've been so busy writing my book i haven't read it yet um i just know that there are people that are doing this i think camila russo is one of them because i subscribe to her newsletter yeah i do think that even if we do see that happen where um we might see small banks get disrupted in a way that the bigger banks aren't that we will also see and we're already starting to see it that this technology can also kind of elevate people that you know maybe uh would wouldn't traditionally have the right connections or or background to or resources to um play or work in the traditional financial system who get a chance with crypto because it's just a different beast and the barrier of entry is is quite different and i think you know for people with the right technical chops that they can really take advantage of this in a way that that maybe um wouldn't have been possible before and as for private blockchains predominating in fintech yeah i don't really see that happening um there might be like specific use cases by which uh they do predominate but i don't see that happening like just you know across the population at large and for 2021 what black swans do you see on the horizon um hmm that's a good question i'm assuming you mean for crypto well huh that's interesting because yeah i think the the regulatory thing is going to be um not as bad as it was rumored to be not that long ago um so you guys uh the the industry seems to have escaped something there which is which is good um but that probably could have really put a damper on things i think the only thing would be in it so in 20 in the summer of 2020 obviously we did see defy kind of have its moment with yield farming and um people getting really excited about that and it did kind of take off very quickly and then sort of died down and i could see that happening again in a much bigger way at some point in the future once certain issues are resolved like around scaling or ui or you know whatever it might be but the thing is that as we all know there were so many security issues and defined there continue to be to this day i literally read about a new one last night involving some place called warp or something like that so this is you know it's something that has to be resolved and so i could see that maybe if d5 does have another yield farming moment that again is much bigger than it was last summer but there's some massive security issue then yeah that that would not be good for the space olly chan asks uh what trends do you see for 2021 the trends i see for 2021 um i think so to my mind number one story i think for 21 is probably going to be okay no i'm not going to make a prediction okay these are my contenders for what i think will be the number one story for 2021. the number one is going i think it will probably be bitcoin and it's funny because last summer i was thinking it would probably be defy because i thought it might play out the way that things had played out in 2017 where the ico craze sort of led and then that kind of like you know created this rally and then bitcoin uh got kind of carried along with the cryptocraze led by the ico craze but actually now you know i think like with the pandemic and uh with what we're seeing with all these different um corporations adding bitcoin to their balance sheets and with um paypal adopting it and and it yeah just becoming so much more mainstream and finally like all these billionaires and investment banks being like oh yeah actually we think it has value and here's what it what the value should be and et cetera et cetera um i actually could see it being bitcoin in fact that's my probably top contender for what i think will be the biggest story for 2021. um this was actually part of the reason why i did the bitcoin now series which um isn't even finished because i'll probably just continue it throughout 2021 because i think bitcoin will be a huge story in 2021 however okay so second contender for top story could still be d5 if if it takes off in a bigger way um you know that's just a bigger question mark because of the scaling issues etc but um yeah and and i just think you would probably need more people to be kind of under on boarded into the crypto space and to be able to use metamask and all that like there are certain things that yield farming requires you to do from a technical perspective that you know even i can't do when i like i think about this stuff all day long um so yeah so that's probably second contender um definitely up there is going to be the coinbase ipo so my current bet is that the top story for 2021 will be bitcoin the the second biggest story will be coinbase ipo the third maybe d5 if if anything takes off with that oh shoot okay so in the top three has to be regulation um because of what i was just talking about uh you know i think there is there are a number of issues uh you know starting with i don't know if you guys listen to the travel epis travel rule episode that i did on unchained this summer um but that really i think you know kicked off this whole thing now that we're seeing where wallets are being targeted by regulation um in a way that strikes a lot of people in the industry as being overreaching and and impracticable so you know this has not really played out fully in all these different jurisdictions like we're starting to see it take place in a few of them but you know like literally right at this moment i think today the day that i'm recording this ama we're going to find out what that's going to look like in the u.s so that will be another big story to watch for 2021. um but yeah so there's my trends and um all right you guys i think this story this episode comes out if i am correct on christmas day itself so um that will be it for this ama i do have a bunch of questions which i will cover for next week's ama um but thank you so much for tuning in there won't be any news recap this week as i and the rest of my staff are off for the break and don't forget we're now on youtube
