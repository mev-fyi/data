[Music] hi everyone welcome to unchained your no hype resource for all things crypto i'm your host laura shin a journalist with over two decades of experience i started covering crypto five years ago and as a senior editor at forbes was the first mainstream media reporter to cover cryptocurrency full-time subscribe to unchained on youtube where you can watch the videos of me and my guests go to youtube.com c unchained podcast and subscribe today crypto.com is waiving the 3.5 credit card fee for all crypto purchases until the end of september download the crypto.com app today this is the third installment in the y bitcoin now series which takes a closer look at bitcoin in the context of larger macroeconomic forces such as the pandemic and geopolitical moves happening in crypto the topic of today's episode is the history of digital currency here to discuss are aaron van wierdem technical editor at bitcoin magazine and finn brunton the author of digital cash the unknown history of the anarchists utopians and technologists who created cryptocurrency welcome aaron and finn thanks for having us to really understand the history of digital currency we need to know who the people were who were interested in creating digital currency who were some of these original groups of people that were working on this and what were their motivations it's a really interesting community and i think one of the challenges for us now seeing how bitcoin has evolved and is evolving is to be able to look back and understand the diversity of motivations that that sort of originally brought them to this because everyone i think who was working in computer science or early network computing in the 1960s and 70s they already knew that online transactions were going to be a thing people were already thinking about in depth what it meant to buy and sell online what it would mean to have a receipt or sign your name to something or exchange tokens of value and they also knew that there were ways that they could make it work that would be huge improvements over say credit card transactions which were already existed in a much earlier format so when we look back at people like uh just to put out a few names uh david chalm who was one of the sort of uh great early pioneers of digital cash uh timothy c may uh cypherpunk and uh sort of anarcho-capitalists crypto anarchist finney who has obviously become very famous uh retrospective for his role in the development of bitcoin we see a mix of people who are all trying to figure out how to solve the problem of exchanging digital tokens over what would become the internet in a way that would allow them to create not just commerce but the kinds of commerce that they wanted to see in the world and and i think that maybe kind of brings us to some of their motivations some of them were looking for ways that they could exchange existing territorial currencies but do so anonymously and securely online the same way that you would pay for something with physical cash and by territorial do you mean fiat currencies oh yes yeah i mean basically currencies you know minted and issued by the country you happen to be in so yeah finding a way to sort of exchange dollars just as you would by withdrawing dollars in cash and paying with them and i wanted to use that territorial distinction because there were others who had similar interests in the technology but with the goal of producing tokens that were native to the network right that were like sort of particular to transnational computer networks and would sort of draw their characteristics from that new context so i think it's it's we can go through a bunch of these different characters and their their different kinds of interests and goals but i think it's really useful for us to start with that premise that everybody knew that this was coming and the question was in what form does it come what are what are your goals what are your visions for the world that you want the money to carry out i think there were sort of two main drives i i think that that sort of uh led to this this developments and i think one half this is really exemplified by for example david chalm who was the first to start talking about this is that if digital if money becomes digital that could have a very unpleasant consequence of making every transaction traceable which means that there might be some database somewhere that's exactly uh details who's paying who when and you know this could be this could become like a big panopticon right which is a scary idea i think or at least anything of course and i happen to agree with that i think that's that's a very scary idea that someone would have because if you don't have privacy that really affects your behavior does it even if you're not sure that someone's watching you like that's the trick behind the panopticon right just the idea that someone might be watching you that's a very unfree idea and you can't really be yourself and develop yourself and you know we could get into examples where where this you know let's say you're a homosexual in a country where the government doesn't uh have a to fund a perception on homosexuality then you know you cannot buy certain things in certain stores because you may get government agents behind you and keep in mind being since this is digital it's not even just today's government you need to worry about like if there's a database then it could be the government 10 years into the future that doesn't like homosexuals and it's you know so that's this panopticon is very or david chalmur at least thought this was very scary so this was really the sort of privacy angle and then you had another motivation which was there's something wrong with our money there's something wrong with fiat currency for example hayek wrote about uh who wrote about this a lot like the austrian business cycle and how the money itself and the way central banks manage it just explain who hayek was i think the first name is friedrich yeah friedrich or he's often also known just as hayek or fa hayek he was an austrian economist and austrian economics is a field of economics today most austrian economics aren't actually from austria but hayek was actually from austria the university of vienna that's where this school of all develops it's a different way of looking at economics it's more of a a priori way of thinking about the world and economics so he has for example and other austrians had this critique on how money works and i think this train of thought led hayek at some point to propose uh stateless currency so free market for currency and i think this was another driver i would say xiao was probably the first but then when some austrians and extropians will get to that in a bit when they sort of realized that money could become digital they also saw that means we can reinvent money we can make a better money in their view a better money and yeah let's talk about the extropians because they were sort of precursors to cypherpunks and they're very colorful who were they and what were their motivations and what did they want to do well this is uh i think this is a pretty extraordinary history and it's also one that really uh weaves together those those two threads that that that have just been so well explained one one challenge where both of those sides met right the the privacy thread and the money reform thread the new money thread the global money free money thread one of the places where those met was the idea that there was a real danger as money became digital that the ways that it was designed could um halt or interfere with the kinds of innovation and activity that that digitization might unlock right so from the chaomian perspective if your privacy is being limited um and you know and chelm i think had a really really prescient fear about this right one that has come true in a lot of ways which was basically it's not just that your that could then be used to track you for example but it could also be used to data mine your transactions and like and just as as was said to to use those transactions against you in various ways or to potentially do things like change the prices in real time you know to like guard you around things that were that you they knew that you had to pay for or knew that you had to pay at a particular time or what have you so there's a whole sense that like okay that will a drive people away from digital currency because it will be this bad deal and b that will dramatically limit the scope of human freedom in a lot of different directions and then the sort of monetary reform side right you know new money different kinds of money part of the the fear the notion with this which is you know which can be debated but the notion with this was in part that um the ability of sovereign states to control their money and use tools to manage the money supply um could potentially interfere with the kinds of investment and innovation and transformation especially technological transformation that might be possible if you had other kinds of economics at work so the reason i say that was that the extropians were a remarkable group in that they really unified both of those threads and they were kind of the place where those threads met and i historically i think the extropians are especially significant because almost everyone who was of significance in the genesis of bitcoin like passed through their ranks in one way or another was a fellow traveler was on their mailing list you know hung out with them wasn't active card carrying extropian etc so the extropians these two threads met and the reason why i wanted to explain them in a little you know in a little depth was to understand their unique perspective the extropians as their name would suggest saw themselves as having a kind of cosmic task and the cosmic task was the opposite of entropy instead of a steady decline of complexity into noise and eventually some kind of entropic heat death they wanted more complexity more transformation more information on like a cosmic scale more life like they thought at the scale of billions of years they were interested in not just like becoming rich but becoming like you know immortal minds embedded on silicon in you know far future physical forms expanding throughout the universe at the speed of light like that scope of ambition is a really amazing thing to consider when you think about how it reflects back on okay so what do you do today what do you do this morning and the extropian answer was we try to build the platform that will fuel the innovation that will bring about things like amazing medical breakthroughs amazing technological breakthroughs like you know seemingly science fictional technologies that could be realized now and we will put ourselves financially in the position of being able to take advantage of those when they arrive right so the idea is that if you can build an economic machine that is sufficiently uh like powerful in terms of driving innovation of accelerating change then maybe you could bring about the inventions that would make it possible for you to live forever and to create utopia right and like i say this uh kind of as someone who like really admires the scale of this ambition but also to emphasize that until you go back and read the extropian documents it's hard to realize that i'm not exaggerating at all right like they they really wanted to figure out what can we do that can create the greatest possible future for trillions of mines over billions of years and the answer came back to one of the things is develop digital cache yeah there's there's this like futuristic idea of course always existed like something like star trek comes to mind but what really was the extropians really it was first of all they thought as something that was very realistic like that could actually be achieved with actual technology that's improving exponentially so within their lifetime you know they could live forever for example and the other thing is that instead of some sort of star-trekky and benevolent government that is sort of like a perfect people-made central planning thing or even democracy or whatever the extraordinary i'm not a star trek fan i don't even know exactly me neither can't help you but the exclupions they really thought as a free market thing like they had a very austrian economics idea about it and freedom and individuals should should realize this progress and governments was interfering with that like governmental regulation was standing in the way if you just let individuals be free if you just let markets be markets then this futuristic utopia could become a reality that's that's what i would add yeah and actually that brings up a really good point which is that they one other kind of way of i think understanding some of the unique elements that went into digital caches that evolved and eventually into bitcoin was was exactly that fact that they were and part of what they inherited from their interest in austrianism was uh was the was a fundamental commitment to emergence right that like sort of superior things came about not through forsightful planning but through the emergence and interaction the emergence out of the interaction of unknown complex factors right so that means that they really wanted to design a kind of digital cache that had the minimal amount of oversight essentially that could kind of like enable enable things to evolve with the least amount of control which is you know in many ways something that's very different from almost any other kind of money that has been sort of developed or administered yeah and you see that ethos almost in cryptocurrency today and by the way so um i know many people will listen to this on the podcast but also we do record this on video and i just can't help but notice that there's a poster behind aaron's head that says cypherpunk future something the future future is now yeah what is that that's a prince by martin fisher he's an artist from uh prague he was involved he's involved with a art collective and they founded the parallelony police i don't know if you've heard of that yeah i have yeah it's like a collective of artists and hackers and they got really into bitcoin as well and uh so this is this part of his series on uh cypherpunk i think the series is called cypher my future is now okay okay yeah i wondered if it was some reality got an email from timmy i think it's the crypto chris manifesto printed on it oh yeah yeah awesome interesting all right well so yeah one other just like little comment i wanted to make about the extropians was when i was reading finn's book um they also had reputation currencies that were kind of like almost like a personal token basically and um and there was something about it i was like oh my gosh this is like cryptocurrency but just a long long time ago um so it was pretty funny um but anyway i actually also wanted to ask so what were the main problems that these creators of digital currencies were trying to solve i think probably many of them are well known to bitcoiners but but you know let's just go through them so people have a baseline uh i i think that's skipping ahead a little bit but that's that's fine i think there may be because we didn't get into the cypherpunks yeah they were sort of doing it step by step let's yes sorry that was the second part of my question i forgot that we didn't get into that part so let's talk about that okay well i would say the first problem the main problem the main problem that any digital currency scheme had was the double spending problem right so if you make cash digital if you make money digital then the central problem there is that if you have a digital dollar bill then you can just copy it and spend it to two people right and that sort of defeats the the point of money i would say that's sort of the central the the main idea but i i there's many problems they solved they it was sort of a step-by-step process towards bitcoin where they figured out to solve one problem after the other you know privacy is one and but let's talk like how did they come out of the extropians how were they different how are they similar what were they what were their motivations and what was their philosophy can i start this one thing yeah go ahead yeah yeah okay okay yeah so um david chum wanted to create digital cash right like he wrote he had this idea of how to do it he had an idea of how to create digital cash um and by digital cash by the way specifically mean privacy he was on the privacy side he cared about privacy uh this was in 1980 this was just after public key cryptography was even invented it was pretty fast now he ended up in amsterdam because he had a girlfriend there and then at some point he won the government's contracts to create a digital tour booth system the dutch wanted to create toll roads on their roads through some sort of electronic system where they track who's which cars are driving where well jump thoughts that's not a good idea i don't want the government to know where each car is driving so i have a better idea i have a private solution he was able to convince the government that that was in fact a better idea and that he was able to do it so then he founded a company called digital digi cache at this company uh he created this toolbooth system but then he also as part of the company he also wanted to create a digital cache system okay so this digital cache system was centralized to be clear there was a central data base at the company but he used clever cryptographic schemes to make sure that the database ideally or at least the people yeah it's a bit complicated it's a bit nuanced how private it was and there was a lot of debate about this but the general idea was people paying each other don't know who they're paying don't know the real names and the companies shouldn't know either because you asked about cyberpunk so i'll sort of get to cypherpunks eric hughes he was interested it was an american he was interested in digital cash and he actually went to work as digicash but he became disillusioned because some of the choices that digicats was making i have to scrape my memory what what his problems were with it he i i don't remember he had some problems with how it was being designed or how the company was planning to make money or something so even some of it was and and you know i i don't know exactly what you're referencing but i think some of it was the business decisions that chum um could not make uh where he was getting all these really amazing offers like from microsoft no yeah that was much that was much later oh okay yeah that was much later like in the early days of the company and he immediately had some problem and it had to do with being able to use the system offline and that came with a bunch of trade-offs as opposed to just using it online without trade-offs like it had some sort of secret chip in it like an unfortunate chip there's a better term for it anyways that was his problem so after a couple of weeks he was out he wants to move back to california and he was looking for a home near the coast and he met up with an old friend called tim may tim may had been working at intel had made a lot of money because he solved the big problem and uh he had stock options and at one point he did the math and he figured you know what i'm 34 years old but i can retire something like that around that age so he retired and he spent a year on the beach bought a house near near the ocean and he spent a year on the beach reading books and he was reading a lot of cyberpunk books so and also economics and these kinds of things but also cyberpunk and cyberpunk is sort of this vision of the future where the internet had some sort of parallel role in in society that was usually one of the teams of cyberpunk booths he got into contact with another sorry this is becoming a long story tim a had another friend who was starting a company that was about selling information the internet was brand new this was like late 80s early 90s late 80s i think still when this happened his friend was thinking of starting a company about selling information and then tim may realized wait if you can sell information anonymously that could completely change the world because if you can sell data anonymously that means you can sell secrets like government employees can sell secret data corporation if you're working at a big company you can sort of anonymously sell the secrets of that corporation and completely in his mind there was a revolutionary concept that you could anonymously sell information online in order to do that you needed something to sell it with anonymously so you need a digital cash okay eric hughes and tim may met up and they started talking about this kind of stuff and tim a went feather in his mind like he started to think about if this is possible and if we have digital cash the potential is complete disruption of government like it could realize an anarchic vision of the future where people don't pay taxes there's no such things as government secrets all of that so he it was a very anarchist vision timmy and eric you started to talk about that both super fascinated about this and then after a couple of days they came to the real they asked themselves the question if all of these amazing tools exist because they had been invented in the 70s and 80s if all of this stuff exists then where is it why is no one actually using any of this and that's where they came to the idea that's why they got the idea to found the cypher punks which was a group in california at first they met physically they met physically at eric hughes's house i think there wasn't even furniture then so they were sitting on the floor they were discussing these ideas and they were they made the plan to actually use these tools and make it a reality allow people to discuss a conference conference online anonymously anonymous cash anonymous information to markets all of this so that that was sort of the cypherpunk ethos is all of these tools exist let's make them a reality that's that's what they agreed to do yeah finn what do you want to add yeah yeah no i would love to add in i think that's a fantastic account of like the whole kind of trajectory of this history and i think also like in that account you can sort of see the different problems that are coming up there that they're you know that they're sort of going to make up the manifest of stuff that digital cat needs to be able to do and how they're trying to address those problems right like so it's going to have to be it's not going to be like a credit card where like you verify your identity you know and then that and then like a ledger is debited somewhere to switch over to someone else's identity and all these transaction records are being produced instead it's going to be like a token it's got to be a token but that means that token has to be uncopyable right like i have to be able to transmit it to you without us being able to you know trivially duplicate it it has to give away nothing about our transaction but there's another like all the kind of problems that we can see in like the bullet point list at the beginning of the nakamoto white paper about bitcoin right like all the issues that bitcoin addresses but then there's another sort of bigger problem even in some ways which is threading through the the story of the cypherpunks which is um what you would use this currency for and i don't mean that in just a kind of trivial like what could you buy with that way but like one of the ways that you make a currency um not just valuable but but something that that is in use something it is as they say in the currency business uh passing current you know like something that people actually transact is you have to make it something that can provide access to to value and to potentially sustainable value over time right like you have to assume that when you put money into this the value of that money is going to be stored in some way if it diminishes it's diminishing on some kind of known schedule so this was one of the problems that they faced like one of the ways that may put it which i think really captures the problem is that he challenged people on the mailing list he said we've built anonymous email systems and those are technically challenging but they're socially easy because everyone gets what anonymous email is but when i say that we need to make a digital coin what is that digital coin and when i say here i'm giving you 10 digital coins what makes that something that someone else what makes that something that someone else is going to use that they're going to like make a part of their lives that they're going to start essentially having more and more of a personal stake in which is what will really help to get that currency over the line into actual circulation and the answer to that and i think this is a place where you can also see some of the challenges that these currencies are going to face the answer to that that may present it was that we're going to start by making it a way that you can access kinds of things kinds of value that you can't get any other way right like we're going to get a fantastic section in this long manifesto that he wrote where he lays out all of the different uh communities that are going to drive the adoption of digital cash and related anonymizing technologies the way that we identify everything that is currently excluded by law or custom from like existing areas of commerce and then we make this into things that can be so from that perspective um one of the reasons for understanding the importance of that it starts out with the idea of selling uh secrets is right that like this can make something really valuable may hypothetically sketched out a system of crypto credits and part of the premise of this crypto credits was that you could get them as payment for selling secrets over this anonymized secret sharing platform that sort of like wikileaks meets the silk road almost in some ways and it was a direct inspiration for both of those but he says okay so you can be paid in those crypto credits and then you can use those to buy other information and this is not what the currency is ultimately going to be but this is the wedge that helps to break apart the structure of existing currencies this is the thing that is what you can do with this currency that you couldn't do any other way and this is what will help to drive its adoption and circulation and i think that really helps us understand that this was a bigger problem that a lot of different digital cash projects faced not just what can you use it for but what kinds of value does this let you access that you couldn't get any other way what's the kind of as it were literal unique value proposition that this is going to offer to you yeah and um so now we're almost halfway through and we haven't even dived into some of the actual solutions that um came along the way but quickly why don't we just go over so i think probably some of the other main problems that these creators of digital currencies were trying to resolve in addition to double spending and privacy or centralization you know having a central point of failure was was something that they had to overcome spam was another one there was kind of one key technological development that happened early that um helped kind of enable these different digital currencies and um this was the development of a public key protocol by what phil diffie and martin hellman can you talk about uh you know what this was and why this was so significant so this predates digital cash right public key came before digital cad so for context before public key cryptography cryptography itself was really something that belonged in the realm of like secret agents uh secret agencies or government agencies or the military or these kinds of domains that's where it's these were the sort of people that were generally doing encryption and one of the major challenges they always had was that in prior encryption schemes it was always the case that the public no the decryption key was the same as the encryption key so that's called symmetric encryption what's with phil diffie really and and the helmet really uh invented is this public key cryptography system where you can publicly share your key with anyone and then anyone so with symmetric equipment sorry i should have mentioned this the challenge is that you can only communicate privately if you first met in real life in some way because you gotta exchange the key if you exchange the key of an insecure line then the snoop can just listen to the key and then listen to your whole conversation so it really only works if you meet up somewhere now an edit better than so publicly crypto cryptography allows anyone to communicate privately without having to meet first another added benefit was that you could sign messages so you could if the world knew that this is if the world knows that this is my public key then i can find messages with this which is a mathematical trick doing a mathematical equation on other data and then i proved that the only person that could have done that is the person who has the private key that corresponds to the public key right so this track of owning or of of signing information this is used in digital cash schemes to prove ownership so there are you you prove at least in bitcoin and let's see well anyway so you prove ownership over specific coin by signing away ownership i i forgot your question but does that answer it yeah yeah well just to understand you know what what uh it was that they developed and why that was crucial to the development of bitcoin all right so in a moment we're going to talk about the early forms of digital currency such as um ecash and hash cash and b money and bitgold etc but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible how much in fees are you paying for your

conversation with aaron van werdem and finn brunton so david chome is a name that's come up several times and we did talk a little bit about ecash and his company digicash but uh why don't we just dive into the details on ecash how did it work what breakthroughs did it contain that later led to bitcoin and what were its flaws i i can maybe uh you know just kind of provide a very a very kind of cursory um overview which was that that and one of the things that um really distinguishes it from a lot of other kinds of digital cache that that came subsequently was the notion that you didn't have to worry about how it was minted right like you didn't have to worry about how it was created because it was not new money instead it was a format that you could transfer your existing money into that would let you spend it digitally without like it would let you spend it digitally in a way that was as analogous as possible to exchanging cash itself so the notion was in in very very simple terms that when you withdrew each cash it would take the form of just like withdrawing money from an atm and you might even do it as an atm into a payment card but it would not be like you were handling you know a debit card or a credit card where you swipe it and it checks in with the central ledger and then it transfers the money if you can prove your your right to transfer it instead it would be as though you had an envelope of physical cash with you if you lost that card the cash was gone um the reason why that was especially important was that that meant that you were holding a kind of digital money token that didn't need to know anything about you so you could like get into your cab or go to your convenience store slot it in authorize the transfer of the money and then at that point their point of sale terminal would be able to check in a way that ties very nicely back into how aaron was just describing public key cryptography that could check and say is this money token signed by an issuing bank right so there would be like you know basically wells fargo's you know key would be would be used to sign this token to say we will redeem this token for 20 us dollars blah blah blah so it would check if that was okayed if so it would transfer that into the uh like the the wallet as it were the digital wallet of the merchant and then the merchant could bring that in and deposit it and it would be just as if they're taking in that like zip bag from you know a retail store filled with cash so a couple of reasons why that sort of layout is really important for understanding how different something like bitcoin is the first is that they didn't need to build any kind of technical minting mechanism to limit the production of money because that was a central bank issue all this is is a format the second thing is that it anonymizes you but it doesn't anonymize the merchant and that was part of the promise that chow made right that like the person who deposits this digital cash is going to have to deposit it into some named bank account if they want to redeem it for money that they can spend um that means that it's money that makes the customer anonymous but would still be very difficult to use for purposes like money laundering you know bribery blah blah blah um and then the the sort of last tricky detail about it is uh goes back to that point about toll booths right so like how do you make this work if there if you're not in a situation because remember we're talking about the 1980s 1990s you know we're not all blanketed in like you know lte data everywhere how do you make it so that someone can't just spend the same signed money token at a bunch of different places and then like you know uh and then all those merchants try to deposit it maybe the first one gets it back and everyone else is told sorry you just accepted a bounce check and we have no way to connect it back um and chalman and a group of collaborators came up with a wonderfully elegant set of solutions that were basically such that if you spent the same money i believe more than twice then there was a way in which that could be used to de-anonymize that money um so there was a whole set of solutions but again the whole premise here is that it's not digital cash the way that we might think of it it's literally just trying to make existing money digital so this might be a really nice way to kind of segue into something like hash cash which is a way to try to think about like how can we produce money that is not about translating central bank money digitally but instead about making natively digital money yeah before we get into hash cash let's talk a little bit more about ecash and digit cash so digicash was the company and it was using this ecash system and you know it was generating quite a bit of buzz and um getting a lot of multinational companies interested in using it so what happened with it well laura that depends on who you ask [Music] i can confirm that you get some different stories about how that went down and the company was basically selling a technology like finn said they weren't necessarily creating money themselves they were creating a money layer like you could layer on top of other on existing currencies so a bank could for example use this to issue digital cash and apparently there was a lot of interest for this and definitely a lot of buzz around this company it was seen as sort of one of the next big things that that you know silicon valley and during uh during the the the 90s people were talking about like um you know the companies that that were big then were like yahoo and these come and and and digicats was definitely seen as like one of the potential next big ones apparently chum got a couple of fairly good offers maybe he didn't think they were as good and for some reason there were no big deals struck and at some point they started to annoy employees at the company and that's kind of when it started to fall apart i i think this is a a version of history that's hard to disagree with [Music] the the disagreement is to what extent ciao was maybe at fault of like the to what extent he was being too stubborn is what some people will claim you know he clearly he that definitely doesn't think that was the case um so yeah yeah and i did also see oh just quickly i did also see some people saying that he had kind of a cypherpunk sense of paranoia um that you know maybe some of the deals weren't as good as they appeared and that kind of thing which definitely that is part of that um ethos and finn what were you going to say i was just going to say that um i think we you know he really uh i think we can look back at at that moment and digit cash and really kind of understand where we are now in terms of a prediction that chow made like i believe in his testimony to congress in the early 90s which was that if we don't get good privacy protecting digital cash by design then we are going to get digital cash that just routes around territorial currencies entirely um i think he really he really foresaw the idea that like he had come up with a really specific framework for how this could work that would allow it to kind of play really well with existing institutions and if that didn't come to pass people were going to just start building their own yeah that's also one of the reasons why xiaomi and the cyberpunks didn't always get along as well the other there was also patents that did debates between them but yeah because like finn explained there were actually some ways in which ecas users could be de-anonymized it would there were a couple of it would for example required the spender and the bank to cooperate but anyways so there were some weaknesses and cypherpunks really really didn't like that so they and then they couldn't build their own version of it because chelm had the patent so there was friction there but yeah thought the cyberpunks were actually too radical they were too radical for his taste like the stuff i just explained about tim may's vision of a anarchy and crypto anarchy chelm wasn't really on board with that so that was um so yeah he did make this prediction in indeed finn is right he made his prediction to congress that if something like ecash wouldn't be adopted but then something more radical would come along and here we are here so that was back in the 90s and there was another development this was proposed in 1992 which was proof of work and it was just proposed in a paper and obviously that's a key technology in bitcoin who developed that and how does it work and what was the original purpose of yeah so the first version was developed by uh what's internet dwar and naur yeah cynthia cynthia dwork yeah dork and nauer yeah so it was meant as postage i i know i'm not exactly i've never interviewed have you interviewed them finn and beckle yeah i've chatted with adam back a lot of course who reinvented it so just tell i'll just tell you you're adam beck's version of the story is that okay because i know more about that yeah and i think that the motivations were similar i think like they wanted to invent the same thing and the back inventors reinvented uh individually a couple years later so yeah the idea was that during the 90s you know around the mid 90s spam was becoming an issue email spam just you know it's free to send as many emails as you want so you can sell send 10 million emails trying to sell penis enlargements or whatever you're spamming and then there was also the thing with the cypherpunks they had remailers so they were offering technology that would allow you to email through them and you could email through a network of remailers and that it's kind of like torque today that's similar technology so you could use that but these were being spammed as well people were just sending spam through these remailers so that was costing all sorts of resources for the people that were running these remailers which included a lot of cypherpunks they they would run that stuff themselves to offer privacy to anyone who wants it but so yeah it was being abused so they were starting to think about how can we counter this abuse and they will start to think in the in the direction of postage for the internet but then the question is how do we do a postage now one way i should note one another solution to deal with spam is to have it banned by the government but the problem with having having it banned by the government is that you get the government involved in deciding what kind of data people can send to each other and the cypherpunks really didn't like idea at this idea in part because you know this would be the camel's nose under the tent that's the english expression right like if you if you let government decide that then who knows what else they'll decide and it will end with like driver's licenses for the internet and and also so they wanted to come up with their own solution for that and the solution that we're thinking is like we need a post system so we need something that resembles postage there were a couple of ideas about this one idea resembles ecas just use ecash's posters but postage but ecats wasn't really ready yet and they had their own problems and all of that so then at some points at the back came up with the solution of proof of work hash cache which meant that there were implementation details that could differ but the general idea was that if you mail someone then you need to actually first solve like a puzzle it's not really a puzzle actually george and that was version was a puzzle and i'm back a bit different but you need to prove that you uh spend energy which means you hash the email a bunch of times until you get a hash of the email that would be considered valid by whoever is accepting um the email and because not all of the hashes would be considered valid by the protocol you'd have to try a bunch of times this cost a little bit of energy and only if you've done that they will accept the email otherwise it will just bounce now the idea is that if you're sending an email alone it would just cost you five seconds of computing power or something like that so it's not really a big deal if you're a spammer trying to send out penis enlargements emails you have to do that 10 million times and that's 10 million times times 5 seconds and now all of a sudden it's going to be super expensive to spam everyone in the world or spam these remailers so that's at least adam's back motivation for coming up with that i'm assuming dwarf and nar had a similar idea of the problem and just for people uh because now we're getting a little bit technical um and i know not all my audience is very technical but a hash is like a random string of numbers and letters and it's kind of hard to create but easy to reverse an engineer to check it and verify it and so that that's you know it's common kind of commonly used now in bitcoin and cryptocurrencies but now let's just talk about hashcash um you know we've been talking about adam back and in 1997 and currently adam is well known he's the co-founder and ceo of blockstream um and in 1997 he proposed hashcash to the cypherpunk mailing list and so who was he at that time and what was hash cash uh and how did it work i think yeah i think this is it's been it's been very well explained kind of the the goal and i think one crucial thing to understand about how adam was proposing it was that um he it begins like in in many ways part of what he's worked out is a a technology with a lot of different potential applications that people can start kind of uh you know feeling out what it's going to be like and he writes this kind of series of of papers and proposals and emails which are pretty fascinating because you can actually watch the idea evolve right where it starts as thinking you know as of thinking of it as like some kind of postage system and one particular aspect of that to understand is that hashcash would be unique right like each um i i believe the exact way that this worked involved the notion right because the hashes is you know this sort of you know string of data and you can set particular parameters around like how you know unlikely you want that version to be so that you can essentially escalate the amount of work that it takes but nonetheless it's a it's a string of data that's based on existing data and so part of the original sort of system for hash cache was the idea that the original data would be for example your email the exact time stamp when it was sent the from n2 and so on the reason for that was that that would make it so that um a spammer could not simply like generate hashcash in five seconds and then just you know control c control v onto 10 million emails so the ideas that has to be like uniquely generated for each message so the reason why that's especially interesting is that it begins to dawn on all of the kind of the circle that back was working with the larger kind of cypherpunk community that if there could be a way that you could use cash to not just create like unique one-off like you know bits of proof of work for particular emails but as some kind of effort limiter that you could like reuse or link to some like larger project well there might be a lot more that you could do with this technology so in i believe it's 2002 back has been reading and thinking about some posts by uh who is become obviously like very kind of very famous and in our world in our in our community for um coming up with uh the b money model and a variety of different kinds of ways of thinking about uh digital currency and making a lot of contributions to cryptography more broadly and part of the the premise of b money is that okay what if we had a kind of digital currency that we could exchange and that all of the people who held it could collectively be part of the as it were bank that issued it and and back is begins to talk about well what if you could actually use hashcash as a kind of minting mechanism for a currency right so you could actually use hashcash as a way of saying we will make it you know this level of difficult to produce new currency and then if there's too much currency floating around the community can make it this level of difficult and slow down the production of new currency for a while you know there's a lot of different ways of thinking about this but now you can start to see an answer to that question of not just what stops double spending but what stops you from flooding the market by control c control v in your currency over and over again well maybe the answer is a hash cache cash-like tool that can like slow down or moderate or demand work for the production of digital money and so that's where we see how ever used um there were some interesting like test versions and there have been a like other applications that are not in this exact lineage of people using these kind of like small scale proofs of work um but the as far as like being applied to money goes i don't know from the institutional side but from the cypherpunk side i believe people start really exploring how to use these ideas and they always credit back and they're all in conversation with each other but it doesn't necessarily take the form of hashcash as such right like they definitely were actually able to get it to run like we have you know emails that hal finney was sending that are kind of experimenting with hash cash but when we start to see it actually being used it's often in the form of something like hal finney's reversible proofs of work system where he basically said like he came up with a really ingenious way to have proofs of work that you could generate that you could then essentially turn into a server that would say like okay this has been deposited with me i'm going to verify that this is still valuable and then i'm going to issue it again that someone else can use it in an exchange so we can see the premises of digital currencies appearing based on hash cash but that's kind of where they're already starting to mutate it turned out that if you put a hash cash filter on your email inbox and no one is using hash cash then you're never getting any emails so it sort of had this chicken and egg it had sort of this chicken and egg problem and as hash cash for email or that never really caught on but like finn said it was like a it was a major milestone what it sort of did was it it tied real world resources namely energy and it tied it into the digital world so now you had something digital that proved that it that it had real world resources um being burned in in this in this case like it tied the real world to the digital world that was sort of the big and that's why people start thinking about it in terms of money because yeah for money you need money needs to be scarce that's one of the things money needs to be so if you can tie real world scarcity to it then that works the problem with hash cash as money was that computers get faster every year much faster every year so then it gets much harder you know you have this risk of inflation and if you have a certain difficulty for which hash cash would have had then it gets easier to create new money every year and after a couple of years you know the system gets overrun by inflation cheap money and like finn said so yeah that was sort of the next problem they had solved like how do we solve this inflation problem and that turned out not to be so easy yeah and eventually it did get results with bitcoin um but before we get to that um two things so first let's just very briefly talk about who hal finney was because he's so important and we haven't really discussed him and then we'll talk about b money because that was the next um additional currency so just very briefly who was hal finney alfini was a digital currency enthusiast from the earliest days he was on the extrovery mailing list where index showed me in meetings where he was already you know that was sort of his thing digital cache and then he became part of the cypherpunks and again he was always on the on the sort of front line of the discussion of digital cash and what it should be and every time someone had a proposal he was the first to jump on it review it explain it to others um at some point he created his own digital currency arpaul which finn briefly mentioned which was based on proof of work and had this um the same type of chip that i mentioned in the context of xiaomi systems with this there's a better term for it which is escaping me though unforgivable type of chip that's what they use but you have helveni was always there he was always on the front line of uh digital currency discussions debate review he was very much a figure of um and i feel like it's really important to like capture the way that when you look back over the history of digital cash like he's he's always there just just as was said right like to the point of being um you know like nakamoto's correspondent and like you know key figure in the very earliest days of bitcoin but he was also um in a way that i want to like you know especially because he passed away you know quite young relatively and very you know tragically and unfortunately um that he also had uh a real role of like uh emotional leadership in a lot of ways like through the whole history of this when he was you know just arguing with uh cypherpunks about directions that they could be developing digital cache tools um he said that uh and this always really struck me in the context of you know this you know just mailing list where people are arguing over technical points he said we may look back on this and understand that this was the most important work that we have ever done you know like he was really someone who kind of like carried the torch for a lot of these projects um but yeah so he uh and he is he is uh um someone as well i think helps us kind of segue maybe into the bitcoin year a little bit because he really like you know carried a lot of these same projects and ideas and questions straight from the periods we've been talking about into nakamoto's uh publication it was it was also just to mention that he was also a major contributor to gpg in the early days oh oh pgp am i saying that right yeah yeah pretty good privacy which is it would just remind me what that that's it's a protocol for is it encrypted or publicly a cryptography yes to communicate which was sort of the first implementation of that idea that whitfield diffie and hellman invented okay yeah and so yeah let's move on to b money which brings in another character who's really important in 1998 wei dai proposed b money and aaron in an article on b money you called it bitcoin's first draft and i remember when i read about it in finn's book i made a little note is b money the closest precursor to bitcoin because when i was reading it i was like whoa um but let's talk about um you know who was wei dai and then uh erin why did you call b money a first draft of bitcoin well i actually had to correct that laura i i think i mentioned it in a note in the article because it turned out that bit goals and so there was sabo's proposal and b money i think bitcoin actually um pre-dated b-money i didn't know that when i wrote the article but it was very close like they were discussing on the same mailing list zabo and why they and others they were on the same age it's not just the cypherpunk mailings also another one um so it's you know they're temporary contemporaries that's that's the word right it was same time but yeah b money what's interesting about b money several things are interesting about b money but one of the things that is interesting about me money i finn mentioned this i think is this idea that the ledger of ownership of the currency itself in chelm's case at digicas this was centralized and this meant actually they had a play money version of ecash as well as well and people start to value this and they actually it was called cyberbucks and people actually had this play money but they started to value it so it was sort of working as money but then when digicast went down then all of a sudden suddenly the central server was down so their money was gone right so it had this central point of failure b money was one of the first attempts to solve this so instead of a central point he said instead of a central surfer that was maintaining maintaining the balances of everyone they shared this now it's a little bit hand-wavy how they would have done this and how they would have solved certain problems or to put it differently they didn't solve all the problems but it was a big step but that was i think that was i would say that was probably the most important idea that's what i focused my article on at least that's the the ownership of balances was maintained on the did this decentralized distributed ledger every time someone makes a payment everyone updates their ledgers so everyone has the same idea of who owns what not just one person so anyone there's no central no nothing can be shut down nothing no one can cheat no individual can cheat about how much they own because then the rest of the network would just notice that and not accept that version um there's no pressure point for the government to targets and to maybe install all sorts of regulation um or or you know this sort of it by decentralizing this distributing the ownership of currency that was a you you get you do away with the central point of failure i would say that was the big innovation that both b money and bit gold around the same time uh brought to the world and what was the flaw in b money like why didn't it go anywhere uh there were a couple of problems with it i would say one problem was it's well so for example the double spending problem was not really solved because if i you know if i copy my coin so to say and send the same transaction well the same coin to two different people on two different parts of the network and they do it at the same time then they are have they both haven't updated their ledger yet for the other transactions so it sort of conflicts then they're both gonna argue that their transaction was first and there's no way for the network to sort of resolve this now he had some sort of idea of maybe having tires of users where some users would be sort of like power users and others would be more like client users and then these power users would have to sort out which who was first another problem i would say is how to get the money into circulation um he had some ideas about it he had some idea about you know either these power users could figure out how much new currency was needed and based on that adjust the uh proof of work difficulty like finn just mentioned there were some other sort of rough ideas but that's how i would describe him they were rough ideas he was almost it wasn't that this it wasn't the final design of a system that could have been implemented it was a great innovation in that it was a good idea but it wasn't quite the details were so a little bit murky and hand-wavy and one thing that was interesting was what you described with the power users uh they would kind of obtain that position by putting down a deposit which could be slashed and so it's essentially a proof-of-stake system or what we would recognize as that today and i found that pretty fascinating and there was another difference which is that b money uh had a different monetary policy from bitcoin um what was its monetary policy yeah so my day's main idea was that there would be a basket of goats in the same way that we have a basket of goods now and central banks used this to sort of manage inflation so that would be a basket of goods and oh i have to think about this it's been a while since i wrote that article every time someone hashes a new thing it should be worth that basket of goods so ah it's a long time well the main thing is he wanted it to be a stable currency he did not believe in yeah that's for sure that was the goal it was very much like yeah it was it was a way of kind of um reinventing the you know the notional goals of the central bank for a way that like the kind of power users who are holding the currency would be able to to act in its best interest as a kind of central bank but with some really interesting like yeah kind of almost computational like ratchet mechanisms that would sort of help them have the tools to keep that value constant but yeah it's very it's i mean i think it's also really interesting to look back at things like this and likewise that um at a bit gold as well and to kind of see them as examples of things that we're really trying to think about what long-term stability would look like for a digital currency right like you know with all due respect to the extropians they were not afraid of like bubbles or you know crazy runaway speculative booms because those might be the accelerants that they would need to sort of you know crank up the motor of you know far future innovation and it's it's really interesting to look at some of these and see the ways that people were trying to look at uh gold we're speculatively talking about baskets of goods we're looking at inflation management we're trying to kind of think about how you would create something that would be more about um stability as a store of value over time rather than like volatility as a speculative instrument and so pick gold i guess was developed by nick zabo around this time but i don't think he publicly described it until 2005 and he had actually worked at digicash under chum um what else can you tell us about who nick zabo was at that time and then um tell us a little bit more about the characteristics of bitgold yeah it was definitely early cypherpunk as well although he wasn't as active on the list later on i think he was mostly active in the early days and you really care about privacy and these things i would say uh you said yeah he only publicly posted the idea for bit cold on his blog in like 2005 but it was definitely it was so this was the other mailing list i mentioned they had another mailing list with white eye for example and apparently that's where he posted it around the same time like 1998 privacy-minded uh very libertarian inspired by tim a tim a was sort of you know the sort of crypto anarchy ideal that was there was a big expiration for a lot of them not all of them some were a little bit more uh um not less radical you could say but uh for nick zaba was definitely uh into the whole crypto anarchy thing and so we get into big gold yeah so bitcoins also use proof of work um the way bitcoins did it was there was it started with like a candidate string so that was a string of numbers and then anyone could perform proof of work on top of that string so create a hash and like we've explained before not all hashes are valid so it needs to you need to prove that you only certain as your valid which means you've invested energy okay then you get a new string if you win a new string that string is yours like you sort of it becomes your ownership it gets tied to your public key it's it's yours to have so the string itself is like the money the other thing is that the string becomes the new candidate string so we started with a candidate string it was hashed you have a winning hash that becomes someone money and now the new hash is always also a candidate string so someone else can start hashing on that on the can on on that string and that that's how you get like a string of ashes so that resembles bitcoin quite a bit right it's also got this string of hashes which is sort of which is the blockchain so this was embedded in a bit gold so everyone's winning this strings the strings is money now one of the problems is like we've discussed before computers are getting faster every year so it gets easier to develop to find new strings every year now this becomes a problem because if i have a string that i found five years ago and it cost me you know five days and we're ten years we're five years later and you get a string within five minutes because your computer is so much faster you know are they really worth the same that's that's not really you know this doesn't really work well um so you know ideally they should be equally hard to find but that's another guy so they so then he had another layer where these strings would be traded against each other and that's how the value of the different strings would be sort of measured against each other so newer strings would be worth less than older strings and then there was there were sort of banks that would bundle these strings and that's how you would get sort of an equal unit of account where one old string is like worth ten new strings so what you've got two bundles one bundle has just one old string one button there was two ten new strings and these are sort of caught up and then you have money like this these make for the units of count that was bit gold's idea and i i just wanted to emphasize that one kind of thread in in zavo's work that we can also see in um in big gold is and another kind of way of thinking about the set of problems to solve was that um uh it was also trying to find a way to remove all of the so-called trusted third parties right like to to remove you know anyone who would be to remove any institution or person that you would have to trust to for example authenticate the value of something or to enable the transaction of something or to that you would trust in the production of the token of value you know and so on so like it's it's useful to think about these as a set of technologies that are all trying to slowly subtract the trusted third parties on which people normally rely in their transactions of money yeah but nick sabo didn't really solve that problem right yeah no no right yeah he wants to like that was the goal that was the idea with the distributed ledger but then it was you know that's a very hard problem to solve it turns out and you know he came up with um so that's called byzantine fault they were like the type of systems that maybe airplanes would use like the several of the computers must all fail at the same time and but then it becomes tricky like who's actually running these computers and he for example didn't really solve the civil problem which is you know anyone can fire up a thousand fake nodes you know the stock puppet problem and then sort of mess with consensus and you know all lie about who owns what and then you're joining the system as a new user and everyone's you know all of these thousands of stock puppets are telling you one thing and then these other computers these other nodes are telling you another who's telling the truth this wasn't a very properly solved system yet for bitgold that was a big challenge and so then after that satoshi did come out with bitcoin in what ways did bitcoin improve upon bickles i so bitcoin did something extremely clever satoshi did something extremely clever because he solved two big problems at once so one problem we've been dealing with is how do you get currency into circulation and the other problem is how do you get everyone to agree on the state of balances now satoshi actually tied these things together so there's one way of getting new currency into circulation which is through proof of work and by the way in satoshi's in bitcoin it's not the process of work themselves in their money you know it's just a way to determine who gets the new money so there's sort of another abstraction layer there as well which i think is also very important by the way so that's one thing there's sort of this lottery of who gets uh the new money and then the winner of this lottery also has the right to determine i'm simplifying but gets the right to determine okay this is the real st you know if there's if there isn't consensus then this is now the consensus to you know the winner gets to decide if there's two winners at the same time in coincidence then it's the next winner after that and then ultimately this is how it resolves so it's these two problems that were solved in the same same solution which is you know that's sort of the brilliance of bitcoin i think and we talked about hal finney a little bit earlier and he was crucial to the launch of bitcoin can we just tell a little bit about that story yeah i mean um uh you know finney was was on that mailing list and and responded really promptly i mean one thing that is often forgotten when we look back at bitcoin um is how um how dubiously it was initially greeted at the very very first instance the reason being right the dubiousness was because a lot of the people who were on that list had you know some many of them were people we've already talked about today or they were sort of people in the same milieu as a lot of the people we talked about today they'd seen digital you know digital cash projects come and go they'd like tried them out they'd kick the tires on them maybe some of them remembered the days of like ghost marks and tacky tokens and all these various sort of experiments and projects and and stabs and so there was a fair amount of um you know kind of early uh you know you know just just people who are like well dude you did you didn't think about this or this is probably going to happen or you really need to kind of map this out and i think finney is really important both because he provides a bunch of concrete you know technical advice and ideas about refining the project and kind of figuring out what it's what it's trajectory of improvement is going to be as it goes from white paper to working code but finney also was kind of one of the most important cheerleaders you know the person who could say i really think there's something here and i think there's something that actually you know like finney was was able to you know both because he was really looking for something like this but also because i think in a lot of ways he was very discerning about exactly the fact that this had in fact solved a couple of pre-existing problems that no one had ever figured out how to address certainly not as elegantly and it tied those solutions together into a new package into a new way that money could be so finney was someone who in a lot of ways like maybe i don't know i'm not sure you know it can be room for disagreement on whether or not this is actually the case but i i'm really curious if bitcoin would have become another like kind of also ran draft towards you know the next version of this technology were it not for the fact that finney had really helped to like keep it all rolling forward yeah and was crucial because he was receiving the the transactions and i would i would add that i think finney apart from maybe satoshi i don't even know about satoshi but i think finney has the first sort of quote that i think shows that he understood sort of the value proposition of bitcoin or understood why its value would or could bootstrap right which is this digital scarcity which is that because it's interesting did a lot of work on prediction markets as well i don't i won't get into prediction markets entirely but it's sort of predicting the future with tokens it it has a lot of like odds related like what what are the odds of something happening and then vinnie sort of did the math like what are the odds of bitcoin succeeding maybe very small but what are the and what it what would the bitcoin be worth then and then if you sort of do the math then he concluded well that means if there is any chance of bitcoin succeeding then it's got to have some value because the odds like it can't be zero like there's got to be some value and that's how uh i you know that's sort of how bitcoins value bootstrap through the scarcity and through this sort of odds you know thinking and odds i i thought that was a great early quote by vinnie where he sort of understood why this could actually be big and might as well you know it's gonna have some value and then from there it could bootstrap i think the quote was that he looked at the value of all the money in the world and then said well if the cap on bitcoin is 21 million then one coin will be worth 10 million dollars um if it does overtake all the the value of all the money in the world yeah and then you can think how much would it cost to mine one and then you can sort of do the odds like is it and then i think the math he got to is like if there's if the chance is even 100 million to one that it will succeed then you should probably get some because you're getting a good deal yeah and so amongst all the precursors who did satoshi credit the most or which previous attempts did satoshi rely on most heavily i actually have an unusual answer for this which is um right so there's a couple of people that we haven't talked about i mean this is maybe a very like dry historians kind of interest but one thing that fascinates me is the relative lack of overlap between academic computer science and like kind of cypherpunk computer science or like kind of hacker digital cache development that people would keep kind of reinventing things on both sides without necessarily knowing that the other side had done it yet so there's a bunch of people many of whom we've already talked about you know wei dai adam back like people that that nakamamoto was in touch with and was drawing on but um the people who get cited in the in the white paper are uh two computer scientists named haber and stornetta and and theirs is a really interesting story because in a lot of ways they invented the first block chain but they didn't invent it for money right they invented it as a way of irrefutably and publicly timestamping documents and their particular interest was uh was actually kind of an amazing one to think about when we look at how bitcoin now works which is um right so you have like benched lab notebooks where you write in your results and there's all these physical mechanisms that make it so that we can be sure that you aren't like fiddling with your numbers after the fact you know there's like numbered pages sewn in bindings they said how do we do that digitally we come up with a publicly verifiable mechanism no trusted third parties that relies on blockchain technology in their kind of earliest form and then we will periodically publish the verification hash in the lost and found section of the new york times and everyone can use it to prove to themselves that this system is still is still working so the reason why i say that is i think that's one other thread that i think is really worth remembering in all this is that there's this whole history of like changing the world through currency but then there's also a more abstract but equally important history which is how do you irrefutably timestamp something digitally how do you create a digital mechanism that allows you to say in a way that everyone can trust that this happened at such such a time um and so that and that i think is something we can really see in all the ways in which bitcoin itself then like led to all of these other blockchain applications that have continued to kind of run with um the the way that it was reintroduced through bitcoin but then are now using it for lots of different kinds of proofs aaron do you yeah well well i can't i don't know satoshi i can't look into his mind i don't know who inspired him to what extent i will say you know if i'm just looking at the different projects that we've discussed or that are out there then bit gold is really pretty similar to bitcoin it was like getting pretty close and it's uh you know it's notable that zaba wasn't mentioned in the white paper satoshi did later mention that bitcoin was an implementation of bitcoin somewhere on the bitcoin talk forums so i know i i can't make any claims on behalf of satoshi and i'm not gonna i'll just from my own perspective bitcoins looks awful a lot like bitcoin and who did you come to believe was the most likely candidate or candidates to be satoshi nakamoto i don't i don't care i mean i don't it doesn't matter it doesn't matter laura he he wanted to remain anonymous that's my answer yeah i have a little bit of a uh a really honest answer even though it sounds like a historian's like head fake which is basically that i think that um culturally historically the fact that nakamoto not just is anonymous but could be anonymous and still have this level of effect is actually far more consequential than any specific known identity could be i think it tells us a lot more about the context and the goals and the sort of historical situation of bitcoin than if we could definitively say that it was this or that person you guys and it matters it matters a lot as well though we don't know and like it's synonymous because that's the whole point of bitcoin it can operate without anyone in charge of it or without anyone leading it's like that's why it's so brilliant sorry laura that's that's the only answer i'm gonna give you i know why you asked but you know this is yeah i was just about to say you guys both copped out but but
