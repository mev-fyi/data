consumer apps have the empty room problem that's really commonly known in the startup world metaverse is an empty world problem it's even worse because now you require all these humans to coordinate to meet in a metaverse all at the same time across all time zones and hopefully you'll have a great conversation but that doesn't really happen right so our thinking is that well if we can't coordinate all these humans to be in these spaces what else can we do you know in the gaming world since the 80s you have the new Zelda game that came out imagine playing Zelda where there's no creatures and there's no characters to talk to you're just walking aimlessly in this beautiful world but doing what are you doing in this world and so in this same context we need to populate these empty worlds these metaverses these autonomous worlds with NPCs that can talk have personality can perform on chain action that's what gives the liveliness of these worlds it makes it alive
