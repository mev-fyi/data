as they always say if at first you don't succeed be a rich dude in crypto do zoo and Kyle Davies the founders of the bankrupt crypto hedge fund 3ac are back they're launching an exchange for insolvent crypto claims which feels a little bit like giving people paper cuts and then charging for overpriced Band-Aids one of the premises of their company open exchange is to offer claimants for bankrupt funds like FTX and Celsius the chance to be made whole given that FTS claims right now are trading at 20 cents on the dollar it's possible that their definition of whole is the same as SBS Adventure successfully raised 25 million dollars from investors which does make me wonder if the vibe in VC right now is like what's there to lose CEO Leslie lamb has said that the goal of the new fund is to help the crypto industry and let me just say we love a pivot 3ac case is not settled and U.S authorities have actually issued a subpoena to Kyle Davies via Twitter you know that Twitter could be used to issue subpoenas I didn't but to me it's no crazier than the idea that FTS claimants could be made whole
