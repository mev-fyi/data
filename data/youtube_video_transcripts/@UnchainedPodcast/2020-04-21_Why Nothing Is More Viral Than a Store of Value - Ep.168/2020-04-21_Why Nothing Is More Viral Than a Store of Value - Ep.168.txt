CEO and CIO of arc and best and you see Nell mantra argh invest blockchain crypto analyst welcome Cathy and you seen very happy to be here Laura great to speak with you great to be here Laura thank you for having us Cathy let's start with you arc invest focused solely on disruptive innovation how do you define that and why do you believe that blockchain technology is one of those disruptive technologies well we define innovation platforms with three characteristics the first one is that they follow a declining cost curve they're technologically enabled they have learning curves and they follow a declining cost curve think think Moore's Law except we have adapted a different lights a relative of Moore's law it's called rights law and I can get into that if you'd like oh okay rights law effectively developed by mr. right in the early days of airplane manufacturing says for every cumulative doubling in the number of units produced costs decline at a consistent rate for any new technology and so you can see how it's it's a relatively Moore's Law Moore's Law is a function of time and rights law is a function of units or production and so and it's much more reliable and can be applied to any technology it's even more reliable for the semiconductor industry again because it's a function of units as opposed to time and there's been a slowdown recently in semiconductors so that's the first learning curve or declining cost curve and and from that we are able to learn when a new technology is ready for prime time and the way we find that out is we say ok for every percentage decline in costs or price how much does demand increase and what you found in the early days of the internet or in the internet bubble you found that we weren't ready for prime time for a lot of a lot of things and the most provocative example there is you know we thought we were going to sequence every person's genome with DNA sequencing technology because we had just sequence the first human genome and we were going to have precision medicine you know I I deal for each person and of course the first whole human genome took 2.7 billion dollars to to map and it took 13 years of computing power we were not ready for primetime I'm not ready for primetime we're just getting ready for primetime now below $1,000 soon to be $100 and healthcare world is going to transform completely so that's the first cost declines rights law the second is that these platforms cut across economic sectors and the reason that's important is because every time costs go down you really would like to unleash more and more demand so the more sectors that an innovation platform touches the bigger the opportunity to transform the world and and that the third even in what will continue with DNA sequencing men many people think that is just for health care it is not it is also for agriculture very importantly for agriculture and any living organism you know whether its animals or plants fish or what-have-you so is going to touch a lot more than human health care and health care here in this country is 20% of GDP so that already is a big big prospective market tam total available market but then you must think beyond that to any anything that's a living organism and can be sequenced and then the third characteristic so rights law cutting across sectors and then the third characteristic is it becomes a launching pad for for more technology new technologies so just to follow with the healthcare the sequencing one DNA sequencing has been the launching pad for CRISPR gene editing so gene editing or Chris I mean DNA sequencing can read the genome and we are able to identify mutations that evolve in our genomes from year to year and CRISPR gene editing ultimately we'll be able to correct those programming errors and cure disease now we're in the early stages of that now but we think it's extremely promising could not have happened without without DNA sequencing and DNA sequencing couldn't have happened without the computing age so these technologies are building one on top of the other if this is just so fascinating because like as you're talking I can already kind of map how those three criteria you know led you to Bitcoin and I know that in September 2015 arc became the first public fund manager to invest in Bitcoin so can you walk us through like how how that happened yes okay so absolutely when we started the firm in 2014 we we had broken the platforms out by DNA sequencing robotics energy storage and next-generation Internet and as we were evolving the research associated with each of those platforms we were doing more and more research on blockchain technology and Bitcoin and as you as you know Chris Byrne iski was our first our first crypto analyst yes seen Elm Andhra handpicked by Chris our second and and so we've said as we were exploring it and understanding it more and more and really understanding Bitcoin to you know that this wasn't just just next-generation and Internet technology that this was you know potentially the first digital currency and the first global means of whether it means if exchanged or a value unit of account we said we have got to break this out and separate it from the next-generation internet because it's it could influence every sector as we began to understand what this really was and it is going to be the launching pad for much more innovation going forward so it started as next-generation Internet hey this is interesting the internet was never conceived with commerce in mind in fact until 1991 people forget this even I forgot it until I heard Steve Case a given presentation before I gave one and he said that it was illegal before 1991 and I believe it was called the Communications Act of 1991 there was some some act it was illegal for consumers to to transact over the Internet to do anything over the Internet consumers really weren't supposed to be using the Internet this was for academia it was for research it was for government it was for DARPA and then we unlocked it in early 91 so back then the internet was never conceived with Commerce in mind and so it never it never included a payments platform as a part of the infrastructure this and we were then looking as we learned more and more about Bitcoin and blockchain technology we said okay this is the missing link you know what we've been doing over the internet paying for things with credit cards and that's kludgy and there are all kinds of security risks and what were we thinking well we were thinking about it appropriately in the early days because the knock on the internet and on Amazon is nobody was going to transact over the Internet it's totally insecure [Laughter] convenience trumped security and and each of these companies who developed on on top of the Internet understood that security was mission-critical for them so they each had to develop their own form of security right or make sure to harness all the security software out there and then you know encrypted or make it their own in some way shape or form well this is this this was what blocked or this is what should have happened in the very early days of the internet now with Bitcoin and digital currencies generally and you know blockchain technology I believe where we're going to reorient how we do things even around the internet going forward yeah yeah and it's already happening before I forget to kind of echo Kathy's point there I think what we're starting to realize now is that really the frontier of economic activity is increasingly pushed into this digital world and so now kind of the need for these new novel institutions to reliably enforce and provide what we like to define as assurances to wealth the increasingly important and so I think beyond just this idea of a native Bunny understanding that crypto networks in particular Bitcoin are these novel social and economic institutions that unlock these new modes of human organization becomes all the more relevant in the context of kind of Cathy's dissemination of the history of what got us here to begin with yeah so you've seen it why don't you give us the background on how you came to work at arc and what it is that you do there sure so I cover crypto assets and blockchain at arc I joined in July of 2018 so shortly after Chris arks former crypto analyst left to start placeholder and so really Chris handed me the baton and I'm been very fortunate since to have a chance to fall into the crypto rabbit hole as a full-time job prior to that I was in school so I went to University of Pennsylvania and double majored in systems engineering and finance and during my time in college I was very fortunate to you know intern at a venture capital fund in the valley in which they kind of gave me an opportunity to look into crypto from both an investment and tech perspectives and I found that what I was studying really this marriage between management and technology between economics and technology seemed extremely symbiotic with kind of the crypto space more broadly and so there I was like I definitely just want to do this full-time and believe it or not I found arc through Twitter I had seen Chris at one of his book signings he had posted a tweet that he was gonna have a book signing in New York and so I the next day booked a ticket 5:00 a.m. to go up to New York there I met Chris and I had met Kathy for the first time as well and I would say the rest is history and I have heard you talk about how you initially got into Bitcoin then discovered aetherium but then came back to bitcoins so what do you mean by that and and why did you come back to pick sure so I think a few things I would say that there I initially kind of got in actually just as uh my father had come to me randomly and said are there any interesting investment opportunities that I'm not that I'm currently not aware of and you know Bitcoin and was always in the back of my mind I had never really kind of fallen deep into the rabbit hole and was given the kind of that opportunity to do so and so when I look when it when you look at it from kind of an investment perspective I was very kind of fascinated by what many consider to be this new asset class and looking at kind of Bitcoin as really that starting point but not really the most interesting thing out there enter etherium where you know bitcoin has extremely is limited in its capabilities and its performance and provides specific guarantees but that obviously comes at the cost of being quote-unquote scalable and so when you think about kind of new forms of these decentralized information networks like etherium they provide kind of massive amounts of feature sets that something like bitcoin cannot provide and so intuitively it seemed like you know bitcoin would be something kind of far less interesting than the thousand other crypto assets that were out there and really bitcoin was the myspace to Facebook as I started to kind of realize from an investment standpoint where I think most value is going to accrue and kind of what made Bitcoin so unique and why it was at specific value propositions that quite frankly I think are very difficult to replicate it goes back to really what what these represent and and so in this idea of providing kind of assurances to wealth where you know the transition to a digitally dominated economy has brought rise to these institutional technologies that are supposed to provide you know specific assurances that compete with financial institutions that compete with governments that compete with markets that compete with firms and so this idea of kind of having an accessible digital foundation that offers strong assurances and consistently enforce these assurances m'as something that became I would say much much more compelling than kind of the thesis that we tend to see in things beyond Bitcoin so as we transition into this digitally dominant world I think having these assurances to wealth everything from kind of reducing the risk of expropriation and seizure to you know reducing the the risk of arbitrary rules to monetary policy everything from kind of lowering barriers to freely transmit and store value and doing all this in a really audible and native way to me felt much more compelling than kind of trying to reverse or flip the internet stack and so that's ultimately why I came back to Bitcoin and and find that - at least for me be the most interesting thing in kind of this space that that is very interesting it holistically so yeah and this so this space is like wild on its own but then obviously now for the last month or a few months we've had another wild card thrown into the mix which is the corona virus and I when I was doing the research even like very recent articles just you know when I was reading them I was wondering hmm I wonder if you know Kathy would answer or or you seen or you know if either of you would answer the questions the same way and so Kathy actually I saw that there was this Bloomberg article about arc from February and it praised your arc innovation ETF as quote the best performer among 584 funds with at least one billion dollars of assets in the global equity market crushing the likes of Blackrock with a return of 165 percent over the past three years and then it said that you be 99 percent of of the others in your category since art became a registered investment advisor in 2014 and you know just looking at I was like okay so February is such a different time from now and in with such an ETF where you know you're placing bets on newer technology which by definition our risk how does something like that perform at a time like this and no you know I don't know what you would call this time like would you say we're in an economic crisis like I'm kind of curious how you would characterize what's happening okay so I will separate this into two parts and talk about what we think is going on and then and then how we've performed okay yeah okay so my background is economics and that's why it was so easy for me to be taken by by Bitcoin by the way I think it's a real it's a really good background to have in order to understand what's going on on the Bitcoin front but so I and my mentor is art Laffer I don't know if that name rings a bell he's in the economics world he's famous or something called the Laffer curve and supply-side economics and he actually is advising President Trump pretty regularly now so because I've been in the business for so long I started in college in the late 70s I've seen ten crises Verte and that includes recessions and they very summer recessions and others are shocks I would categorize what we've just been through as a shock it's an exogenous shock a healthcare crisis this did not start with the economy it started with the corona virus so a shock there have been two other shocks in my experience as an investor the first was in October of 1987 and there was something called a day called Black Monday during Black Monday the stock market dropped almost 25% in one day which is worse than what has happened this go-around and in any one day and the reason was there was something called portfolio insurance that had been developed at the time and it had become so popular that when everybody started you know basically relying on the insurance and trying to get out the door at the same time it failed and and that's what took the market down there was a panic and I the second shock was 9/11 9/11 was you know a terrorist attack a terrible thing but again exogenous so both of these were exogenous one was a portfolio insurance gone wrong it was not well designed and and maybe not even honestly designed I don't know and then the second was a terrorist attack neither of those were started because of failures in monetary or fiscal policy they were outside from outside the economic system and what happened during those periods was the trends that were in motion before those shocks took place basically remained in motion you went through maybe a two three four month period where the shock had people on edge and activity was subdued but we got through that and in the 80s we continued along the bull market and very strong economic growth in the early 2000s 2001 we were in the middle of the tech and telecom path bust we continued along that line for another 18 months and this time around we had entered with the economy in an extremely strong position and it was from a couple of angles the consume consumer spending was very strong and the consumer saving rate was eight percent roughly eight percent very high by historical standards it had doubled in the last five to eight years and so the consumer had a nice not all consumers of course this is devastating what's happening now for certain consumers but on average the consumer had a good level of savings relative to historical standards you can go into the early parts or the later parts I think of 90 and early parts of to 2000s and see a saving rate of one or two percent so much higher then traditionally has been the case at the same time you had businesses who were they were fearful of a few things and had been actually pulling back on inventories and capital spending for almost 18 months and it wasn't a straight pull back in that inventories went down they just weren't keeping up with demand and the reason for businesses were so concerned is that we were in the middle of the china-us conflict trade conflict and the yield curves had inverted and yield curves historically within 12 to 18 months of an inversion yield curve an inverted yield curve was a harbinger of recession well the recession wasn't happening wasn't going to happen but you had businesses very conservatively postured you had consumers in a very good mood record confidence very high saving rate felt good you know felt secure and suddenly the shock if we're right and if the both the Fed and the administration have done the right things and and they're not all the right things they're throwing too much at this but we think in terms of fiscal policy the loans are a good idea to keep business is intact so that there's an infrastructure for employees to go back to so we think that they're doing enough of the right things and and will continue to do enough of the right things including perhaps a payroll tax holiday for the rest of this year to encourage much more activity to come back this year so we think we think that a both of them have and I think this is the reason the stock market has been doing so well it correct it correct anytime because we've moved up so quickly here I do think the trend that was in motion beforehand will continue after we get through these three to four months we'll end up in a v-shaped recovery very strong and businesses will have to race up to race to catch up to consumer demand so I actually won one question I wanted to ask about that because you know in the various comments I saw of yours online some of them were from kind of earlier before the unemployment figures that we have now which at the time of this recording are at about 17 million so has that changed your view at all about that v-shape recovery well what what I will know actually the v-shape will is because of this you know so just to explain that a little bit and and and in the context of the prior to shocks this shock is like the prior two combined and then you add some to it so it is the biggest of the three shocks and I think that I was concerned in the beginning when I saw the government they were there was a little bit of chaos there and I thought that that that that would cause you know a lot of bottlenecks in terms of getting checks out there and getting loans out there but they seem to be working through those and so I just heard recently that if you look at multi-dwelling residences ninety percent are paying their rent which is much better given the number you know the seventeen million that are that have filed for unemployment insurance claims you know these people are expecting to keep their jobs and want to continue to live in the same place and commercial tenants at least for this one organization which is very broad-based are paying 100% and this is as of yesterday well early April I will say they they are 100% paying their rents the biggest problem is in the retail and restaurant area where only 30% are paying so and there was that's where the that's where the help is targeted as well a lot of the help so I think if we just hold these businesses intact which is what this administration is trying to do and now that the Fed is actually buying commercial paper and taking a lot more of the short term funding risks out of the market again all of this is trying to tide us over for the next three to four months so that these these companies are still intact they may not be operating at a very high capacity but they're intact and there is a place for these employees to go back and we can start up again I think and especially the way the task force has been has been educating people about about what's going on they're saying look we're gonna come back really strongly now president Trump is saying you know V shape we're coming back stronger than ever before Mike Pence will temper that a bit and say yeah we're gonna do this safely and and so forth so you have that a little bit of that going on but I do think by the end of this year we're going to be surprised at how strong this economy is okay well let's say we're gonna um dive a little bit more into how the corona of I was coronavirus will impact also the crypto markets but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible in response to the challenging times crypto comm is introducing three measures to help the community first

please go to Kraken calm that's KRA ke n calm back to my conversation with Cathy wood and yes Enel mantra so in your view how do you think you know obviously like four years now and I think Kris Pearn iski actually was one of the people or he and Adam white wrote a paper that called this out all the way back in I think it was 2016 yes it talked about how yeah the the crypto markets or really it was it's mainly Bitcoin back then were uncorrelated to traditional markets and I was wondering if that's still held here in the time of the coronavirus or you know how you think if this virus will impact the crypto markets sure so I'll start and then hand off to Yasin because he's been updating that study as a matter of fact and we're going to put it out yep fairly shortly but just to start out I was obviously we all were watching what happened to to Bitcoin you know going down more than 50% into the 3,000 s when everybody assumed that the 200 week moving average which everyone had been trained on and we had started out that way actually at pointing out that hey it even in the riskiest of times it didn't hold it broke through that in in March and you know there was so much going on with with the rest of our world in equities that you know I was just looking at the court like I said wait a minute Yassine Gold keeps going up and Bitcoin has just crashed here what the heck is going on so certainly wasn't correlated to it was inversely correlated also a big surprise and you know you usually get these breakdowns when everybody assumes they've they've nailed it like that 200 week moving average when you've got so many people's a little but like portfolio insurance that I described in in 1987 and you can even say the same in the equity market there were a lot of low volatility strategies and risk parity strategies that fell apart in this period they weren't supposed to why did this happen it's because there was too much capital chasing that objective and there was too much comfort that they had nailed it in other words they thought the risk was out of the system and out of their portfolios in some in some great way when it came to Bitcoin I noticed and we talked a yes Ian and I talked a lot about it I noticed that okay we we got to the 200 week moving average around you know it was in the high 5,000 6,000 and it kind of just stabilized there and everybody who was getting used to the idea that yep that that's it it has held if you look go back to 2015 when we initiated our position we initiated it when it hit the 200 week moving average and it then continued to hug it there is so much more capital now involved in this space and it's hedge fund speculative capital and the leverage that you know there were apparently and I didn't even know about these people yes and of course did but apparently there were I will call them traders or speculators who were using 100 times leverage and and and bit max was one of the places this was happening a hundred times leverage and they were considered apparently you know as though they could do no wrong you know in our business in our business I know if I ever feel like I this is so easy this is getting so this we are onto something big here I that makes me cringe it makes me shudder I start looking for all of the risks and I actually start taking risk off when I start feeling in that feeling that way I think the people who were involved in actually got to a hundred times leverage we're so in experienced in terms of what leverage can do they had no idea that it was going to shut down their firms they had no clue I guarantee you they had no clue if I had known and that there was that kind of leverage out there Yassine did but again he was in that circle it wasn't something we talked about in terms of leverage and in that circle these people had become very popular very famous but if someone had told me look there's something out there it you know and a fairly nascent asset that is being leveraged a hundred times I would have said okay get me you know let's that limited let me just tell you where the weak link in the system is that those guys will go down and they did so I know Yassine knows a lot more about this than I do and also knows a lot more about the correlations but the only last thing I'll add is that it makes sense you've got so many more hedge funds involved who are not only involved in the crypto assets but also equities and bonds they're multi asset managers that when you get this amount of capital moving in it is logical when there's a crisis in one market and there are margin calls and there are margin calls all over the place in all kinds of assets that they're all going to go the correlations going to go to one in that moment in time but I think a Yassin has surfaced some more interesting insights about the correlations in and around this period that I think will explain that we're still we're still very early stage in terms of this asset class and the correlations are still fairly low so Yassin sure I think that sets it off quite nicely it really has been interesting to see the evolutions of narratives around kind of the crypto space more broadly during coronavirus I would say for Bitcoin specifically in large Pierpoint there have been really two competing narratives that have been questioned during this first quarter of 2020 the first is obviously kind of Bitcoin as this uncorrelated financial asset and then the second is is Bitcoin as this safe haven asset I think that you know it was a shock to many of us to see Bitcoin during this time suffer its second largest daily drawdown in history and I think it was fewer than 15 minutes we saw Bitcoin drop from 7,200 to less than 5400 it broke it's 200 week moving average and and that was that that hadn't happened in seven years and then it continued to sink touching I think $3,800 and then to Kathy's point the largest contributor to this sell-off appeared to be these Bitcoin liquidations to satisfy margin calls on the bit mixes of the world bit mechs that time saw almost a billion dollars in liquidations that it's perpetual swap and the most over 24-hour period in almost two years and so this sell-off was definitely severe and it was in tandem with an equity market sell-off and so questions have definitely been raised around bitcoins legitimacy as an asset worthy of allocation if especially if it's claim to fame narrative has been it's it's non correlation and kind of a safe haven aspect if we dig into the numbers and actually coin metrics its crypto asset data provider and Kathy was talking about we're updating we're collaborating on a white white paper with them and they actually recently released a report showing kind of the the historical correlations and update that and into the into the coronavirus and so if we look at like kind of the history of Bitcoin with let's say the S&P 500 we see that it has been relatively uncorrelated since 2012 the correlation has stayed between 0.5 teen and negative point 15 which signals kind of little to no correlation and and then but but over this last month we saw kind of this correlation reaching new all-time highs and so is it fair to ask then does this recent correlation suggest that Bitcoin and the sp500 are now suddenly correlated I would say no because although the short-term correlation did shoot up I think it was still under kind of very unique market circumstances you had kind of a lot of news about the spreading of coronavirus in which investors across every asset class rushed into cash and so really what we need to look at is correlation shot up between most assets in March and and in fact to Kathy's point about gold even the correlation between the S&P 500 and gold was it was also its highest since 2013 and so I would say over the long term I expect the correlation between let's say Bitcoin in the S&P to see some sort of reversion to the mean and and then return to that range that we've seen since 2012 but at the same time over the short term I think that you know we we very well may continue to see kind of relatively high correlation between the two especially since especially since we've seen kind of strong correlation across all asset classes and ya know I was just gonna add one one more thing Laura I I think that this was a really good lesson I think it will add to the maturity of the ecosystem because it's so clear that the willy-nilly leverage is not to be trusted and so have more scrutiny of leverage in the Eco you know you know many of the crypto acid ecosystems and I think that's a good thing yeah and one other thing I did want to add was there were a few circumstances on that day that contributed to what happened to on bit max one is that their systems actually suffered a DDoS during this whole March 12th Black Thursday liquidation period so that also affected things and then the other thing is that there were a lot of arbitrage opportunities because the price of Bitcoin diverged wildly you know between the different exchanges and markets but the blockchain itself became so backlogged as people were trying to move money around to take advantage of the arbitrage opportunities that they weren't able to and so I imagine that there are some liquidations that happen that maybe would not have happened if it weren't for the fact that the Bitcoin blockchain itself was clogged and but the same happened with etherium and for listeners who did not hear the episodes I did with Kyle Somani where he kind of breaks those down and then Antoine look like how they of coin metrics who was uh none confirmed both of them in their shows it kind of dissected what happened so one other thing that I wanted to ask you about was Kathy I did see in a Yahoo Finance video that was about arcs big ideas for 2020 you talked about how your conviction in Bitcoin has has only grown since the downturn from the last big bubble at the end of 2017 and I wondered why that was and you know how you look at its future outlook like what analysis you make to to say that yeah I think from the P at the peak in 2017 Bitcoin and and I know these are not precise numbers but you know whatever errors are being made are being made all the way through so yeah seeing can can refine this a bit afterwards but at the time we we were looking at the total network value of the crypto asset ecosystem and we go to said you know Bitcoin had gone down to the low 30s as a percent of the total as a Bitcoin price and all crypto asset prices kept coming down Bitcoin shares started to rise and it rose to I think the low 70s I'm not 100% sure where it is that I think it's high 60s although after the crash it may be higher and what that told me again bringing my economic roots back is you know Bitcoin is the reserve currency of the crypto acid ecosystem and that's what a reserve currency is a dollar the dollar right now I think is about sixty five percent sixty sixty five percent of global currencies Bitcoin getting up into the low 70 said ok this is the reserve currency this is the strongest currency this is the most secure that's one of one of the things it told me and I also think we were learning we were doing a lot more research on WoW confiscation of wealth this is a perfect antidote and at the time we had we had the MBS as that his name MBS arrests his own cousins in Saudi Arabia and locked them up in a hotel I'll bet there are a lot more not just in the Middle East but in emerging markets in any emerging country or even developed country where individuals fear there will be confiscation of wealth either either in a direct way like it was in Saudi Arabia or in an indirect way think is Zimbabwe the hyperinflation Venezuela Argentina Argentina 50% inflation that's crazy so I think that this idea of confiscation of wealth you know we we can we can take out this insurance policy we can carry it around in our in terms of the the the key to unlock it instead of around with us I with all the hot spots flashing around the world you think about China Hong Kong the protests in Hong Kong what did they think is going to happen finally I we just began to do more work and I think yeah seen the work you've done said just if you took the if you took the individuals in the world with I think we said an investable investable wealth of $1,000,000 around the world and they bought out an insurance policy which basically was suggested that well there's a 5% chance in your lifetime that you're going to see full confiscation of wealth that total was about three trillion dollars just that use case just that use case so the store of value certainly and this reserve currency role there is no more important role for money and there's nothing more viral than a reserve currency when you're talking a talking about currency markets so yes seen you might want to add add to that another additional point is actually around kind of the infrastructure and credibility amongst financial institutions in the community more broadly that has been accepted since since 2017 so you know Kathy often likes to reference the the Cambridge Associates report that came out around portfolio allocation specifically and how Cambridge recommended that institutional investors begin exploring these crypto assets more broadly obviously with Bitcoin at the forefront of that you have you know institutions like fidelity who are now understanding any recognizing that there's that there could be an institutional appetite and in order to fuel the demand you need to have kind of regulated custodial services and and you have you know fidelity has been mining Bitcoin for four years now now entering that space seeking to meet that demand we saw the recent launch of kind of backed everything around price discovery market infrastructure and I would say another one that that a lot of people are dismissing or have not really looked at how profound the implications could be is around square and what they've done in particular what Jack Dorsey has done as you know the CEO of two public companies who genuinely understands the value proposition of Bitcoin and is really doing everything he can with the resources that he's been able to build over the last few years to kind of fuel demand for Bitcoin I think the launch of square crypto you know launching that first open-source Bitcoin initiative could and we've seen has become a precursor for open source development from other institutions obviously questions around kind of sustainability of funding for developers that's that puts that to rest and and so when you have kind of a lot of momentum that's kind of being built around the institutions that are now beaming Bitcoin credible combined with the fact that now you're seeing kind of these recent trillion dollar injections from the Fed it is possible that we are you know in the midst of this crucial inflection point for Bitcoin I would say if central banks continue to inject money into the economy at these rates in which in which you know something like the narrative that we saw in 2017 it will kind of pale in comparison to what we what we might see in the next few years okay so I'm gonna do a sorry Laura I'm gonna do just a little bit of a reality check on that because and and Yassin agrees with that what I'm about to say as well but what we're seeing and this is from personal experience is institutions while the infrastructure is being built around them right now institutions are not ready to move aggressively into this space we have had you know we we manage money for institutions we have one of our largest institutions owned gbtc and was trying to figure out a lower cost so Lou and we were trying to help them do that in the form of you know you know more of a private fund which would be much more efficient from from an expense point of view and they they they they had trouble getting over over the hump they were almost there until they realized that it would be broken out as a separate fund and that they would be on the line as effectively espousing Bitcoin and they just didn't want to do that so they stuck they stuck with gbtc even though they were they had started us on this search for a better alternative for them so Institute and they trust us I mean this institution has been with us is our it's one of our longest lasting clients where of our first and so they trust what we're doing and they know we know our stuff when it comes to especially to Bitcoin and they wanted a lower cost solution but they the the optics of actually seeming to support it without being in it being included in a much broader portfolio was something they couldn't take I also have you know I we know this is an issue and I was with a group I had an opportunity to meet with a group to try and talk through this institutional issue and you know I think the most important thing we have to do is educate educate educate that's why the eff scene is right and updating that white paper the original one was Bitcoin ringing the bell for a new asset class we're updating it because we really do feel like it is time now that we've gone through these perturbations and maybe much more than that in these markets from a price point of view and yet if you look at Bitcoin on any kind of moving average basis it's still appreciating year-over-year so from year to year so I we're bound and determined to become a part of the solution to that problem and and you know what you asked my confidence one other thing I to point out is I also had the luxury of meeting some of some of the core developers in the space and for bitcoin oh yes in the Bitcoin space and because my my education was in both economics and finance I was able to you know see how much they understood about economics and I was I was blown away by the sophistication in terms of understanding economic theory and understanding monetary policy monetary theory Austrian economics and I have to say that has also boosted my confidence I believe they understand how important that 21 million unit limit is especially in the context of what is happening what started happening in oh wait oh nine in terms of opening the floodgates it never turned into inflation so many people say Oh fine we can do that again and we just have and it's still not going to turn into inflation I disagree and I disagree for the same reason portfolio insurance didn't work and lo of all strategies didn't work when everybody thinks something is a sure thing it's usually wrong and I think to look at Oh 809 Oh 8 oh 9 and to see inflation coming down actually it came down after that why was that think about it it was because the velocity of money collapsed consumer started saving more they did they were spending and the spending was going at a good clip but they were also saving more all along the way and businesses had become very conservative very very conservative so and what I mean by that is from an Operations point of view some of them were leveraging up to buy back stock which turned out to be a very bad idea but that that's why I think this this notion that inflation is dead it to the extent I hear that learn more just because it has been means it will be I will become more convinced we're going to have an inflation problem because these reserves both from oh wait and oh nine and now again from today we're going to go up to nine trillion dollars in reserves we were we started before Oh eight at eight hundred and fifty billion we went up to four and a half trillion then and now we're going to go to nine trillion those reserves are sitting on the balance sheets of central reserve banks and they are kindling their the kindling when banks start competing against each other to make loans that kindling will be lit and you know when everybody feels we're free and clear and I don't think that's anytime soon I don't think inflation is a problem for the next few years at all but I do think to dismiss it as a potential problem is a big mistake okay so yeah I mean you guys have made a strong case for Bitcoin but I did want to ask you about etherium because as you probably know that does have more developer mindshare and I wondered you know even though you can i'm sure see that i believe the last big report i saw on this show that there about four times the number of developers in aetherium as in bitcoin you know i was curious to know why does that not translate into investor conviction on your part and one other thing i wanted to throw in there was because i saw a scene KO rode a medium piece where I'm just blanking on what the the matrix was but it was something like unconstrained and constrained and I also heard caffeine give a talk where she talked about the East Coast way of looking at the world in the West Coast way and I just sort of wondered if that had anything to do with you know your views on aetherium or really any smart contract any cryptocurrency affiliated with a smart contract okay I'll start and I know you've seen has a lot more to say about it but as an investor I have to and because I'm not solely in the crypto space I have to pick my spots and and and we run concentrated portfolios so I typically go with the highest conviction names in any space in any innovation space and and Bitcoin Bar None is that for me atheria yes we get back into that West Coast is this technology is a software technology or is this money and I think that that the the the value in these ecosystems is going to be dominated by the currencies and Bitcoin being the reserve currency would be where I'd allocate most of our assets in the space although I could see over time if there are other currencies that evolve and some people think ether could could evolve into the kind of currency we're thinking about you know the equivalent of the euro the yen or you want the pound what have you we were I'm as again having to pick my spots I'm going to focus in the cryptocurrency space where I think most of the value will accrue anyway and I'll leave the technology side - - to others but Yassin sure so I would say just to add on to that I think what we've seen really the most salient distinction between crypto investment philosophies and it touches on this idea of like constrained versus unconstrained visions of crypto networks is you know looking at looking at these networks that's kind of a software first in which I kind of coin them as innovation maximalists or kind of money first in which kind of you you you can coin them as monetary maximalists in which case if you look at it from a software first mindset kind of the killer app is definitely not money in the killer app is definitely not Bitcoin in fact you know the idea that you have some sort of that this whole space has nothing more to offer than a slow and volatile form of sound money to a software first mindset seems seems quite anticlimactic and so when you look at it from that mindset the and from an investor focuses mindset you you start to see that yes there are certainly limitations with Bitcoin the investor focus should rather be on kind of creating these expressive upgradable base layer protocols with these large feature sets and then the network infrastructure priority should be around scalability and no not having this very slow yet reliable mechanism to transfer very very small pieces of data when you look at it from kind of a money first mind set then then you you start and kind of end with Bitcoin in which case kind of the investor focus is really around kind of that insurance theory of money and and and looking at this really from a monetary view I would say that from an investor standpoint there is this kind of discrepancy that people are kind of failing to realize with between kind of value capture and value creation and that's where I would say our views on aetherium are differ in terms of where value is going to end up accruing long term so the best the best analogy that I can actually give for this and actually placeholder was the first to bring this up was actually in the context not of Bitcoin versus aetherium but actually of aetherium versus aetherium killers and so if you kind of look at this as okay coming into this year you had kind of a number of aetherium killers that that kind of planned to launch their main nets and and so and we've seen kind of the the Algar and and the hash graphs of the world who have been able to sell this dream of look our technologies a lot superior well that hasn't really been reflective and where value has accrued obviously in bull markets you tend to see that these are kind of levered beta plays and so you would expect them to trade up so at a time when aetherium was trading at like a hundred thirty billion dollars market cap you had you know yoson in card ah no that that weren't even launched but had kind of tradable tokens that were trading at ten to twenty billion dollars in market cap now in bear markets the disposition is a lot different especially I would say if the fundamentals are questionable and so I think that very similar to how bitcoiners view aetherium Zod's of kind of usurping it by using let's say the developer activity as a metric a theory ins view a theorem killers odds as usurping it as in very very similar ways and that is it's really hard to justify evaluations based on kind of superior technology and features feature sets alone and so you first have to understand kind of what is supported I would say by etherium and bitcoins market cap before you can you can justify why these etherium killers merit higher valuations and there are things that that that are simply something like developer activity or feature sets can't can't really replace as a value proposition and so I would say two theorems credit it has built out a an extremely robust set of stakeholders and I and I do and I am bullish on the idea of experimentation on a theorem I think that there is very very interesting experimentation but but I remain hesitant to think that most value is going to accrue in the long run to things that we kind of aren't proven forms of money all right so we're gonna do we're a little bit over time but do you guys have a few minutes to to just do a lightning round of three last questions sure okay I said one thing that I was curious about was I saw that you guys are also bearish on cryptocurrencies with privacy features like Z cash but at least for the you know privacy cryptocurrency crew they would say oh the investment case for these is that financial institutions wanna you know use these crypto assets but they don't want all their transactions to be public they want to have privacy features built in so I was wondering like do you disagree with that like do you think that that isn't gonna be something that you know enterprise or institutions will have demand for yeah I'll start and and then so yeah scene just because I know where this came from sure III gave a presentation in Boston where I where I said the fully dark coins I would be concerned about mostly mostly because I think the government from a privacy point of view and especially you know everything that's going on in the rest of the world right now I think this is even more of a risk they are they are going to want some transparency for themselves now I know that certain of the coins are you know they will allow that you know it's the users who are enable you know there's transparency yeah the transparency so I'm not saying point blank 100% across the board that that I I wasn't really trying to say and I do think that they will you know iterate to a point where you know there there has to be some oversight I believe you know to prevent nefarious actors which you know really everyone involves you should want but yeah seeing you you I'm sure have sure I'll take it from the from the lens of yeah I'll take it from from the lens of more like privacy as a technology I would say that really the the stance on being more skeptical about privacy coins is really like if you consider a privacy privacy to be like an implementation of a technology I think that like in the open in the open source world I think that it's nowhere near as defensible as what we would traditionally see and so the big caveat to that is if larger assets let's say like a Bitcoin or an aetherium end up assuming the same privacy features as as these privacy focused coins then I think over the long term there is less of a value proposition for these privacy coins but there is a big question on let's say should we implement confidential actions on bitcoins baselayer and that may come at the cost of auditing monetary supply and so we see kind of the limitations with sea cash in its ability to audit monetary supply but at the same time having confidential transactions at the base layer so there are these questions and I think that ultimately we haven't reached it's an equilibrium and then from I would say from an investment standpoint there is an argument to be made where if privacy coins or if a coin has the only the only feature of a private of a coin is privacy then they could actually end up just being glorified mixers in which you know you you you want to mix your coins you go into a privacy coin and then you you come back out and you've effectively cleaned your coins in which case you know there's high velocity in the privacy coin and so from a value accrual standpoint it would seem kind of less interesting Medora values and one other thing i want to ask what of course is a big event coming up on the horizon which is the Bitcoin halving and obviously it's coming at a really kind of crazy time in the history of the world and you know not only the crypto markets so what is your outlook on what will happen at that time yeah we have had a few brain storms about this and I would say about five months ago coming into this year there were there was a lot of talk about the halving and I began to feel like as we I think we hit 14,000 I began to feel ok they're pricing this in because it is a positive at first of all it'll be a it will be another proof proof point that we're heading for 21 million you know is sought a successful software update and and I think you know if you're diminishing the supply relative to demand I think that's that's a positive force I'm glad that the discounting of it has been shaken out because if we were still at 14,000 or what-have-you I'd say how much is priced in but give him what just happened I don't think much is priced in yaseen sure so I think this is a really interesting topic honestly I I don't have a straight answer I think that two camps have definitely formed there's one camp that believes that the happening is priced in and like use exciting the efficient market hypothesis and then the other camp believes it's it's not what I can say or what I do believe is that we definitely see kind of minor LED selling pressure and an in in which case unless like the price of Bitcoin doubles you'll start to definitely see like minor LED selling pressures and that there will be kind of these miners that are will be below their breakeven cost and so I will expect a drop in in the networks hash rate and but assuming that price that demand for the Bitcoin remains the same having kind of a having in its in this selling pressure could lead to increases in price I think that the Bitcoin cash having is going to be that's interesting precedent for what to expect for a Bitcoin we definitely saw kind of a lot of money led selling pressure for Bitcoin cash particularly from there kind of just shutting off miners but but again you know this is the third having that the market will witness its experienced only to having's in its history obviously those two having's have tended to be kind of catalyst for bull runs but I beyond that I I'm not sure what's gonna happen well I'm very curious yeah yeah me too especially with everything going on all right so last topic I just wanted to make sure to touch on before we said goodbye is to talk about Libre and Central Bank digital currencies which you know that was such a huge topic last year and then you know it sort of looks like the future was a little bit cloudy at least for those but then with all the coronavirus stuff now at least Central Bank digital currencies are getting a little bit more life in them and I wondered not only what your outlook was on those but also just how that would interact with what's going on in the economy because for instance I did see that the Financial Stability Board has been warning regulators about disruption that could happen from them so I kind of wondered how you thought the coronavirus crisis or or the impact of it would interplay with this push toward central bank digital currencies yeah yes Dean you want to start on that one sure I would say largely what's been very interesting the Libra in general I think has been very interesting catalyst putting kind of the term or the label crypto a crypto acid or crypto currency on the map it's been very interesting to see kind of the evolution of the narratives and how seriously regulators were taking it post Libre announcement I think we've definitely seen a lot of slowdown in the momentum on creating kind of this reserve back asset of which the basket is up to Facebook to to decide we've seen kind of we've seen a lot of pushback from kind of the EU we've seen pushback from the United States there are some that speculate that kind of Libre is never going to launch I expect it to launch but I expected to likely look a lot different than than what what it was initially presented as I've heard kind of through the grapevine that you know the best solution is to actually just have a fully USB backed Libre in which case you know you appease regulators in the United States but that I would say sheds light on I would say one of the most interesting use cases in crypto especially amidst this recent uncertainty and that's around stable coins more broadly it's been really interesting to see how the supply of all stable coins has has grown to all-time highs around coronavirus and this is during kind of bitcoins massive drop I think that the most recent statistic was the stable coin market cap is around seven to eight percent of the total of bitcoins market cap and so we're starting to see this this trend pick up and you know Kathy referenced emerging markets like the Venezuela's Argentinean Argentinians of the world they would much prefer holding the US dollar than they would prefer holding Bitcoin and for having some sort of coin dependent on whether or not you could export your private keys I'm not sure libras going to enable that but if it does this could serve as a very very interesting use case for emerging markets and we're starting to kind of see how the stable coin growth is really a signal that investors are piling into these kind of crypto cash equivalents in times of uncertainty the irony is u.s. dollar based we've just had this conversation about inflation this would be another indication to me that that people do not believe that that what the Fed has just done and other monetary authorities will that the belief is there that it will never turn into inflation another another indication of sort of the complacency out there find it very interesting yeah and one other thing I was going to add is that the most recent episode of Unchained is an essay by Mariano Conte of the maker town Foundation who is Argentinean and he talked about his you know road through cryptocurrency basically but kind of earlier on he discovered it because you know in Argentina the value of the US dollar you get through the banking system is different from what you get on what we would call the black market but apparently in our state it's called the blue market but anyway and so through that he you know got into I think it was Bitcoin at first and then later when stable coins came about he would have you know for his freelance work started getting paid in dye and now he's that's just for him the way to go and so you know that's literally just I mean of course it's just one person but still it like you know through that story you can see like okay this is you know where this is being useful this is somebody who says like this is superior to what's available to me so anyway okay well it's been so great having you both on the show thank you so much for coming on Unchained thank you very much Laura thank you Laura
