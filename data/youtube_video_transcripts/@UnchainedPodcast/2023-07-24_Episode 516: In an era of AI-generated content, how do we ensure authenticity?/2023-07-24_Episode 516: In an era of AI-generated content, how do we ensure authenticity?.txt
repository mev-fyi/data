for example let's say this podcast was completely AI generated how do you know that how would the listener know that it was a generated or real people we three actually said yes we actually participated and so the way to do that is for us all three after it's recorded to sign the kind of hash of the whole podcast and say like yes we participate in this and this is indeed content that we've been members of and potentially it can be actually like edited with AI to like make it sound nicer to have better images Etc that doesn't matter what matters is that I say yes I authorize this content and I put my reputation in this and so to do that we need cryptographic signatures we need kind of identity that ties all of the things that I signed with so you can see like what I've signed and we need a set of tooling that when you do listen it on for example podcasts or Spotify or whatever it says yes it's verified and indeed signed by the right people
