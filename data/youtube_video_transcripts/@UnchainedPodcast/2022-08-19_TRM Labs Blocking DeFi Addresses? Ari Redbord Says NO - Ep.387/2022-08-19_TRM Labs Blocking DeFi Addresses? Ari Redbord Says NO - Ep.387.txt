affairs at trm labs welcome arie laura thank you so much for having me you see i i wanted to be with you so much today that i i did it from the middle of the woods uh so it's uh real really nice to join you and again thank you so much for having me well i think the crypto community is going to be very interested in what you have to say so i'm glad we could make it happen as you very well know the community has been up in arms about the sanctions on tornado cash and i imagine you will have quite a different take to give listeners a sense of why why don't you start by giving your work background especially as it would pertain to these recent events yeah no thank you so much um so uh prior to joining trm labs about about two years ago i was a federal prosecutor i was in ausa for the district of columbia for about 11 years during that time i focused on threat finance so that intersection between money laundering and and national security uh terrorist financing export control sanctions criminal prosecutions as well i then went over to uh to u.s treasury department where i was the senior advisor to the undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence which is essentially the role that oversees the national security apparatus within the u.s treasury department so ofac which is the sanctions regulator didn't send which is the anti-money laundering uh you know regulator for the u.s the financial intelligence unit so yeah joined joined trm about two years ago and really work on a lot of these same issues and just for people aosa is assistant u.s attorney that that's right it's really uh you know doj has local prosecutors it's a it's part of the department of justice okay so since you have this background at treasury and doj why do you believe regulators sanctioned tornado cash yeah you know it's interesting i think it's important when you're discussing this latest sanction to really understand some of the context in the background here you know i'd say over the last let's say 18 months or so we've really seen treasury take sort of a targeted approach to going after what they consider bad actors in the cryptocurrency space so we really saw you know a targeted approach to what i'd call dark net advertising mixing services right helix and bitcoin fog and these were really these were chart these were criminal charges brought by the department of justice against larry harmon the administrator of helix uh sterling from from bitcoin fog and the idea there was they were conspiring with dark net markets like alpha bay to launder funds because they were actually advertising that you should use our service to launder the proceeds of criminal activity that that was a crime those were the kinds of places then right treasury sanctioned its first ever crypto business was a non-compliant russia-based exchange called suex and then the next one was chad x and gorantex all russia-based cryptocurrency exchanges that were essentially laundering funds because they didn't have any compliance controls in place so ransomware payments you know and other types of illicit proceeds were flowing through these exchanges dark net markets right starting with silk road and then um alpha bay and then hydra just a few months ago so really sort of going after what i've heard treasury called the illicit underbelly of the sort of growing crypto economy and i will tell you just sort of for context ronin the attack on the ronin blockchain in my mind was a true watershed for the shift in the way regulators law enforcement were thinking about these types of cases because this huge hack 620 million dollars became associated with north korea and it really took sort of hacks from fraud and financial crime you know to be investigated by law enforcement to major national security issues involving you know north korea because when north korea is involved the hack just isn't just the loss of funds which is a problem enough right but it's the loss of funds to be used for weapons proliferation you know ballistic missile systems other destabilizing activity and there really became a shift where it wasn't just the fbi that was worried about investigating these cases it was the national security council and the treasury department and that's really the first time we saw ofac use targeted sanctions in this way so the first ever cryptocurrency address that was sanctioned associated with lazarus group was the the address where the funds from the ronin attack went into and then we started to see them use more yeah i feel like what you're not addressing is what the community is upset about which is the fact that you know an identifiable entity a person or an organization and this time it's a series of smart contracts there's there's no entity there's no organization or person that can defend themselves and apply to be removed from the sdn list the especially designated nationals whatever abs absolutely so let's get right to it that that's a bit that's exactly right so so the only reason to provide that background is because you're absolutely right lord tornado was exceptional right all these other entities that i just described were different they were centralized it was used primarily by illicit actors but here you have the first time that the treasury department designated software sanctioned software smart contracts that are not just used by illicit actors but are used by you know a community of regular cryptocurrency users and it had it has definitely created you know significant collateral damage now on the one hand treasury looked at tornado cash and said look this is the primary money laundering concern for north korea state sponsored cyber criminals you know they according to trm they've moved you know about a billion dollars through tornado cash it's been used in the 10 largest hacks that north korea has ever perpetrated but then at the same time you have a situation where regular users are having their sanctions exposure from regular users and i think what you're seeing now is you know d5 front ends other cryptocurrency businesses trying to figure out how to manage risk in the wake of of these sanctions right and so uh that for that very reason a lot of people in the crypto community are saying that ofac messed up they must not have realized just what you know what kind of consequences there would be and how messy it would be and so do you think they intentionally did this that they understood what the fallout would be or do you think that they did indeed mess up as people seem to believe i think it's a mix look i think ofac is primarily thinking look we need to take out this entity for lack of a better description that that is being used that is being utilized by north korea i think that was the primary focus here and i think that what needs to happen now is there needs to be guidance to the community including all these d5 front ends that are figuring out they're using trm they're using other other services to try to figure out how to manage risk and guidance to these entities on how to think about addresses that have sanctions exposure now regular users and i think that's something that that we're working you know with with clients on today you know just kind of digging into that but do you believe what ofac did here was kind of right or wrong look i think i think i think it's interesting like when you know having sat in uh meetings for years on sort of how you know how you think about sanctions right you you talk about targeting you figure out all right where are the targets and understanding sort of you know tornado was a you know an obvious target after all that other sort of description right they watched where the funds went from the ronin attack went through blender right they designated blender and then i think the idea was like well so much more illicit activity is going through uh tornado cache uh we need to sort of take out that capability now did they fully understand the sort of the impact on regular users i i don't know i know that when i was a treasury uh this idea of an impact assessment was something that was done in sort of every case what are the humanitarian impacts of iranian sanctions or venezuelan sanctions i hope that was done i believe that was done i think what is needed now more than anything else from regulators from ofac are faqs and guidance on how to deal with this issue of regular users who now have sanctions exposure and i will tell you like i think there are a number of different ways that d5 frontends in particular are using tools to try to mitigate some of that risk okay and you did say that a number of these are using trm to help comply with that so what is your role exactly yeah i know that's really helpful i think there's a lot of misunderstanding around sort of what are the role of blockchain analytics here blockchain intelligence tools like trm and we're working with a lot of those major d5 front ends on sort of how to mitigate this risk we don't block addresses blockchain analytics tools do not block addresses we provide data to these d5 front ends for them to make decisions on how to mitigate risk and what's so interesting about this issue is that look sanctions was always pretty black and white laura it was actually pretty simple and that if it address is sanctioned okay you block it and if an address transact with a sanctioned entity you block it because it's probably a bad actor right if you're transacting with a terrorist financier who's on this ofac sanctions list then you probably yourself are a bad actor but that's why tornado is so exceptional because it's the first time ever where that changes that you have regular users innocent people who have transacted with a sanctioned entity and you've got to figure out how to treat them and i think what we've seen is there's really two ways to think about this today the first is you know d5 front ends use trm to say hey we're going to block all the sanctioned addresses right there's some risk there because if you're only blocking those sanction addresses you're not as sure about sort of what are the addresses that they're transacting with right you leave you leave some risk open there but that's one way to handle it and that that ensures that you don't touch any of those those regular users right the other way to do this is try to look at a little bit more granularly and well in trm we surface data on time right when did this when did the transaction happen how much so you have a sense is this just one of these dusting um attacks that has come out over the last week or is this something more significant is it a is are you receiving funds or are you sending funds right like dig in a little bit more granularly and that wouldn't be so extraordinary because banks and other financial institutions have been doing this for years when it comes to risk mitigation right like it's there's investigation involved they're digging in a little bit deeper i will say sort of one thing that is different is that even d5 front ends which are more centralized than the rest of the the rest of the protocol right want to be as decentralized as possible so historically a lot of this has been automated and that's why we've had the issues we've had over the last week or a few days because the automated nature of sanction screening has has cast a net that has entrapped a lot of regular users and i think what we're seeing now is sort of a move towards maybe more granular screening i hope some of this makes sense because i know it's complicated but it's it's really important to understand that like the real key here is that what we do at trm is we provide data to our clients many of whom are d5 front ends in this situation and what they're doing is they're they're deciding hey look what is our risk appetite here and how can we create the best user experience possible and not have any of the fallout right of the last few days but at the same time also stop bad actors from using our uh using our uh our interface all right so in a moment i'm gonna dig into more details on how exactly this works but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible to swap crypto a user has to choose among hundreds of dexes on multiple networks all offering different rates and fees do you want to avoid that hassle swap on one inch a top decks aggregator built to get you better rates than any single decks enjoy unlimited liquidity across multiple networks and top level security get one inch on your phone now or swap on one inch dot io back to my conversation with arie so it seemed like you were saying that actually trm only provides information to d5 protocols such as uniswap and ave and then their compliance departments or teams are deciding what to do with that information and who to block and so trm isn't actually making those decisions is that a fair characterization that that's absolutely correct we can't block addresses that is something that it can only be done by the entity that the client the the the company that we're working with uh so what we do is we provide data we say hey these addresses are on ofac sanctions list they're actually on there right they're part of the 45 in the tornado cache scenario they're part of the 45 addresses that were on ofac sanctions list and then a a d5 company says hey we're going to block those which you really have to do because i say sort of one thing that's really important to understand is we talk about oftentimes sanctions and aml anti-money laundering but they're very different right every u.s entity every u.s person has an obligation they are prohibited from interacting with sanctioned entities so you have to block those addresses the real interesting questions uh come from these regular users that have been affected right and i think that's when you really start to want to dig into sort of more granular data but the reality is those are decisions that are being made by uh these d5 front ends and are you advising them on any level about how it seems like you're implying that in this case the way to go would be that more granular level meaning i guess identifying kind of when the tornado cash transaction happened i'm supposing transactions maybe afterward would be ones sorry i hope you understand what i'm saying i i hope you know me well enough to know now that i am not a cop-out kind of guy but i will say that the one thing we don't do right is like we you know every defy entity but really it's not just d fights financial institutions uh cryptocurrency businesses exchanges they have they sort of take they have their own risk appetite and they're all different you can imagine when you're talking about financial institutions right traditional financial institutions they might have less of a risk appetite than sort of a startup in the d5 space and they are all now we we work very closely with them on sort of how to configure risk how to sort of understand you know how to use the tool but really at the end of the day we're software that is providing data to allow them and and whether they have lawyers or you know compliance professionals or anyone else to kind of make those decisions i think the problem that we ran into over the last few days is that this has always been automated primarily because a small defy entity doesn't have the same compliance function that a coinbase right has you don't have teams of compliance officers so this has always been automated and that automation has cast a very wide net because traditionally it made sense to right because anyone who's transacting with a sanction address is probably not someone you want on your platform that's why tornado cash changed everything okay yeah this probably explains i saw a tweet and you know i it was actually a newsletter i don't know you know whether i certainly didn't um get to verify this with the person but they were saying that they were the victim of a hack and though you know the hacked funds were sent to tornado cash and now their eth wallet is being blocked by ave and uniswap even though their address hasn't been sanctioned so this sort of explains it this sort of kind of blanket software that's being applied um that hasn't been tailored to the events of tornado cash affecting someone who's innocent and in fact just because they were the victim of a hack now is being blocked does that sound like a reasonable okay yeah it does and it's just like these dusting attacks right like you know people it is it is a terrible thing to use sanctions offensively like this even to make a statement but at the same time it's like now it's up to us to figure out sort of how to take a more granular approach to risk management to ensure that regular users have good experiences and i can tell you working really closely with ave and unit swap as you mentioned and other sort of defy front ends um they they're they want to do that right comply with sanctions but also ensure that um that their users have a good experience and are not regular users are not blocked and that is the focus right now and that is you know why i don't sleep anymore but like it is i i think the reality is that like everyone in this space wants to do the right thing it's it's all very new and like laura you you've been in this space for so long but still things that happen every day are brand new and have never happened before and you have a regulator you have a regulator here who did this thing that now i'm sure they're trying to sort of figure out how to provide guidance right like don't we need guidance from ofac that says essentially you know hey if you uh have if you're the victim if you will of a dusting attack that you don't have actual sanctions exposure right i mean of course you don't but the reality is we need guidance that says that and i think that's coming and i know it's sort of like it's not helpful to anyone who has their funds blocked or they can't move funds today but i think that like the d5 companies are working on it and i'm very hopeful that ofac is going to provide guidance as well that will speak to this and if you were writing that guidance what else would be some of the principles you would put in there you know i think one thing that's really important is sort of what is the expectations for uh defy entities today in the space and it you know i know i said that like aml and sanctions are very very different but there is also sort of a need for more guidance on sort of what the expectations are from building an anti-money laundering program you know is defy expected in the anti-money laundering space to have the same types of compliance controls that a more centralized entity would have and then it becomes complicated as you as you started the questioning you know of entities like tornado cache that you know how do you implement um those types of controls so i think just really understanding what are the expectations what are the expectations from regular users what are the expectations um from the uh from the d5 companies and also look i mean something that like so in order to solve for this right trm i think we we were the first to come out with this idea of a time stamp so you really understood you know look sanctions happened at 10 30 a.m on august 8th i believe any activity with tornado cash prior to that was not in violation of sanctions right so it's really important to understand as we're thinking through this sort of things like you know time stamp understanding sort of when things happened and that's the type of granular detail that i think is really necessary to have in the tools like trm when you're using them but also guidance from regulators about how they're thinking about this so as i'm sure you're aware um a number of entities in the crypto community are also saying that they believe that what olfact did here was unconstitutional and i was interested in your opinion on that yeah you know i think it's really look i think it's really interesting and um you know i've spent a lot of time reading really the great content that's been put out by jerry britto a coin center and the blockchain association other places and actually i've had amazing conversations with them on on these issues you know i i know again like i don't know i don't know i i think that you know typically there is a lot of deference to national security issues laura you know it is one of those areas when you're talking about sort of because right even you know even like fundamental constitutional rights there are there's a balancing and i think that while uh the right to privacy uh the right to uh you know speech really these fundamental issues i mean you know these are the reasons you you know become a lawyer these are the reasons you work for the department of justice these are the reasons you do what you do oftentimes if you look at the case law there's so much deference to national security and even the way even the way if you recall vincent wrote its uh nprm on unhosted wallets right they couched it in a national security context and we would see the same thing here right this is not fraud and financial crime this is national security you know this is a missile being sent to guam right by north korea or or hawaii or wherever else and i think that's the way you'd see this couched then when you do that balancing typically right courts come out on the side of a deference to uh to national security i will also say that like tornado cash you know is a harder one because of the volume of illicit activity that was flowing through there you know upwards of 30 or 40 percent as i said about a billion dollars just on nor being used by north korea alone and i think that that's the balancing that you'd see and just typically i can tell you what courts come out on the side of sort of you know giving the executive a lot of leeway when it comes to national security issues and out of curiosity i also heard that it was only blocked on ethereum but not on like other chains so do you think is it just because what most of the hacks are on ethereum d5 protocols or say that one more time but yeah oh like tornado cache on bsc for instance wasn't blocked so people were saying that there was like another way they seem to have messed up but i didn't know is it just that's so interesting i actually i don't i i don't know the answer to that what i will say that just like again like you raised it in your first question i didn't get there fast enough but uh you know it it it it's exceptional because it is just software right and like you go you know you go take a look at it you could copy paste and create cyclone cache i mean the reality is that um you know right it is it is just it is just software and i think really one of the challenges is um you know when i was a prosecutor we talked about shell companies as a whack-a-mole game right or iran would create iranians would create a shell company we would take it down and then um another one would pop up this is the ultimate game of whack-a-mole right i mean you literally could go in and copy-paste the code and create another smart contract and recreate recreate this so really look i think what what ofac must have said to themselves is this is a giant game of whack-a-mole but this is a big enough mall uh to to attempt this with and you know and we understand that they could be easily recreated but i guess we'd go after that mall too and what do you think this potentially says about the future of privacy and crypto yeah look i mean i think look i think it's more important than ever and quite frankly as as we do more i mean you and i believe very strongly in the future of this new financial system and as there's more and more transactions on open public ledgers people are going to have more of a desire for privacy quite frankly this dusting thing was a little bit of a like a wake-up call even for me because what i think i learned there is there are a lot of people with public addresses who actually need some level of privacy um in order to transact do you feel the government is going to keep going after privacy technologies yeah i i think that the government is going to try to strike a balance and it is hard like this is very hard stuff i think the need is to strike a balance between ensuring that illicit actors are not taking advantage of this technology but also allowing regular users to have a degree of to have a degree of privacy look you know in the age of crypto a hack you know doesn't just mean the loss of you know pii and usernames and passwords it means the loss of people's life savings right like you know even take lazarus group out of this for a second national security like you know no one is going to engage with the crypto economy if they're worried about having their funds hacked or stolen on a regular basis and if you want this to succeed which i desperately do and really fundamentally believe in it we have to stop bad guys from from continuing to hack you know d5 protocols bridges exchanges um so i think that's what's really so important here it's not just the government right we need to stop this from happening as a crypto community because we want people to engage with these services and i think it's just so i think it's so critical that we have to stop these hacks and i think the treasury at least said hey one way to stop this is to stop the ability to launder the funds from the hacks will it work you know i think it's that's a very big tbd but uh i think today i think we need to continue to strike that balance all right well we will see how it all works out for them okay well this has been extremely illuminating thank you so

week's news recap [Music] galaxy drops bitco acquisition biko to sue galaxy on monday galaxy digital announced the termination of its 1.2 billion acquisition of bitco the cryptocustodian according to its press release galaxy is not going through with the deal because biko failed to deliver audited financial statements for 2021 that comply with their agreement however bitco is pushing back against its much bigger counterparty biko said that the termination of the deal is improper and that the company is going to seek a 100 million termination fee the attempt by mike novogratz and galaxy digital to blame the termination on biko is absurd our brian timmons partner at biko's legal firm told the block galaxy's ceo mike novogratz has not yet commented on bitco's plans alex mashinsky made some bad trades prior to celsius's bankruptcy the financial times reports that alex machinski ceo of bankrupt crypto lender celsius took control of the company's trading strategy in january days before a u.s federal reserve meeting mashinsky was apparently convinced that the fed would raise interest rates and started overruling experienced financial professionals within his company according to the article machinski sold millions of dollars worth of btc only to buy it at a loss on the following day some people were outraged by his behavior especially since just months later celsius halted withdrawals from the platform and filed for bankruptcy this is not normal dejetting it's not his money he was gambling with this is a concoction of ridiculous arrogance sociopathy and a heavy sprinkling of scam salt said jordi alexander cio of salini capital meanwhile celsius's current financial situation does not look promising this week a new court filing from celsius's law firm kirkland and ellis revealed that the crypto exchange would run out of cash by october the company did receive some good news this week as it was allowed by the court to sell some of its mind btc in order to meet operational expenses lastly cdpq one of the largest pension funds in canada announced that it had to write off a 150 million dollar investment in celsius coinbase ceo hints that the exchange won't censor ethereum brian armstrong coinbase ceo said on twitter that he'd rather shut down the exchange's sticking service then sensor transactions to comply with ofac sanctions armstrong's tweet came in response to a question from leftirus carapetsis founder of portfolio management tool rocky who tweeted if regulators ask you to censor at the ethereum protocol level with with your validators will you a comply and censor at the protocol level b shut down the staking service and preserve network integrity what kickstarted this discussion was the concern that centralized taking services needing to comply with sanctions would lead to compliance at the protocol level after the merge once ethereum moves to proof of stake coinbase is expected to be one of the largest validators in the ecosystem michael morrow resigns as genesis ceo michael morrow stepped down as genesis global trading ceo as the company announced other changes in the leadership team genesis was one of the many companies that suffered from exposure to bankrupt crypto hedge fund three arrows capital in july genesis filed a 1.2 billion claim against 3ac after the latter failed to meet a margin call morrow served as chief executive of the crypto broker for more than six years and will be replaced temporarily by ceo dara islam it has been an honor to lead genesis for nearly a decade and i look forward to supporting the company's next phase of growth said moro in addition genesis is laying off 20 of its employees in an attempt to navigate through the crypto winter 3ac was all over the news this week as well on monday new york magazine published an excellent article by jen vyatchner exposing the history of the hedge fund and his two co-founders xu xu and kyle davies here are some highlights 3ac did not want to put up collateral for its loans it was supposed to be reputation based matt walsh co-founder of castle island ventures started suspecting 3ac when the latter seemed to be desperate about a 20 million dollar deal signaling that it might be insolvent the tara blowout meant half a billion dollars loss for three ac and it kick-started the collapse of the fund castleman chief business officer at blockchain.com said we firmly believe they committed fraud it became clear that they were insolvent but were continuing to borrow which really just looks like a classic ponzi scheme zhu and davies intended to buy a yacht which was the subject of numerous memes on twitter and name it much wow add more unstable coins to the list akala dollar or ausd the stable coin built on a kala network

dokwan's first interview wasn't well received jo kwon founder of layer 1 tara broke a long silence in an interview given to coinage media months after the collapse of the ecosystem here are some highlights from the interview quan stated that tara was never intended as a fraud and that he didn't think that blockchain would collapse tara and luna were essentially my life i bet big and i lost i alone and responsible in response to questions about his hubristic comments on twitter he responded i developed an entertaining alter ego to match the community kwon confirmed that investigators have not reached out and haven't charged him with anything the interview sparked criticism on crypto twitter as people wondered why the interviewer didn't ask harder questions i wonder why do kwan chose you over all those media titans could it be perhaps that tfl is an investor in coinage asked fat man tara a crypto influencer zero percent royalties for creators pseudoswap a decentralized nft marketplace on ethereum launched an automated market maker that set artist royalties at zero percent which sparked a heated debate on crypto twitter the pseudo amm allows anyone to mint an nft on the marketplace without having to pay a percentage in royalties to the creator the biggest nft marketplaces such as open sea magic eden and looks rare do honor the royalties set by creators but it has become clear that this is social convention as the royalties cannot be enforced on chain i think the creator royalty argument is actually a lot simpler than people make it out to be there is zero way to force royalties technologically so creators will have to build a collector base that want to honor those royalties it's really that simple said nft artist people yaw a marketplace built on solana was the first to offer this feature earlier this year in addition salon art allows sellers to choose whether they want to pay the royalty fees to creators and if so how much as a creator myself i had
