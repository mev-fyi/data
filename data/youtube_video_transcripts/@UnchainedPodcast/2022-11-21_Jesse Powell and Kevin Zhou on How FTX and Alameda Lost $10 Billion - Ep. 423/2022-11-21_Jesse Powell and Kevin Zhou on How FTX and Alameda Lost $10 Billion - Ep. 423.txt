just a quick note that we're releasing what would typically be a Tuesday show on a Monday due to the Thanksgiving holiday coming up but don't fret we have a great conversation for you to tune into on Tuesday as well a special edition of The Chopping Block to go over the first day declaration in the FTX bankruptcy the US versus Bahamas jurisdictional battle Genesis and crypto lending and all the other craziness that happened last week as for this episode I reached out to Jesse Powell co-founder of Kraken who ran a centralized exchange for a long time and Kevin so of galwa capital who could offer his perspective as a Trader on FTX the two of them mention some past observations about FTX that in hindsight seems suspicious plus discuss how Alameda which had been seen as top Traders could have lost so much money as you might expect Sam coins such as ftt played a big role I also asked Jesse for his views on not your keys not your coins since he is an exchange owner and we dive into how ftx's collapse reflects on the media VCS and Regulators this was an incredible discussion and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did hey everyone just a quick note before we begin Unchained is doing its

are going to be discussing the collapse of FTX here to discuss our Jesse Powell co-founder of Kraken which disclosure is a former sponsor of the show and Kevin so co-founder of galwa capital welcome Kevin and Jesse hey thanks for having me yeah thanks for having us the crypto industry has been absolutely rocked by the seemingly never-ending Saga of FTX which every day seems to reveal even deeper levels of incompetence malfeasance perhaps fraud Jesse since you're an exchange owner I wanted to get your opinion on what exactly happened here what do you think the root of the issue was yeah I think these guys first of all didn't really know what they were doing when it came to running what should be like a Fort Knox type of operation you know I think they they were Traders first and foremost I think they were very inexperienced operators and uh they took on a lot I think uh a huge amount of work for the number of people that they had on the team you know like our whole security team is like you know 100 plus people and they were doing you know what the whole company is doing with like 50 people at one point so you know they wouldn't be able to do all the things that that you would normally do and and build and you know from the outside we figured that this was going to catch up with them at some point you know that they were accumulating a lot of technical debt we didn't anticipate that it was as bad as it is you know it seems like they hadn't done any kind of accounting or reconciliation in like three three years and that they basically had no controls in place and very few people knew what was actually going on there yeah and Kevin what do you what about you I know you're approaching more from the trader perspective but I was interested to hear what you thought the core problem was um yeah no I definitely agree with Jesse and actually you know before starting the firm I used to work two years each at two different exchanges one of them being Kraken so I'm pretty familiar with some of the operations that go on within exchanges and you know like Jesse said there's a lot that goes into it and you know with a small team it's very difficult to run because there's so many different divisions it's a full-fledged business right if you look at a trading operation I mean there's you don't have to do any marketing um there's very little BD there's not too much legal overhead there's a lot of these divisions that aren't you know fully fledged but in exchange of the full-fledged business so you have all these different divisions and then I think on top of that some of these guys you know from FTX from Alameda they were coming in from the Trad five world and they weren't you know super crypto native at the time and there were a lot of lessons I think that were learned in history you know everything from like gox to bitfinex I mean to some extent like bitcoinica I mean there's so many lessons along the way cripsy with big Vern um all these pieces of history that you know I think folks that had lived through it um really internalized and folks that you know just just came by later you know they they knew about it they understood intellect actually but they hadn't gone through sort of the experience the harrowing experience of what it was like you know to see like gox collapse or all of these like major hacks or exploits happen you know in real time so I think you know the attitude that a lot of these guys at FTX and Alameda took probably was a little bit too Cavalier and you know how they were Blitz scaling their exchange something that they thought of as kind of like a you know startup Financial product rather than some kind of like what Jesse said like a Fort Knox where you know at the end of the day it doesn't matter how good your systems are um how good your trading platform is if you can't manage to hold on to uh your users funds right and that's only from the sort of the angle that you know these guys had some incompetencies now on top of that maybe there was actually some actual bad behavior and some fraud and malfeasance now you know that you know that that can also happen on top of them not knowing what they're doing right so it just like makes a bad problem even worse um I'll even share a really kind of random story about when when we met we met Alameda first before they started FTX sometime in 2018 late 2018 or early 2019 and I actually distinctly remember talking to them about accounting systems and this is you know before FTX existed so this is just for alameda's accounting systems and you know what they were saying is that yeah you know at the end of the day you know we do our best to try and reconcile we spend you know some time half an hour a couple hours I forget exactly how much time they said but they spent some amount of time at the end of every day to try and reconcile the records but then they're like you know at the end of the day sometimes you know you just can't get to the right number and you know if it's plus or minus 10 grand 100 Grand which back in the day was a lot of money right you know they said well you know to move on to the next day right so I think you know you know looking back there were so many different signs like that that I think in retrospect were sort of clear warning signs and signals for the risks that were to come but at the time you know we didn't really think too much of it right so it's just you know it's one of those things where hindsight is um you know definitely 2020. yeah and I don't remember how big they grew to but I feel like the latest numbers I saw were some somewhere in the 300 range but clearly for the size of the operation that still was an extremely lean um machine which you know Sam would sort of boast about but um obviously as Jesse mentioned that is a kind of red flag and you know to see your comments about the security app that was literally my very first thought like how does this even happen when you have you know what should have been like a security team I like couldn't even figure that out clearly um I don't think they've really had one as the answer so my next question actually was going to be if you two had any inklings of something being amiss beforehand and Kevin actually already answered that so Jesse did you have any experience with them prior that kind of made you think oh there are some red flags here we had no direct experience with them I've never met Sam I interacted with uh Brett on one occasion about some regulatory stuff and I disagreed with them on that you know but they clearly had their own strategy they were pursuing and and can you talk about what what that difference was yeah there was some Bill I don't remember exactly what it was but there's some very problematic language in it and Kraken actually like went went out to our users and notified all of our users about it to try to contact their government Representatives about it FTX felt like the better approach was to use their contacts in DC and try to like negotiate this you know in in backroom deals and things like that you know we felt like through our experience over the years that that was basically going to be futile and um you know we're kind of beyond the point of being able to do that to be able to to reason with a few people you know behind the scenes and so you know I think that was kind of like that interaction was sort of Representative of their their whole approach which was like basically they thought they knew better than everyone else you know even even though they were relatively new to the scene they thought that well you know things aren't better because all you guys before us you know maybe you weren't doing things right uh and so they had like new ideas which they thought you know would be better and I mean you know they didn't appreciate that we actually tried all these ideas years ago and you know we've developed over the course of a decade the strategy that we have now you know but I think that was just par for the course for them to come in and think that they could do things in a way that no one else had tried before and that would make them successful uh not learning from the lessons of of the past and obviously that played out with the implosion of their business as well oh interesting yeah I have a feeling maybe the bill that you're talking about is the infrastructure bill from a year ago that might have been that because I I remember a kraken at that time calling upon its users um so I don't that may not have been it but that was one time I remember your company did that yeah that's probably it yeah okay so Kevin I just have to ask you and I'm so sorry about this but obviously you know the news this week was that galma Capital had 40 million dollars worth of assets stuck on the exchange and I was curious you know just to hear why it is that galwa didn't withdraw earlier like you know what was your experience using FTX like why did you you know kind of have some confidence to leave the assets on the exchange um yeah so I I'm happy to talk about that a little bit there's some things that are uh confidential uh with regards to the fun but you know generally the idea is that slowly over time uh as a us-based business we kept getting kicked off of international exchanges so uh sort of the scope of our trading started to get more and more concentrated on FTX um and then um at that point there was also I think some sense that you know we really didn't see this coming I mean in retrospect there were so many red flags but you know at the time uh you know we thought the exchange was Secure we thought you know he was sort of The Golden Child of crypto you know going to meet with all the regulators and whatnot seemed to be smart seemed to be you know knowing what they were doing you know turned out not to be the case and uh so I think we were kind of lulled into a false sense of security there and then on top of that um had a lot of positions open at the time uh that we had to unwind before we could withdraw so um you know just given the the size of those positions it was um very cumbersome unless we were willing to puke it uh and then just you know take on all that slippage uh very cumbersome just to unwind all those positions uh to withdraw so a mix of many different factors but I would say that's mostly it and also wanted to maybe just take a step back and sort of respond to to what Jesse was saying uh before which is you know I I completely agree I think I think there's a lot of lessons of the past that new people coming into the space whether it be new exchange operators or new um token project Founders but there's always this um kind of sense that you know we can do uh things better and I and I think that that is a good attitude to have but at the same time I think there's a lot of history lessons that a lot of the newcomers have not quite learned yet and there is something to be said about having experience in the space having lived through you know some of these events you know a lot a lot of times I think the road to hell is kind of paved in Good Intentions right where it's sort of like you know we think we know better and we think not only do we know better but we know better for everybody right not just for ourselves right in taking this kind of approach right very easy to become misguided and you know maybe here or their make certain shortcuts that they shouldn't make right all for the sake of the greater good you know I'm reminded by early on before FTX you know I was doing some you know just due diligence on these guys because we were trading counterparties with Alameda and I stumbled upon Sam's blog which has since become very popular as everyone of CT has now been reading this over and you know I thought it was curious that he was a utilitarian right and in particular and maybe just to explain very quickly utilitarian is uh is someone with the philosophy that you know people should act in a way that does the greatest good for the greatest number of people you know never mind how to measure this goodness right and what what which people count which people don't count this whole thing gets very messy but it's generally this kind of sex right where you're kind of like reducing people down to numbers and then trying to add them up to get the greatest sum right it's like you've turned it into a math problem an optimization problem which uh you know I think is a little bit questionable to begin with but in any case reading through this blog and then now having re-read it I realize something which is that not only you know is this philosophy that of a utilitarian but that of an act utilitarian rather than a ruled utilitarian right so so a rule utilitarian is someone who would say uh generally there are good rules to follow which yield the greatest good for the greatest number of people for example do not steal that's generally A good rule to follow we should we should invent we should create these rules and then we should follow these rules because they have a lot of utility in them right and act utilitarian is not that way it's not so much that you you prescribe certain rules to follow it's that you judge every single circumstance and event and you decide whether or not you think the outcome will be good right so under that kind of Paradigm sometimes it may be okay to steal if stealing yields the greater good right now obviously this this can very easily get into you know murky moral and ethical territory because the Allure of having an excuse to do something for the greater good if we are sort of not cognizant of our own biases and our own self-interests can allow us to do great evil right and that's sort of you know this this sort of idea about you know the Rotel is paved in good attention right so now that kind of like stood out to me right having now sort of like Revisited his blog and realized oh that's right he wasn't after utilitarian not a rule utility utilitarian right so there's all these like small all pieces that I think and I'm sorry I went on a random tangent but I feel like there's all these small pieces that kind of add up to a picture of a person who basically told us what he was going to do ahead of time it was right under our noses it was right in front of us but there was no single thing which was alarming but when you add it all together it Paints the picture of a person who is rather ruthless yeah um I don't know if you guys listen to this week's episode of The Chopping Block but this is the exact argument that tarun and I had with haseeb where he and I kind of agreed with you Kevin and then sorry tarun and I and then his Eve um has called himself an effective altruist although when he talked about it it just seemed very different from the way Sam talked about it so not sure what to make of that I don't mean this as an indictment of effective altruism I don't see it as that way at all I just think that his personal philosophy was a little bit bizarre and I think not all effective altruists are probably back to utilitarians or even utilitarians themselves yeah and yeah I mean people if they listen to the shopping Mark they'll hear that I asked him this but I'll just mention this because the last time I interviewed Sam I did ask him a question like when you make these political donations is your guiding like motivation to do that your EA philosophy or is it to help the crypto industry and he basically said it was the EA thing so you know but that was like like another way of thinking about the question is could it what I really was asking him is like are you an effective altruist using crypto or are you a crypto person like that's kind of what I was trying to get at it's what you talked about and it's like um when you think that you have a better idea of what to do with like other people's money or whatever than than they do then like it just leads to you know you to do things like oh I'm gonna justify like using people's customer funds anyway but I'm curious for Jesse's response to all this well I agree with everything Kevin said and you know I was a philosophy major in college uh me too well more like literature and philosophy but love it cool you know my concentration was was ethics and law and and um you know this kind of stuff was the stuff I would write papers about and um you know I mean like Kevin said this uh utilitarianism is a slippery slope you know like you said you can just you decide that you know that five dollars is better spent on on a political donation not knowing that this person was going to use that five dollars you know that was the last five dollars they needed for their life-saving surgery or something like that um you have to make a lot of assumptions about you know the relative value of things either Sam is just making all this stuff up or you know it seems like I mean from that from that Vox article uh the screenshots that were posted I mean it sounds like he was pretty much like an ends justify the means kind of guy like like Kevin said I'm just gonna do what I think is gonna give me the best outcome in this scenario without having any any specific kind of like you know moral compass basically to or or even his own like internal Persona that he was trying to maintain you know he's sort of saying like I'm just going to be a chameleon and do whatever is gonna get me further ahead like in any in any situation and I'm going to if donating to the Democrats is what what does it that's fine if stealing client funds is what does it that's fine ultimately you know I don't even know if we buy that he was actually going to use all this money that he misappropriated in the end for some some greater good like what would that be you know I mean I think delivering cryptocurrency to the world is a pretty great good you know I mean it might be the best the biggest thing that any of us could could work on and do in our lifetimes uh but you know I don't know I don't know what the greater thing that he was planning on like investing in would have been um I don't think he said that oh actually I know some of them oh really one is pandemic preparedness another one was some kind of AI thing like protecting people from future AIS that would like hurt humans something like that called anthropica tarune mentioned this in the show have you heard of that or do you know it okay those are the two on my show he talked a lot about pandemic preparedness and but as tarun put it because the Ontario's teacher pension invested in FTX tarun was like okay so he stole from the grannies to protect people from an AI that might hurt humans ten thousand years from now that was what he said but anyway pretty much yeah the pandemic preparedness thing also sounds like something that would just play well in in the current uh climate you know with the media and everything so like I wonder if that's even true its current thing is it's current thingism yeah exactly yeah and maybe just to say one last thing too uh you know I'm starting to think more and more that the personal philosophies of the founders of these exchanges matters a lot you know especially given what happened because uh from what I remember with conversation with Jesse uh Jesse is a deontologist which is the complete opposite of a consequentialist meaning that it's the means that matter much more than the ends right um so you know I'm more inclined and I think he's you know being truthful when I you know when I talked with him about it I think he was being truthful so you know then I have some very strong confidence that Jesse is not only gonna look for what's the best outcome for people what's the best outcome for him but he's gonna to try and do the right things in the right ways right to reach those goals right and I think you know I think that really matters you know at the end of the day I think character really matters um in this space huh okay well we can discuss this like at infinitive but I actually want to just stick into some more details you guys um I'm sure you've probably at least heard if not read the first day of Declaration that the new CEO John Ray um published but he mentioned certain things like corporate funds were used to purchase homes and other personal items for employees and advisors it also said that Alameda loaned 2.3 billion dollars to paper bird which is an entity wholly owned by Sam it also led to one billion dollars to Sam himself 543 million dollars to the director of engineering nishad Singh and 55 million dollars to Ryan solomay Who is the co-ceo so all that together accounts for about four billion dollars the New York Times reported that Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison said that Alameda had taken out loans to make Venture Investments and um I remember that earlier in the year they announced uh that their Venture investment plans were going to Total 2 billion the information also reported that Alameda invested at least 20 million in Paradigm and that Alameda research and FTX Ventures committed hundreds of millions of dollars to Sequoia altimeter Capital Management multi-coin Capital these are Venture funds and that's some of the funds also backed K5 global global which is an advisory and investment fund run by Michael kivis who's a close advisor to SPF so I was just very curious um so obviously that's a huge amount of money you know I don't know what that totals maybe somewhere in the ballpark of 4.5 billion or something people think maybe about 10 billion dollars is missing I was kind of curious you know what are your theories on where the money went and like why so much went missing is it like bad trading because people have said to me oh they were on the top of the leaderboards we thought they were great Traders like what's your theory on what happened with all this money that's missing I would love to hear Kevin's take on this um yeah sure I'm happy to start so you know I think um you know there's a there's a Twitter account uh I can't believe I'm saying there's a Twitter account uh called Xerox FBI femboy and uh this person writes a Blog called milky eggs and I think uh you know theorizes on a lot of where the money went I don't entirely agree with all the assessments but I think it's pretty comprehensive and I mostly agree so I think it's it's all of the above so I think you know first off you know when they first started and they they were on top of the bitmex leaderboards I think they were like the rank two rank three and rank 7 accounts on on bitmex you know I think back then the game itself was a lot easier and you could have like a ragtag prop shop you know just coming out of tribeify there were not many institutional players uh there were not many sophisticated players back then and it was kind of easy to do Market making you know across a lot of different exchanges but for the most part from these shops that they came from uh predominantly Jane Street uh James Street's not particularly known for Speed now now they're not slow but they're not known for being like very high frequency right you know in terms of like hft for example so you know I think as things progress and you started having a lot of these bigger players like jump Tower you know HRT these really proper kind of hft market makers um come in then they started squeezing out a lot of these like crypto native firms uh on the market making side and probably profits started drying up right and you know at that point they probably started thinking well you know it's very it's a lot harder now to make sort of like you know risk neutral kind of Market neutral uh Returns on just Market making maybe they'll get more into like uh riskier stuff right and you know more into like Longshore punting or you know speculating on VC Investments that sort of thing I remember that um and this was I think even before we met the Alameda team in 2018 and 2019 but there was some a little period before that where there was a fracture within Alameda itself because Sam had a co-founder Tara McCully who uh eventually went on to stand uh to start Lantern Ventures and basically there was an internal disagreement uh where two-thirds of the team kind of wanted to take more risk and one third of the team wanted to take less risk so the one-third of the team branched off and went to Lantern and then the two-thirds stayed with Sam you know you know you know each each part of the team went with each of the different uh co-founders um so basically you you know where things may have started sensibly you know with kind of this kind of check and balance system between people want to take more risks and people take less risks there was some kind of um self-selection process after that split we had all of the Risk Takers on one side and all like the the you know the lower risk you know the higher you know the lower risk tolerance people on the other side so now all of a sudden now things start to get more extreme right so that's one thing I think probably the fact that they were using a lot of like uh you know possibly amphetamines or other pharmaceutical drugs probably didn't help I think you know once you start you know messing with like the dopamine system particularly the mesolympic dopamine system uh which forecasts uh reward and pleasure um it can really start affecting your judgment on uh you know possibly taking on more risk or just just general cognitive uh impairment and function I thought it was very interesting that people brought up the fact that Sam is hard stuck at bronze too in League of Legends uh I think this is you know if you play three years and you're stuck at that ranking in League of Legends um there's just something wrong you're just not learning anything you know you just it's just like it's very it's it just seems like he's struggling to pick up and learn new things right like I think there was a great analogy on Twitter which is like if you've been trying to figure out how to learn to ride a bike for three years and you still can't ride a bike you probably are a little bit impaired cognitively right and that's kind of what I think that represents um even though it's kind of a bizarre example I think they they did do a lot of speculation on uh Venture Investments and in particular in the Solana ecosystem with these high float or low float High fully diluted uh value coins and now reflecting back you know at the time I thought it was like ah it's a little bit greedy to do it that way you know because you want some high marks on the books you know this this and that but I didn't think it was like that nefarious it was just like slightly Shady right to have these projects always do that on Solana but now I'm thinking maybe it was actually way more nefarious than that because maybe they already had the intention of using it as collateral so they needed it to be as High Mark as possible Right but when you have a situation like that the higher the artificial Mark is the worse the liquidation is when it fully when it finally comes time to do liquidation and on top of that them using ftt as collateral to borrow uh funds from FTX or for FTX to borrow funds from Alameda you know whichever way that relationship went using the exchange token itself creates also a bunch of reflexivity because now as the solvency of the exchange gets called in question the value of the token plummets further putting the exchange in a weaker balance sheet State further pushing it into insolvency right so this is these are the kind of like debt spiral effects that we saw with Luna this one is not as extreme it's not as reflexive right maybe the multiplier if you if you wanted to quantify it then the numerical value of the debt spiral effect is is lower but it's still you know let's say greater than what greater than some critical threshold in which these kinds of spirals can happen because honestly you know a 500 million dollar cell of some kind of like fairly High market cap token in top 50 top 100 by CZ should not crater the price to near zero and bankrupt in exchange that that should not happen right if things were constructed properly and then there are also so you know suspicions that you know Alameda had unique accounts which were could not be liquidated uh on FTX and well that's what the first day declaration said so this is like a fact according to the new CEO John Ray yeah and I think this is true so they they've uh they their screenshots of this um document it's called the CLP program and we've also heard about it ourselves basically I think it's written it's in Japanese or I forget what language but basically it uh from what I understand are the terms the CLP program is a program that market makers can participate in and if they put extra collateral on the the platform where they have certain certain levels of margin normally than during extreme situations they'll actually get a call on the phone rather than Auto liquidated and then on top of that there are certain risk checks that are bypassed by the risk checking system so so you know basically from our study of their um of their systems there's two cues that your orders go into in the API whether you know you click through the screen uh that generates you know that order placement into the API or you actually connect up to their API and send them packets um there's two queues the first is the risk queue and your order goes through that once that's finished then it goes into the matching queue right and the risk queue there are some nuances there and from what we've been told normal customers go through the risk queue and things are checked in serial so there's a number of different things that have to be checked one after another right and I think it has to do with the fact that there's like multiple assets and you know they do cross asset collateralization there's a whole bunch of different collaterals that you can use you can use anything to catalyze anything almost right but then with the CLP program they basically run it in parallel and there are some like race conditions but they're willing to overlook that because like your credit is good or you've signed a document with them uh you know that sort of thing so I do think that that program exists I think that not many people even knew that it existed and probably Alameda was there here from the very beginning with this kind of favorable treatment now I think whether or not they actually looked at people's stops and passed that information to Alameda to go run people's stops or push them over there I mean that I don't know I wouldn't really speculate on that uh maybe they did maybe they didn't it just really depends on you know just how much you know how much malfeasance there was but at least I would say there probably was at least some kind of advantage for alamina with this CLP program we're going to take a really quick ad break and hear from the sponsors who make the show possible join over 10 million people

Jesse so Jesse what do you think happened to all this money how could there be this much missing it's kind of crazy you know I wonder I wonder how much of it was just lost through Market making you know if they wanted to they felt like they needed to prop up their own books and make a liquid market and they were willing to bleed off some amount of money just to do that over time and they knew that if their markets weren't liquid that they would just lose the exchange game period so it could be some was due to that you know I think to Kevin's point like I think they probably started to take on some some directional bets you know and if they were Market making a bunch of these coins they would have been holding those coins but it seems like you know maybe Luna was was like the start of this for them like the real liquidity crunch and uh you know there's like this Cascade of other dominoes falling that ultimately led to this and um you know I think that if you had had other lenders you know like if we um on Kraken for example you know when we look at sort of like the equity value of somebody's account for like margin Trading you know we look at tokens that they have and uh each token gets its own like discount rate basically you know like uh usdc is basically like zero discount you know Bitcoin might be like five percent discount or something like that and then you go all the way down the list you know and some tokens are like 95 discount you know to the the current price in a liquidation scenario toward the account Equity because we just don't feel like we're gonna be able to like liquidate that asset like it might be very volatile or it might be illicit markets and you know if FTX went outside to try to get a loan against their ftt someone else should have looked at that and said hey like this is uh you know you want like a five million five billion dollar loan against this asset that uh you know there's like 50 million dollars of liquidity out there and if we ever had to liquidate this you know it would be basically going to zero so you know maybe maybe you would put a cap on how much you lent out you would you would lend out like up to 50 million dollars or something like that against them against all the ftt or against you know 500 million dollars worth of ftt if you Market it at the current price uh but because they were lending to themselves they obviously like ignored this risk and just marked it like the most favorable rate possible which allowed Alameda basically to borrow client funds against like a collateral that was like almost worthless you know they just greatly exceeded what the risk level should be to the the lender FTX never should have lent Alameda client funds at like a one-to-one ratio basically you know they should have marked it down like 95 percent really uh to even be reasonable you know I think they probably just basically took out a bunch of Leverage bets on on coins that ultimately just crashed and I can't believe they were taking out loans to make like seed stage Venture Investments I mean that's just like Madness clearly I'm working at the wrong exchange because uh you know no one cracking hasn't bought me a 30 million dollar penthouse well since Kraken is still around I think maybe you are working at the right exchange yeah we'll see it hasn't played out yet um yeah maybe just to add to what Jesse said I actually read um their margin docs and basically there was a couple things that really stood out to me at FTX which was um there there is a collateral weight factor which was basically putting ftt at a five percent discount so something that should have been like 95 discounted was five percent discounted and on top of that another very weird feature is that in their loan book in their in their lending pool right you can borrow all sorts of different assets right but you couldn't borrow ftt and I think maybe that the reason for that is that they designed that on purpose because they didn't want people having a lot of ftt Too Short it right like even when they started and they opened their books for ftt they started with the spot market and it took a lot of time and a lot of lobbying by their customers to introduce a perp book on ftt if you guys remember when it first launched it was only a spot book while you know these days when they launched new token tokens they list the spot and the Futures and the perps at the same time so why all this very strange treatment for ftt which is different than everything else and my thought is that you know there's you know there's a little bit of smoke there I wouldn't you know maybe it's fire right but certainly there's a lot of smoke there suggesting that they knew exactly what they were doing and they were like in a wonky Financial engineering way trying to create something that is hard to go down because they themselves held so much of it and were using it as collateral for so much depth right so they wanted us few shorters in the market as possible and therefore wouldn't even lend it out so you know I think those are you know all these like small interesting tidbits um now coming out you know no single thing by itself is that suspicious they're all like slightly suspicious right and then you add them all together and the entire picture looks kind of horrifying yeah one last bit that I just had my jaw on the floor was in that Vox piece I don't know if you remember you know she kind of asks him you know about like what happened with with the the money and then he says something like oh yeah you know it we had these accounting issues um like for instance oh FTX doesn't have a bank account we'll just have customers send their money to Alameda three years later whoops all the money got sent to Alameda and we never you know put it in the stub account for FTX or something and I was like oh my God and then other people started tweeting like oh yeah when I deposit my money on the bank slip it said Alameda and I was just like whoa like customers were literally sending their money straight to Alameda and so I just feel like it appears at least from that Twitter DM that there literally was no separation and that Alameda just kind of considered customer funds their own funds to trade that's how I read that am I wrong or yeah I think that's exactly what happened now that I'm thinking back I think I remember that too right so like you know that somebody on Twitter posted hey look here's the wire instructions for FTX OTC and it clearly says on there the name of the verb is Alameda and I think that we actually have those same wire instructions I think when we traded with FTX OTC we also had to wire money to Alameda OTC so like I think that this is like these are some of the things where it's just like you know you really just can't be doing that you know because like it there's it's it's not clear that in the back end everything is being tracked correctly like this whole stub account issue you know like like um you know I'm I'm sort of reminded of like uh there have been other times with other exchanges where it's like you know just uh we we've managed to catch money disappearing out of the account and I'll give you one example which is pretty bizarre right which is that one of our counterparties uh was settling a trade with us and we told them to settle it to I don't mention the name of the exchange to this this exchanges account but instead of sending Bitcoin they instead of sending the tether to their the tether address they sent it to the Bitcoin address right so it's still it's still recoverable because it was still Bitcoin based tether right at the time but you know we need the exchange to go and like figure out how to like retrieve the funds and then credit us so the exchange charges some amount of money for doing that and we noticed that they actually charge this twice because they just kind of like forgot they didn't remember if they charged us or not um but they charged us twice so I'm sure like these kinds of things like happen all the time I I remember doing a trade with Alameda just like somebody has said on crypto Twitter where they settled their leg of the the trade but forgot to remove money from our account and we had to go ping them and say oh by the way um you know I think you guys forgot to take money out of her account but you know trade settle on your side so go feel free to do that and then oh sorry we forgot you know so it was just a lot of that kind of like sloppiness everywhere and I'm even reminded of another anecdote where I was talking with basically one of the employees at FTX and I was asking him you know because the person was looking around for uh vehicles to invest in right and I'm like but wait you guys have like don't you guys have like a really profitable Prop Shop like why don't you just invest in Alameda I mean you you work there you work at FTX I mean you know why don't you just invest there and he's like well Sam won't let us and I'm like well why is that the case where he says well it's just really messy because like all the bookkeeping and stuff you know it's just very hard to say exactly um you know what the right marks are and what exactly the p l is um at any time so you know right now it's just like it's just Sam's money as I'm remembering all of this I feel like the writing was on the wall right but it's just like each of these instances are just so far apart from each other and each one like not suspicious Enough by by themselves you know but there's like I think there's tons of instances like that you know Jesse do you want to add anything on that you know the using of like other bank accounts is something that some exchanges have done you know quadrica did it extensively and I I think in part you know it's just it's a problem for the industry that that it's very hard or at least historically it was very hard to get bank accounts it's gotten easier over time and I think you know these days if you're a legit crypto company you can get a bank account now um they're friendly friendly Banks serving crypto but uh for a time yeah it certainly was was very difficult and would that have been the case when FTX started in 2019. in 2019 no they should have yeah I think they would have been able to get a bank account in 2019 if they had been willing to do a little bit of diligence maybe get a license uh or something like that at the time it's definitely Shady you know is sometimes you question sending money to the CEO's wife's bank account or something which is stuff that like happened at quadruga but it's another thing to like send money directly into a hedge fund you know rather than like your exchange account you have to wonder like okay what are these guys actually doing with my money so that's definitely sketchy yeah wasn't there like an exchange in the old days like there was something like the rock trading or something you're supposed to mail an envelope of cash or something like that it was something wild it was something crazy basically yeah there was another one where they would tell you to go into a bank and you would have to deposit some amount that entered and ended in some number of cents and then that was how they would match like your order to what amount of Bitcoin you were buying yeah yeah this was like I think even before the dwala days I'm just blanking on the name of that exchange but trade Hill it was a trade Hill yeah maybe Trader that sounds like okay so I have like one kind of perhaps projection I'm curious to hear what you guys think of this um if you think this will actually happen but I thought that one of the kind of consequences of this whole thing will be that we'll maybe have more people doing the self-custody thing and participating in defy but I wonder what you thought of that because you know the history of of crypto has been littered with numerous incidents like this like obviously this appears to have been fraud and some of the other ones were more like hacks which it's a different animal but you know kind of the same thing you know customer puts their coins on an exchange and then lose the coins you know I was just kind of curious if you thought that would happen or also to hear because Jesse as far as I can tell I think you are an advocate of this Mantra and not your keys not your coins and yet you run an exchange so you probably have some sort of more nuanced view on like when that applies or like you know how people should think about this philosophy and yeah so it's just curious for your thoughts on all that yeah I hope that more people take their coins off and and self-custody I know not everyone's comfortable with it you know and if you've only got 20 20 worth of bitcoin and you don't really know what you're doing maybe that's a reason to leave it on because it's not that much to risk but also you know it's not that much to risk on the other side too to to self-custody I do hope that more people learn about that and um try to do that you know from from The Exchange perspective for us we don't get paid for keeping your coins on the exchange you know we don't charge any kind of like account balance fee there's no monthly fee there's no dormancy fee or anything like that and so if you're not trading with the money that's on your Kraken account that's just a liability for us you know we're vaulting your assets for free basically so we're taking all this liability you know in the event that we get hacked or you know something happens to your account so it's just risk for us and and why would we want to have this risk if you know we're not getting anything from it you know so if you're not trading with your coins you're not staking them I mean there are non-custodial ways to stake as well my preference is you just take it off because just risk that we don't need and we're not benefiting from and but do you think that that will actually happen that more people will try to do the self-custody thing or do you feel that the vast majority of people find that sort of um onerous for them um yeah I think it is onerous um for for many people especially if you're if you're actively trading you know obviously you you don't want to just be moving your money on and off all the time but we've already seen a lot of withdrawals I mean if you look at the blockchain uh most of the exchanges are getting like net withdrawals and uh I think that means people are withdrawing to their own custody which is fantastic but you know it's probably just a matter of time before this is forgotten and you know a new wave of people come in you know just like everyone forgot about gox and uh you know and and the next Bull cycle there'll be a new wave of people coming in to crypto they'll have no idea about FTX they'll certainly have no idea about Mount gox and um you know unfortunately there'll probably be like another hard lesson to learn again at some point I think we as an industry you know need to do a better job of just like calling out the Bad actors I think the ranking sites need to like come up with some other metrics by which to to measure venues other than just like trading volume you know like maybe some kind of like degree of like seriousness of of the business or longevity of the business you know I think one of the the big things that caused FTX blow up to be as bad as it was was that you know even people that were experienced gox you know their their worst case scenario is like a hack that people just thought like the hack was the way that like you know NF FTX would get taken down but because of all of the the media hype the media fluff pieces the political contributions you know all of the people that Sam seem to be hanging out with you know the celebrity endorsements all this stuff I think that helped to build up this status you know which you know just like Bernie Madoff basically and just like Elizabeth Holmes with theranos you know like surrounded themselves with with the elite people who you know from the outside you see that who they're associated with and you think oh wow this person just must be totally legit otherwise they wouldn't be associating with all these um you know other Elite people you know that was obviously wrong I mean he sort of bought his way into that perception with client funds and you know I think I think people just didn't think about that like could he be buying all these stadiums and all this stuff like you know people saw him spending so much money and and I think thought wow he must just be making so much money there's no way like he's extremely competent even if he does lose some money he's making so much money that uh you know he would cover the hole or whatever you know not thinking that actually what's going on is he's actually spending all the clients money to buy all the status you know I think that's maybe like a new thing for the industry I don't think we've had like a legit bad actor like that before who just intentionally stole client funds you know I think everything else everyone else has gone down has been hacks I think but I don't know Kevin correct me if I'm wrong I don't know big Vern was a bit shady I would say that's true yeah um wait what what what's that big for I don't know what that is uh courtesy that was cripsy he's still out there right he hasn't been that large down right he's like hiding out in China somewhere probably all these guys I mean who knows that the Quadra good guy is dead or alive and who knows really you know I'm still waiting for Sam to mysteriously die in India yeah exactly exactly that's right yeah no I think actually Gerald cotton probably is the the other big one that's known but you're right I can't think of and so the one guy shows up as a Xerox sifu right is this a wild the timeline's just wild but but yeah no I I definitely agree with uh you know Jesse's sentiments here you know it's just well one other thing that I wanted to ask about was so we talked about how ftt was a big part of what happened here and I I mean name any of the other Sam coins like serum or oxy or Maps or fighter or whatever these all are which like I literally hadn't heard of some of these until a few days ago I'm sure you have seen encrypted Twitter a lot of bitcoiners are taking a lap right now they're all like you know we told you that all these coins that you guys are creating it's like a bad idea and um and stuff like that and Jesse I don't I know you're a bitcoiner I don't know if you would consider yourself a Bitcoin Maximus obviously you run an exchange so you're selling a bunch of different coins but I was just curious like does this vindicate you know what Bitcoin maximus in particular where they where they're more like focused just on one coin not just like being a Bitcoin or who also is interested in other coins but like specifically Maximus do you think that this vindicates them or what's your thought on that no I I don't think so you know I mean it doesn't vindicate any anyone any more than you know someone who thinks that Tesla is the the best car company and then the Bernie Madoff situation happens and a bunch of other investors who are not invested in Tesla Get Wrecked you know I mean this this really doesn't have anything to do with Bitcoin or the other coins or D5 this is just a straight up fraud Ponzi theft you know I mean he could have been custodying anything it could have been Pokemon cards or stocks or whatever you know he's just had custody of of client assets and uh he stole them and that's it you know and it's unfortunate that um the Bitcoin and crypto Community are the victims here but I think we need to like keep repeating this for politicians you know so they don't come back to try to attack defying crypto and say that that somehow this proves that you know we we need more regulation around defy you know if anything this proves we need more regulation or better regulation around centralized venues you know which which I would love to hear from Kevin like you said earlier you were getting you were getting shut out of other venues and so you became concentrated in FTX why were you getting shut out of other venues and what was it that FTX was doing that for example crack on her coinbase you know weren't doing which which would have allowed you to kind of remain on Shore in the U.S yeah so I mean we were getting kicked off because you know we're basically a us-based um firm and then um you know I think there's been a lot of improvements uh you know the kraken's uh sort of matching engine API and just overall systems recently uh but you know one of the reasons we um slowed down our trading earlier on was just because you know there was more liquidity on sort of like first of all on derivatives in general uh and then second it's nice to have like being able to use like any asset as collateral that sort of thing you know just like fewer rejections I think through through the API and you know through the websockets you know that being said it's not like you know FTX was like super great either right to use as a product because like there were certain like weird bursts of latency here and there sometimes their systems would fall over too so you know and then you know going through the risk check Instagram all you know consumed up a lot of time you know tens of milliseconds maybe even hundreds sometimes you know I think it's just a sort of balance of considering all the different offerings between all the different exchanges and and I think there there is something to be said that because FTX was kind of like a little bit skirting regulation a little bit more um than let's say cracking and coinbase they're able to kind of get away with like listing some like really random you know crazy stuff right like all sorts of  coins and like Vault products and leverage tokens and all sorts of like random stuff and even though I don't like particularly like any of those products uh or almost any of them uh still if there's trading and you know there's retail appetite or even institutional appetite for those products then you know I think market makers tend to think well then there must be money to be made there um so you know they'll bring some of their business over so you know I think I think those are just some of the reasons yeah well Jesse so this leads me to a question to you because as you just implied in your question to Kevin I've seen a lot of people say that a big reason that this happened here is because Regulators in the US have not come up with clear regulation here the other kind of like flip side of that argument is that leaving FTX us aside we haven't seen a U.S exchange that has seen this level of Fraud and so in that sense um that's an argument in favor of The Regulators who say like oh are existing laws work quite well and we don't need new laws so it's kind of curious to hear your take on you know whether or not existing regulations have helped us customers or if you think you know this kind of lack of Regulation that's specific to crypto has hurt U.S customers I think overall hurt you know it basically forces people to to go offshore for things that they otherwise would be able to get you know in the United States um just take like Futures Trading for example it's it's not available in the United States um trading certain tokens which uh the SEC would probably call Securities you know is not allowed in the United States and and there's actually no there's no license to be able to do that whatsoever it's not just a matter of like getting the right license there's there's no license and so the SEC would say yeah there's just no way to do this this activity period in the U.S unless there's a change to the law uh which explicitly contemplates this this new activity uh so so people are forced to go offshore because the domestic businesses are prevented from offering these services and um you know coinbase even went to the SEC to ask them if they could offer this like three or four percent yield product and uh you know seem like a very conservative product and um the SEC rejected it and so they weren't even able to launch that thing meanwhile FTX is offering the same product basically with 10 yields from the Bahamas and so if you're a U.S client you know why wouldn't you just go go do that right like I mean maybe you've been comfortable at your safe and secure domestic Exchange in the United States but there's this other exchange offshore that's offering 10 yields so like that's pretty attractive and if The Regulators aren't doing anything about that you know we asked the regulars all the time you know when they when they hassle us about certain products or we try to get approval for certain products that our competitors are offering you know why aren't you guys going after are you preventing us from doing this but you're also not going after the guys offshore that are doing it and um you know basically it comes down to like laziness and and convenience and I think they don't recognize that by not shutting those guys off and at the same time preventing domestic businesses from from doing that activity they're basically forcing all of the consumers to go offshore to do what they want to do uh so it's like the worst of Both Worlds the one question about that because um both I and I saw buckrin or somebody like my thought was oh maybe all of this makes coinbase feel better about the fact that they didn't end up launching the learn the um earn product because it shows kind of how risky it is to try to take customer funds and then earn yields on them so like what do you say about that and then I mean on the other hand like when you talk about how FTX was offering 10 like clearly the methods they were doing to uh using to do that were risky so you know they were loaning Alameda but like uh they were yeah they were certainly doing some very risky stuff that was probably the most risky loan you could ever make you know I think to get three or four percent I I think you can do in conservative reasonable ways without taking a lot of risk they could even be you know doing it internally you know like Kraken has a has a margin program basically right so we have a pool of funds that go into the the margin pool and uh clients are effectively borrowing that on the exchange to trade on on margin and um and we could we could easily offer three or four percent returns if we were able to open up funding the margin pool to clients uh because the the margin rollovers rollovers are at like 20 a year or something like that you know so we could easily do that without having to go outside of our system and without having to trust a third party you know it's all like kind of self-contained and we have full overlateralization and liquidation control and all that stuff so I think you can you can get numbers like that um especially in in today's interest rate climate you know without too much difficulty but you know to even be prevented from from offering something like that even conservatively uh it's a huge problem and and I think The Regulators don't acknowledge that and I think as a as a country we also need to understand like what do we want our our public policy to be here and what do we want our national objectives to be here with crypto and and if it's to own more of the crypto business and and develop more of the the crypto industry domestically then we have to update these laws and then we have to to do something for the the good actors you know we can't just say too bad when their offshore competitors are are out competing because they're able to to have a better product because they're not enforced against I completely agree with Jesse you know I think um you know in some ways like even if like the US government's goal was like a little bit like against crypto anti-crypto right even then strategically doesn't it make sense for them to welcome as much business onshore as possible and then try and control things afterwards like why be so aggressive about crypto in such you know early days and push everybody offshore push all the businesses offshore push all the users and consumers offshore and then finally when they do get some kind of like iron grip over their domestic you know crypto industry you know more than 90 of it is already offshore right like what was the point of that even from their own incentives even from their own goals right so you know I definitely agree I think um you know governments generally been pretty heavy-handed um on on on regulation and and a lot of it's not directed at crypto a lot of it is like Legacy on regulation that crypto maybe happens to fall under but it's a little bit gray but people want to be safe so they don't want to mess up or anything like that right so it's like it just kind of shows just how far the system has come right to where it is today where it's just that hard to do business in the US uh which shouldn't be the case right you know there is a lot of gray area and the problem is that The Regulators have largely taken the approach that anything gray is black and um you know they want to kind of capture as much control as possible and for the businesses um you know we've we've disagreed with Regulators at times uh you know we might think a product is completely okay and legal to offer and they will have a different interpretation because the fines available to them are so high you know if we went to if we took them to court to try to prove our case you know first of all it might take years but if they won you know Their fines available to them are just obscene you know it could be something like five thousand dollars per transaction you know which is counted as a trade or something like that you know which would you know they're like Millions a day so so you know they potentially could be awarded some fine against us it's like a trillion dollars all right so even fighting over just being able to offer a specific product could be like existential for the whole business right like the fine could just could blow up the whole business and so what ends up happening is the companies will just like not offer that product because it's not worth risking the whole business for yeah definitely and and I you know I do particularly think that you know in spite of what happened at FTX I do think having a loan book within exchange is is a good idea in in the sense that you can allow users to choose whether or not they want to take that risk and fully disclose all the risks to them and say that okay you can we can do one of two things we'll just keep your money not re-hypothecated not loan it out it just sits there and does nothing right but you know you just take on absolutely no risk completely segregated or you can take a bit of risk get that three to four percent yield but if something catastrophic happens we may or may not cover that loss we may still just cover the loss we still might just make you whole but we may not and these are some very weird tale situations that are possible right so I think as long as I think all these risks are kind of disclosed then people can kind of choose for themselves with the risk appetite is whether they want to be like Ultra conservative or try and get some yield out of their balances so yeah so I think I think I don't think there's anything wrong with that kind of product it's more just that well there was kind of like malfeasance at FTX and then on top of that that product wasn't well designed if you can accept those collateral things that are just extremely illiquid and when it comes time to liquidate certain loans uh the borrowers post this collateral then you're not able to do so without taking account Equity values yeah actually it's funny because I was going to ask you what you thought was going to happen of crypto lending oh I kind of I'll kind of throw out a few topics you can sort of pick where you want to go with this but we touched on the media a little bit we have now touched on Regulators although I do think we could actually talk about that even more one thing I also noticed was that Jesse you had a tweet Thread about VCS missing red flags and in general I feel like there's this kind of constant tension we see in crypto which you know started with these cypherpunk ideals and then now these VCS have been very influential in the space and you know we kind of see this tension just constantly play out there was that whole phase a few years ago with the fair launch coins versus the VC coins and obviously a lot of VCS right now are being reprimanded for their role here uh and what happened with FTX so all those things are crypto lending you can take any uh topic that you want but we'll maybe just have each one of you say a few last words and it can be about any of those topics um yeah sure so what I would say is that you know I don't quite believe uh the VCS on what they say on their word because the VCS tend to benefit a lot from what happened um at least earlier on with FTX and the Sam coins right like if you're a VC and your buddy buddy with SPF and you get allocation into all these different Sam coins then like you yourself as a fund now get to mark up the book extremely high because the float is so low fdv is so high and then if you were to do distributions based on Mark to Market profits to investors in the token itself right so you issue out these distributions and token itself then you get to mark your carry at an extremely high overvalued price right and this this would be very different if they had to sell the token back down into dollars and then distribute the dollar profits to their limited partners right so there's a lot of this kind of like synergistic kind of like symbiotic relationship between the VCS and Sam just on the Sam coins and then you know kind of on the FTX side I think a lot of the VCS honestly are over uh willing to overlook a lot of things because if you look at the web 2 Playbook way back in the day with the you know.com bubble you know a lot of these you know there are these VCS that surely didn't think that these there were some businesses that were good but they still invested into them because they thought that you know the growth would be good enough that they could get it to the soft Bank round that they could then get it to the public and then finally dump on the public right so it's not like it's not like crypto is unique in that sense of these games of people buying illiquid stuff and then you know with enough moment momentum flipping it high enough to then dump it onto the Public's head right like this has been the playbook for a lot of web 2 VCS for a long time already and now we're just seeing the crypto variation of that right so like all these uh you know VCS you know I don't really take them on their word because I think that there there's a lot of mixed incentives and you know as well as with the exchanges themselves too right not just FTX but you know exchanges in general you know there's all these kind of like um dealings between you know the the token market makers so not like the principal market makers but the ones that contract with the token projects and the exchanges who get listing fees I mean this is more like 2017 right where it's just like it's literally in everybody's incentive um that everybody makes money except for retail and they all not even in a collusive or conspiratorial way but just out of their own incentives cooperate with each other to dump on retail as the inadvertent action even though it's none of their goals to dump on retail well that is kind of national equilibrium outcome if they're all following their own interests right and they all take a little piece of the pie right so I think you know you have a lot of this kind of behavior it's not that they're outright colluding it just so happens that their interests are aligned to dump on retail and then some people just don't say anything it's not that they think it's right it's just that you know well it benefits them so they don't say anything yeah there are some investors that that uh passed on the FTX round and said that they had they saw some crazy things um you know not all the investors share all this information you know I think they're obviously they don't they don't generally come out publicly when they spot something that looks like a fraud because they might be wrong you know they don't want to get in trouble for um you know disparaging somebody and get a lawsuit against them or something and um you know they don't want to like burn the relationship with the founder you know like VCS try to preserve their relationship even if they pass because it could always be wrong you know they want to want another opportunity to come back later and so you know maybe they weren't as critical as as they should have been I mean maybe you know the worst case they just didn't invest but many investors took a look and I think we're just either you know maybe they got some incentives in tokens that tip the scales for them or maybe they were just fomoing at the time and you know they saw this hockey stick growth from FTX and they were used to investing in growth companies like you know Instagrams and uh social networks and chat apps and stuff like that where you know all that mattered was like your user growth and revenue and uh there was not really any concern put toward you know the actual like infrastructure of the business you know like how secure it was or anything like that because you know worst case scenario for a photo sharing app is like you know people get to steal the photos which obviously has been pretty bad in some cases but you know it's not it's not like at the level of losing 10 billion dollars which was probably even more than the company it was worth at the time right so like that possibility exists in crypto for custodians that you can lose more money than your company is worth you know I think VCS maybe didn't really appreciate that at the time I do want to touch on on one other topic uh which was the regulation you know and and I think we all have to come together as an industry right now and uh stop fighting about proof of work versus proof of stake because politicians have just been like salivating for an opportunity like this to attack crypto and I think we we need to just be totally clear that you know we're not willing to give up any ground in in defy and that this is 100 just a basic Bernie Madoff style fraud uh you know and just as Bernie Madoff was not an indictment of uh the stock market or Wall Street you know no one was calling for more controls on uh the stock market or NASDAQ after Bernie Madoff you know we shouldn't be hearing that kind of stuff about crypto either and if we are hearing that you know either someone's being intellectually dishonest or you know they're using this is just a fake reason to to attack crypto so we need to clear up at any time it's mentioned you know we need to just clear that up and make sure that everyone understands this is a fraud on the crypto Community it's not a fraud of crypto or you know buy crypto and so you know I'm very concerned about the political blowback that's coming here and it's going to land on the victims unfortunately uh you know anything it's not going to be targeted in the right place which is how do we actually help consumers get us access to safer products yeah I mean if anything this was a guy from tradfy coming into crypto wrecking all the crypto people so if anything we're we're the ones who got attacked here you know by uh by FTX and Alameda yeah so yeah completely agree um you know Laura um I actually just I had one question for you if you don't mind um which is having uh you know had a career in media what are your thoughts about why it's the case that like SPF gets all these puff pieces in the media but then the media goes out and just slams oh you know all the mainstream media it goes out and slams Jesse and Brian at coinbase and you know it doesn't look upon them very favorably like why do you think that that is the case from your own experiences um in Media well so so first of all I I consider myself to still be in media you know now I just have my own little Media company but um the other thing that I would say is to not paint um the media like it's not a monolithic thing obviously they're you know good reporters bad reporters just as like you know there's fraudulent exchanges in um you know above board exchanges what I would say is that I think in this particular case I think probably you're talking about the New York Times piece that came out on SPF earlier this week and you know the the main reporter in that he he's like three years out of college and another big piece that he wrote on Sam was a few months ago after the salt conference in the Bahamas in April and I think maybe at that time he had really kind of you know who knows I I didn't I didn't read it again recently now but my sense is like he probably spent a fair amount of time with him and like had some sort of impression of him at that time and then maybe it was just like a little bit slow on the uptake of like just how much of a fraud this was and maybe that's why the piece just seemed a lot more sympathetic than it probably should have been you know I just maybe want to explain that one particular situation I think you know for some of the other critical coverage so Jesse probably knows like you know when you underwent that it sort of seemed like a bit of a it was worth it like there was internal fighting a kraken basically is what this story was you know that story probably like in general when people do stories and and you probably even hear like comedians will say this like you know you don't punch down you punch up you know which isn't to say that um the every Reporter Goes in being like Oh I'm gonna you know take down the people in charge but it's more like you want to try to give voice to people who maybe are the ones who have less power so maybe in any kind of conflict that is what will happen and so maybe that's why those pieces might have come across as like oh the times is like attacking Jessie or attacking Brian or whatever that's probably like maybe another way to look at it obviously I don't work at the times I I don't even know like a ton about what happened in those situations other than what I read there but um maybe that is like one way that I would look at it one thing that I I do want to say because obviously the media you know like you know Forbes who I used to work work put SPF on the cover Fortune did as well unfortunately I don't remember if I read both of those pieces that sometimes sometimes one of those things like you see one of those pieces you're like I'll save it for later and then you know you don't get to finish it when you are doing this kind of work there are certain markers that you look at of like legitimacy and the VC backing that Sam had um would probably you know check that box off for you you know I mean like Sequoia being very closely affiliated with you that that's like oh like this is you know one of the the best and um you know like it's a VC firm that does its due diligence or whatever you know just there are certain shortcuts that you take um or I shouldn't even take it I call it a shortcut but it's more like you know when you see so many stamps of approval it kind of gives you a sense of like what the quality of this person or or their Enterprises so that's another way maybe that I could explain all of that that happened but when it comes down to it I really think the situation frankly was that you know at least so far we know that only four people knew about this like I have talked to some you know high-ranking people at FTX they were just completely blindsided they did not know so I think when you just have that kind of secret like you know that that's something that's just it's going to be hard for that to come out and the last bit I'll say is that and I can't remember if I said this on on the show previously so for listeners who maybe heard it uh you know uh you could skip ahead but I had been tipped off to a few things about Sam previously um nothing related to this uh just other things and when I had tried to get people to talk to me about it nobody wanted to talk to me because Sam was a gazillionaire he was very powerful in the industry they were worried about their careers they would worry that he could like bury them in the ground with like a tiny little lawsuit that would be you know you know super difficult for them to defend but easy for him to just like spend a bunch of money on you know people just weren't willing to talk and so it's just fascinating to me and granted like I said the tips that I got were not uh related to this but still it's like what happened with Harvey Weinstein you know that story took decades to come out even though apparently that whole time it was an open secret in Hollywood that he would prey on young actresses this way right so like at that time again because he was so powerful people did not want to speak to the media even though everybody knew this was happening and when you have that kind of like threat from someone it's hard for everyday people to like be the ones to step forward and talk to the media so that's another reason why like I do see a lot of blame going to the media and yet I feel like there's just a lack of awareness of like all the hurdles that you need to go through as a reporter to be able to publish that kind of thing and not only does it start with sources being unwilling to talk to you but it ends with like the publisher maybe not wanting to publish it or the lawyer at the publication being like you know we can't do this for you know XYZ reason like I can't remember for the Harvey Weinstein one there was a previous reporter I think it was yeah I think it was Kenneth at the New Yorker and he just couldn't get across the Finish Line he had done a ton of reporting he couldn't get across the Finish Line he ended up giving his notes to Ronan Pharaoh which like that's crazy like if I spend a bunch of time I definitely wouldn't want to give my notes to another reporter that's like competing with me that's terrible but you know at that point kenneletta was just like wow I have been trying to get this guy for years like a lot of people have been trying to get this guy for years you're closer like we should get this over the Finish Line I'm going to give you some help and so even when I with you know the Dow attacker thing like people have asked me like why didn't you name the Dow attacker in your book like you you know eventually publish it but it's not in the book and if you read my book you know it's 12 chapters four of them are all about the doe attack and yet I knew who it was but you know and so that's just you know I'm not gonna give too much information what happened there but you know that that just goes to show like even though I had like great evidence you know the thought was let's let's put this in a publication that is used to dealing with this kind of situation because as book publishers they're not they just pretty much never have that kind of thing on their hands and and yet you know yes I publish it in forms but you don't know how many how many Publications I pitched before then and you know thing that I had people coming back to me saying things like oh well you know how do we know that this isn't a case like one Newsweek named Doria Nakamoto Satoshi Nakamoto and you know I didn't want to like give all my information away either you know because what if they steal it you know but like I knew how good my evidence was and it's really you know thankfully just because of how much my Forbes editors and I we trust each other we like have worked together for a long time and so they you know we're like oh like we'll we'll do this like you know we we trust you and you know they verified all the evidence and then they were like yeah this is strong doing that kind of work it takes so much work like and like I said just all these people will put up like little roadblocks or like little hurdles for you to pass along the way so you know so when I see all these tweets being like the media should have figured this out I'm like okay you guys just you know you just should understand what it takes to to do this kind of work and actually get it into print like that is the really hard part so and which is not to say like you know the media was perfect in any regard um but the media never is I mean it's one of the hardest jobs here like publicly performing all the time and like people just like well you know I criticize you the moment that you you publish your your work so yeah I appreciate that no I totally understand makes sense yeah so okay well um anyway this has been so amazing I know we're like way over time um but you guys this yeah has been awesome why don't you each tell people where they can learn more about you and your work all right um I'm Jesse Powell You can learn more about me on Twitter uh my handle is at
