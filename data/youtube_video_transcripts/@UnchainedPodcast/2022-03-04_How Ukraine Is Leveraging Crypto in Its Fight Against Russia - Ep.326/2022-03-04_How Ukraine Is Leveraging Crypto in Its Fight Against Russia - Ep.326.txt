laura link in the description today's guest is tamika tillemann chief policy officer at katie han's new firm welcome to micah pleasure to be with you thank you laura when i was casting about for someone who could speak to the crisis in russia and ukraine with what has turned out to be a surprising crypto angle i realized you would be perfect because of your extensive experience both in government and with blockchain technology for listeners who are unfamiliar with you can you please give a brief description of your background so people can understand how your perspective is deeply informed by both subject areas well i went to work in washington now many years ago for a little known delaware senator named joe biden and at the time he was the ranking member on the senate foreign relations committee and i covered a large swath of the world for him that included ukraine and spent a great deal of time engaging with ukrainian officials in that capacity i then in 2008 went over to the state department and served as a speechwriter and later senior advisor to secretary of state hillary clinton and then secretary of state john kerry and ultimately uh encountered uh blockchain technology and uh crypto on web 3 in the course of that work uh through a conversation initially with then president of estonia tomas ilves estonia has some of the world's best digital systems and we were talking about how we could port those capabilities to other countries around the world and his suggestion was that if we were to do something like that again today we would build on on blockchain and that really got me interested in in this vast new space of what we now call web3 i left the state department a few years later inspired in in large part by what i had found in the ecosystem went to work at an organization called new america that operates at the intersection of innovation and policy and collaborated with governments around the world and across the united states in building out an array of open source and decentralized systems to serve the needs of their citizens more effectively from there went to andreessen horowitz where i was global had a policy with a focus on web 3 issues and joined katie's team just a few months ago so yeah so people can see how you know both areas very well and why don't we now give a recap of what it is that has happened over the past week and a half involving russia and ukraine and also then talk about how it is that crypto became involved in this story so quickly well you've seen over the last several months a buildup by russian forces in the bordering areas primarily in belarus and in areas of russia that are right up against ukraine what we saw you know tragically but uh in in this case there was a lot of warning as that as soon as the olympics ended uh russian tanks uh rolled into uh ukraine and this was a case where u.s intelligence did a very good job we had a pretty good idea that this was coming and in the conversations that i had been having with us officials for weeks and weeks they anticipated that this would occur you i think are now in a situation where the ukrainians have proven incredibly heroic in in defending their country and have been successful in holding off the russian advances in many if not the vast preponderance of the population centers around ukraine but they are in urgent need of help in order to avoid being overrun and uh it's uh surprising but uh some of that help a significant chunk of that help uh has come from the crypto community the vice premier of ukraine the the vice prime minister put out a call for help uh asking for people to donate we've seen almost 50 million dollars in contributions come in which is pretty breathtaking if you think about it and a wide array of different web 3 tools harnessed in order to help in the response efforts you see efforts to utilize platforms like our weave for documents preservation and for evidence preservation in the case of war crimes you see a variety of different mechanisms being utilized to send humanitarian support so this is really the the first conflict in which web 3 tools are playing a big role and we're seeing that they can be utilized pretty decisively to support those who are standing up to oppression which is i think one of the reasons that many of us got into this space to begin with yeah i mean just to see a government twitter account tweeting here's our btc and ethan tether address and later dot was added i mean that was just really mind-blowing you know it really felt like okay definitely something historic is happening right now you know at what point in history have we ever seen anything even remotely similar to this you know one thing i wanted to ask about was several russian banks were cut off from swift which is kind of like financial messaging infrastructure and i have heard that you know some different entities felt that that maybe wasn't the right move that that should be kept neutral and that there were risks that then that would kind of break up the primacy of of swift and and reduce its power and maybe by extension the power of the us dollar what do you make of that and then how you know there were concerns that of course then russia could just turn to crypto instead like what do you make of that debate and and what the concerns were around crypto well i think you've seen a couple of different elements come together very rapidly the first is an unprecedented sanctions response by virtually the entire world and swift is one manifestation of that swift is an old and pretty cumbersome system it's very expensive to use it's very slow it's not a great way to send resources between banks but it is the only system uh that most banks rely on to do that on a cross-border basis and so i think for for that reason swift has been in trouble for a long time and certainly many of us in the the crypto community the web 3 community have been mindful of the challenges confronting swift for for quite a few years now i think what we are seeing at the moment is a forcing function which is that many countries are going to take a hard look at swift at the inefficiencies that exist within swift and you know that's it's true that potentially they may start looking for other solutions i also think there's a real moment here for some of the solutions uh like dollar denominated stable coins that are being developed that are frankly much more functional than the the antiquated swift system uh that we've been stuck with for a long time to come to the forefront and and prove that they can meet some of the needs that were previously provided by by that system um so i think this is a moment when folks are going to start asking tough questions about our financial infrastructure and our digital systems hopefully we're going to be able to answer those questions in ways that will ensure an open dynamic financial system going forward but it's hard to argue that the russian banks deserve to be sanctioned in this situation and i certainly supported the move to remove them from swift so numerous people have also warned that russia you know could use krypto to have vein sanctions um for instance senator elizabeth warren tweeted cryptocurrencies risk undermining sanctions against russia allowing putin and his cronies to evade economic pain what do you think of that theory is that possible or likely or or is that unlikely the most sophisticated analysts in the space organizations like chanalysis have looked at this question in great detail and they've come to the conclusion that it would be virtually impossible for russian actors to utilize crypto to evade sanctions at scale there may be limited instances in which an actor here an actor there can circumvent the the sanctions regime but it's going to be extremely challenging due to the visibility and accountability that's provided by blockchain architecture to really do an end run around the international sanctions that have been put in place i think that you know certainly law enforcement is going to be watching closely to see how this plays out it's a pretty unprecedented set of circumstances but in many of the engagements that we have with national security and law enforcement leaders they are among the most enthusiastic actors when it comes to the use of web3 technology because they know that the alternative which they've dealt with in past conflicts is pallets full of hundred dollar bills that go into war zones and uh yes certainly uh web3 tools provide a much much higher degree of accountability and transparency than the systems that they have been forced to rely on in the past which are deeply deeply flawed and problematic yes but certainly if i were in their shoes i probably would prefer using blockchain technology over pallets of cash if i were trying to trade to trace um transactions all right so in a moment we're going to talk a little bit more about some of the other crypto turns with this story but first a quick word from the sponsors who make the show possible web 3 means freedom from big tech and wall street with more control and better privacy but your crypto wallet is a weak point most wallets are browser extensions a web 2 technology that means the same old risks app spoofing phishing scams and theft brave wallet is different

that trading volume pairs in crypto with the ruble have increased in volume on tuesday the block reported that they are up over three times their normal volume so what do you think is going on you know probably i guess on the ground level for russian people well the the russian people are facing an unprecedented crisis uh there's no major economy in the world that has ever been unplugged from global markets in the way that russia has over the the last few days and you know certainly there are many uh russian people who are not supportive of the war and it's important to acknowledge that but there is a broad recognition on the part of the international community that changing the behavior of vladimir putin and his regime will require imposing some pretty extraordinary and unprecedented penalties on the russian economy and so i think you see a lot of russians looking to decouple from the ruble in any way that they can because the value of the ruble is plummeted and in many instances what we're hearing is that the utility of the usual mechanisms that people would take advantage of to make purchases in in russia is also crumbling many of the the payment systems that they traditionally rely on just aren't functioning and so in the against that backdrop it's not surprising that you're going to see folks trying to utilize decentralized architecture to you know keep keep their families fed and ensure that they're able to survive what is going to be a difficult time so similarly we did see that the ukrainian government and the vice prime minister who you mentioned before i'm not sure how to pronounce his name mikhail federal yes called on crypto exchanges to freeze the accounts of russian and bella russian users but the exchanges responded that they would only impose sanctions on individuals to whom you know was legally required to do so so why do you think these ukrainian ministers or the ukrainian government were requesting this and then what did you make of the exchange's response well certainly ukraine's best hope right now is to impose the strongest possible penalties on russia in order to ultimately most international policy and international diplomacy comes down to a very simple equation you know are the the costs of pursuing a course of action for a leader greater than the benefits of that course of action and you know previously vladimir putin had made a determination that the costs of going into ukraine were going to be outweighed by the benefits that he was hoping to accrue from that the ukrainians are trying to change the equation and they're using any possible tool that they can to to do it and you have to recognize the the pressure that they are under in this extraordinary moment to do that i think you are seeing a couple of things as this plays out the fact that folks are moving assets out of rubles puts further pressure on the russian economy so that that on its own is actually an additional challenge for the the kremlin and then you know beyond that i i think there are a wide array of potential responses to this and and you have to be somewhat some they they follow the fact pattern for each specific case i don't know that you can say categorically that kicking everybody off is the right thing or kicking nobody off is the right thing um they're going to be i think a lot of efforts over the the next few days to identify individuals who are subject to the sanctions make sure that those individuals don't have access to any asset and sanctions of course are not based on the type of asset they're based on the individual who is sanctioned and so that's an important clarifying point and you know hopefully we we get to a place where those that are an urgent humanitarian need are going to be able to access uh digital assets those that are facilitating or participating in the conflict in ukraine should not be able to access their assets in in my view if they're under a sanctions regime and one other thing i wanted to ask about in terms of donations to the ukrainian government is that we saw other crypto donations groups such as groups such as ukraine dao spring up and i wondered how that compa you know donating to that how that would compare to sending money to the government's addresses or just what you make of the fact that a dow sprang up for this purpose um then you know what you thought the significance was of this well there have been a variety of very innovative uses of web 3 technology including dows some of which have been publicly announced a number of which have not yet been publicly announced but they're coordinating uh response efforts across everything from humanitarian engagement to in in some other instances looking at longer term challenges like the prosecution of war crimes and so we're seeing an array of different mechanisms uh come to the fore uh i think that you know with crypto in general you get a much higher degree of transparency than you're usually accustomed to in humanitarian assistance or support provided in a conflict zone so you know that money has arrived in the account you can see when money has left the account and in the context of a dow you have some say in how that money is spent um so there is a lot of accountability that comes with the utilization of uh web3 architecture that we haven't really had in any past global conflict and that i think is something that we are still starting to wrap our heads around but my assumption is it's going to have a very far-reaching impact on the way that humanitarian support is provided in complex emergencies going forward donors will be able to know with a high degree of assurance that resources have hit a specific wallet that they're trying to target and in the past you would send money off to a place like afghanistan and pray that maybe a small portion of those assets would actually meet their make it to their intended destination that's no longer the case so a very fascinating twist was that the ukrainian government even then announced an air drop at one point they did ultimately cancel it and instead replace it with an nft drop and people were saying oh people are getting rug pulled by a sovereign nation but i kind of wanted to unpack that so at the moment of that the airdrop was announced what did you think the significance of that was before we knew that they were going to change their minds i think it's fair to say that it is both extraordinary and unprecedented for a government to be utilizing uh defy tools to mobilize and aggregate capital in the the context of a military crisis that's not something that the best of my knowledge we have ever seen before on planet earth uh but you know now that it's been done and being done frankly very successfully by the ukrainians and they are a country that has a high degree of technical proficiency many of their leaders are web 3 natives they understand how these tools work i assume we're going to see this again and it's it's certainly likely that it could become a more common feature of providing support in complex humanitarian emergencies um i i think that ukrainian authorities have plenty of things to worry about right now so i certainly would not be counting on them to provide air drops i i think that those who contributed speaking for myself at least did so without any expectation of an airdrop but i i do think that tools like nfts could provide a very powerful mechanism for validating contributions going forward and creating the type of community that web 3 systems are uniquely positioned to build across borders across time zones bringing people together to address a common challenge and so ultimately why do you think they decided against the token airdrop in favor of the nfts you know i've had a lot of conversations with ukrainian officials over the last couple of days i haven't pushed them on that question and i wouldn't want to speculate i think they have better things to worry about okay so at this moment you know we're looking at just some really unprecedented things that have happened but in general from this moment and going forward you know obviously i'm sure this isn't the main you know thing that's top of mind for the ukrainian officials but i do think that actually this has really showcased some benefits of blockchain technology so what would you say are kind of the main lessons for some people who are you know seeing blockchain being used in this way for the first time well i'd highlight four big areas where the international community should sit up and and take very close notice the first is when it comes to moving capital to governments the united nations has estimated in the past that in complex environments you lose roughly 30 of every dollar that's deployed due to malfeasance and corruption it takes another 15 approximately of every dollar to do auditing monitoring and evaluation so before you have done any good at all before you've helped a single person bought a single blanket you've lost 45 cents on every dollar that's deployed using traditional legacy systems we need to be able to do a lot better than that and so using web3 architecture to move capital into complex humanitarian emergencies is the way of the future this is how it's going to go and i think governments are going to recognize that second piece is we can get resources to individuals in need in a way that we have never been able to previously one of the reasons that ukrainians are proving so adept in using web3 tools now is that when they ousted their their past leader who was beholden to moscow and and somebody who was engaged in extensive corruption you'll remember that many of the ukrainians on the maidan would hold up bitcoin addresses on signs so that people watching from the outside could target resources to them directly because they needed band-aids they needed medical supplies they needed food and you could send that help precisely where it was needed to the individual so that's another huge advantage the third thing i would highlight is the importance of decentralized systems in safeguarding information when a military rolls in they're going to do two things one is destroy physical records and the other and we know that there were attempts to u do this using the a bug called wiper is to erase digital records the advent of web3 platforms like rweve will provide new frameworks for safeguarding information in the face of military attacks and and that's very consequential and important if you want to be able to rebuild quickly and effectively you need to know that your land registries are protected you need to know that your vital records have been been preserved and web3 tools can help do that and the last piece that i would mention and i alluded to this earlier is that we need to be using web3 systems to preserve evidence of war crimes and atrocities unfortunately there are war crimes being committed in ukraine and it has been very challenging in past conflicts to ensure that you have a clear chain of evidence regarding the validation of those crimes and and we can now use web3 tools to have a much higher degree of confidence in the information that's coming out of war zones and ensure that it's protected against future deletion by bad actors i i just almost had chills in some ways listening to you because i do feel these are just such kind of new capabilities and they'll really change the nature of these kinds of altercations and so hopefully i would imagine that could have a positive effect and i would hope that they would one quick point on this if i can laura right now everyone is justifiably and correctly focused on bringing an end to the conflict and ensuring the removal of russian troops from ukraine we also need to start thinking about the rebuilding process to come and i remember having a conversation with the individual who was prime minister of haiti when the earthquake hit in that country many years ago and he told me that the first building to collapse was the building that stored all of the vital records for the country what that meant is that when it came time to rebuild they couldn't do it because they did not know who owned the land that they were going to be building on and it has been devastating now for a generation of haitians to be able to get their lives back on track simply because there weren't good record-keeping mechanisms in place web3 systems should solve for that in ukraine so in addition to seeing a web 3 enabled response to the conflict my hope is that we're going to see a web 3 enabled recovery in the aftermath and that should enable people to get back to their lives much more rapidly than would have been possible otherwise that's such a great story i actually was there when you heard that story because this was on necker island with lauren lamont you were there i remember yeah exactly yes i was i could picture his face and i just couldn't remember his name but thank you yes um and yeah that was such a powerful story i do agree that yeah i mean hopefully we we will see blockchain technology being used in this way and people will earn will understand the power of it this has been such a fascinating conversation i so appreciate that you came out and chained to explain all this you know would love to hear more uh when there is more news but for now thank you so much for coming on unchained thank you and thanks to all those who are helping to respond to this crisis using the tools and community

sec wants to know according to bloomberg the u.s securities and exchange commission is probing nft creators and marketplaces to determine whether certain tokens qualify as securities and should be regulated as such a particular importance to the sec are fractional nft platforms where an nft can be subdivided into many units that are sold independently of the original nft be it art collectible ticket or meme citing sources familiar with the matter bloomberg noted that the sec had sent subpoenas to both creators and exchanges requesting information interestingly crypto friendly sec commissioner hester purse aka crypto mom had set to coindesk in december given the breadth of the nft landscape certain pieces of it might fall within our jurisdiction people need to be thinking about potential places where nfts might run into the securities regulatory regime the sec's look at nfts did not shock many cryptic lawyers for example anderson kill law partner haley lennon tweeted that it was not much of a surprise and stephen palley described the regulator's exploration as predictable as herring in brine the news comes just a few weeks after the sec fined blockfy 100 million dollars for offering a security product via its interest earning accounts consensus has a messy lawsuit on his hands a group of 35 employees at the joe lubin-led ethereum development company consensus filed a request for a swiss court to review a previous deal between consensus and jpmorgan the 35 employees who make up more than half of consensus ag shareholders claim that a 2020 transfer of assets from consensus ag to consensus software incorporated was illegal the deal saw jp morgan take a significant stake in both metamask and infuria two major assets originally owned by the ag without the ag's minority stakeholders being properly notified in addition the deal offset a 39 million loan from founder joe lubin according to the claims published by arthur hayes who is heading the suit against consensus ag the transaction was to the detriment of the minority shareholders of cag and to the benefit of joe lubin personally the legal request comes shortly after a consensus fundraising round of 200 million dollars at a 3 billion valuation the company refutes the claims found in hayes letter telling the block mesh aka consensus ag refutes the allegations underlying the legal action as well as this contained in the factually inaccurate press release that was self-authored by one of the former employees mesh looks forward to formally refuting the allegations and accusations in swiss courts core crypto products block international users in related news metamask and infuria both consensus products updated their support pages to reveal that services are unavailable in certain jurisdictions due to legal compliance in changing some configurations as a result of the new sanctions directives from the united states and other jurisdictions we mistakenly configured the settings more broadly than they needed to be explained in fira metamask said that it and infuria would be unavailable in certain jurisdictions due to legal compliance going forward but did not specify what areas iranian users of the nft marketplace openc are also claiming that they have lost access to their accounts with multiple verified collections allegedly being removed from the platform the irs won't take no for an answer the u.s internal revenue service filed to dismiss a lawsuit by joshua and jessica jarrett a married couple who claims they should not have paid income tax on staking rewards while the irs offered the jarretts a refund in december the couple refused in an effort to force a federal court to decide how staking income is taxed in the u.s however this week the irs filed a motion to dismiss the case arguing that the jarretts could not refuse its offer of a refund in related news during a march 2nd panel carolyn shank an irs official said the regulator would be utilizing john doe summons to seek information from crypto exchanges on unnamed taxpayers and in the uk the financial conduct authority revealed that it has opened 300 cases relating to crypto companies and has 50 live investigations including criminal probes into unauthorized businesses the fca is the uk's supervisory authority regarding anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing bitcoin's best day in 365 days plus bitcoin had its best trading day in over a year on monday gaining 14 in a 24-hour period data from crypto rank shows that it was a good week for the crypto market in general with bitcoin and ethereum gaining 20 in the seven days spanning thursday to thursday while only three coins filecoin secret and leo in the top 100 by market capitalization fell as has been the case in 2022 cosmos and tara tokens led the charge with roon luna anc and juno making up four of the five biggest gainers of the week among tokens in the top 100 by market cap with each experiencing price increases between 65 percent and 79 percent the cosmos and terra pumps appear to be led by development and usage on terra's side its native token luna has been locked up at an extraordinary rate and overtook ethereum 2.0 based eth this week as the second largest staked token in crypto according to staking rewards data from smart smartstake shows that terra has burned 2.48 billion dollars worth of luna since february 4th a month ago and as covered on last week's podcast luna foundation guard a non-profit supporting the stablecoin ust ontario but one billion dollars worth of btc with luna locked into a four-year vesting schedule to backstop ust interestingly it appears that lfg plans to purchase more with tara ceo doe quan tweeting the tara protocol will be one of the largest holders of btc on cosmos's side the much anticipated fmos launch and airdrop took place this week marking the arrival of the first evm compatible hub on cosmos citadel security ceo does an about face on crypto kenneth griffin founder of citadel securities and infamous winner of the us constitution bidding war told bloomberg this week that his once negative sentiment regarding crypto has since shifted he calls crypto one of the great stories and finance over the course of the last 15 years he added and i'll be clear i've been in the naysayer camp over that period of time but the crypto market today has a market capitalization of about two trillion dollars in round numbers which tells you that i haven't been right on this call according to griffin citadel securities which handles 25 of equities volume traded on the u.s stock market each day and executes 35 percent of us listed retail volume will most likely get into the crypto market making games soon despite saying in october that the company would not due to regulatory uncertainty to the extent that we're trying to help institutions and investors solve their portfolio allocation problems we have to give serious consideration to being a market maker in crypto griffin explained it's fair to assume that over the months to come you will see us engage in making markets and cryptocurrencies the news comes almost two months after citadel securities made headlines by taking 1.15 billion dollars in capital from two venture firms sequoia and paradigm a cryptocentric company that has backed compound cosmos sky mavis and uniswap this week in crypto adoption in a week filled with headlines about ukraine russia swift the eu and more it was easy to miss a slew of major companies adopting crypto in one way or another here are three examples kpmg purchased two nfts this week the canadian arm of the major accounting firm bought women 2681 for 25 eth or 75 000 from the world of women nft collection it also minted kpmgca.eth an ens domain charles schwab filed with the sec to create a crypto economy etf that would give investors exposure to companies developing and utilizing cryptocurrencies bracketin group launched an nft marketplace last friday that will allow users to purchase sports and entertainment digital collectibles along with ip minting capability for fun bits kevin the meme green pixelated money printing machine pixelmon a blockchain gaming project released a collection of 9999 nfts last week generating 70 million dollars in sales during a mint that saw collectors pay up to three eth per nft the mint sold out quickly however collectors were immediately disappointed with the quality of the art which was later described by pixelmon's ceo as unacceptable the nfts grant holders exclusive access to pixelmon-based land and token airdrops boost in-game earning potential and grant access to the alpha release among other things however the price floor for them has already dropped to 0.299 eth on wednesday night meaning that some mentors nfts are worth one-tenth what they paid just a week ago however as this is crypto one particular pixelmon nft a species called kevin caught fire on social media and saw the floor price skyrocket due to its ugliness at one point kevin nfts were selling for over 20 000 kevin nfts spawned an entire meme culture on twitter with the green bowser-like 3d character taking over crypto twitter and even receiving its own song from song a day man aka jonathan mann kevin became so popular that a derivative project called kevin punks was minted and instantly became a hit with 549 ethan volume after just a few days of trading and a price floor of 0.88 eth unchained tracked down a kevin investor via openc and asked them essentially why they would spend 8.6 eth on a meme john bisou co-founder of seasons.io seemed to think it was a good fit for his nft platform and told unchained that he might donate his kevin into the trash pile on trash dow where users can swap nfts from qualified contracts in exchange for trash tokens which govern the deposited nfts however if kevin continues to grow in value bisu might fractionalize the nft on seasons so that everyone can have a piece of memetic history because as bisu explained to unchanged there is a kevin in all of us alright well thanks for tuning in to learn more about tamika the crisis in ukraine and
