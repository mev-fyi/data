this is a thing that I think optimism very uniquely has at this moment is you have a bunch of people who are making this commitment and saying hey we want to be a part of something bigger than ourselves and that that's the commitment base is saying right we didn't go and say we're going to do this by ourselves instead we said we believe that at the end of the day this is going to be bigger than us and we want to help build that thing that's bigger than us and I think that that's what optimism is saying I think that that's what Zora is saying I think that that's what a bunch of these folks are saying and my intuition is like we've seen crypto be positive some for the last decade in really new ways and I think that there's an opportunity for us to build something positive some here that's way bigger than base or op mainnet or any single component of an L2 and is actually a super chain that brings a billion people on chain and so is that a little crazy is it optimistic yeah but like here we are we're gonna do it hey
