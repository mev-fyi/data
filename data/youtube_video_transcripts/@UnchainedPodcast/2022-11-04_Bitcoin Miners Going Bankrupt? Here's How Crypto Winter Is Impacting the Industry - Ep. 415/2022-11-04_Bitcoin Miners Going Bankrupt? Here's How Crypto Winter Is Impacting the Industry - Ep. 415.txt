download and get 25 with the code Laura Link in the description today's guest is Nick Hansen co-founder and CEO of Luxor Technologies a mining software Services Company welcome Nick hi thanks for having me on this week there's been a slew of mostly negative news about Bitcoin Miners and it even goes back to September when crypto mining data center operator compute North filed for bankruptcy mining firm Argo blockchain attempted to raise 27 million dollars but that fell through and that sent its stock price plunging and core scientific the largest Minor by hash rate has said that it may have to file for bankruptcy still at the same time it actually looks like a few companies are weathering the storm but why don't you just give us the general overview how would you describe the State of Affairs for Bitcoin mining right now yeah think thanks of thanks for the question so right now we're seeing in my view the lowest margin environment that we've ever seen for Bitcoin miners to date and there's a couple of reasons for that one uh the the metric of of their output is called hash price and hash price is now at the lowest we've seen since 2020 which was just after the most recent having and what that means is miners revenues are as low as they've ever been as of right now uh the the other end of that equation is their inputs which is generally just electricity cost but we're seeing High electricity costs across the board so if your inputs are the most expensive they've ever been and your outputs are the lowest they've ever been that means the amount that you can make in the middle the margin is the lowest it's ever been and so that's what's really pressuring miners right now is just the reduced margin that they have to operate under currently that is compounded by the fact that we saw a trend start around 18 to 24 months ago where miners were taking out loans to finance future hash rate effectively leveraging up and the amortization schedule of that debt over the uh generally a pretty aggressive term around 24 months or less is causing them to be cash flow negative so some of them generate net profit but they don't generate enough free cash flow to pay for their debts and that's the situation that we're in right now we've seen that with many of the miners that have gone under so that's the that's the super high level of of where we're at in Bitcoin mining and why all of these companies are feeling uh the pressure uh more pressure than they probably ever ever felt yeah one thing I also want to ask about was that I read at this moment that in the us alone more than a quarter million of brand new mining rigs are still sitting unused and the exact number of unused rigs isn't totally clear but in a coin desk article about this they wrote Whatever the exact number is this much is clear the economics at the core of crypto are completely out of whack so how did this end up happening so the number of machines sitting latent is due to a Confluence of events we've seen again increasing prices so there isn't that immediacy by miners to get machines turned on so right now they're seeing okay well if I can't get a good deal for my hosting rate or I can't get a good deal for my power costs I'd rather just let these miners sit and maybe wait for a better time to plug them in and then there's also the other end there's there's actually not a lot of Hosting space available so even if Miners did happen to say okay I'm willing to take the risk and operate in this super low margin environment they they may not even be able to find somewhere to plug in you know the big bull run up to 65k of actually around this time last year the the hosting space hasn't caught up with that quite yet and so you know we've seen you know compute no you know compute North was going to be potentially the largest host in North America and uh they you know they succumb to the to the bear market and I think we're starting to you know we're starting to see that that hosting space is continuing to be constrained so that means miners just aren't getting plugged in and that may continue especially as we see this low this lower margin environment where there just isn't the the urgency to plug in machines so can you walk us through the calculus that minors have to make when it comes to determining whether their efforts will be profitable you mentioned a few of these things like energy and the hosting and and all that so you know just yeah walk people through yeah you know so yeah that machine behind me is called an S9 it's very old I use it for testing that produces around 10 Tera hash per second uh the the hash price today is about seven cents which means uh seven cents per terahash per second which means that that thing will produce around 70 cents per day uh if we take and if we look back at this time last year hash price was around 40 cents so that thing would be producing significantly more than it is now so the prop so what we're seeing now so it'll be about four dollars a day so that is the revenue that miners make and so since we're in this very low low hash price environment I'm not as incentivized to plug in machines if I'm only going to make seven cents per Terra hash per second right now in 2020 that we did see hash price this low or close to this low uh in 2020 but the main difference was the energy price was significantly lower across the board and so that was my you know at that time it was still worth it to get machines plugged in that's why we didn't see as many machines sitting unused now the calculus that you would use to determine whether I should plug in a machine or not is you take you know take your input costs subtract them from your revenues your potential revenues and determine what your margin would be and decide if that makes sense for your business model traditional wisdom would indicate the miners are looking for somewhere between a two year and 30 month payback period but right now we're seeing payback periods much much longer than that which means that miners if they make an investment today aren't going to be in the green uh or in the black it for probably close to five years which given traditional wisdom would indicate that you should not deploy right now so that's where we're at right now unless unless you have some crazy low power rate or you've got a you know an Innovative way of reducing your in your input costs that's going to be the calculus until hash price turns around so traditionally minors have been able to relocate to seek out a cheaper electricity fees I haven't seen much talk about that why is that not something people are pursuing so we're at a much different scale this cycle as well this cycle we're seeing individual miners with individual mining companies with hundreds of thousands of machines moving that as an operational overhead is massively operationally intensive going and physically unplugging a hundred thousand machines putting them in boxes paying for the shipping to put them somewhere else it's very intensive so a lot of a lot of folks would or a lot of companies would prefer to just sit on that inventory at their hosted site there's also not anywhere for them to go right now either generally they would go to other places around the world but Energy prices across the globe are high except for in some countries which are now sanctioned and you can't really do business with them anymore so that's the reason miners right now are most likely not they're not going to be able to they're not moving currently and they're probably not going to be able to move just because there isn't anywhere to go well okay and you know one of the bigger pieces of news that I referenced at the beginning was the possibility that core scientific would file for bankruptcy obviously that is the largest minor at the moment so what impact do you think that could have on the wider sector so there's a multitude of events that could occur from coresight going under one they are also the biggest host and so there's many companies that are with core scientific that are potentially not going to be able to continue to operate so we could see disruption we could see second order disruptions from this event of course I also has a lot of machines themselves a lot of them are under secured by or they are under mining debt so they're they're under debt um and so those those loans require the lender to take those as collateral and most likely if I had to guess those those lenders are going to liquidate those machines rather than hold them or remind them themselves and I would I would bet if they if they do start to liquidate those machines we could see a cascading event where the value of mining machines dropped significantly over the next three to six months as those liquidations occur oh wow okay yeah so we'll see what happens with that it'll probably all play out over the next couple months before the year's end so in a moment we're going to talk more about potential solutions to what else Bitcoin miners but first a quick word from the sponsors who make the show possible defy saver is an all-in-one management app for the top lending protocols on ethereum including Ave maker liquidy and compound they have dedicated protocol dashboards with options for quick leverage adjustment and self-liquidation as well as automated liquidation

visit avox.network or follow on Twitter at Avalanche avox explore the platform millions are using for its speed stability and scalability Avalanche create Without Limits back to my conversation with Nick one interesting development I saw was the creation of a lending pool created by Maple Finance to help struggling minors this is one of the D5 protocols and they're already helping 10 Miners and they're another 25 on the list I was curious what you thought of this effort so that has been a trend we've seen over the last couple of months is these so-called distressed mining funds come into Market to potentially Aid liquid Aid and provide liquidity to to minors now they're certainly not doing this out of the goodness of their hearts so there is going to be a you know there's going to be a premium for that capital and right now since there is such a demand for four dollars for for New Capital uh I haven't seen what the deal terms look like for these yet but I have to imagine that they're very much in favor of the lender and I did yeah I did see the interest rate was around 18 to 20 percent and these loans are being offered on what's called a full recourse basis could you explain that I think I sort of understand but so well of course the so the 18 is uh is actually a little bit higher than we would have expected to see in the around this time last year so most of the loans that were issued to Big miners were on the order of 12 to 14 maybe 15 it looks like they're adding on some more of risk premium we did see a few of those uh types of loans go out last year but those were for smaller more nature miners that were trying to lever up more you know in a riskier way and then of course full full recourse meaning that they'll be able to take you know not just the The Entity but I believe that they can take the entire business so they are sorry they won't be able to not just the machines but they'll be able to take the entire business in that case is especially concerning if you are a minor you're not going to you're putting up the you're putting up your entire business uh not just the collateral for the loans it's kind of like saying when I go when I go buy a car if I use a full record first loan for my car not only can they repo my car if I don't make my payments they can repo my house or my boat or anything else that you any other assets your 401k any other assets you might have to make themselves whole so certainly that's the most lender friendly term that we've ever seen in in mining loans but there are certainly other and there are more of these distressed funds coming coming uh coming to Bear we've seen Finance launched a 500 million dollars uh they had a 500 500 million dollar pool of capital a bit Deer uh put up 250 million dollars in capital and and there's probably close to a billion dollars worth of uh or more even of of capital available to minors but they are going to come at these exceptionally lender-friendly terms and rates is your sense that these are helpful or not helpful it is yet to be seen I I'm certain anybody that's in a situation that needs Capital would find them to be helpful one of the reasons that most of these minors are in the situation that they're in is because they they've already taken debt that had more favorable terms and so I imagine packing on more debt with less favorable terms I can't see how that turns out well but there may be situations where it makes sense well let's talk about some of the brighter spots in the market um Marathon for instance which is also publicly listed mined 615 Bitcoin in October which is the highest monthly total it had ever seen I think it was like roughly what it had mined in all of Q3 stronghold digital was able to eliminate more than 67 million dollars in debt and also restructure some debt Bitcoin minor clean spark bought almost 4 000 new machines Canadian minor Digi host announced that it was debt free and cash flow positive what do you think um separates these firms from their competition so Marathon they all have their own they all have their own very specific reasons for being exceptionally well positioned but it all mostly boils down to being very liquid and having plenty of capital at the right time in the market so they effectively timed the market correctly you know Marathon has you know raised the most money of all of the publicly traded Miners and they were able to keep a nice stash of that Capital available on the sidelines and are able to deploy uh continually same with clean spark they are buying sites and buying machines in a distressed environment which means they're getting the best pricing that anybody's ever gotten so the you know the marathon machines uh those are machines that they purchased around this time last year and are starting to get turned on and uh that's you know really exciting and great to see that they're able to operate that way uh they didn't mention the they do have exposure to compute North and they didn't mention that in the filing so it's uncertain if the you know where what their roadmap will be we'll have to see what their earning they'll probably expand more during the earnings release you know and and so the miners that have done really well really the Common Thread is that they have they have cash on the balance sheet ready to deploy they have uh low debt low incumbrance and you have positive free cash flow which means that they can continue to weather the storm without having too much dilution there's always been talk about how Bitcoin mining could be combined with producing renewable energy and I did see that there was one new startup Aspen Creek digital which raised eight million dollars in a series a that is focused on that do you see this bear Market as a good time for Bitcoin miners to kind of try alternative methods for you know I mean really any aspect of their business you know I hold personally that the Bitcoin mining is going to revolutionize many parts of our lives and specifically Bitcoin mining will revolutionize the energy the the green energy transition certainly uh Luxor is an investor in Aspen Creek we work very closely with them and and really like the team there and I I view that type of investment really accelerating right now as cash is King most of the Investments are most Investments are probably going to come you know be a little bit slower but I do think that as Bitcoin miners continue to monetize uh latent or stranded energy and continue to provide that demand response service to the grid we'll continue to see new investment made you know into Bitcoin miners specifically through the lens of energy Innovation and I think that that's going to be the trend of the next five years I actually have been writing some piece you know some pieces specifically on this because I think that's one of the most exciting parts of the Bitcoin mining industry talk a little bit more about that like you know when you say that you think this will will be the trend of the next five years like where do you see that going so I think right now we'll see Bitcoin miners get co-located very closely to sustainable generation sources so let's be a little bit more tangible so Bitcoin miners will be co-located next to most like like wind farms and solar Farms a wind farm it's very hard to predict you know you could maybe predict what tomorrow's generation is going to look like but it's very impossible to predict what December 12th generation is going to look like for a wind farm and there are costs associated with curtailing meaning reducing the amount of energy produced by a wind farm uh because you have to like turn on brakes and all that stuff it's much easier to just spin up some sort of some sort of load resource like a Bitcoin mine underneath so on energy grids there's this thing called the demand curve Delta which is the amount of demand at the peak and the amount of demand at the trough of the day you know around the US that Delta is somewhere around 200 gigawatts on any given day if you could produce some way to raise the trough and lower the top and basically reduce that Delta it would reduce the amount of of loss and improve the efficiency of the grid across the board um so I think that Bitcoin mining comes in and makes a really compelling argument as to why it should be used for providing this consistent base load as we continue to progress towards a renewable energy future Our Generation assets become more and more inter intermittent and so there needs to be extra capacity you know to provide all of the the energy for all the demand that there is at different times so we also need to uh also also invest in in nuclear energy and we've seen in miners getting co-located with uh with nuclear energy assets as well so lots of reasons why Bitcoin mining will continue to incentivize and lead the green energy Revolution and I think we're just getting started and that's been Creek is a great example of that so last quick question you know obviously at this moment I I don't really know what is going to catalyze the Bitcoin price to go higher so we could you know continue to see a trade in this sort of low 20 000 range for quite a bit and I was just wondering you know assuming that this sort of shake-up in Bitcoin mining continues what do you see is happening on the other side aside from what you mentioned in terms of this Green Revolution shake-up like do you see the industry changing in other ways as well there's a couple things one we've never had a real return on cash throughout the existence of of bitcoin's Life Meaning there's never been a real a real interest rate you know there's actually an interest rate now that can be can be generated on cash and now this is the first time any crypto Bitcoin any of them have had to compete with that environment so investors are going to remain less risky as there is this real return on cash and we'll see how that affects the overall ecosystem now the ecosystem never existed when there was you know real real Returns on on cash now as for as for Bitcoin mining specifically again the you know miners are capital intensive they require a lot of capital to get up and running and so that capital is going to come at a higher cost and so we may see slower expansion you know the investment into Bitcoin mining may become a bit muted over the next three to five years as this you know this washout occurs you know I would imagine that over the next three to five years it will be a slow a slow growth but there will certainly be another another run uh just like there is in every Commodities Market it's just a matter of being you know being well positioned so miners that are able to build now like marathon and clean spark are probably going to be the best position for taking advantage of that next run all right well this has been a super informative interview thank you so

for tuning in to this week's news recap Elon musk's purchase of Twitter has repercussions for crypto Elon musk's acquisition of Twitter has firmly grabbed the attention of the crypto Community the billionaire founder of Tesla announced plans to charge 20 a month for the Twitter blue check mark which Twitter has long used to verify public figures on the social media platform but that move attracted a lot of criticism most prominently from horror writer Stephen King musk later lowered the price to eight dollars a month and added a few additional benefits the crypto Community still wasn't happy vitalik buterin tweeted musk's idea could damage the blue check Mark's anti-scam role indeed for a while scammers would take over verified accounts and use them to nefarious purposes however musk's purchase of Twitter will have a more tangible impact on specific players in crypto the block reported that FTX founder Sam binkman Freed's stake and Twitter would give him the right to receive 50 million dollars to 100 million dollars based on musk's purchase price speaking of crypto exchange CEOs finances changpang Xiao who is a minority investor on Twitter said he would join

Singaporean Law Firm wants Quan to reimburse them for their losses plus pay aggravated damages whether Kwan was responsible for Tara's collapse is still hotly debated some argue that the Korean co-founder committed fraud but others say that he's not guilty because the code was open source and everything was public vitalik shares his opinion on crypto regulation in recent weeks Sam bankman freed sparked a heated debate after he suggested that regulations apply to D5 front ends or websites metallic buterin the creator of ethereum tweeted especially at this time regulation that leaves the crypto space free to act internally but makes it harder for crypto projects to reach the mainstream is much less bad than regulation that intrudes on how crypto Works internally while the debate rages on within the industry Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler defended the agency's actions against crypto companies during a speech in New York City speaking about the cases against coinbase and blockfi's savings accounts Gensler said that companies that failed to properly register a security or register as investment companies violate the Securities laws regardless of the form
