description today's topic is legal developments around Dows here to discuss are Gabriel Shapiro general counsel at Delphi labs and Fatima funnies a day crypto lawyer and researcher welcome Gabriel and Fatima thank you good to be here so before we dive into the meat of this topic which is going to be super interesting let's actually just Define some of these terms because Dao is one of those words that's been discussed a lot in crypto for many many years but it went kind of like from theoretical concept to reality and yet there's many permutations of different Dows so now that we've seen like all the different kinds of organizations that people are calling Taos how would you each Define Dao so I would Define Dao as a decentralized autonomous organization which may sound trite uh because that is the acronym but I think a large amount of the organizations currently called Dows either are not decentralized or are not autonomous so what is decentralized decentralized means that if there is discretionary authority of some kind decisions to be made that the the power to make those decisions is very widely dispersed uh among in my opinion which would be a potentially Anonymous Global set of people right uh they may vote through tokens or they may vote uh you know I consider Bitcoin to be a Dao in the end the the members of the Bitcoin Dow vote with their hash power but more often it you know it's voting tokens and then it has to be autonomous and autonomous means that it is resistant to extrinsic exercises of authority right so we we decentralize the intrinsic power we get rid of the extrinsic power so that means it shouldn't depend on any particular company it shouldn't depend on any specific group of people it shouldn't depend on for example again in my opinion a a state Charter a state license right uh and then it's it's an organization right meaning that it's some type of group of people who have gotten together to do something whether it's to set the rules uh for a non-chain protocol set the rules for an entire blockchain system you know whatever it might be uh but usually it's technological and blockchain oriented and at one question before we turn to farame because just when you were talking about a saying it's um like impervious to external changes or forces or something like that I forget the wording that you used but basically um that that doesn't necessarily mean because like so to most people the word autonomous would mean like you don't need to do anything and it just runs but people need to vote like it's a very active sort of thing but you're just saying only the token holders of that Dao can act in it and that's what makes it that's right yeah you try obviously with a lot of these things we want to minimize the need to make decisions as much as possible right and that that is what is autonomous it's like a robot but with most of the if it was just that if it was purely that then it would just be an autonomous organization right it would basically be a robot the reason why it also needs to be decentralized is because there is still some flexibility and decision making and mutability that's involved and so whenever you have that that residual discretion you want to decentralize that as much as possible okay and follow me what about you how do you define cow um I like Gabe's definition I think that uh it is maybe an ideal definition the way the way it gave you you just mentioned presented it um I feel like I I would adopt an approach that is a bit more uh General and and Broad to Encompass more of the realities that we have now on unchanged so I would say that uh Dows are just groups of people um who are coordinating organizing and governing anything so either could be the treasury um a protocol or anything else that may be governed uh on chain and I would simply Define this as a as a Dao so it's it's kind of The Other Extreme because I don't necessarily include any like minimum level of decentralization although it should be technically decentralized so government token based governance for instance or potentially be decentralized but nowadays we don't have the tools to to assess properly whether or not that is actually effectively decentralized or not so I wouldn't even Venture into these considerations so is there like some thresholds at which you guys would say like something is centralized or decentralized I think that what is centralized um is could be pretty obvious so if there is like a corporation that makes 100 of the decision or you can uh overrule has veto rights over what the Dow governance decide then I would deem that to be centralized if there is one person or a very small centralized group of person making decisions and not being accountable to any form of token holders for instance I would deem that to be centralized but other than this um I think it's it's an open question yeah I would say that if a single person or a group of extrinsically Affiliated persons has more than a majority of the means of determining consensus or a major majority or more like the requisite minimum itself to determine consensus on a cosmos chain that might be any group or person that holds more than a third of stake within that active validator set in some you know it might be like 51 percent that's why it's called a 51 attack in Bitcoin but whatever that number is for the requisite system if it's controlled by a single person or group of extrinsically Affiliated persons then I would say it is centralized so at this point I was saying earlier we have a number of different Dows that have come into existence and they're all all taking different shapes and forms and we're going to dive into some of the really specific cases but um I just wanted to hear like from an overview perspective what are the main issues that you feel need to be resolved about Dows right now when it comes to legal issues well there are many and I'll try not to muddle it with with other issues you know that Dows might get pulled into one is just what type of legal thing is a Dao right some people particularly regulators and class action litigators are arguing that doubt was simply a partnership like any other right partnership is defined as uh an agreement to co-own Assets in the context of sharing profits and losses related to them right that's one potential but there are you know countervailing considerations for some doubts uh like you know for example some of them are highly rivalrous in fact if you consider Bitcoin to be a dow and that was actually the first uh system that was called a Dao in the literature it was called a DAC a decentralized autonomous Corporation but same thing basically if you consider that a dow well the the miners comprise that Dao and the miners are highly rivalrous with one another uh just because one typically in a partnership a rising tide lifts all boats so to speak but in in Bitcoin uh a particular Miner doing really really well can quite adversely affect the other miners so is it really a partnership I don't know right it's debatable but there's no clear legal classification and it might differ depending on what Dow you're looking at um another issue is around who comprises it doubt right uh because in a traditional partnership for example a pure common law partnership every time a new partner is added or a partner leaves the partnership is dissolved and it's now a new partnership right so you would not be able to sue the the old people who left for something that happens afterwards but for example in the cftc's suit against ukidao they seem to be defining that Dao as anyone who at any point ever voted in the Dow on anything right um so these are that kind of gives you a flavor I think but there are many many unanswered questions I think it all goes down to a question of liability basically and this is a very practical view um if I want to be part of ADA or I want to build a Dao um the question that I will be faced with and and also if I want to participate in the governance of one is whether or not I'm gonna be held liable at any point because of the Dallas activities for instance because of the Dallas lack of certain activities so for instance that could be like if the doubt is a defy dial Will can I be like made liable for the fact that it is conducting it's an activity without being registered in a jurisdiction for instance will I be liable if um one day there is a problem with the software and uh I somehow participated in the governance of that software will I be liable if uh jurisdiction all of a sudden decides that this down needed to pay tax in that jurisdiction and obviously did not do that so there are so many different array of possible liabilities that are right now unclear the way that most dials operate currently is that they either try to mitigate these liabilities through various means that are untested and oftentimes uh just maybe converts the participant a little bit but without giving any form of guarantees um or or basically we have to find ways to either have risk tolerance towards these issues but um there is no certainty whatsoever what are the possible liabilities faced by a participant and I think this is something that needs uh to be clarified also just for peace of mind yeah well you were talking I was imagining like you know what if a dow token holder would be liable if they voted to approve an upgrade and then that upgrade resulted in a hack where everybody lost their money then what so um yeah anyway so um again we're going to dive into some details of things however before we do that I do want to talk about A New Concept that Delphi Labs is unveiling and gave you guys agree with a language here you call them cybernetic organizations and then you shorten that to cyborg which is I guess I don't know somehow very in line with most crypto nomenclature so what are what are you um you know what are these exactly what are boards yeah so the idea here is that look there are kind of two steps you can take to the issues that we've been discussing so far and that we'll further discuss which is there's a lot of risks around house a lot of uncertainties around Dows one is to essentially they're kind of two ways to risk off so to speak one is essentially look at the end of the day these are just businesses like any other let's just create entities if we need to create a new type of entity under law like a Wyoming Dow LLC let's do that and let's just make these Dallas companies and then everyone who participates in them will be like a member or a shareholder or something in that company they'll get the typical limited liability package they can do anything they want just like people do with any other business and they can have at least somewhat more reasonable assurances about what their risks are associated with that and so on to to me however that takes away the the essence of dows right because it's it's no longer autonomous it's now a state defined entity right and you have to follow the specific rules that that statue has laid out or else you lose the limited liability and you know there can also be theories of piercing the corporate veil limited liability is never iron clad even if you have an entity what I actually think is better is let's stick to the real concept of Dao's which is that they are basically robots with like a decentralized base of people who can give them very very limited type of flexibility right and let's take all the business functions all the management functions if you're looking at something like Olympus Dow which is essentially a very complicated on-chain hedge fund because it funded all these other protocols and took stakes in them and it sold tokens and then bonded them and it has this protocol owned liquidity or if you take um Dows that like directly try to pay higher workers like higher full-time salaried workers to to develop the protocol all these things that we think of as businesses that are highly off chain that involve legal agreements that involve a lot of discretion and potentially regulatory license take them and put them back into entities put those into entities right not the entire Dow but the way you can do that is you don't have to go all the way to the extreme of just saying okay their entities like the ethereum foundation for example is basically a black box to us like the etholders have no influence but really uh except maybe social pressure but no legal influence and certainly no blockchain based power over how the ethereum foundation spends its money uh exactly how it governs itself Etc let's take advantage of this brilliant like on-chain infrastructure that we've built and we can create new legal blockchain hybrids cybernetically enhanced legal entities borgs right like the borgon Star Trek where John Luke Picard gets like the monocle and he's been assimilated right so these entities can be sort of merged with with a Dao or with you know other types of on chain constituencies without being mere agents of them but being somewhat accountable to them so just for example one thing you could do is let's just say like a very popular right now is like token to token swaps among Dows right they want to get synergies they want to get value alignment like uh you know like like we work on a protocol called Mars protocol that's on a blockchain called osmosis wouldn't it be great if the osmosis Dow owned a bunch of Mars tokens and the Mars Dow owned a bunch of osmo tokens and you know we were all friends in Kumbaya but to me that that's very regulatory risky but what you could do is I could set up an entity that's adjacent to the Mars Dow right and that entity could own a bunch of osmo we need to make clear to Dow holders that they're not the owners of this osmo they're not going to get like profits from it or dividends from it and they're not going to decide kind of everything about it but one thing I think we could do for example is we could commit in the governing document of that entity we could publish it we could say we will always keep that osmo governed by a multi-sig and everyone who's on that multi-sake will be directors of this company furthermore we will always configure that multisig in a way where the Mars Dao can vote those osmo tokens on osmosis doubt proposals right that's not a really a regulated activity that's not a financial thing it's not Distributing profits and I think we can do that right so it's a direct on-chain control that the Mars now has over these tokens even though it doesn't like own these tokens right there's a or you could take uh for example emergency multi-figs is another application right now you know a lot of protocols have these multi-cigs that can halt the protocol in the event of an emergency or they can change parameters in an emergency whatever it is because you know there's security risk and we're not fully confident in the code but the problem is if you have the power to Halt the code in an emergency the chain doesn't know what's an emergency and what's not right so you also have the power to Halt the code at any point right that's really bad so in my opinion the the way to plug that hole is put that multi segment entity and have in the charter documents for that entity we will only use this power in an emergency and by the way if we abuse it if you hold five percent ten percent whatever it is of either the deposits in the protocol or the Dow governance tokens and you think that that we've violated the rules of this entity you can sue the entity and force it to come into compliance right so things like that I think can create a bridge between the off chain world and the on and these on-chain robots uh that still is web 3 still is accountable and still is innovative in its way it's not like it's just going purely back to tradfi um but that has a more it leaves the Dow concept pure and has these adjacent legal hybrids being something other than a dow interesting so it's almost like there's the part that's like truly down and then there's these Like Satellites that are more like Dao slash legal entity and then but sometimes they can be at odds with each other if like one perceives that the other didn't kind of follow through on its word exactly and so there needs to be accountability mechanisms right now there's a lot of trust in people who have these kinds of authorities over the protocol but the accountability is lacking and essentially it's just reputational damage is the only thing right to me as a lawyer that's not enough and I don't think that's really the crypto ethos we have an ethos if not your keys not your coins the off-chain equivalent of that is there needs to be a damn contract written down in words that's legally enforceable right so I'm trying to bring reduce the Trust on the off chain layer as well get fun of me what is your reaction to this proposal I'm curious It's very new uh Gabe just sent this to me I was like this looks interesting but what are your thoughts I find it pretty interesting to also compartmentalize the risk in in such Ways by having smaller entities so one of my biggest criticism of wrapping an entire line one entity is that it creates one single centralized point of failure so if the treasury of the whole entire da is governed by one entity then that entity has to respond to one jurisdiction and may may be forced to basically um for instance just seize the treasury or or have other actions over the treasury that is not aligned with the Dow governance so I feel that having these satellite entities instead of one is definitely positive I'm wondering uh how I mean this basically deals with one aspect of the issue which would be accountability of decentralized actors for instance multifig signers but what about the liability of the Dao participants like is there a way within this framework of borgs that this risk can be mitigated yeah I think I think there are ways it can be mitigated number one I think once you sort of do this exercise of putting all the businesses and stuff into entities I think you've already de-risked a lot right there right then you're kind of left with okay what is the Dow actually do right let's just take a protocol governance down well I think it probably assuming things are set up reasonably well probably it can adjust some parameters of the smart contract like variables and maybe it can actually fully upgrade like Laura mentioned before maybe it can fully upgrade the code to the new version right and so what is that service right well it's not really a software development Service uh it's kind of like a it's a protocol governance service right so I think it has similar risks maybe to like icon which is the internet Corporation for assigned names and numbers and you know look they do get sued sometimes but what they get sued for is like violating their own rules and procedures so I actually think that like what the Dow is doing in this world is very limited there's always going to be some risk of litigation even if you have an entity there's still risk of litigation and there's still risk that people will say oh you controlled it so we're going to sue you personally particularly regulatory stuff so I just think at the end of the day it is a trade-off right you are taking some risk but you're doing it to honor that autonomous concept and really the risks of just setting some parameters on a smart contract or deciding new code to adopt is relatively manageable uh in tort liability there's a Doctrine called the economic loss Doctrine right it says if someone was negligent and your only losses from that negligence were economic damages you cannot hold that person liable and toward in the absence of a fiduciary relationship right so if it's clear that there's no fiduciary relationship because the participants in the Dow kind of disclaim that and they don't promise anything right and the losses are economic which I think will be the case until a dow controls a drone or something in the real world um which I would recommend against you know I actually think the legal risks are are quite manageable to be honest I'm sorry can I just put put you on the spot Cape um is there any jurisdiction you recommend for for this board uh we're working on some right now that are using Cayman foundations uh so I think it it does this is one advantage of BoRics it depends what it's doing right because Caymans is uh quite good in that it has these memberless foundations and it's uh basically zero tax for you know unless you set them things up in an incompetent way so it's good for certain purposes but then on the other hand it actually has a relatively strict um virtual asset service provider licensing regime and it's also uh has fairly strict requirements on not being used as an a tax Haven for intellectual property monetization uh by companies that actually kind of have their you know their economic substance elsewhere so like if you were doing an IP Dow like probably like nouns Dow you'd probably want like a seychell or or maybe Panama because they're more hospitable to IP but on the other hand um for you know something that is just like a security multi-sig you know the Caymans might be appropriate so you can cherry pick right and pick different things for different purposes rather than this monolithic full Dow wrapper in one specific place so this is you know a proposal that you have you have you guys are working on um but I wanted to kind of contrast where you'd like douse to go with you know kind of some of the developments that have already happened and already I hear you know some of you have criticisms of these so why don't we just start with the Wyoming one that's you know one of the states that have been creating laws to help Dows get some kind of legal recognition what does that law say and how um good of a bill do you think this is so look there have been some doubs that have in fact I I formed one of the first ones it was metacartel Ventures Dao and we called it a Dao although nowadays I probably wouldn't call it a doubt but uh it's essentially an LLC that uses smart contracts and you know they they make Venture Investments right um and we just used an ordinary Delaware LLC for that you you can do that there is no problem with doing that because llc's are extremely flexible you can basically write nearly any rules you want for them but on the other hand I I think people just wanted it to be easier with less custom Drafting and so I think the the kind of Steel Man why it might be good is let's create a specific type of LLC that's meant just for Dows that's the idea behind the Wyoming dialogue right we have these Wyoming Dow llc's it has some custom rules like for example that um you need to put in the like in the publicly I believe if I recall correctly that you need to put in the publicly filed documents that form the Dow what is the Smart contract address of that specific Dow right um and there are some other rules around it you need to specify is it algorithmically managed or is it member managed these are not requirements of a Delaware LLC even if you use one for Dows so it just kind of sets more of a roadmap for exactly a good way I guess to form a dow that is an LLC but make no mistake it is saying that a dow simply is an LLC right and that's where I think people might get thrown because that means it's a function of state law that literally means that the secretary of state of Wyoming can declare that Dow dissolved and there's even a rule in the thing that says if the Dow is inactive for a year it's deemed dissolved so what does that mean exactly right I think people like there are things that could surprise people with this especially if they're very crypto native and to me it's just not really necessary because you can use an ordinary LLC if that's what you desire if you desire to fully wrap your down and entity uh and and you could just set whatever rules you want exactly custom uh to your specific thing not have to worry that you're violating one of the specific requirements of this Dow LLC law right and like when you just said that about how if it's inactive for four years it could be dissolved I was like what if there's a multi-stick and there's a lot of you know whatever token in it I was like uh-oh finally what's your take on the Wyoming LLC law I mean I totally agree with what Gabrielle said I feel like basically all of the jurisdictions are who are into technology and blockchain-based Technology are trying to understand what those are and understand it within their own language of the laws and regulations that they have however this language is not yet suited to understand and Bridge with these organizations the those are a type of organizations that we never knew before where anyone from anywhere physically can join a group and and and govern uh some assets or some some other other things and this is basically Unknown by by regular state laws so they're trying their best to basically either capture a market share be attractive and and be Pioneers in this field but unfortunately using old laws or old understanding is just bound to fail when applied to to them so Wyoming has been like there was a small adoption I think like last I read was around 400 I think to 500 that was registered over there but it's a lot more than I would have thought but I I I'm gonna double check after but I'm pretty sure that these are the numbers I read but but nonetheless um I've rarely heard that I was being Satisfied by this choice so oftentimes they would opt for it either because they just simply need an entity and want to experiment with this the Wyoming one um because of very practical reasons so they would need an entity to own some form of physical assets that they cannot do otherwise or because um they're just us-based and and for for various reasons they knew the entity and they would go for this but it's not just a default option for for those at all all right so in a moment we're going to talk about Utah's new Dow law but first a quick word from the sponsors to make this show possible join over 50 million

trust visit hallborn.com for more back to my conversation with Gabriel and fatimae So In The Same Spirit as the wyomingdale law Utah also recently passed a law that grants legal recognition and provides legal liability for Dows it calls them llds what did you think of this version it's an interesting uh acronym limited liability doubts basically Utah to my knowledge is the most Innovative jurisdiction as of Date With regards to recognizing those as legal persons so basically the the the the biggest pain point with that and what we discussed prior in this episode is that they are not understood by jurisdiction as being legal entities or legal persons so they are not um able to sue for instance they are not able to as one organization own assets and the participants in this that whatever whomever Within These participants are because this is also not very well defined are not necessarily protected by limited liability so in case uh something goes wrong there is a risk that there may be attachment can be sued for the entire um for instance damage that is uh happening so what Utah did is that they basically took the koala Dao model law which is basically a piece of research that was published by the think tank called koala I think in 2021 where it presented a framework a legal framework that jurisdictions can just take the model law and um basically pass it as a law within their legal system and then automatically those that fulfilled the conditions of this model law will be recognized as legal persons so the model law is structured in a way where through the principle of functional and Technical equivalence the conditions that generally need to be met for corporations to be recognized as legal persons are fulfilled by doubt so for instance a corporation needs to be registered in a public register I think anywhere in the world and this model looks at dollars and sees okay those are not going to be registered and we don't want those to have to go and register in a public registry of the state of Utah or New York or whatever that is a lot of overhead and bureaucracy but we look at the technology and we see that there is a technical equivalent for those they are registered on a public blockchain so by basically saying that doubts must be for instance registered in a public blockchain and have like this information disclosed on a public forum we being that this fulfills the same condition and policy requirements that usually nation states needs for corporations therefore it should be recognized by the jurisdiction so Utah took this model on but adapted it because obviously there are a lot of points within that model law that um are more difficult for jurisdictions or for politics to to just Embrace without any changes This Modern law is made four dollars and for for the blockchain space uh and by the blockchain space as well so a lot of people who worked on it are Builders and are members of daos and obviously there there's very little compromise therefore on for instance issues of um privacy um we have doubts where members are pseudonymous or Anonymous right now and this model law wants to preserve that and doesn't want to require every participant to disclose their identity however politically this is something that is difficult for jurisdictions to just accept so Utah took the mother law but what it did is that it changed some of the aspects so for instance required a registered agent to to be in Utah for the sit down so if a dog wants to benefit from this law it needs to appoint a person in the state of Utah that can be basically um in between person between the public State and the Dao and there's also some other adaptations and is that person the person basically who could be served legal papers exactly that's one of the main purpose of this person I believe that's hilarious because this goes back to the Uki thing which we'll discuss in a moment but um yeah so Gabe what's your take on uh well either the Utah or this model law uh I the I like the model law um is like a like a more interesting approach I think than just saying you know let's let's turn all Dows into like slightly modified types of ordinary business entities so yeah I like the philosophy behind it the tricky thing right is that there's this desire to say well look not everything that you just call a dow should get limited liability so let's let's try to carve out exactly what types of things we mean by Dao if you get this limited liability right and as you do that you start having words that describe the way a Dao should basically be right and then whenever you have that those words are subject to interpretation right and it just it just becomes a little bit of a tricky exercise right like is this really just creating limited liability or is it also functioning as like a backdoor type of Regulation as well and to me when you mix those two things it doesn't really work very well like trying to do regulatory things and give limited liability at the same time I kind of think those are two different functions but but maybe you could do it but to me I just I just always worry okay like are we really getting this limited liability or is there some weasel room within the way things are phrased that someone can retroactively use to try to challenge whether that limited liability applies and I think as soon as you tell people we have limited liability they get sloppy right uh they they they get they get confidence and they start maybe now like really being like confidently treating this as like just a business that you run um and I just don't know that these really are meant to be businesses I prefer for businesses to be run out of business entities and for Dows to be Dows but I think I'm glad people are trying out different approach issues you know and and I think we'll have to see what people do with these things what litigation happens over these things and it's going to play out over a long time and it'll be fascinating yeah and before we move on to some of these questions like around ukidao and stuff like that I just wanted to ask because we were discussing this before the show Fatima you mentioned that there are other jurisdictions that might also adopt variations on this model law so um can you elaborate on that yeah so there are various um there there's a few jurisdictions um offshore um Island ones I'm not sure we can talk about it and whether it's public yet that are disgusting but there was also the state of New Hampshire so in Back to the US who was considering at the same time as a state of Utah to basically enact a version of the mother law um however in that state I think these efforts have been halted for now postponed to next year they decided to wait and because ruta's now Act was pushed quite quite quickly and adopted I think first of March and it's going to enter into fours in 2024 so next year um but but New Hampshire decided to wait so that they can do a better integration of the modern law so I feel like there is definitely the need for a lot of these provisions of the mother law to be tailored to the regulatory space in at least the US which is rapidly also evolving and and all of the stakeholders have to be around the table for this law to be successful so for now New Hampshire is a thing on hold all right so we keep referring to this so let's discuss it now one of the more surprising events involving Dao's from last year was that one Court determined that Dallas could be sued this was uh the uhidao case um although the facts and circumstances of that case are sort of unusual or maybe they're not I don't know you guys tell me but um can one of you recap what it is that happened with that case and you know how the court determined that it could be sued sure well there's actually three legal actions related to ukido right so just want to be clear one is that the cftc had an investigation and I suppose a claim uh against both the original bzx development company the bzx Dao that ended up managing the bzx protocol that was created that by that company and then the successor to the bzx company and the bzx Dow which was renamed as ukidao right so the cftc kind of brought claims for violations of the Commodities exchange act against all of those people the Developers and the development company settled with the cftc we could talk about that settlement and the cftc then went on to actually file a lawsuit against ukidao then there is also at the same time a class action against all of those same players related to a hack of the protocol where users lost money and all three of these things are relevant and sort of treat the Dao as well as various down members as defendants the core of the cftc's claim is that Uki bzx protocol was a you know essentially a a credit protocol on ethereum and some other blockchains including BSC I believe Finance chain which enabled people to engage in leveraged trading on tokens right so you know you could borrow a token and you could you know use that to to leave her up essentially you know taking a a long position on the token right and so the the cftc says well look uh you're only supposed to be able to do that on one type of platform and that's a cftc registered contract market and so you know you you guys are violating the Commodities exchange act right and so you know the developers settled individually their company settled and then but the protocol is still running uh and there's something called ukidao that governs the protocol right and so the cfdc decided to sue them as well naturally the last thing you want to do if uh you're a dow getting sued by the cftc and the cftc might not otherwise know who's a member of the Taoist show up to court and say here I am I'm ready to defend the claim right so no one is stepping up to the plate to actually defend this lawsuit so a bunch of people including Lex Punk and uh a16z in Paradigm and some others uh defy education fund I believe was the sort of the fourth one there filed a mucus briefs trying to kind of fill the Gap there make some arguments okay no you guys can't do this lawsuit you can't serve you can't properly serve process on these doubt members you don't even know who they are and the Dow is not even an entity well we lost that unfortunately uh you know the court said now this is just an unincorporated association of some sort like any other it is an entity anyone who's part of this entity would surely be reading the governance Forum the cftc posted a notice of service to process there they know they're getting sued they can show up to court if they want they didn't show up to court and now the cftc is Seeking a default judgment against the entire Dow um hasn't named any individual members of the Dow but it's seeking one against the doubt itself whatever that ends up meaning um and then for the class action lawsuit also again the Dow has lost so far uh the lawyers for I guess some of the individual defendants tried to get the claim dismissed on the grounds that the Dow was not a partnership or on the grounds of the economic loss Doctrine would would bar the claims uh and at least at this very early stage which was just sort of determining whether a cognizable claim has been made that can move forward potentially to trial uh the the plaintiffs have won that won that particular motion there's still more they didn't win the whole case right but there's at least enough there that it can potentially go to trial well yeah so um one thing is just you sort of left that dangling and it's kind of funny to think about so they served in the Forum but then I'm assuming a lot of the members who are not publicly known just they're not going to reveal who they are and then so is there anything the cfgc can do or nothing we don't know there are things they can try to do right um they clearly I think they at this point they just want the precedent of getting some type of judgment against a dow right we don't know what further they're going to do there with that judgment like will they try to find individual members of the Dow and say you're now liable for damages for violating the thing or will they say hey we got a judgment against the Dow um let's go to the ISP for their website and say that their website is facilitating an illegal business shut it down uh let's go to whatever platform the governance forum is run on say look they're condor is illegal shut this governance Forum down I think it's probably more likely what they're going to do than try to chase all these individual people who they you know may or may not know who they are right but it's sort of yet to be seen and it's yet to be seen whether they even will get the default judgment but that's what they're seeking pardon me do you have any thoughts on that whole situation there's just so much to unpack there yes totally um I feel like this is one of the most famous cases right now and everyone is just waiting to see what happens in the Uki case um and whether or not um that would be considered to be a general partnership for instance um and if the participants in the Dao governance are going to be liable for being part of sit down and I feel it's really interesting to to wait and see also how if there is a judgment against the Dao how they're going to enforce it because this is an open open question right now and whether they're gonna go after the most well-known or wealthy known members of the Dao or um they will go after the front end and so on so I think this will inform also a lot to endows how to structure their activities in the future knowing that those usually are not bound to one jurisdiction and it's very fair game to try to identify the risk in in one jurisdiction so if um I think this this lawsuit is in state of California right and so if whether a Dao is linked to California and the U.S it's Federal it's U.S federal court in California U.S federal call in California so if it's linked to the U.S then it has to take some actions to to basically mitigate that risk that would pose a positive or um a judgment Against The Tao what I think um this this does basically is that it it creates some incentives for Dao participants to start becoming more and more privacy centered and and pseudonymous so that they cannot be held liable for something that either the Dow does or other participant in the governance vote in favor again stuff and this is can can be actually quite tricky so for instance if I'm a dow participant in the US I am also obliged to declare in my tax declaration each year all of the tokens I hold so I have to basically disclose that I am the da participant a participant in that said Dao and then I I'm basically doxed uh to the US government as as being someone who may be liable for it so if there is a positive judgment then it also creates this risk that people will have to either a structure their whole things in a way that will not appear in their tax declarations or basically obfuscate those so that they are not held in some illegitimate way I think libel for whatever happens on the doubt level but wait but with the IRS tell the cftc look this person has that token I don't know how that works like is that something where the agencies talk to each other about that I wouldn't know because I'm not a U.S lawyer but maybe Gabe you know that answer yeah I'm honestly not sure about all the information sharing roles among agencies I wish I knew more about that I'm not sure but to hearken back to our earlier conversation there is an easier solution here just stop turning Dows into Revenue earning Partnerships and businesses right then there won't be there won't be anything to report no one is no one is sitting around saying you know Bitcoin miners isn't Bitcoin just a giant partnership like shouldn't Bitcoin be sending k1s to every Miner like no one's saying that or no one's even saying that about like ethereum and validators even though that looks like a little bit more partnership like so like there's a bigger problem here right and there's an easier solution just to stop making these into businesses they're not meant to be that they're meant to be like robots right um so yeah I'll get on my soapbox now but just uh just a side note one other thing that I I expected you guys to talk about um and maybe I just missed it but there was another it was like ookie was determined to be this unincorporated association and I heard I remember like a bunch of lawyers were kind of arguing about that so can you define what that is and then talk about whether or not you think Dao's or any or any even type of dows would fit with that definition unincorporated association is a tricky term because personally I at least before that case I tended to use it as just sort of like like a group of people but we don't know we're going to kind of be agnostic on like whether it's an entity or exactly like the nature of that association's activities but in some jurisdictions unincorporated association actually means the same thing as partnership so it can get very confusing in in California in terms of like a service of process issue because that was the issue that was being debated right like can the cftc has a cftc even given proper notice of the lawsuit to the Dow members right um and if the Dow is an unincorporated association then it has a at least something sufficiently close to personhood that based on the relevant precedence you can serve that Association and you don't need to serve every individual member of that Association now what it has been used for in the past is sort of ill-defined things like gangs for example right um you know like like the Bloods are not like a company right but they but they aren't unincorporated association that is like sufficiently discrete where the government has decided you can serve process on that organization right um and so yeah it's not clear like exactly what all the rules of an unincorporated association are uh but it's clear that it it's sort of like sufficiently a thing where you can serve process on it rather than having to serve each of the individual people um I I find this very interesting so from from a Swiss lawyer perspective um this is a this is a concept that I just discovered in in the in the in the context of of crypto in the US and and the okay case I I I think this is just a curiosity for me that I'm following I I would I would just also encourage everyone generally with this topic to take a step back um it's a lot of there's a lot of anxiety in the space right now because of all of the legal and Regulatory um developments that happen and there's like Daily News and it's very hard to follow and usually the news is quite especially also also the cases against thousands thou members that it's it's even more anxiety-inducing for anyone who is trying to participate in the space experiment and also uh build and I would just take a step back and and and basically say that no matter the outcome there are appeals possible it's not uh the end of the entire case and at the same time um there are also legislative efforts that are deployed in the US and elsewhere to clarify the situation and to basically re-establish some form of equilibrium Injustice and and also Clarity in the space and basically whether or not dowels are considered to be unincorporated association I feel uh could be of interest and people have to have that in mind when they are building the Dao in case there are conditions that that need to be met for this to be an incorporated Association they don't want that when they are building the Dow or try to address these conditions in a satisfy a factory manner but at the same time it's not the end of the world if it is I think all right so I want to contrast uh the Uki Dao case against one with maker because um it feels like these were decided somewhat differently so what happened in this maker Dao case was um I guess the judge dismissed it saying that the maker Foundation was not a proper defendant because but it has been dissolved and therefore relaxed capacity to be sued so um just before we record it I think Gabe you implied that this indicates that like the legal status of dows was decided differently in these two cases Uki and maker the maker dial case is not um yeah it's not so much about Dows or it's not that there were two entities sued in the maker Dow case um one had been dissolved before the lawsuit and one had not and though the one that was dissolved you're right you know the judge basically said too late it's too late to Sue this entity the one that was not however the judge still sort of reviewed the merits of that claim right now again it was an entity it wasn't the doubt but that particular entity does things that you know are currently done by the maker by the Dow right they they got rid of the entities for a reason and the doubt took over whatever they were doing right so what's interesting about that case is that the activities involved in managing uh governing a smart contract protocol potentially creating a smart contract protocol we're at issue in that case because that entity had been doing those activities and some people lost money in the protocol it was over the maker Dow black Thursday incident where a subset of vaults basically had their eth auctioned off way more cheaply than they were supposed to and they incurred like the the people who got liquidated incurred a way bigger loss than they would have expected to right that was the issue and they basically wanted to say hey this protocol was designed in a negligent manner or it was described uh falsely right um those are all issues that can also be faced by a dow right if the Dow is setting the parameters negligently or upgrade the system and it turns out the the new code is bad in some way and people lose money those are the issues right and so what's interesting are those issues and the way it was decided and the judge did apply the economic loss Doctrine there and unlike in the ukidao case uh the judge said there is no special relationship here these developers never said hey we're looking out for you guys we're going to give you the best protocol possible this protocol is awesome and we're going to monitor everything and we're going to always be making sure it works they never said that they did some stuff and they may have been trying to make money off of the system in various ways but it just doesn't it just doesn't rise to that level of special fiduciary duty where it overcomes the the standard rule under torts which is that if you only incur an economic loss because of someone's negligence you do not have a tour claim against them if you want to have claims against those type of people you need to enter into a special contract with them that gives you the right to claim a breach of contract or something and people using D5 protocols not only do they not do that but typically the the front end or the the web interface that people use to access the protocol if you look at the terms of service it actually disclaims all liability it says as is where is we're not doing anything for you use at your own risk right all the those things so that is the deal that people are striking when they use these protocols there's your your it's caveat and tour it's do your own research look at the code yourself or get your buddy to look at the code or hire someone to look at the code you're not going to go to the developer so I think that case although it was about a development entity has a lot of implications for these types of lawsuits that could be brought against Dows as well and to me it illustrates that although there are some risks the risks are pretty manageable if you're careful about what you say what you put in relevant terms of service don't over promise things just cause Fade to Spade keep the Dallas activities limited and I actually don't think the liability risks are necessarily that high but then is that in contrast to how the US government handled the tornado cash different bodies of laws very different bodies of law very different issues right one is private plaintiffs who got a lot of sustained losses trying to recover damages from developers this when it's the government saying saying no your protocol is violating regulations that's a very different thing right and the tort issues are out the window right it's it's more whether you are doing something that in some ways facilitating violations of law right and in this case the government is saying hey you guys created a system that's designed to help people evade sanctions laws right you're aiding and abetting violations of law right that's essentially what the theory would be there now keep in mind the government isn't you know actually suing the U.S government at least is not suing tornado cash developers as far as I know it's just impose these sanctions on people saying don't use the tornado cash system in the Netherlands there is a tornado cash developer who's currently sitting in prison who's being brought up on those types of charges although I'm not an expert in Dutch law or whatever it is but it's just different when it's a violation of regulations and it's the government suing you versus a private plaintiff who just lost some money on your protocol yeah funimate do you have any thoughts on on that I don't know if I mean they're I guess they're not exactly commensurate but it struck me that it was in contrast to what Gabe had been saying I mean I I find the the decision to make a job case very very very positive because we usually see right now this trend of always trying to find someone accountable for whatever negative happens related to blockchain or use anything that happens in the crypto space as just negative advertisement and and then points to some some people liable and I find this decision to be correct with regards to tornado cash I mean this is a very very unfortunate situation and I really hope that basically the two lawsuits that are brought now um against this decision by ofak to list the software um as persons under sanctioned to be successful I feel that this decision is basically um basically taking away a lot of our freedom to privacy and to assembly and basically a lot of the rights that we have away from from anyone so any any U.S person but on also unfortunately the reality is that um all facts decision regarding sanctions and generally like policies in this field uh reach outside of the United States so right now if you are in Europe and you're not a U.S person uh it will be way much more difficult for you to take your funds out of uh tornado cash the way you would have done before although this is not illegal there but basically whatever ofak decides to put under sanctioned has Ripple effects everywhere else in the world and we should just not vilify privacy Tech in the in this way private stake is or any Tech basically that um the main narrative that is put forward to basically put Toyota cache under sanctioned and also to um go against privacy Tech is oftentimes that it's used by uh for instance North Korea when they are laundering the proceeds of uh that they obtain illegally through hacks or through through extortion and so on um but unfortunately like I don't think that we should give that much power to North Korea to basically decide to use a software over another and always when this software is helping them to launder money and no one else can use it so basically we are at the mercy of their decisions and this is just not sustainable at all so I hope that there will be some uh like positive outcomes to these lawsuits and we will be able to use privacy tag in in just in a lawful manner without having to worry about uh about basically doing something illegal I yeah and keep in mind I mean I think on this as far as the issue of limited liability goes this is like the point I really want to make that when there's a violation of regulations having an entity is not going to give you this magical limited liability anyway right like you know what I mean like like the tornado cash devs had an entity right the guy is still in prison right when it comes to crime and like serious like Financial regulations they are gonna they're not just gonna stop at the entity they're going to go to the individuals no matter what right so that's the thing that I think is lost in this whole oh like there's all these risks like maybe you're violating these regulations like you should really have an entity maybe but like that's really if you're violating regulations and criminal statutes that's not really going to help you very much to be honest yeah well but we so a couple of things so first of all like with ukidao it felt like what they were saying was like oh if we have this decentralized doubt then it's okay for us to do these illegal things but when it comes to you know with tornado cash like coin Center would say oh it's not illegal to write code especially you know as in the US we have a right to privacy you know there was sort of like an unintended consequence there but I just want to I don't know exactly what you're saying are you saying that you thought what the tornado cash deaths were doing in terms of writing this code was it legal no I'm not saying that but I think if it was illegal right then the whether they have an entity or not is not going to be the issue right that saves them right the government will pursue the individuals responsible again the the ukidao guys they had an entity too the cftc still sued the individual people because there's you know a control person aspect of the law that says the people who ultimately making the decisions they're liable even if they're operating through an entity so it's just kind of two different issues right you can use an entity to protect against like commercial liability and some basic things but when it comes to these regulatory things they are just going to go after the people responsible no matter how you set it up so the real lesson is try not to violate regulations very controversial obviously and a lot of like questions around that but but that ultimately is the issue not whether you have an entity or not if I can just add uh to these I I strongly believe that the developers of thundercatch has have not done anything illegal um and writing software should not be deemed to be illegal and using software neither so if you do something illegal ahead of you using the software then obviously you should be responsible and made accountable for this but just simply using a privacy software is not illegal and I think that this needs to be repeated until we get everyone else in regulator especially to to agree with us on this to go back to basically busyx and what we're discussing I find that the fact that they so openly provoked regulators and said that decentralization will shield them to be basically what brought them in this situation in the first place and the effect that this case can have may just harm or cast a shadow over the entire space and this is basically I I want to just talk to every Builder and and that they should be extremely careful when they put forward these claims because the the effect of what they are doing and what they are saying will be greater than just their own projects and and basically they have also a responsibility to first of all act uh just in lawfully and and second of all also to try to have safeguards in place so that they can protect whatever the policies of the regulation want to protect and then also protect the space overall yeah intention matters if you're decentralizing because you're just wanting to evade regulators and that's a different thing from decentralizing because that's like the best you know version of what it is that you're trying to build or you know whatever so so last case that I want to discuss before we go is obviously what happened with mango um so mango markets uh you know what had this Market manipulation by Avi Eisenberg who then went on Twitter and told the world that he had engaged in this quote-unquote highly profitable trading strategy which you know The Regulators determined was Market manipulation and what had happened was that um he actually returned um a big chunk of the money to the mango Dao because they had agreed with him that they wouldn't pursue legal action as long as he returned this money so before we even get to like what happened in court I was just curious at that point in time did you guys think that that agreement was going to be legally binding I thought it would not be legally binding I thought you know look they're essentially being coerced to to agree to something in order to get some money back they're humoring him they're trying to say whatever it takes to like give him some false comfort that he can keep some of the money lawfully and then give the rest of it back and he'll be okay and I I did not think that it would be an enforceable agreement plus it's a doubt as well so there's all these questions like who if it is enforceable who's in enforceable against every user of the protocol or just the people or the entire Dao which may not include all the users or or just the particular people who voted yes in favor of this element you don't know you don't know so there are many questions around it and if I had to have guessed I would have guessed no I I will take the offices stance here and I would say that if um and when this decision is made according to the governance rules of the Dao then I think that it must be upheld and I don't think that this decision was obviously it was a very um it was a challenging situation there was time pressure there was Financial pressure there was a lot of stress involved in making that decision but no one I think forced them to make that decision the identity of this person was known at that point so they may could have just simply decided not to make any deal with this person and try to basically have law on first we'll go against that person and attempt to recover the fund so they made this basically I think informed decision to enter into that deal whether or not it's a good deal I think this is a whole other question I think it's a it's a terrible deal but but then I feel like those who may be responsible for this are are the ones who made bad strategic decisions or had bad negotiation or actually Allah in like made decisions I had that led to this this exploit even being possible there is I mean there is some interesting Nuance here because ultimately Avi cleverly I think arranged it so that the users could be made completely whole and only the the treasury funds of the Dow which which had been raised in kind of like a like a sale of mango tokens they had this Insurance Fund concept where they sold mango tokens and then they they had this like Insurance Fund that was controlled by the Dow as a result of that right and and only that in the end only that value is what would be reduced and go to Avi right because of that I think there there is a a stronger argument that it's enforceable right because it's kind of like the Dao agreeing to give its own money to Avi whereas if the users had gotten haircutted I don't think there is really any agreement or implication of an agreement on behalf of users that because they're depositing funds in the protocol they're empowering this Dao to like negotiate deals on its behalf right on behalf of those users right so it that that Nuance I think does lead toward you know the the reading of it being enforceable more defensible than if the users themselves had been haircuted okay yeah because initially when you guys responded what was interesting was so I agreed with Gabe in the sense that I thought it would not be legally enforceable meaning like I thought that a court would say like this is just bogus like you guys made up this thing and it's like you're not a legal entity anyway and whatever I think that I thought the court would just dismiss it um but what I liked about Fatima's answer is Father May was like uh hello like who cares about the status um if you are part of any group and you guys agree on something like you should follow through on that which just makes sense from a common sense point of view um so it's just funny like I felt like you guys answered it slightly differently um but what was interesting is that actually surprisingly this judge disagreed with me and Gabe and went with fatimae and was just like um yeah even though this isn't uh you know a contract between lawyers or whatever um this but you know is legally binding so I was curious for your thoughts on you know that judgment you got to keep the procedural posture in mind here right because it's not like a final judgment but the there was a a mango development company was trying to act on behalf of the Dao to come in and because a lot of people are suing Avi now and so These Guys these developers came in and they said whoa whoa whoa I know a lot of people want money from Avi and they're suing him and they want to throw him in jail and all this stuff but he still has 30 million dollars from us that he took in a hack and we want a temporary restraining order judge to like free I I forget exactly what they're asking for whether it was to probably just to freeze it right while this all gets figured out and their main argument was that number one you know he's look the guy's getting sued for Market manipulation in the attack that let him get this money and in the first place right so it's all legal and number two that yeah we like have this like settlement agreement that the Dow voted on but like that was truly duress it was done under duress meaning it was coerced it was not a real agreement and the judge reasoned exactly like Fatima he said wait you guys negotiated this you rejected his initial proposal and you made a counter proposal that's not duress duress is like when you tie someone up and say sign this or I'm shooting you in the head that's duress right you guys negotiated it's clear no duress so but it's just on a motion for um a temporary restraining order they could still ultimately win like on a full trial and a full consideration of the merits right but you have to to get that temporary restraining order you have to show a high likelihood of success on the ultimate merits of your claim uh based on what you've given the judge so far and based on what he had right there he wasn't seeing that high likelihood that rises to that standard and he was not willing to give the temporary restraining I feel like like basically if you want to be coherent and we want to consider doubts as being this organization with personhood then we have to also respect their decisions so we cannot be like in this specific case we go beyond it and we we just disregard this decision they made um because after the fact it seems more favorable to their pockets to disregard it like I don't think it should work like this yeah all right all right so going forward are there any particular developments regarding Dao's that you're especially interested in checking out well I think I think one of the biggest ones is what we hit on which is is the cftc going to get a default judgment against ukidao whatever ukidao is and if it does get it what's it going to do with it right um is it going to try to go after individual people or is it just going to use it as like a like a like a cudgel like take down their website or something that's a very interesting one I'm also interested just to see because this is somewhat a game of cat and mouse right so what's going to be the adaptation here right are people just gonna stop doing those um because because of all these lawsuits and things and find different ways to design protocols uh or or they or are they going to adopt the Borg approach right of like minimizing what the Dow does and having more entities you know how's how's the industry going to adapt I mean I can't really predict exactly where it's all going but uh you know I'm here for it uh other than everything that's happening uh in the crypto law space especially in in the US I'm uh very excited to look at those and see how they are trying to self-regulate and and Target all of the responsibilities that they must have um in protecting their users and protecting uh their software and having compliance strategies while being resilient I think there's a lot that can be done on uh by Dows to to make the space better and also to be more confident with regards to Regulators when they are negotiating policies with them um and and I feel like we should be more building rather than looking outwards for answers and solutions all right great well where can people learn more about each of you and your work uh my my Twitter is uh at Lex node Lex underscore node I'm there I'm terminally online as they say and also check out Delphi Labs medium page where we'll be publishing a very long and comprehensive article about Dao's the liability associated with Dows how to limit that and this this new model of borgs uh as a technique for um you know going back to the pure concept of daos and also working on um uh smart contract enhanced uh business entities at the same time on Twitter simply it's my handle is fatal me f-a-t-a-l-m-e-h sounds ridiculous when I say it out loud but that's where you can find my my posts love it all right well it's been a pleasure having you both on Unchained nice thank you so much thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about Gabriel and fanime and Dows check out the show notes for
