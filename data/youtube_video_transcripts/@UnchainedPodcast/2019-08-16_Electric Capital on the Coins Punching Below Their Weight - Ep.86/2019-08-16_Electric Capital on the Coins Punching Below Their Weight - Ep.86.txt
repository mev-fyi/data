electric capital released a massive report this week about the state of developer activity in the blockchain and crypto ecosystem what exactly did you look at and what were your main findings yeah that's a great question so the developer report is a deep analysis of a developer activity across 27,000 code repositories and 22 million code commits and that really enables us to look at two things so the first thing on a high level is it enables us to look at how many developers are active in open source crypto and a layer beyond that is how many active developers are in each ecosystem and you know what we found is that there's close to 7,000 developers in the crypto ecosystem but this is actually a dramatic undercounting so I think one important caveat here is that we only look at open source repositories which means things like exchanges enterprise chains are not counted and so a lot of projects are closed source and but there are things that people really care about that are open source like Bitcoin and theorem that we really focus on here and when you see you looked at the code tory's what factors or features were you analyzing yeah so we look at code commits but not just that we really duplicate code to look at what is original so when we look at a commit we look at what the code author is and so if you have a fork of an original codebase we don't count that towards your activity so using those signals were able to look at how many monthly active developers each ecosystem has and one of the big storylines broadly about the crypto space has been the downturn and stagnation in the prices is that correlated or uncorrelated with developer activity like were your findings in line with this downturn or was there a different story there's absolutely different story and I think that's what's really interesting here so even though you know as you mentioned a lot of cryptocurrencies fell maybe 7080 percent over the past year the big finding here is that full-time developers actually increased 13% over the last year and we define full-time developers as someone who commits code ten days or more in a month and means that you're really active you're really devoting a lot of time you know your weekends your weeknights to building inside the ecosystem and digging into that even just a little bit further when we were doing this analysis we noticed that a high at a high level the number of unique developers had fallen 10% but the amount of code being written had not fallen so that was really puzzling right so what was going on here you know how is it possible that the amount of code written on remains the same code activity remains the same but developers have fallen and so what we really found is that many of the developers are infrequent contributors so 30% of developers contribute only once a month and if you look at quote-unquote developer loss eighty percent of that developer loss came from one time or part-time developers and so the people who actually commit code who are actually working really hard within these ecosystems who commit code ten times or more a month actually went up that was really our biggest finding here and were there also trends that you noticed between coins I noticed that some of the analysis you did was for instance separating out the top 100 coins from the rest and even within that there were other sort of subcategories so what kinds of trends did you see even within the coins themselves yeah we can you know maybe one way to organize this is look at it from top 100 Network value start with the biggest projects and move down so if you just look at the biggest names in crypto Bitcoin and aetherium we can start there so for Bitcoin the trend was really fascinating what we found is that since 2014 the number of developers that work in the Bitcoin ecosystem hasn't fallen below 100 and in fact there's right now more than 300 developers in the Bitcoin ecosystem so that's massive and it's very consistent over the years and for aetherium one in five developers are working inside the etherium ecosystem and just to kind of remind everyone what an ecosystem is an ecosystem includes decentralized applications it includes wallets includes infrastructure as well as core protocol so you know from a very high level at least looking at Bitcoin and aetherium the developer ecosystem is very very healthy there and if we move down a little bit into midsize projects that many people know and then look at the next layer down projects like cart dah know like Manero basic attention token stellar waves maker all of these projects gained full-time developers in some cases these projects lost developers overall but full-time developers which again are the people who work you know commit ten days or more in a month these developers actually increased for these projects and then one of the things that's really fun that comes out of this analysis is you can actually look at projects that are not very big yet that I've started to build a really healthy ecosystem and so you can really start to see the beginnings of something and so grin was one thing that really popped out at us here grin has 33 developers work and for a project that's launched about six months that's you know that's pretty incredible and so it actually has the largest developer developer ecosystem of any coin under 50 million network value they're growing very quickly for listeners who missed it I did what to me was a super fun episode on grin Unchained so I highly recommend you check that out one thing that I wanted to ask going back to Bitcoin and aetherium so Bitcoin first there was a section of the report where you analyzed on chain transaction count where it was basically just the number of transactions on chain per day and I noticed that the number of on chain transactions on Bitcoin was low relative to its market cap and developer activity but I noticed on block tivity I don't know if you ever check that but they have this like little meter and at least today that the chain showed that it was maxed out and you know obviously we're already seeing that that chain is trying to move a lot of transactions to layer two so in that regard is is that metric like maybe less important or will it like lose significance over time or and on top of that like is there a different metric you can use to you know that's like equivalent as more transactions move to layer two yeah you know I think that's a really great question there definitely is a danger to looking at pure transaction count because it really doesn't capture the amount that's transacted and and in a lot of cases if the fees are lower or you know it's a very gay Mobile metric for example so I'd say transaction count is something to look at that that you can consult with but maybe you know just kind of keeping that caveat in mind that that it's a little bit of a game above metric and to your point a lot of activities moving on to layer two and so looking at pure on chain transactions you definitely lose some of that nuance there and so then would transaction volume be the better metric yeah action volume is one thing to look at but even transaction volume I think doesn't capture the whole picture and one of the things that it doesn't capture for example is etherium you know if you just look at transaction volume it's very healthy but that volume doesn't really include the volume for ERC 20 tokens right which really should actually count towards aetherium so I would say it's you know transaction volume is a better metric to look at but with really any of these metrics it's really important to keep in mind the pros and cons and and the the nuances that you're losing by looking at each oh no wonder okay cuz my exact next question for you was why there was such a large gap between the size of the etherium developer ecosystem and then the relatively low daily transaction volume yes that's on but that makes so much sense because it was like there's 1,200 developers on aetherium we know there's like a ton of activity there and why are these okay so it's because it's not accounting it is there a way for you guys to measure to add in the ERC 20 tokens or was that not possible no there's definitely a way and actually one of the things that we want to follow up with is is looking at you know aggregating some of that volume and then looking at it that way as well but we wanted to keep it at a pure protocol layer in the sense that you know for that core chain so for Bitcoin as well it's really just for the Bitcoin chain or for the Yeo's chain what is that volume compared to the number of developers in the ecosystem so that really allowed us to have an apples to apples comparison all right we're gonna discuss some of the other ways that Maria an electric capital parsed out developer activity in the crypto space in a moment but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible crypto comm is the place you can buy crypto at true cost you can buy over 40 coins at the lowest possible prices with no fees and no markups at crypto comm we grow your crypto for you too you can earn up to 8% per year on BTC eth XRP and more when you deposit in any of the one month 3 month or flexible terms download the crypto comm app on iOS or Android now will the world follow France and advocate banning privacy coins will government-backed stable coins become the new Fiat are distributed and peer to peer exchanges just a flash in the pan the answer is maybe virtual currencies can flourish and create a new private and more versatile economy but that grand vision can't happen without keeping crypto clean and that requires support of governments and accountability for bad actors privacy enhanced compliance using cryptographic controls has the potential to preserve anonymity without compromising legitimate investigations cipher trace is working on this vision of the future sign up to stay up to date on the privacy enhanced compliance initiative and receive authoritative crypto AML reports quarterly WW cipher trace calm slash keep crypto clean back to my conversation with Maria Shen so there was another way that you analyze these crypto networks which is by something that you called active ecosystem how do you define active ecosystem and what trends did you find when you measured things that way yeah so an active ecosystem is an ecosystem with at least two developers who have the full time for six months out of a year and the reason we really looked at it that way was again a lot of the developer loss or a lot of the activity within the crypto ecosystem come from developers that contribute infrequently so they they contribute once a month or they or they contribute you know just a couple of times a month and so we really wanted to hone in on ecosystems that were very active that were consistently building things and that's that's really how we came up with the active ecosystems measure and you're looking for that because like as investors you're imagining if something has an active ecosystem that that means there will be like progress on that chain is that kind of like what what the importance of that metric is yeah absolutely I mean I think in general you know this really harkens back to why do we even care about developer activity overall and developers are really an early signal for where value is going to be created and accrue and so you know if in order for there to be network security or applications on chain developers really need to go build that a lot of people believe this so Chris Dixon for example talks about this all the time and that what developers do on the weekends is why people will work on during the weekdays in ten years and so you know that's really why looking at that concentration of developers really important to us obviously though it's really important to keep in mind that this is just one signal in one part of the cohesive whole but unfortunately I think developer data is not something that's very easily accessible and so that's really the gap we're trying to fill it is is giving more people access to this data that that a lot of people care about one thing that I found interesting in your analysis of the active ecosystems was that so smart contract platforms apps and infrastructure were the most active but then weirdly money which to my mind is the earliest and sort of like most proven use case of flushing technology and then defy which is I guess like a related trend there are actually quite much less active so what do you make of that I would separate money from defy so let's just talk about money first for a lot of these chains development has really you know calmed down to some extent so for smart contract platforms you really see a lot of activity on that because a there's a lot of people working on the park core protocol but then be a lot of people working on applications contributing to applications on chain and so that's really where you're seeing a lot of the activity for money it's really more of Aegeus consistent amount of activity so again Bitcoin for example has kept a hundred developers since 2014 and so that's the sort of consistency that we see with money the drop-off would really come from you know like money projects that are maybe a little lower quality where developers are leaving and maybe aggregating really to to hire projects and for dfi you know our finding is actually the opposite and that defy is small and absolute numbers right now but it's actually one of the breakout categories you're seeing a lot of full-time developers growing in defy and a lot of developers moving in to defy and that's one of the areas that that have been very quickly increasing in the past year right right I guess yeah the numbers for defy our small assembly because it's sort of new but it did surprise me that money was low given that it's the oldest but actually when when you started your answer I just want to clarify one thing you said that with smart contracts and applications go together but actually in your in your analysis you actually separated them so but oh but I get yeah you're right but they're both among the top two okay okay so that's right of course yeah and so overall would you say that there are any coins that you think are punching below their weight price-wise based on the metrics you looked at you know I I think there definitely are a lot of the tokens that I mentioned mid cap and low cap are really surprising and in the growth that they've seen in full-time developers so you know again projects like Manero Cardno basic attention token stellar waves maker these have seen full-time developer growth and then of course the breakout the breakout projects that we saw that we were really surprised by was grin which again is the largest developer developer ecosystem in coins under 50 million so for that network value they really do have a lot of developers that are working very hard on it yeah I'm not gonna lie I I'm actually not surprised in the sense that and I think I said this when I did that interview there was so much about grin that reminded me of Bitcoin and like kind of the obsessive like falling in love feeling that I had when I learned about Bitcoin which I had about learning about grinning as well and so it was a little I don't know it just doesn't surprise me that like other people sort of gravitated toward it and then as for like yet you oh no I was gonna say absolutely I mean I I think another really interesting thing and just even tracking how the times have changed so grin has 33 developers working on it now and it's been out six months you know I mean to think of the number of years that it took Bitcoin to get from you know one or two developers to 33 developers it's you were obviously in a different era now very different and then so the reverse question are there any coins that you think are punching above their weight price-wise based on the metrics you looked at yeah I think one of the interesting things that came out of this was you know maybe one was the loss in Bitcoin cash again we really care about the full-time developer account because these are the developers that are really building core functionality and really making progress in on chain and if you look at Bitcoin cash at least according to our analysis just in January 2019 it fell from 24 full-time to eleven full-time and so that that I think was was something that stood out to us and yeah I would say that's probably and then in our previous developer report and in this one I think one of the other projects that consistently have lower developers to network value would be like coin so you know a lot of these Bitcoin Forks that that came around what we're seeing is lower developer activity relative to the network value that they wield today yeah and with Bitcoin cash for sure there's been so much drama and so much of I think the value of these networks comes from community and so clearly they're the community is is not a cohesive one so that makes sense and actually just one other one that I wanted to call out cuz on the reverse and we saw that maker Dow gained the most developers it was like an 80% increase obviously from a small base but still it was just on the charts like clearly really really different from every other coin so do you want to talk about why you think that is or what else your you know your observations are about maker yeah I think it's really part of you know we talked about defy briefly earlier in this conversation I think it's really part of that trend is is that makers full time developers grew from nine to twenty three over the last year and you know that's that's really remarkable I think that's really part of people intuitively have been have been aware that GFI is is growing in importance and I think this is one of the metrics that really confirms some of the intuitions that people have had around this so overall based on your research do you feel like you have any projections you can make about how you think the crypto space will develop going forward yeah I mean one of the interesting analysis or comparisons we wanted to make is is how crypto compares to other open source ecosystems so if you look at that you know the number of etherium developers is approaching the number of contributors to Apache projects in q1 2019 that's very remarkable that means said there's still a lot of room to grow so no js' package manager' users there's 4 million of them right so whereas we're still in the thousands so there's definitely a lot of room to grow but I think the takeaway here that was super fascinating is that part time and one time developers tend to increase in bear markets whereas full-time developer growth rate continues but just at a slightly slower rate in in bear market so what that really means is that for the full time developers the ones that are consistently building they're very very sticky in the crypto ecosystem and so if you we did this fun production forward write to say like you know what if the next four years of developer growth looked like the last four years and we get to something like seventy thousand in March 2023 obviously this is a projection into the future but I think if you just even look at the way that historically developers have stuck around despite market conditions it's definitely very possible to look at it that way yet well something that was funny to me brought that chart was that the way you projected it out was that it would actually peak at a higher number before and then drop a little bit before we get to 17 K so it was like you are projecting some future bubble and then it kind of a resetting at a new at a new level at a at a new plateau or something but but as we know that's kind of how it goes in crypto we tried to incorporate a little bit of volatility in there yeah getting super realistic okay well great it's a fabulous report so good job thank you I really appreciate that yeah and thanks for coming
