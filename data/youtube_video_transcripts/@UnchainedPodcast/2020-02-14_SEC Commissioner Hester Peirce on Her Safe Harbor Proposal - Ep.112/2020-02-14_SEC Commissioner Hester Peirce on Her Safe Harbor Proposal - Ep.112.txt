download the crypto comm app today today's guest is SEC Commissioner has her purse welcome Commissioner purse flora is great to be here last week you proposed a three-year safe harbor period for token sales describe what that means and how the safe harbor period would work the purpose of the safe harbor is to give projects three years to get from the point where they're ready to distribute their tokens to the point where those tokens are out in the hands of enough people to constitute a decentralized network or they're up and running and functioning as tokens and a functioning network and so it essentially gives you a three year hiatus from the securities laws during that period to allow you to do the transition and so what problem are you trying to solve with this proposal the problem that I've noticed is that token projects that want to get up and running want to do a distribution and they worry about doing a distribution of any sort because they worry it's going to look like a securities offering and so they there are a lot of folks who are just not doing their offerings here in the US or they're really hesitating about how to move forward because they're very worried about it potential SEC enforcement action and in your speech you talked about how the SEC may have conflated the token with the investment contract what do you mean by that well it seems like when we talk about offerings in this space we often talk about the token as if it's the security and so really what it is is the token is being wrapped in an investment contract in some cases it's being wrapped in an investment contract and it's being sold to people with along with the notion that there's going to be this group that's going to build the network and then your token is gonna rise in value that's sort of the promise that people are getting but it's it's really important to remember that the token itself it can't be the security because then you could never have a functioning network where the token were being used as the coin of the realm on that network because it would always be a security and it would always have to transact be transacted just like any security would have to be would be transferred from one person to the next so if we go back to the Howey case for example those people were buying a piece of an orange grove and they were also buying the management efforts of others when they when they bought those pieces of the orange grove but the the plots in the orange grove weren't the securities and the oranges weren't the securities it was that whole contract rep together that was the security so there's one compliant route that has been taken by a couple of different teams which is the reg a plus offering otherwise known as the mini IPO why do you not think that this option is sufficient again you know I want people to have as many options as possible and if that's an option that works for works well for people I think that's great I was excited to see that there were offerings moving through the Reg a plus route what I wonder about is how do you get from the point where you have done a reg a plus offering and then you want to get those tokens more widely distributed and being used in a network and not having to travel the way that securities would have to travel from one person to another that's what I don't understand and that's what I'm trying to solve for oh so I think now there's something I misunderstood so the Reg A+ offering would be the first step in the sale and then the safe harbor period would be the 3-year period after that well you certainly could use a reg a plus offering to do the first the first piece of it or you could raise venture capital and you could do your first development phasing it phases using venture capital money and then you could do your token offering or you could do a token offering from the get-go I mean you'd have to be fairly far along because you've got to have a code that's that's up and running that you can put up and that you can show people so it's not like you can just throw up a white paper but you you might have gotten your money in the first instance through some other channel so to qualify for the safe harbor the first condition that a token development team must meet is to make a good-faith effort for the token network to reach network maturity and you define that as either decentralization or token functionality within three years after the first sale how do you define decentralized or you know token functionality well again I mean these are the same concepts that have have been very difficult for people to grapple with my my hope is that after three years it's going to be much more obvious that a token is actually functioning in a network or that a network is widespread enough that enough people are using it that they're enough that there are enough nodes at that point that it's going to be obvious it's decentralized so I just think the question becomes a much less gray area after three years and again I should know that this is a draft proposal it's just me putting it out and I'm really putting it out with the idea that people will come in and they'll give us feedback and say yeah this works this work and I think one of the initial pieces of feedback that I've heard is people are still wanting more guidance about what decentralized is gonna look like even after three years I just think it's gonna be much more obvious once you've had that three year period see you don't have any kind of like metrics or thresholds in mind already I don't and it has the community offered any because I noticed that you solicited in your speech you know input have you yeah I mean it's still pretty early days so I it's it's less than a week so I've gotten some feedback but I haven't gotten specific feedback on what those parameters should be you know we have some guidance out from the staff which I imagine people could look to but I'd like it to be a simpler question than trying to run through 40 different factors so you know certainly certainly I welcome input on that on that concept but I really do think it'll be so much easier to tell that you're you're on one side of the line or the other after you've had three years of really trying to push it out into people's hands the hands of people who want to actually use the token one other part that intrigued me was you said that being theoretically susceptible to a 51% attack would not keep a network from meeting that decentralized threshold and then you said quote nor would the participation of the team in a network alteration achieved through a predetermined procedure in the source code that involves other network participants prevent a team from determining that the network is decentralized and I know that sentence is a little bit difficult to parse in a verbal format but when I read it what came to mind was something like the Hart fork that aetherium instituted after the DAO attack is that what you had in mind well what I had in mind is that you know if you set out your if if you set out the way that you the way that the code will work and how it could be forked if you participants in the network decide to change it it's not going to kick you out the fact that the the team that initiated the network is participating on the same terms as everyone else in making those decisions is not going to kick you out of the safe harbor okay it's not going to kick you out it's not going to kick you out of being decentralized I should say or in and of being able to qualify as a non security and that's because of this phrase here where you said that that alteration involves other network participants meaning you know it's it's not just the team developing the token but then also for instance maybe like miners and users who are behind that decision is that what do you meant by that it is so what I'm trying to say is if you're the if you're the initial team and you retain the right to unilaterally make changes then it looks pretty centralized but if you're part of the team and you're just one piece of the team just like in one piece of the network just like anyone else it looks a lot more decentralized to me so you don't have to pull back and say I'm not going to be involved in the network anymore at all you can be involved on the same terms as other people and I and and when I'm when I look at that I would still look at it and say it's decentralized in a moment we'll discuss more about the conditions of Commissioner purses safe harbor proposal but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible crypto comm have you seen the mzo visa card a metal car loaded with perks up to 5% back and unlimited airport lounge

a dispute with some person or a business involving crypto or you just need legal advice related to crypto info at Kelman law that's ke l ma n dot law or just go to their website at wwlp.com on back to my conversation with the SEC Commissioner has her purse another requirement that you mention is that the token development team would have to make certain disclosures what would those be the disclosures would there be a range of disclosures but including who's on the team what your plans what what your plans are for the network how you plan to achieve those plans you'll have to disclose what the experience of your of your team is you'll have to disclose if the team members start selling their tokens so if you hit 5% you'll have to disclose that every time you you sell five percent of your tokens you'll have to you'll have to disclose it so there are a range of disclosures that are intended and then the code and it's intended to give people what they're interested in when they're considering whether to make a token purchase and it's also intended to sort of separate the wheat from the chaff the the projects that are really trying to do something and those that are just trying to raise money and run to make sure that the ones that are trying to raise money and run wouldn't find this an attractive route to go and I should say one one key piece is that there's the back up of you're still subject to the anti-fraud laws the part of the securities laws that governs fraud so you you don't get a complete free pass from the securities laws that you can't lie to people yeah well I did actually see one critical response I mean if there were multiple but there was one in particular that said that they thought that your proposal would result in a flourishing of the scams that we saw in the ico phase you know basically like a free pass and I was just curious for your response I'm assuming it's something along the lines of what you just said but but I wanted to ask you this yes exactly I saw that critique too and I think that my point is we're trying to both address the concern I think legitimate concerns that people have had about this space that there isn't a lot of information and that people don't really know what they're buying or who's behind these projects and what those people's plans are but also address the the the concern from legitimate teams that are really trying to build something and are perfectly willing to be transparent about what they build to let them put out there what they're trying to do and then and then sell their tokens so I take issue with that criticism because I think this this tries to exactly address what what the concerns are underlying that criticism yeah yeah I had a similar thought but at the same time it is true that I've also interviewed people who held icos in kind of when I guess when you would call the mania around crypto assets really had built up in 2017 but it was sort of the the follow-on crowd where it was people who weren't necessarily like trying to create new business models and had like a really you know that were really using the I guess distinct features of crypto tokens to create something new but we're instead just kind of glomming on and using them as a way to raise money and you know they thought they had a kind of justification for using it but just knowing what I know about this face I was like mmm you know I I see through this and I feel like you really are using it to raise money but but they seemed like very Ernest and to really believe that what they were doing was not that so I think that's the one gray area where I'm like whom I wonder how those would fare under the safe harbor period but but maybe what would happen is that you know those wouldn't end up taking off and wouldn't meet the decentralised or you know the the thresholds that you outlined you know for functional tokens but I did wonder what would happen to tokens that don't meet those thresholds well so I think the three-year period is long enough that as you're approaching that three-year period you would kind of know whether you're gonna hit it or not you would know whether your tokens are out there being in the hands of lots of people and being used by lots of people and whether your network is functional and so you can prepare either to register your your securities going forward or you can prepare to you know if you want to shut your your network down you could do that as well but my guess is that at that point most people would would register with the SEC sort of similar similar to what we've required in some of our enforcement settlements with with folks and one other condition that you had here that I wanted to ask about was you require that the team make a good-faith effort to provide liquidity for users and you say that you expected that this condition will surprise some people because the SEC views attempts to facilitate secondary trading as indications of a security offering so why did you decide to make this a condition I think if you can't transfer tokens from one person to another then you're really minimizing the ability of the network to grow of those network effects to happen so I imagine that developers might get paid in the token and then they'll want to cash out some of that for Fiat or another crypto and so you need to allow them a way to do that and so I think that the the focus on on secondary trading is being negative just it doesn't make sense here because you really do want to make sure that those tokens are widely dispersed to people who actually want to use and also there are some states such as Wyoming and Colorado that have already exempted certain crypto transactions from securities laws so how would your proposal if it were to go through how would that affect these state level laws I think that's an interesting point and it's one I need to think more about I mean you know typically we think of the securities law the federal securities laws as governing anything that that's crossing state lines and so I am not entirely sure how those state-level exemptions work but I'm happy to talk with with people in those states to make sure that that the two approaches are consistent you know right now the way it's written is is if someone applied for this or said that that they were taking advantage of this safe harbor then you would get automatic preemption from state laws and so it may be that this would just be you know both would be consistent they'd be we'd be pre-empting but they would also want the state level be saying our state laws don't apply and since you've released your proposal how have the other commissioners and SEC staff received the proposal did they seem receptive you know I've gotten some positive feedback I think that I still have work to do and part of the reason that I wanted to release this was so that I could get good feedback from the community of people who would be interested in using it and then you know make sure that it's workable from that perspective and then be able to take it to my fellow commissioners and say all right look I think I'm addressing the concerns that you have which are again legitimate concerns but I think I have a way to both address those concerns and to allow the good projects to move forward the way they want to so I'm you know I'm I'm still recognizing that I have work to do but I'm optimistic that I can make progress on that front since your tenure is up in June if the commissioners did decide they wanted to institute this proposal what would need to happen and how long would it take well I should say that my tenure is up in June it's typical for commissioners to be able to stay on past their tenure if the spot isn't filled if it's filled obviously I have to move on so I don't know when my departure date is but in any event I think that this is something that whether regardless of whether I'm here or not I think the the need for this kind of gap filler is there and so I'm hopeful that having it out there will will allow people to work with it and and and refine it and reform it into something that would work but you know if it were to go the way I have it structured now it's a rule and so if it were to move forward it would need to go out as a proposal and then it would need to to be adopted and that process can take some time and would it involve does it just involve the SEC deciding to do it or does it does so okay and when you say some time it would it be a year or so typically what happens is when you put out a proposal you have a 60 or 90 day comment period and then you can adopt off that so you know you can kind of do the math and see that it's it's certainly not an overnight thing one other approach that I suggested was possible would be to do no action relief at the Commission level and that's something that you could do much more quickly so those are two options but again as people in the crypto space know everything in government takes a long time and so I thought it was really important to get this out there to get people talking and thinking about what something like this would look like and then we can go from there and I should note that you know as is obvious from this discussion all the views that I represent are my own views and not necessarily those of the SEC or my fellow commissioners you know speaking of the crypto community people definitely by and large had a positive reception and were sending their love to you crypto mom so yeah I think this is definitely something you know people are talking about and and at least in some parts of the community are excited about well and what I appreciate is that and what I think is is so nice about this community is that I know that people are giving me really constructive feedback too it's not just crypto mom we love you it's it's crypto mom you got this wrong and let's show you how to fix it and that's really what I'm looking for is people to weigh in I'm by no means an expert in this area and I know that there are people out there who are and who will have a sense of what needs to change and and what looks like it would work you're close enough to an expert that when I was reading the proposal I felt it was actually pretty thoughtful and considered you know obviously it's not like super filled out but like the basic lines are there I feel so well that's good I'm glad it's well it's been great having you on the show thanks so much for coming undone

that's et Oro comm hi everyone greetings from Denver where I flew risking coronavirus for those of you who saw my Twitter poll even though 40% of people responded to the poll saying that they would wear a face mask on the flight almost nobody on the flight was in I think I only saw two people and then we're wearing this surgical face masks which don't really do anything although I guess maybe they prevent you from touching some parts of your face anyway I'm here at eath Denver and we'll be doing a fireside chat with two of the most crypto friendly governors in the US and we'll release that conversation next week on unconfirmed as always thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap first headline getting more bullish Larry Cermak of the blog tweeted several interesting charts saying quote the sentiment has drastically changed in January in my opinion his first bit of evidence is that spot trading is up 70 percent from last month to a five-month high perpetual swap volume in January on bit max is up 55 percent to an eight-month high and web traffic to crypto exchanges is up for the first time since April check out the full tweet storm for all the indicators we'll see how February goes second headline all the ways to value crypto assets coin metrics is conducting a comprehensive review of all the methods for valuing crypto networks this week they rolled out part 1 which covers the equation X of exchange and the equals PQ discounted future utility models Metcalfe's law price regression models and more they conclude quote the Dutch East India Company founded in 1602 was the first corporate entity that issue bonds and shares to the public and in doing so became the world's first formally listed public company it then took a period of over three hundred years for the necessary foundational concepts to be developed until the formal discipline of the equity valuation was established in the 1930s with crypto assets we stand on the shoulders of giants and substantial progress has been made over the past ten years in the emergent field of crypto asset valuation research third headline China's blockchain plans the chamber of digital commerce dig digs up all 84 patents by China regarding blockchain technology and had them translated to English based on its review of the patents the Financial Times reports quote China may plans to algorithmically adjust the supply of central bank digital currency based on certain triggers such as loan interest rates some outline mechanisms to allow customers to make deposits with their existing banks and then exchange that for digital currency daaaad other patents are focused on building digital currency chip cards or digital currency wallets that banking customers could potentially use which would be linked directly to their bank accounts the article also quotes one expert mark Kaufman a partner and patent attorney at Ramone law who says quote most of the patents have to do with integrating digital currency into existing banking infrastructure next headline an inside look at crypto scams Paul vania of the Wall Street Journal did a great feature on how crypto currency scams took in more than four billion dollars in 2019 in it we meet one victim of the plus token scam a Korean man who got into crypto via plus token putting eighty six thousand dollars in to crypto within five months and losing everything weirdly the scammers used Prince Charles to promote their coin by showing images of the so called founder of plus token a supposedly former Google employee named Leo shaking hands with the British heir to the throne next headline JP Morgan may merge Quorum with consensus reuters reported that such a deal may be announced within the next six months though it's unclear whether the 25 people who work on quorum will join consensus preston Byrne tweeted quote consensus and JP Morgan are not merging my guess is that all that's happening here is handing over control of a github repo to save face on JPM side and to get a cool press release on consensus aside my only comment here is that if you've into both the consensus and the JPMorgan offices then the idea of these two office cultures being mashed together is pretty hilarious next headline how chained Alice's cornered the federal government market for a blockchain analytics software coin desk write up a good feature on chain alysus and how it is the blockchain Analysis provider most used by the federal government with ten point seven million dollars spent on its tools the biggest customers include the IRS the FBI and surprisingly ice now for fun bits how backed plans to make all our points expendable I miss this feature are on fortune last week which is about backs plans for its reward wallet but it's worth a read for understanding the vision that backed has for its consumer facing app the feature begins wouldn't it be great if you could open a digital wallet and view the sum total of all your rewards programs for hotels pharmacies and bank cards all in one place converted into cash then you could spend all those thousands of unused airline miles as dollars to buy an Apple watch or take your spouse to dinner at the corner pizzeria loyalty points you don't even know you have the average American has more than a dozen rewards programs are suddenly as spendable as the books in your checking account just by scanning your rewards app at the checkout counter one of the main challenges to bringing this fruition this vision to fruition will be persuading merchants to accept payment via the back tap it'll be interesting to see how the company's efforts go alright thanks for tuning in to learn more about commissioner purse and her safe harbor proposal be sure to show you the links
