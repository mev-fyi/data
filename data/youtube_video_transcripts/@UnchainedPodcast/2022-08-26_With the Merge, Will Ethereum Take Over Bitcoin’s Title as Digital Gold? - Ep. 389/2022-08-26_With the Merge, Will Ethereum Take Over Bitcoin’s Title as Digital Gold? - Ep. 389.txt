travis thanks for having me laura how are you doing i'm doing great i'm excited to have you here to talk about the merge which has been a hot topic uh at the merge ethereum will finally move from being a proof-of-work blockchain to a proof of stake one and although this sounds like a technical upgrade the supply and demand dynamics of eth will also change and that in turn will affect its price so can you walk us through what these changes are and why you think they might impact the price of eth the the bullish catalyst here so i consider this the most significant catalyst in crypto history in terms of its magnitude and the fact that ethan is the second largest crypto and just what it means and it's you know i think of it as being you know even larger than bitcoin havings and the bullish scenario around this i think is relatively straightforward ethan's going deflationary ethan's going yield generating and ethan's going esg friendly which you know the world cares a lot about esg at the moment so so to me i think the bullish case for it is pretty straightforward but i think i'd i'd like to probably talk more about the risks around it today in terms of price action because people talk a little bit less about that and there's a lot right now okay well if you want to go ahead and dive into that go ahead yeah so i mean there's many risks going into this merge during after in terms of price technical design risk technical implementation risk hack risk value accrual risk price manipulation risk illiquidity risk there's a lot of risk i think the risk is priced attractively but i don't intimately understand every single one of those risks and i could just be mispricing one or more of those potentially grossly mispricing one or more of those and i'm you know you may learn some new information and very rapidly decide that the risk isn't attractive anymore for any number of reasons and if you're you're long east today you know you need to understand these risks and price could do literally anything including go down 50 in a straight line it just did that like six weeks ago two months ago price could go up a lot and then it could go down a lot and like fade the news type of thing and then it could go up even more or the the merge could technically work and then price could go up a lot but then value accrual which is which is still an un you know an uncertain concept value cruel could eventually fail and east could bleed out into oblivion like eos that's that's not my base case but it could happen and that's kind of the like east specific stuff and then you've got like this whole other macro overlay that matters just as much and i would argue maybe potentially more than the east specific stuff okay well why don't we walk through some east specific questions and then we'll go into macro one of the points that i wanted to pull out was when ethereum becomes a proof of stake chain the ability to stake will lock up some proportion of the coins and i wondered if you had some percentage of eath holders in mind that you expected to stake but then i also wanted to ask you about the other issue which is that maybe about six months to a year after the merge those who staked will also then be able to finally withdraw their money although they won't be able to all do that in one so i kind of wondered when you look at those two lovers how you think those factors will affect the price of eve just from a trading perspective to answer your first question no i don't i don't i don't have a base case estimate for what percent of ease is going to get locked up that that overhang you know which is not near term but coming down the line from a from a pure like trading perspective you i don't love that you just you generally don't love that it's like it's kind of a minor version of like the the mount gox bitcoin that's been you know locked up in these lawsuits for however many years at this point and people are always watching for the updates there to see okay like when is all this bitcoin finally gonna gonna get into the owner's hands they can do what they want to with it but it's like a similar type of situation to a lesser degree i think as the um the staking you know becomes unlocked and people can do whatever they want to it just having that big overhang just from a trading perspective i i don't love that yeah so maybe um because that's going to be delayed for a little while perhaps we won't see that downward pressure in the beginning but then maybe for a while after we might i did also notice that at the moment the ultrasound money website says that after the merge the amount of usage on ethereum in the past year if it were to happen post-merge would result in a deflation of about 1.5 percent of the ethereum supply and i wonder how much do you expect that would boost the price of eth if at all oh this is definitely not not financial advice and i try hard not to go on these types of things and make you know public price prediction one thing i will say about that is you know the activity levels on east like today or over the last month are you know drastically lower than the average over the prior 12 months so you know day one or say you know the first month or the first 90 days after the merge you know if we're still in this kind of macro driven bear market and there's you know we're still dealing with the kind of fallout of of everything that this ecosystem has had happened to it over the last couple months then you wouldn't necessarily expect that that that uh activity would ramp that much so i think you know it's probably going to be plus or minus you know slightly inflationary versus you know maybe slightly deflationary you know probably somewhere around there just depending on on activity levels but that's obviously you know a massive reduction from what the supply schedule has looked like in in proof of stake ethereum so you are talking about like you know i think it can in a conservative estimate you know it's like a probably a a 75 percent uh reduction in emissions and in a bowl case you know it would be north of 100 so yeah yeah you said proof of stake uh but i think you meant proof of work at that time but yeah uh point taken yeah and you're right that when you change the settings on the website for the level of activity over the past like month or you know week or whatever then yes at that point it looks like post merge ethe would continue to be inflationary so as we speak ethereum's trading at roughly seventeen hundred dollars and i wondered you know once uh it becomes a proof of stake chain you know you mentioned a few different factors so how would you at that point start to kind of figure out what your price target is or whether or not youth is overpriced or underpriced so there's all those risks specific to to ease that i laid out at the beginning of this conversation you want to see how the implementation goes you want to see if there's hiccups you want to see what happens with this proof of work fork that looks like it's going to happen i'm not expecting you know anything particularly spectacular out of that but but it is going to be a factor that's going to be worth watching yeah which is yeah people wanting to continue the old the original chain right right and you know i think there's a because you're asking this is a very traitory type of question right so you're asking like so to give a traitory answer it depends a lot on positioning so i think you got to ask yourself the question of like how crowded is a directional eth long right now and i think you know the crypto sort of crypto native capital has gotten smoked over the last couple months right we all everybody knows what's happened over the last couple months the capital that's left over you know i think it's mostly long east now in terms of the the large institutional capital that came into this space on the way up and came out you know just as quickly as the fed started tightening interest rates and that's been the price action we've had since november of last year it's my guess that most of that traditional institutional real deep pocket type of capital is is remaining on the sidelines for this this merge event and i think part of that is the execution risk around that but i think the the larger factor there is the uncertainty around macro and if you just look at if you just take the nasdaq and overlay it with east since november of 2021 like you can pretend like you're trading the merge but you're trading the nasdaq and the nasdaq is completely tied to monetary policy from central banks and some other things but that's really the overarching thing and there's still a ton of uncertainty in macro land right now but i think it's probably not the bat drop that most pools of traditional capital want to see to be firing into east now there's a path through the course of this year where you could thread the needle and get improvements on the macro the couple macro factors that matter most right now but then there's there's a whole set of outcomes where that's not so rosy and you don't get that that institutional capital coming in say after the merge is complete and it went okay and the sort of crypto native capital by itself i think can probably only drive this thing so much higher without getting that extra list of you know real deep pockets from non-crypto native money does that make sense yeah yeah it does and i'm i have a few more questions for you about institutional interest in eth but first a quick

unchained at checkout that's mainnet.events and promo code unchained see you this fall at mainnet2022 back to my conversation with travis so you said that it's mostly the macro environment that you feel is affecting kind of you know whether or not institutional money gets involved in eth but i wondered now that most merge when the narrative around eth changes um you know there's been this talk of east becoming ultrasound money at that point about it being this triple point asset you know as you mentioned yield bearings you know it'll be deflationary et cetera and i wondered you know bitcoin's narrative so far has been that it's got this limited supply um granted it will be slightly inflationary for the next what is it you know 120 years but i wondered do you see that narrative around digital gold changing because of these changes to eth or you know what's your perception of how the merge is changing the institutional narrative around these two assets so i'm pretty certain that there's never been more institutional capital sort of willing and able to buy east in size um pretty pretty highly convicted around that and there's just a lot more on you know there's a lot less uncertainty around it and it's just gotten a lot bigger and you had you know defy and then you had nfts and gaming you've got multiple use cases that are happening on layer one smart contract platforms and you juxtapose that against btc's narrative which is as challenged as i've seen it in the five years that i've been paying attention to this btc did not really act as a cpi inflation hedge i never you can't find me ever saying it was going to but other people were saying that it was not an uncorrelated asset which i think was a pretty meaningful ding to bitcoin's value proposition because anybody that was pitching institutional capital to buy bitcoin had the page in their slide deck about how you could own historically just own a little bit of bitcoin in your overall portfolio allocation it would juice your returns and juice your sharpe ratio just by owning a little bit of it your risk adjusted returns get more attractive and now it's just been trading in line with with everything else but like everything is trading in line with everything else right like it's not just crypto that's been so tied to this you know the 60 40 portfolio like bonds have gotten smoked this year the 60 40 portfolio's had a very bad year so far and i think that really just speaks to you know this adage of don't fight the fed and it's all one trade and that those two things have just never been more in place than they are right now this is j-pal's world and every asset price on planet earth basically is is living in it so yeah all right well you know you sort of hinted at this earlier but i did want to ask you directly there's been a lot of activity in eth futures trading and i wondered when you looked at that trading you know what that indicated for the price of eth kind of post-merge and beyond yeah it's hard to say because there's there's some [Music] i would say meaningful amount of capital that is long spot short derivatives and playing for you know getting like a free fork basically and it's just kind of hard to know how much of the open interest in ethereum has that type of trade on versus you know just levered long you know the east pert basically and then there's on on on the east options side there's more east options activity than there has ever been before it just recently surpassed bitcoin options activity for the first time ever and you've got options dealers that are you know presumably selling calls to people that are bullish on the merge and want to get upside through calls and then those dealers have to go do something with that risk and it's it's i would say it's pretty opaque in terms of trying to get a sense of what you know if you're if you just think about all the different entities that are selling calls to the people that are trying to be directionally long eth into the merge through buying calls that whole universe of sellers of calls like what do they do with that risk like it's it's it's kind of hard to say you know they're probably sitting on you know some amount of spot ease but then they may go do things in the derivatives market that would make a lot of sense as well too because they're not obviously trying to just be naked short a ton of these calls so it's pretty it's kind of convoluted right now um yeah all right well another uh wrench that could be thrown into everything as you mentioned earlier is that the original proof of work chain may be continued it likely will be continued and there will even be a coin associated with it um eth w i think as the ticker and a lot of analyses say that this chain is unlikely to really gain long-term traction so i kind of wondered what your perspective was on trading this token who is it for who is it not for is this considered a long-term investment or a short-term trade what are your thoughts on that oh man a clean way to think about it is the percent of the market cap like eat proof of work like what percent of each proof of stakes value is it gonna is it gonna trade at you can go back and look at the bch fork for btc back in the fall in 2017 trading at you know i don't know it was like around 10 percent a little got a little bit higher than that for a little while and there's you know some reason to make that comparison i think this is it's pretty different this setup and and i think that the value of each proof of work is is probably going to be very heavily tied to like how smoothly does the merge go if there's like real problems with with the merge for some reason that's not my base case that you know they've been testing this thing extremely heavily for a long time but you just you know you never know right and in in this market i have no doubt that you know there are predatory actors in this market that if they see some sort of opportunity to cause some chaos you know i think history would tell us that that they would take that opportunity so if there's some kind of hiccups with proof of stake you know i think that that would directly translate into into eve proof of work but but other than that i'm i would be generally worried about the amount of one-way flow of just selling east w that people aren't interested in it it's a free dividend the bch story would tell you that the you know the best time to sell it is basically right at the beginning because it you know it bled out forever after that the market the market knows that so i'm it's going to be interesting to see just how one way you know the ew cell flow is yeah uh in terms of saying that you know this may have happened before you may not have read my book but um around the dao hard fork you know people didn't realize that the ethereum classic chain was going to keep going and some people were trying to buy it on the cheap and then once the token got listed then you're right then there was mayhem and i think people made a killing and i did find out that kevin joe was one of those people who was trying to get it um early on and he's one making a lot of noise about this for coming up um so as you've kind of sprinkled throughout your comments uh during our chat you have talked about macro affecting all this so here we are kind of focused in on you know all these things going on in ethereum but when you look at that bigger picture you know what do you think will be the impact post-merger how much do you think it might dampen any effect of the merge yeah i think you have a bit i think you have a big effect i mean if you if it didn't have a big effect you would be betting on a decoupling which like to my origin to my point of beginning this conversation about this being the the most significant catalyst in crypto history there's a chance it's significant enough to decouple but i wouldn't put like all my eggs in in that basket uh that doesn't feel particularly safe to me and so you know then that the macro setup that we're looking at right now is we're recording this thursday the day before jackson hole jackson hole is going to matter it's going to be nuanced would be my base case i think i think powell could say a couple things that lean dovish are a couple things that lean hawkish on the margin and that will have a significant impact on asset prices i mean that's that's what we saw at the at the july fomc meeting which wasn't like outright dovish but it was sort of dovish on the margin relative to how hawkish he had been for the number of meetings preceding the july meeting and relative to positioning and relative to expectations and you got this this lift in asset prices uh through the back part of july and the first part of august so i think it's going to come down to that much nuance again tomorrow and then sort of whatever happens there is going to affect you know it's going to inform the market's view of what's going to happen with the next fomc meeting which is on september 21st rate decision meeting so whether we go 50 bips or 75 bits in september there's a good chance that'll get sorted out from this jackson hole commentary and in between tomorrow and september 21st you've got the cpi print on september 13th which it looks like there's a decent chance is is going to be kind of lower and serve to further firm up this sort of like declining inflation growth trajectory that the market is looking for so that the market can understand the fed you know slowing down tightening that's kind of what i think that path looks like but then you have to overlay that with quantitative tightening you know rolling off the fed's balance sheet which is ongoing they've been running down the treasury general account since they started qe so it hasn't really had the the net tightening effect that it would have if if the treasury general account didn't have you know a couple trillion dollars in it and then the other really big thing is natural gas supply situation in the european union uh due to the ukraine conflict and electricity prices are already absolutely through the roof in the european union and we haven't even started winter yet and that is a situation that has the potential to get really bad in a hurry there are indicators you know you look at the euro the currency you look at peripheral sovereign debt yields cds just european equities in general the market's telling you that it is very worried about this and putin from what i can tell is in a strong position of power with this and i would guess that the west is trying to figure out a way to hand him what he wants in order to get movement towards a credible treaty in the ukraine conflict in order to not cause what looks like potentially widespread economic calamity in the european union due to due to natural gas prices come winter but they've got to figure out how to do that while simultaneously saving face uh on a global scale which is uh which is you know not an easy thing to do but but i think that that is probably the critical macro factor and and there is a there's a series of outcomes where you know that that fed timeline that i just i just talked about is you know negative enough and then this this gas situation in the eu is negative enough that this massive catalyst and the eth merge is either you know sort of price reaction is either delayed or just like canceled essentially because the overarching macro picture is just that bad and so it's just it's just kind of tough right here like it's like sh okay should eat thread the needle with implementation should ease value accrual hold should the fed slow tightening should qt not implode some corner of the u.s financial market should the global financial markets remain reasonably stable should taiwan not cause world war three should ukraine not hold the eu hostage or russia hold the eu hostage over natural gas and cause continent-wide economic collapse and potential collapse of the euro should all of that happen then east should work really well but that's a whole bunch of qualifiers and so that's like that's i think that's where we're at wow okay well that was definitely i mean quite the overview of factors there but i agree that you know a lot of things that are sort of unrelated to ethereum itself could really affect how the markets react after the merge so love to see what happens um travis this has been wonderful thank you so much for coming on unchained i enjoyed it thanks for having me don't forget next

stablecoin issuer announced it would stick to its decision to not freeze tornado cash addresses at least for now the announcement came shortly after a report from the washington post that alleged tornado was defying u.s sanctions on tornado cash earlier this month the u.s office of foreign assets and control sanctioned tornado cash a decentralized cryptocurrency mixer for allegedly laundering billions of dollars following the sanctions circle the u.s based entity behind the stable coin usdc froze over 75 000 in funds linked to tornado cash addresses however tether a hong kong-based company whose legal obligations to the sanctions are unclear has decided to take a different path as it has not yet frozen any assets related to the platform according to the statement released on wednesday tether has not received any requests from either u.s law enforcement or regulators to freeze addresses involved with the mixer unilaterally freezing secondary market addresses could be a highly disruptive and reckless move by tether the company stated still the company said it is in contact with law enforcement almost daily and also hinted that it would comply with regulators if it was asked to freeze addresses speaking of tether last week bdo italia the accounting firm hired by the stablecoin issuer to publish attestation reports revealed a 58 decrease in the company's commercial paper holdings at the end of the last quarter from the previous quarter the reduction from 20 billion dollars to 8.5 billion dollars in commercial paper holdings is in line with its promise to cut its exposure to those assets by year's end congressman demands answers on the tornado cash sanctions the news about tornado cash doesn't end with tether this week u.s congressman tom emmer sent a letter to u.s treasury secretary janet yellen demanding answers on the tornado cash sanctions representative emmer is an advocate of the crypto industry and has addressed many of the concerns raised by the community these sanctions are unique in that they were not levied against a person or an entity but against privacy enabling code he wrote after tornado cache was sanctioned alexi percev one of the main developers of the platform was arrested in amsterdam last saturday a group of 50 people gathered in the city's dam square to protest against the arrest and demanded perceve's freedom however on wednesday a judge in the netherlands ruled that pertzev must stay in jail for 90 days until the initiation of the public hearing ethereum merge's kickoff date is confirmed the ethereum foundation has confirmed september 6 as the date for the initial kickoff of the merge in a blog post the foundation wrote following years of hard work ethereum's proof of stake upgrade is finally here the successful upgrade of all publix test nets is now complete and the merge has been scheduled for the ethereum main net the transition to proof of stake is split into two upgrades called bellatrix and paris the first upgrade bellatrix is scheduled for september 6th at 11 34 am utc in the blog post the foundation included the links to upgrade the necessary ethereum clients a compulsory step for the bellatrix update to happen celsius bankrupt and embroiled in legal battles cryptolender celsius which is going through bankruptcy proceedings has filed two lawsuits this week the first one is against a former business partner prime trust which was providing celsius with custody services celsius is claiming that when it terminated the business relationship with prime trust in june of 2021 the latter did not return all the assets it was handling prime trust has allegedly kept 17 million dollars worth of crypto and assets and celsius is now asking those assets to be returned plus damages to be determined by the court the second one is actually a countersuit against kiefei in july jason stone kieva's founder had filed a lawsuit claiming that celsius manipulated the price of the cel token failed to hedge against kefi's trading activities as they had agreed upon and that the company's financial mismanagement had created an accounting hole of 200 million dollars now celsius is countersuing kiefei and its founder accusing them of stealing losing and laundering millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency through tornado cash as for celsius's financial health cfo chris ferraro said during a bankruptcy hearing call with creditors that the company will likely not run out of cash until the end of the year previously law firm kirkland and ellis had estimated that this would happen in october ferraro is now saying that celsius will receive additional funds from maturing loans savings on sales and savings on use taxes on mining rigs and it will be able to stay cash flow positive for the remainder of the year this week for my premium subscription i interviewed thomas brazil the founder of 507 capital who's been buying distressed crypto claims since the mount cox bankruptcy he had a lot of insight into celsius's bankruptcy and discussed the likelihood of its survival big name exchanges i voyager's distrust assets according to coindesk the distressed assets of voyager another bankrupt crypto lender are attracting some interest from the biggest players in the industry ftx and binance are reportedly among the companies exploring bidding for voyager's assets which will have to go through a sale following the chapter 11 bankruptcy voyager was allowed by a court to pay employees retention bonuses for up to 1.6 million dollars per the judge's decision the names of the approximately 30 employees receiving the bonuses will not be publicly disclosed on the topic of troubled crypto lenders coindust reported that ftx could end up buying block 5 for only 15 million after ftx gave block fight a 400 million dollar credit line sam bankman freed's company got the option to acquire block fi for up to 240 million dollars however coindesk revealed that the minimum price of the deal is actually 15 million dollars and that block fight is very far off from the goals established to be acquired at the maximum price and for the last note this week on all these bankrupt and troubled companies three euros capital liquidators got approval from a court in singapore to recognize the liquidation order in that country this will allow teneo the company appointed to liquidate three ac's assets to dig deeper into what happened with the hedge fund as it will be able to request access to all the financial records the case against nfts as securities a lot happened around nfts this week nathaniel chastain former head of product at openc filed a motion with the doj to dismiss the charges that he engaged in insider trading chastain is accused of defrauding openc by allegedly buying the digital assets prior to them being shown on the platform's homepage and then later selling them for a profit his lawyers are arguing that since nfts are neither securities nor commodities the charges should be dropped in addition chastain's attorneys made the case that their client wasn't concealing anything as every transaction was made public on the ethereum blockchain board apes hit the floor speaking of nfts the floor price of the border bill club or bayc nft collection hit its lowest since the beginning of the year it was even momentarily flipped by crypto punks the second largest nft collection by market cap this drop in the floor price caused concern about a major liquidation in the nft market because of a situation that arose in an nft lending protocol called bendao the protocol basically allows people to put up their nfts as collateral to borrow ether as the prices of the nfts were declining liquidations were on order and the risk of a death spiral was now a real thing to make matters worse ben dao started suffering a classic bank run as lenders lost their confidence in the platform's ability to repay them and decided to withdraw their eath however at the moment the issue has stabilized because the dow voted in favor of an emergency proposal to change its liquidation parameters the lending rates on the platform which had spiked to over one hundred percent at the time of the bank run now at three percent again in addition it looks like the recovery in the major nft floor prices helped as well in the past several days bayc's floor price has increased by more than 10 percent anyone saying that this is the next 3ac luna 08 housing crisis etc was being sensationalist the scale of the problem wasn't that big for the market said nftstatistics.eth the director of research at proof collective another nft project that saw great gains this week was the pudgy penguins ethereum nft collection which almost doubled in the past few days one penguin was sold for 400 eth this week around 650 000 lawsuit sparks solidarity in the crypto community youtuber bipboi crypto filed a defamation suit against another youtuber called atozi who had made a video on how bipboi promoted a crypto token that later failed on twitter atosi revealed that he was being sued and asked the community to help him with the funds needed to pay for the legal fees jordan fish most commonly known as kobe donated 100 000 usdc then ben armstrong the man behind bitboy crypto decided to drop the legal charges because he never intended the suit to be public it could be argued though that he dropped it because of all the bad commentary he was getting on social media the two hundred thousand dollars in funds raised will be returned once i have the confirmation that the lawsuit is officially pulled i will be refunding everyone who donated said atosi time for fun bits the latest strategy to 20x your money algon trading a popular crypto twitter
