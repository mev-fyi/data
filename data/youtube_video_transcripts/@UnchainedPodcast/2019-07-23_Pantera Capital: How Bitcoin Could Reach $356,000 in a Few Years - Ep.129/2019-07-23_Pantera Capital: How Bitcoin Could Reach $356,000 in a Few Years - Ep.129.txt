training Kraken is the place for you my guests for today are Dan Moorhead founder and CEO of Pantera capital and Joey Krug Co chief investment officer of Pantera and founder of augur welcome Dan and Joey thanks Larry thanks Dan let's start with you tell us how you learned about bitcoin and came to found Pantera so I've been investing in interesting disruptions over the last 30 years from Russian privatization to Argentine farmland or Tesla Motors and friends of mine Pete Berger and Mike Novogratz called and asked if I had looked at Bitcoin and my brother had introduced it to me about eighteen months before in 2011 but I hadn't really I read about on the side was really great and I really hoped it happened but I didn't actually do anything to help bring that about and we really got talking about it and got so excited that I basically spent two or three weeks reading everything that existed and back then that basically was a very short list of things you could actually find to read about it and came to the conclusion that it would be just a massively asymmetrical trade that you know obviously there's some risks or some ways that this project wouldn't work but if it did work it was going to disrupt the biggest things on earth payments wealth storage cross-border money movement all these really really important industries and even ultimately cash the world has a hundred trillion dollars worth of cash and most countries their fiat currency systems are terrible so their citizens really do want something better to use and so after about two or three months decided to launch Pentair Bitcoin fund yeah and I think that's the first crypto fund in the US and it actually just turned six years old so it's been a it's been a really while six years Congrats thanks yeah well it's so keep going so you you founded that like but why I like I just want to know I mean it feels like for somebody with your kind of experience that it was a real departure from what you knew so you know aside from I mean I guess you sort of explained you kind of felt like this would be really disruptive and a big opportunity but like but why do you think it captured your imagination so in a way that I well I don't know you tell me did did was that sort of similar to how you felt about previous investments so my previous role was as head of macro trading at Tiger management working with Julian Robertson and in that role my day job was trading things like dollar yen or you know they're very normal big liquid markets and if you think about it things like dollar yen it hasn't moved 20 points from 120 my entire career basically so you're trying to kind of scrape out little moves on these massive markets and that's essentially what the main part of my job was but my passion was always these little kind of funky disruptions I went to Russia when Gorbachev was doing glass nosed in 1990 and invested in Gazprom and it's voucher privatization in the early 90s and those are the things I did kind of as a little hobby on the side because I thought they were really interesting but they didn't kind of fit the big corporate mold that we were in and when I found in Pantera in 2003 we were able to do those types of trades as more of our you know more meaningfully you know raise funds to invest in Abu Dhabi and Dubai in Saudi equities in 2006 or 7 before most Westerners were there trades like that and always looking for ones that had you know many much more up so that upside than they did downside and then when I I saw Bitcoin it was trading at a 1 billion dollar market cap and that just struck me as just amazing trade that if it worked it be worth potentially trillions of dollars definitely hundreds of millions of dollars and if it didn't work hey could only go down a billion dollars so it's you know very low risk for the potential upside and since then now there's been all kinds of other new developments we began our first blockchain venture fund in 2013 investing in companies you know they're helping people use blockchain in the background and then there been other innovations like our pre-auction ico fund that invests in blockchain tokens before they're sold to the public yeah and one thing I want to mention which is just a really fun tidbit from your history is that you're also friends from Princeton with Mike Novick rats who you mentioned and also Joe Lubin both of who are huge figures in the crypto space so I find it pretty amazing that you guys have all landed in this industry and our big figures in it so let's turn to Joey now Joey you were on the show before and at that time you handled some really tough questions from me with grace thank you for that and you told us a bit back then about how you got in a Bitcoin and came to found augur so when do you usually just summarize that briefly since you already explained it but then also then kind of explain how you became co-chief investment officer at Pantera sure so for Bitcoin I I came across it in May of 2011 on an online forum called overclocked net and it was about how you could basically earn free money with your graphics card on your computer and so I started mining at the time the next month mal Cox got hacked the first time and then so I decided just kind of hold on to my Bitcoin and basically lay low until maybe late 2013 when I started getting excited about the space again thought that coin was cool for kind of the same reason standed it's this new kind of self sovereign money and then in 2014 kind of came across the theorem in smart contracts and at that point my view kind of changed and I began to kind of consider Bitcoin to just be this sort of digital gold in aetherium to be this platform where you could create all this sort of decentralized finance stuff that I thought was going to be kind of the equivalent of what the internet did to information but doing that to money and finance and so yeah I ended up started working on augur and kind of the fall of 2014 because I thought that she had this decentralized financial system what's the main kind of most important thing that you need that also benefits from blockchain tech and so Aughra the idea in a nutshell is basically it's a peer-to-peer platform that lets you bet or essentially try anything was kind of no-limit stuff can be anything from a presidential election to you know as a sports match and the way I got involved with Pantera is I'd known Dan and Paul kind of on and off throughout the years because of auger and because his face was so small back in in 2014 it literally was only you know maybe a hundred people in San Francisco who ever went to any of these meetups or anything so I kind of knew him from that and then I started talking to them again when Paul reached out kind of late 2016 early 2017 I was busy with something with augers I didn't respond for like six to eight weeks and then eventually I ended up meeting up with them and grabbing pizza we actually had a bunch of pizza lunches and after like the first two Dan started joining and we just kept talking about the space Paul I'd liked a lot of the investments I'd made on my Angela syndicate and so we just kind of kept talked back and forth and Dan and Paul basically decided that they wanted to bring someone someone on his co CIO who had you know built something in the space you understood kind of the technical challenges and what problems need to be solved and if somebody had done something from the kind of operational aspect and I thought that made a lot of sense and I also thought that for things like Aughra to succeed it pretty much everything else in the v5 space there needs to be a lot of companies and infrastructure and other problems need to be solved that are way bigger than any one company being able to solve them and so at Pantera we're kind of you know funding a lot of that infrastructure and you're still working on augur correct so how do you split your time yeah pretty much all my time is on Pantera for augur you know I hop on a weekly call with the team but take me like an hour and kind of we talk about very high-level stuff like what's the future product roadmap is gonna look like what the kind of future direction looks like what features should be worked on that sort of thing but I don't you know write software anymore for it or anything like that once in a while if I have a couple free hours on a weekend or something I might help you know solve like a really hard worth of a problem like we're trying to figure out you know how should markets be ranked on auger such that it's it's hard to manipulate the ranking and rank the market by liquidity or something that's something I spent a few hours on last weekend but other than that kind of one-off stuff the rest of my time is pretty much all Pantera both of you have quite a long view on the development of this industry how would you describe where we are in the cycle of the development of blockchain technology and the sector overall John say there's that great Gartner hype cycle it has the huge manic wave up where a small kernel of something very important gets people to be you know crazed about in the trough of disillusionment and we've already gone through two of those cycles in the six years that that we've been investing in it and I think people just need to keep that in perspective that this is a two decade long project we're actually 10 years into it but you know we still have another solid 10 or more years to go until this is fully fully fleshed out and for the people that use price as a proxy which is is not great but that's the human instinct the thing to keep in mind is there's if you ever go back and zoom out your lens more than a year Bitcoin as a proxy for the industry is always going up and you know I know from our own fund history it was only had one down year in six years and there's only been one year that Bitcoin in the calendar year has had a lower price for a low for that year than it did a lower low from the previous years and so we're always trying to look you know three to five years out and be thinking about where the industry will be then rather than you know worrying about these kind of manic you know phases of bubbles and then the crypto winners where everyone thinks that it's never gonna work and so between those those bubbles and winners where do you feel like we are now in terms of either what hat you know what has been a success so far and what still needs to be built and etc one perspective would be to grasp the price of Bitcoin logarithmically to take away the you know crazy exponential growth and it's typically a pretty consistent line and there's a few bubbles 2013 obviously Bitcoin is up 83 X year-on-year and then at the end of 2017 I was also a bubble it deflated so much that it at the beginning of this year and where the kind of the trough or the crypto winter we graph what it would be like if Bitcoin spent the next 12 months getting back to its trendline and then from there out just stated as trend and it's trend has been to grow at 235 percent compound annual growth rate and that put at the time bitcoin was three or four thousand that put Bitcoin at 42,000 at the end of 2019 which I know sounds crazy but essentially we're halfway back there it's it's right on the trendline and I think it's a good shot that by the end of the year we're we hit that and then if you just extrapolate that line out for another year at 122 thousand per Bitcoin and then one more year at 356 thousand and those sound crazy but our first research piece that we wrote on Bitcoin we predicted if we go to 5,000 and when it was a hundred bucks everyone thought that was totally nuts but these numbers in two or three years people look back and go oh yeah that makes sense and how have the investors interested in crypto changed over time you know what I mean so you started your fund in 2013 and I guess Joey had his you know had interest in this even before then so how would you describe the kind of demographics of the investors from back then and on through today like how they changed so it is changing in you know in the early days is it was Wall Street or tech professionals investing their own money in our funds so you know high net worth individuals but very sophisticated about this industry we now have 850 limited partners which is just a crazy amount of of LPS in our previous days we managed a billion dollars with maybe 50 different investors now we have just have an order of magnitude more than that we're starting to see that transition to more institutional management or institutional investors pensions endowments but that's a relatively slow change you know there's a there's a handful that have invested but most still have no exposure and that's one of the reasons we're still you know so bullish on the space that if 95% of institutional investors don't have any exposure to blockchain you just need five or 10% of those two to make an allocation over the next couple years to keep pushing the prices higher it makes sense I actually wanted to direct my previous question of Joey to about where we are in the development of this industry because you know it's obviously Dan you're coming at this from the financial background but Joey since you are you know you started kind of on the tech side of things I was curious to hear where you think we are in the cycle sure I think the thing about the crypto space is the tech is so new it's like the Internet in the late 80s to very very early 90s and so it's really hard to do lots of the things that people want to do and so you look at the use cases that have succeeded thus far there are things that aren't really price sensitive so the transaction cost doesn't matter that much and they don't require a much throughput so right now basically the only use case that's works so far is collateralized loans or peer-to-peer lending so things like maker compound Dharma none of the d5 stuff outside of that has really taken off and I think the reason is from the technology standpoint there's no three but so if you're young still does you know 10 to 15 transactions per second if you were to put that quantify that in like augur trades per second you can do about 1/4 of an augur trade per second so you can do every four segments you can do one trade if you look at a site like bet fair you know they have dozens of trades in a random you know English Premier League soccer match and so the throughput is nowhere near there the cost is very expensive if you think of financial markets you need to be placing cancelling and modifying orders to provide liquidity and each one of those actions cost quite a bit of money on the theorem and so it makes it's almost like an anti network effect you can't really get any adoption because of these reasons and there's one kind of other problem which is onboarding is still a pretty bad experience the way I describe it is you know imagine if we do it when you went to Amazon when it first came out they said first you know create a bank account at this other Bank take itself with your passport and then wait a week to get verified and you know wait another week to deposit limits raised that's kind of like buying crypto today and so these two main problems the scalability one and the omble need to be solved on scalability two years ago he asked me you know I would have said well I hope that it gets solved but I don't really know how it's going to be solved today it's much clearer so there are solutions that you know theoretically on paper the algorithms make sense they should work they should be able to be implemented at this point the text just being the software is being written that's a much better position to be in and there's a bunch of projects that are supposed to ship kind of by the end of the year even if only you know one to three of them actually ship I think it's gonna be a big thing for blockchain scalability because I think it's not gonna be linear like we're not gonna go from ten PPS to 20 to 50 to 100 it's gonna be more like 10 to a thousand in kind of one or two big phase shifts and then on the onboarding side there's companies like wire which is one that's in our portfolio that are working on making it so you can buy small amounts of crypto you pretty much get it immediately and which scaling solutions are most interesting or do you find what's promising yes I think I think the kinds that are interesting to me are ones that require minimal changes for the developer for developers because if you think of software development it's an inherently kind of like lazy activity in the sense that you're trying to automate as much as possible so you have to do as little work as possible so if somebody comes up to me as a developer and says hey I had this way to let your application scale but if they're gonna require a year and a half of work and rewriting everything to make it scale I'm just gonna be like no I'm not gonna spend my time on that a year and a half later things could look drastically different now somebody comes to me and says hey I have a way for you to scale it doesn't require you guys even your software at all it just requires making these small changes that you can do in four to six weeks that's an entirely different story and so if you look at projects that are enabling that kind of scale phase shift there's two in our portfolio there's one outside of it so those three projects are our Bertram blocks trout and Matic network and so Arbitron in thematic network what they do is they're creating basically side chains to aetherium so similar to kind of that old-school idea that blog stream had in 2014 except the difference is the theory since it's turning complete you can actually do all the things you need to send data back and forth between aetherium and these other chains and do it in a secure way and without requiring any sort of modifications on the exterior and protocol there so the reason why I block strange side chains never really took off is they remote if required Bitcoin to make a modification that the Bitcoin core dad has never got pushed through and so aetherium is different because you can just write that all in a smart contract so these things are already on test net their functional and testament and they're kind of polishing them up before they release main net versions and then blocks route if you look at that they're trying to solve scalability on the networking layer so the fundamental problem blockchains is that if I broadcast the transaction I broadcast it to seven to ten computers and I'm connected to those seven to ten broadcasted to seven to ten they're connected to this continues to happen until the whole networks aware of a given transaction blocks routes essentially pretty in a CDN so if you've heard of Akamai or CloudFlare they're basically creating a layer where you can kind of broadcast your transactions to those computers that everybody is connected to and it sort of cuts the number of hops down it's out later it gets shut down or censored or whatever you kind of fall back to the same slow system that we have today interesting yeah it sounds like those are really promising and there was one more that you said was outside why is that one interesting to you oh yes the magic network it's it's similar to how Arbitron works it's a little different in the kind of mechanism design but it's another sort of layer to scaling thing what's what's significant about these networks like our Bertram and Maddock is that they don't have any weird capital requirements so if you look at the past five years everybody on the etherium landscape has been talking about oh we're gonna use state channels or payment channels these sort of lightning might means a version of that on Bitcoin everybody says oh we're going to use that to scale that doesn't work for financial applications though and the reason is it requires excess collateral so like he told you know Dan when he was a trader at Tiger hey you're gonna have to over cloud analyze your position by 5x and there's no leverage so you're just basically putting up five hundred dollars to trade a hundred dollars and some underlying asset that would be crazy in no trader would do it it doesn't make any sense but that state channels work it's so what's significant about mattock and Arbitron is they get rid of this problem so if you're trading $100 position you only need to put up $100 and that's kind of a big improvement in the tech that wasn't really possible in the past and Laura I'd love to link your two questions you know you just asked about you know the kind of man X cycles up and down and the challenge is now and there was a time where people thought blockchain was going to change everything and to do it all overnight and then we realize you can only do seven transactions per second and the block was maxed out so transactions were no longer essentially free the rash really expensive and then everyone got super pessimistic I think a lot of the rally in the last six months is from projects like our trailing blocks route getting close to launching I was just out at the block route office in Evanston Illinois and they're doing 2,000 Bitcoin transactions per second so it's not like Joey said we're not gonna go from 7 to 10 to 20 we're gonna go from 7 to 2000 or something like that and I think that's when those things do go lives during 2019 it's gonna essentially blow people's minds and that's why it's at least a huge part of why I think the mark is rattling right now and one other thing I wanted to be sure to touch on was Joey's essay a crypto thesis which he published in January Joey can you just briefly summarize that it was kind of a long piece but you might want to just pick out you know your main points but then there was one question specifically I wanted to ask you about which was at one point in the essay you felt that you said that you felt that cash and payments would be some of the last financial areas to be disrupted and I was curious about why sure so kind of high level of the essay it's pretty straightforward basically the idea is I kind of tell a story about the printing press and the essay so if you look at how information has changed the first big innovation and information was the creation of the printing press it allowed people to basically disseminate information create books very cheaply and kind of spread them around the globe and afterwards you know you had radio television and Internet if you look at every information revolution besides the internet they only really transformed for the most part with the exception of the printing press they transformed a kind of consumption of content but they never really democratized creation of that content like most people don't author books most people aren't on radio most people aren't on television but the internet what it did differently is it transformed both sides of the equation so not only consumption of content changed but also creation of new content sites like YouTube Twitter Facebook etc basically democratize that and really kind of blew it up and so if you look at blockchain tech my thesis here is that we'll see the same thing but for finance and so I would argue for finance it hasn't really changed all that much since you know the Dutch were trading tulips hundreds of years ago and things have become electronic so trading is electronic but creation of new financial instruments creation of new assets it's always kind of been the realm of a privileged few and it's never really been easy to do or cheap or kind of on the same scale as creating say a tweet and so my view is that the same thing is gonna happen with with blockchain sex so if you want to bet on some real-world event you can create that market very easily easily if you want to take out a collateralized loan at 3:00 in the morning that may not be the best idea but you can actually do it on the theory I'm today and there's gonna be tons of applications that you know I haven't foreseen and that nobody else is foreseeing of this I think that's the high level kind of thesis and then you had to answer your question about why I think payments and in kind of money will be some of the last areas that are really transformed I think it's because it's just such such an entrenched market and there's other kind of higher inefficiencies in other areas so if you look at like betting or derivatives there's things where you can enable people to do things they couldn't do in the past or you can save them literally 10% in fees if you look at payments the fees are much lower it's really competitive the margins are razor thin if you look at Visa MasterCard Visa MasterCard actually use five from the most people know this they don't make that much the the banks in the middle are the ones that makes the majority of the Visa MasterCard interchange fee and so disintermediating that is is extremely difficult if you look at the pain I do think we're blockchain tech kind of immediately is going after area or merchants can't accept Visa MasterCard either because their fraud rate is too high or because they're on a list of merchants that you know if it's a MasterCard won't do business with but I think stopping that kind of those two entities which is what people usually talk about when they say crypto payments is kind of extraordinarily difficult yeah one other area might be rut Minton says to for certain corridors where the fees are really high but so speaking about money and payments what do you guys think about the announcement of Libre the sort of quasi stable coin that Facebook hopes to launch like what do you think the significance will be I think they did a great job you know walking this tightrope between the two extremes one extreme being totally decentralized totally you know independent and then the other one be completely centralized you know Facebook controlling everything and they have the foundation set up so that over time it'll grow to be decentralized and one of the I think the really clever things they did was to make it a stable coin backed by currencies that we all trust but the interesting bit is to do it as a basket of currencies kind of like the IMF Special Drawing rights so it's not just a US dollar backed coin is backed by the pound and which is the oldest currency in the world has been around for a thousand years the Japanese yen in the euro and that way it's it's has very low volatility with respect to the dollar but it's better for Europeans or for Japanese or for British citizens to use because it's lower volatility relative did their currency than it is to the dollar so I think they did a great job packaging it as a basket of currencies enjoy it your thoughts so we actually before we go to Joyce thought so so buy that what you mean is like that will help adoption in those markets as well because I guess like you know one of the common I guess observations a lot of people make us that crypto will probably not take off in the same way in developed markets because we are good functioning Financial Services but what you're seeing is that the way that they've designed it despite that sort of like obstacle like the fact that they made it a basket of these currencies and strong economies will help the adoption there is that what you meant yeah I think stable coins are great concept right tokens have incredible utility they can be transferred to anyone anywhere on earth real time almost free but the existing ones like XRP or theory or Bitcoin have incredible volatility relative to the US dollar or relatives of the British Pound so that makes it kind of dangerous and scary for the typical consumer to use it and so if you had the the promise of a stable coin is to have all the benefits of tokens but to have not as much volatility or if it's pegged to a specific currency like the US dollar no volatility against the dollar but a US dollar stable coin like circles coin has a lot of volatility against the British Pound or the euro or the Japanese yen so for people who live outside the United States they still have to deal with currency risk so this thing the Libre coin will essentially blend all those currencies together into a single SDR like basket which will reduce its volatility with respect to all those other currencies obviously it'll have some volatility with respect to the US dollar but it'll be better for the developed world as a whole and then it can be I think it's its other function is in the long run and this is definitely you know a decade or so it could become a reserve currency there's the reserve currency you know has shifted four or five times over the last five centuries always to the country with the biggest military might used to be the Portuguese Escudo and then it was the British Pound now it's the US dollar there really isn't any alternative in the Fiat space for an alternative reserve currency but you could imagine something like Libre a basket token ultimately becoming a place that countries can store wealth and that's not essentially the US dollar hedge monie and Joey do you want to give your thoughts on Libra and what the significance could be sure yeah I think it's I think it's super fascinating development in this fate it's it's something that you know if you told me 10 years ago I I wouldn't thought never would have happened it's kind of like almost something out of a sci-fi novel where a big you know group of multinational corporations decide to create a currency sitting it's a super interest I think it has you know it definitely has a long way to go in the cent and the development standpoint you know is that kind of ballpark napkin cloth it's like you know 10 to 15 percent done and with any kind of software project this is not only a software project it's also a finance project you know it's a the last 10% takes 90% of the time so I think it's got a really long way to go from from that perspective I think there's a lot of interesting kind of open questions that kind of solving are really interesting kind of fun challenges to think about like I think the biggest up in question from my perspective is you know there's this long term plan to transition to being a permissionless network how do you kind of incentivize the you know 100 validators to actually end up doing that and then also since it's collateral backed and there's collateral sitting around in the real world how do you ensure that you know the permissionless version actually has control over that collateral and that's interesting from a legal perspective like you may have to do something really creative from like a corporate structure standpoint to get something where you know people sticking actually do own the cloud at all underneath it if they don't it's it's I think it's a bit less interesting like if you don't solve that problem then it's it's not really a permissionless Network long term it's something that's the biggest challenge and if that if that couldn't be solved it would be super fascinating because it would be a global currency

legitimate investigations cipher trace is working on this vision of the future sign up to stay up to date on the privacy enhanced compliance initiative and receive authoritative crypto AML reports quarterly WWC fruit trees calm /keep crypto clean back to my conversation with Ann Moorhead and Joey Krug of Pantera one of the main issues that's cropped up time and again in crypto is regulation on the one hand compliance can help legitimize projects or products and also help and just ensure their longevity on the other hand compliance is costly and it can also cause companies or projects to move so much slower than their competition that that poses a threat to their survival and Jeremy a layer of circle and Fred Wilson of Union Square Ventures have actually spoken up quite a bit about this recently how do you guys advise your portfolio companies on how they should thread that needle and how does that catch-22 also inform how you make your own investments I think from the from the compliance standpoint you know we definitely encourage all the companies and projects in our portfolio to get good legal advice and seek good counsel I think one of the challenges in this space is that you know a couple years ago there was really lack of clarity on I'm pretty much anything that has changed a lot over the past two years there's clarity now from Finn said this clarity from from the SEC there's clarity from FINRA all these agents at this point kind of come out and and you know said something about how they how they view this space I think some of them worried and do you do you really think that there's clarity from the SEC yeah I think so I mean if you look at companies we've invested in pretty much nobody that I'm aware of in our portfolio anyway has done an IC o---- that wasn't under reg D or I guess since you know kind of mid 2018 all right well so is there more that you want it like so when you choose to make your investments how do you think about compliance do you and and how that affects competition you know like I feel like we're seeing this kind of happen in real time where coinbase sort of started as being but like I once wrote a magazine feature in them that was titled bitcoins blue-chip and then now you know they appear to have this different strategy where they're just listing all kinds of coins ones that go against their very own digital asset framework that they published where you know it's coins without a lot of volume and stuff like that and I you know they're they're maybe going more in the direction of by Nance but is that something that you guys think about as well when you're talking with your projects like how they can you know get market share but also not run afoul of regulation yeah that's something we think about a lot I think the probably biggest concept in which we think about it you know concretely it would be surrounding weather weather projects are doing things you and it makes them an operator it's been essentially unlike the more defy side of things if you're you know custody funds if you're processing payments if you do all these things that makes you an operator of whatever X is then that opens you up to to kind of a lot of regulatory burden its of trying to figure out things where where that's not the case I think is where kind of the the opportunities are able to be had if you look at somebody like coinbase you know we don't we don't think about that too much because there's no beer in our portfolio it really kind of falls into that category like we're investors impact for instance and they're not gonna go and you know list chain-link as an example you know they're gonna list Bitcoin and you know hopefully eventually ether and then maybe as a space involves you know there was some more assets kind of same thing for era sacks where investors at the moment and more of these institutional grade exchanges that are trying to I think with the next run of kind of cash for the institutional market yeah and you were investors in bitstamp which I believe got acquired but are you still working with them yeah we used to own 34% of bitstamp and we sold such that we now own 10% of its debt but we're still very actively involved with them and do you how do you it like I noticed that they only list Bitcoin Bitcoin cash aetherium like coin and XRP how do you or how are they thinking about which assets to list you know I think you're right that they've taken a a conservative approach to the compliance in this industry and I think they were the first firm to ask for full kyc for clients wishing to open accounts way back in 2013 I think way before any government agency you know required any exchange to do that and so they've tried to be very careful and it reminds you of a great quote that Jim Freeze who used to be with Vinson said maybe in 2013 or so he said that financial services are just different there's no beta release and that's a great line because in every other kind of startup you could do like photo sharing it really just doesn't matter you can just spin up some servers you know see what happens is some photos get stolen her hack nobody really cares but there are some potentially bad uses of money so you know the government really does need to to be sure it's being used correctly and so exchanges like bitstamp are trying to be very you know cautious and and you know very everybody knows the Silk Road guy was using bitcoins and he's arrested he's in prison not that many people know that there were actually two federal agents that went rogue who were being paid by US taxpayers to try and find the Silk Road guy who money laundered over a million dollars each across five big banks and one mutual fund complex in the United States doing things like writing 30 thousand dollar checks to cash paying off their entire mortgage in one payment which is not what a normal federal worker does and they did all these very very suspicious activities and none of the companies banks and mutual fund companies that were dealing with these two rogue agents filed any suspicious activity reports as they're required to it was actually to peer to peer companies venmo and bitstamp that that turn these in and I remember at the time I was the chairman of bitstamp and so I spent a lot of time in lovely Slovenia talking to the management team and they told me before this you know became public that they thought they had a federal agent laundering a million dollars on their their site and I was like oh man you guys watch way too many Tom Cruise movies that's isn't happening and so I went and looked at all the data I was like oh man this is pretty grand we do have to report this so we reported it to another agent we knew and he resigned that day and I was like oh that's not good so we reported to a third one and ultimately it got to Katie Hahn the prosecutor and the two pleaded guilty to a bunch of money-laundering crimes and her doing nine years in prison but that is just kind of that story I love it because it shows that companies like coinbase or bitstamp they really have to hold themselves to a higher standard then even you know big money center banks that you know well or big mutual fund companies that you know well oh that's interesting but but actually just to go back to my original question do you feel like by kind of taking the high road in this regard that that has hurt bit stamps market share and like ability to compete against the likes of finance and some of these other exchanges that list hundreds of trading pairs yes I mean that's obviously true that they've chosen not to take on trading and things that might be deemed to be securities by bodies like the US SEC or other countries regulators and so yeah they've taken a very conservative approach and in the short run they certainly have given up some profit opportunities but you could imagine that some of these exchanges you know for example you know BitFenix now is the subject of investigations by the New York Attorney General you could imagine issues like that in bid stamps taking a strategic decision - they've been in the business longer than anyone they're the oldest existing exchange and they want to be here you know 20 years from now rather than make a ton of money in the short run pantera invested in kin which is the cryptocurrency created by the company kick and kick is currently being sued by the SEC for conducting an unregistered securities offering what's your stance on the lawsuit we're not actively involved okay but you did invest at the time are you oh no we're in vest but we're not taking an active stance in the suit alright so okay so I guess I guess you haven't contributed to defend crypto and you you know don't don't have I guess any kind of criticism of the SE C's action or yeah we're investors in the project we think it's a great project but we're not active in the suit itself alright so everyone talks about how the methodology for valuing crypto networks is still being formed what technical aspects of blockchains do you tend to look at to see what's worth investing in I think there's really two types of two types of assets in this space and I think it's actually pretty similar to to traditional finance but the two types of assets are there's assets that will have a yield someday and so you can model a discounted cash flow for them and think about you know how much you think they'll be worth based on that and then those assets that don't and the assets that don't are going after things like digital gold and money those are the ones that are super hard to value if you look at Bitcoin you know you can say well I think maybe maybe the market cap reaches 50% of the market cap of gold in the next decade it didn't figure out what you think a big point is for us discount that back to present value and determine whether you should buy or not but it's not like you're you know building a revenue model for it on the other hand for something like maker you can actually do this kind of cash so people have done them they published them and you can kind of see well based on certain loan volumes and based on how much is kind of locked up in cap in collateral it's in based on whatever you think the interest rate will be you can calculate how much makers is essentially going to be bought back which you can model similar to a dividend they didn't even come up with with the kind of cash flow model for it and so I think people love to talk about how like crypto is impossible to value and it's so different than everything else I think the the kind of contrary an answer is that it's really not that different it's just that when people say that they're mostly looking at assets like Bitcoin or ones that are trying to be money which are very hard to value they're not looking at things like makerware where you contribute a cash flow to it and for the ones that are trying to be money I don't I don't think that necessarily will ever be a sophisticated valuation model for them until they're significantly larger so like if you look at Bitcoin it's entirely possible that there never is a good valuation model for it beyond you know the well I think you could be X percent of gold and there's only good valuation models in the short-term like if you look at gold you can do some modeling of it but it's really hard to predict the price of gold out over a you know a year time span you can do it over the next day over the next week maybe even the next month you can quantitative models but doing it over a year tons fans basically impossible because there's no cash flow associated with it I think that's kind of how I think about it yeah I'd add to that that you know I've heard some of my kind of stock oriented friends say hey I'm not gonna trade crypto because there's no cash flows to discount I have no idea you know how you can but I think about you know I've traded paper currencies for you know years and there's no cash flows to dollar yen or the Euro or whatever you're seeing how useful it is how many consumers want to use it and it's supply and demand that's basically what the price of Bitcoin is there's a fixed amount of them 21 million ultimately and as Joey said you know in the early days there's only a couple hundred people that cared about Bitcoin and you know a few years ago there's a million people that care now maybe there's 30 50 million some number like that they care about it and if 10 years from now a billion people care about it if the demand curve shifts up you know from 30 million people to 1 billion people and the supply curve is fixed or flat the price will just go way up and so that you know I wish we could say was you know more sophisticated and quantifiable but there is some of that some of it is is just the big picture supply and demand and how useful a currency is I happen to see that you guys um automate I guess a lot of the analysis as well and I noticed that one of the factors you look at a sentiment and I was kind of curious how that works because I feel like one thing that a lot of people talk about in the space is how there's rampant you know like Twitter BOTS and you know I actually don't know what all the little things are that people do too to automate a kind of positive comments or whatever it is that they're trying to to do on social media but how do you I guess how do you quantify that and also filter out some of the I guess fake sentiment yeah at this point we only have a very very tiny amount of our fund in in models that use stuff like sentiment like it's you know on the scale of basis points stuff like that isn't isn't super proven out yet and it's also really hard to scale up because the assets where that does work well like where it doesn't really work well are ones where there's not really good trading infrastructure to trade those assets across exchange is like if you look at tegami they support you know stuff from the top ten really well if you want to buy asset 47 on point market cap you know they just don't support it today and so you have to write all that in-house that it just takes a really long time to do and so but if but if you do look at the sentiment models like how you actually do it what they do is there's different ways you can do it but the way we do is you take like a bunch of data on Twitter so much of tweets and then you kind of do basic natural language processing on them to figure out for each tweet is it a neutral positive or negative sentiment just based on what words are in it and what order the words are in and then you can kind of sum that up and figure it out for a given time window of tweets about a given asset which you can find by like looking for Bitcoin you would search you know hashtag Bitcoin hashtag BTC I think even great a sentiment scored it's like the average of kind of all those tweets over a given time period if it's a sticker where there's a lots of bots then you have to do things to kind of filter out the bots by looking at you know at the age of a Twitter account what it's tweet patterns have been lots of thoughts you know don't have even profile pictures there's lots of little things you can do but even then it's still pretty imperfect and we don't really use them for very much of the fun all right yeah I was worrying about that because somebody tagged me and some tweet where there's like a gazillion BOTS going on it and so I've been getting a ton of notifications but it's pretty obvious that this is not real an engagement so anyway I was just like where is this coming from and how are you doing it in why but anyway I also want to talk about institutional money for a long time people talked about how this wall of institutional money was coming in and it's like almost embarrassing to bring it up now because that doesn't really happened but obviously as you guys have mentioned Pantera has invested in eras acts and backed and Dan I saw at a conference last fall you said that you thought that five years from now we'll look back and realize that backed infidelity were hugely significant and brought large amounts of capital into the industry so where do you think institutional money is right now and what impact exactly do you think we'll see from companies like backed fidelity and era sex I think having those institutional grade cftc regulated exchanges are really going to give institutions and more comfort to enter the market but again you know I think it's a it's not kind of a light switch to just flick on and we go from 3% of institutions having direct blockchain exposure to then 100% I think it'll be a process you know over the next few years but it's such a massive investor base that if we go from you know 5% institutional ownership you know to 15 over the next couple years that's a massive amount of money and we're seeing that with those announcements but then you also have things like one of the biggest advisors to pensions and endowments Cambridge Associates put out a positive paper maybe four or five months ago about blockchain suggesting their clients look at it we've talked to quite a number of the the largest endowments who are doing serious work a few have made investments directly in the space and the rest are trying to get get their heads around it and so I think you're gonna see most institutions take a look in you know five ten fifteen percent of them over the next year or so will make commitments and Dan you've also said a few different times that a Bitcoin ETF is not that exciting to you why not oh it's exciting it'd be great it's just I don't think it's gonna happen anytime soon and when we set up our Bitcoin tracker panther Bitcoin fund we looked at ETS we looked at a bunch of other different structures and we came to the conclusion that it would be a long time before an ETF was approved and that was six years ago I still think it's it's a while if you listen to the comments from the Chairman the FCC there's still you know questioning supposed market manipulation I frankly am not sure what that is and as a reason to not yet approve an ETF and if you look at one of the last major asset classes don't you think what he's referring to is the fake volumes that bitwise and some of the other companies have pointed out oh I think you know the fake volumes have been an issue that bunch of people talked about for a long time but I don't think that actually moves the price you you know just printing that you're doing ten times as much volumes you're actually doing doesn't in and of itself move the markets very much but the point I would make is the SEC has been very cautious as they should in in encouraging retail investors to invest in new asset class ETFs and the last asset class that got ETF certification was copper and it took three years and coppers been around for 10,000 years right so I just I've always been in as a belief that it's gonna take quite a while for an ETF to come out and that's why our tracker fund has all the benefits daily liquidity you can come in and out on any US banking day it's the lowest fees of all the products we know out there but it is technically set up as a hedge fund oh and so that's not available to the everyday person right it has a $50,000 minimum so you have to you know it's obviously for a higher net and net worth category all right one of the hotter topics this year has been smart contract platform Wars we'll aetherium 2.0 arrived before being undercut by one of the newer competitors can and other network convinced developers to move to a new ecosystem etc what is your take on how this battle will play out yeah think that we're the weird thing about it it's I think I think it is totally doable and the reason why I think it's doable to kind of unseat aetherium is if you look at a great essay called the cathedral and the bazaar and it's about how open stores projects are like a bazaar they you know kind of get everyone involved everyone's involved in making a decision where it's the cathedrals where you design something kind of in a closed room once that's a company or or an academic circle or something like that and the point is you can move really quickly in the cathedral and then once something's kind of pretty close to being done you can push it into the bazaar I think with the hiriam you know one mistake in hindsight was that they figured that they could solve scalability pretty straightforward once it was in the bazaar and it turns out that's really hard because you have to make a bunch of different trade-offs the simplest way to make this concrete is imagine you had a way to scale with yeoreum by a factor of 10 thousand times but it only had a 30 percent chance of success say even it had a 60 percent chance of success nobody wants to risk the you know whatever the market got this today at 1520 billion dollar market cap on something that only has a 60 percent chance in success but our new upstart can can kind of easily do that I think the problem with all these upstarts thus far has been you need to understand a bunch of different things really well to do it so you need to understand the tech and actually have a credible solution there you need to understand actually managing people and shipping and billing software projects you need to understand what developers and smart contracts actually need they need things like making it easy to write contracts and solidity making it easy to port their existing contracts over you need a bridge to aetherium people will probably initially migrate part of their contracts over to new chains and not the whole thing but migrate the part that's like needs scalability the most and so nobody has really released anything yet to date it kind of has all these requirements and the last piece is you need to be good at you know building communities in making people have awareness of whatever it is you're building but at this point today nobody even has all the technical requirements set that would make it possible to build something like maker auger or 0x on another one of these in theory on competitors and so I think there's a chance that this happens we've invested in a few of them but today it turns out that finding a team of people who kind of understand all these things and then also understand the merits of decentralization it's really hard and so the the challenge is you need a team that can kind of do all these things and then release it pretty quickly while developing it in the cathedral whereas aetherium 2.0 it's kind of moving along that is essentially the snail's pace but it's continuing to move along whereas these upstarts have much higher blow-up risk so that's kind of a two to two trade-offs I think it's like I think it's like a thirty to forty percent chance that somebody does it before aetherium and maybe a you know 20 to 60% chance that aetherium 2.0 is what ends up winning yeah I noticed that you guys had only invested in polkadot which isn't exactly a competitor to etherium you know I mean there are worries I guess that it could reduce the theorems dominance but but it's not quite exactly the same type of network so that's interesting that that you guys have not done that one thing I also wanted to ask about is ayios initial exchange offerings that's one of the newer trends from this year and actually prior to taping you guys sent me a chart showing that only 2% of your investments last year were done via ayios and that 82% of your investments this year have been through ie o is as opposed to I SEOs so why have you switched primarily to this new way of investing yeah so for us you know we're we're usually investing before the auction so for us we're kind of doing the same behavior what's different is the products that we have invested in the mechanism by which they're going live and tradable and most of them are doing these IPOs and the reason is I think one is it's a bit more natural it's kind of how traditional financial markets work it's very rarely do you see a direct listing you know slack was kind of an anomaly usually the entity you know sells some asset when they're getting listed and so in the case of ayios that's that's kind of the dynamic that's played out I think it's actually more a thing driven by the exchanges as opposed to the companies or investors in space so the exchanges have realized that if they just list an asset kind of like a direct listing it's it's rare that they actually get volume and so they said kind of ask themselves well how do we get volume for an asset and the answer is well you sell a small amount of it on the exchange at a cheaper price so that the people are basically buying something that has a very high probability of going up and then people will trade it after it gets listed and so I think that's why we've seen this kind of shift in market dynamic and it's primarily driven by the exchanges one of your portfolio companies flex a recently launched an app that enables people to spend crypto at stores like Barnes & Noble Nordstrom Jamba Juice and more but if you link back in 2014 and 2015 we learned that people aren't super psyched about spending their crypto assets on a coffee or a juice that could be worth not just four dollars but four hundred dollars in a year so why why what's the appeal of flexo for you yes dad you're behind Flex I know my view isn't really well you're gonna go spend your Bitcoin coffee at Starbucks it's more that it's sort of a Trojan horse almost right so they're not riding on Visa MasterCard rails they're riding on kind of rewards rails which are much cheaper and better for the merchants and so if you look at that you could have things like well you could pay in done or you could pay in Libra and so they're kind of an infrastructure company it's basically facilitating this and getting tons of integrations with merchants but I don't think you know you can pay at the coin dethroned it sure that's more of a novelty I think longer term in game would be you know they are one of those companies which is this thing I said that's very hard to do is you know trying to disintermediate inter mediate visa mastercard and i think reflects the kind of expected value of it made sense you know the odds are sort of stacked against them but i think if if there's a team that could do it i think it would be these guys Pantera is also invested in staked a company which users can delegate their staking duties to since they may not want to actually take on all the requirements that they have to fulfill in order to receive the yield that's available through stinking so I totally get why people would want to delegate their stinking butt made me wonder does that just like sticking as a service take the industry away from this ideal of this peer-to-peer financial system it does to some degree but I think as long as there's competition and to no one's taking provider has a huge share of the market I think that's fine the other piece that's really critical here is they actually don't have custody of your funds so you can basically withdraw your capital and Reese take it somewhere else pretty seamlessly and so it means that's gonna be a pretty competitive market there and that you know if they ever got too centralized I think somebody would kind of start an upstart competitor that you know maybe have lower fees or something and it's I think I think it's unlikely that any one player has you know greater than ten to fifteen percent market share in this space yeah I was going to say that you know staking as a service I think it could be a huge business proof-of-work is incredibly environmentally intensive and so I think most of the block chains that are developed in the future will be proof of stake and we've actually you know we invest in quite a number of them and we've done our own staking it's a huge hassle right like getting separate equipment and doing all the staking so people will want to have services that do that for them and the analog in the real world is proxy voting shareholders almost never actually vote their shares they have proxy companies do that for them and it doesn't matter that there's only a handful massive proxy companies if the proxy companies ever started doing something that was not in the best interests of the ultimate shareholders they would just switch to new proxy companies or take the voting services back and that's the way I see staking as a service that staked the company that's in our portfolio as long as they're behaving in a way that their ultimate owners of the tokens want to have these states they'll gain business and if they ever do anything that removes the trust of their clients their clients are going to either take backs taking themselves or move on to companies that do it the way they want all right going forward which trends do you guys have your eyes on in the crypto space we've actually still I've been investing in some exchanges there's obviously some huge opportunities on the institutional level like with backs and Aris X and in there a handful of countries that that are massive potential users of crypto so we recently invested in bit so last year exchange in Mexico so we're still building out our exchange investment space we've invested in scaling solutions we've talked about a couple of today stark where was another one that we've invested in a year and a half ago that are gonna help this bottleneck of the throughput all right well where can people learn more about you at both of you and
