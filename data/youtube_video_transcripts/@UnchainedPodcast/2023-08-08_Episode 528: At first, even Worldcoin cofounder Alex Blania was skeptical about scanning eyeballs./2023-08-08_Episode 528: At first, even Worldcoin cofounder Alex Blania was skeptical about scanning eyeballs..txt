kyc was a terrible idea for a lot of reasons because it's I think it's the antidote to what crypto actually is trying to do but then also it's not at all inclusive so you really could not do that web of trust things can become promising once you have a large number of verified users with something like World ID that you can build it on top of but it's really really impossible to bootstrap and so we threw it away too and then within Biometrics we came to this like heart inside that we cannot use phones and we cannot use fingerprints or face because of kind of the uniqueness requirement is just not fulfilled if you even go to building users and so we had to go with Iris recognition which is the only thing that actually works on that scale then it's it's proven that it works um and you can implement it privacy preserving of certain launch proofs and of course my first reaction was like holy this is gonna sound like very very scary um
