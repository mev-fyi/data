is the person who makes the show sound just as good as it does at least when we're not faced with factors beyond our control like AWS outages and I would not be able to put out this show without him especially now since I produce it independently so thanks Chris for doing such top-quality work helping me with every last little thing and for being an all-around awesome person apologies in advance for the background noise that you're likely to hear today we're meeting in person and this was the best room we could find but we're probably definitely going to hear some footsteps and maybe even some voices or other noise in the background my guest today is meltem Damaris director of development at digital currency group a member of the World Economic Forum's Global Future Council and blockchain and an advisor on future commerce at MIT Media Lab welcome meltem hello Laura so listeners just a heads up that meltem cannot talk about DSG's bitcoin ETF filing which I anticipate some of you might be curious about so unfortunately I will not be able to ask her any questions about that but she's been very involved in the development of Bitcoin and blockchain so meltem tell us what it is that DCG does and describe your role here absolutely so digital currency group it is really our mission our goal as a company to accelerate the development of a better financial system I don't I say better I mean more open more inclusive more efficient etc we do this by investing in building buying supporting Bitcoin and blockchain technology companies leveraging our insights our network and our access to capital so what that means specifically is we do a few different things here at digital currency group what we're probably best known for is investing in companies so to date we've invested in over 100 Bitcoin and blockchain companies across 27 different countries which has been so wild right we've invested in over 100 companies across 27 different countries which is just phenomenal to see and they're all in the Bitcoin and blockchain space so we're very focused we also have city areas operating companies including coin desk a media events and research company Genesis global trading which is an institutional trading firm that faces off against hedge funds family offices large institutions that want to buy and sell digital currencies and then the last one is grayscale which is an asset management business that has two products currently one is the Bitcoin investment trust which is a vehicle that enables retail investors to invest in Bitcoin and the second is an aetherium classic trust and we just launched our newest subsidiary DCG Connect which I'm very excited about which aims to can to enterprises and startups who are working on blockchain platforms Oh interesting so tell us more about DCG connect absolutely so one of the things that's been interesting about my journey through the world of blockchain I I started in my role really spending a lot of my time working with our portfolio companies as they were formulating strategies to go to market as they were thinking about growth and obviously our industry two years ago looks very different than it looks today so there has been a lot of lessons learned through that process and we really viewed DSG's most valuable asset being its network all right the relationships we've created over time we really want to be at the epicenter of this industry and to be able to bring different stakeholders to the table to help advance all of the different things that need to happen whether it's regulation whether it's developing relationships commercial relationships between large institutions and startups whether it's ensuring there's a lot of investors who have capital they're willing to allocate to companies we really want to play a formative role in that process so over the last two years working with these hundred portfolio companies what we found was so many of them were having the same challenges and the challenges are really number one how do I communicate what this technology is it's very difficult when you first start learning about blockchain there's a lot of high-level talk about blockchain and its potential use cases and then there's a lot of really deeply technical information but there's really not much actionable information that you can get around what the technology is what the products even are and so it's a very challenging space to navigate the second is our network so we've built this phenomenal network and we want to bring other people into the ecosystem help other people connect with the right partners more quickly there's a lot of blockchain tourism that happens where people will go out meet with startups and our companies don't have the resources to be spending an hour with each different corporate and doing that over and over and over again and so we really started to look at this and say is there a way that we can build this network so that we can help make that process more efficient it's also really confusing I think for corporates who come into the space and they start talking to companies and there's all these great ideas but you have a really hard time figuring out who actually does something around the use case I'm interested in how do I find that person it's a very interesting fragmented ecosystem we're part of so we really wanted to use our network to create that conduit and make it a bit more efficient and then the last is really related to application so this is aspect I'm most excited about is today there are all of these different platforms around blockchains there are private blockchains there are public open block chains their permutations of that there are different platforms that startups are developing enterprises are developing and each of these platforms or protocols has developed their own application ecosystem around them some of these are developed just by the company that's built the protocol some of them like the hyper literate project are more open and lots of people are using that platform to build their technologies but the problem again is all of these technology communities are separate and distinct and really what we want to do is to enable more robust application ecosystems to develop around all protocols but also to start connecting some of these ecosystems so that companies aren't having to choose between developing on one protocol or another and aren't having to make these really challenging design choices and sort of affiliation choices when they still haven't really identified what their product is yet so how do you do that exactly they come to you and then do you sort of act as a consultant like you kind of find out what their needs are and then you say like oh we think that this protocol is gonna be right for you or no so I think again we don't want to be a consultant or or or a sort of advisor really what we want to do is when companies come to us they tell us what their product is with our use cases what type of partners they're looking for to start to validate the ideas they have around their product what we want to do is to be able to point them to communities that they can participate in whether it's something like the hyper ledger project whether it's something like Enterprise etherium whether it's something else and start to connect those dots for them and ensure that they're part of the relevant dialogues for the particular use case they're interested in because there's so many consortium projects that are springing up it's impossible to keep track of it all and so by connecting those parties we've found in the past over the last two years it's really been one of the most valuable things we can do what was it like when you joined in April 2015 versus now how would you sing the industry and your role have changed oh that's good see we have five hours so 2015 I I actually got into Bitcoin around 2011 kind of played around with it but like many people I was like oh this is interesting I thought philosophically was really interesting but I didn't really hear about it I heard about it through my brother who is a computer programmer and a geek like me I'm a huge nerd so he mentioned it to me and I went online to read it just started kind of digging in as many people did in those days and I thought it was just fascinating to see this grassroots sort of ecosystem developing but there wasn't really much happening at the time you had to buy Bitcoin through local bitcoins or you would mind them yourself and I was like oh this is so interesting and quirky and weird and at that point Bitcoin was also very ideological and it was just that is fascinating but I'm not sure that i 100% identified with everything that was happening in in that community so fast forward to 2013 I was in graduate school at MIT and I might he was actually placed where there was a lot happening around Bitcoin there was just this really active student group that was mining Bitcoin in their dorm rooms they were setting up Bitcoin faucets I think they got sued by the state of you see or something just crazy but very cool stuff and then in 2015 I think Bitcoin really had that first aha moment and there have been many sins where you started to actually see platforms and products developing that we're moving beyond just facilitating the buying and selling of Bitcoin or the storing of Bitcoin but people are actually starting to build really interesting products on top of the existing Bitcoin infrastructure and so when I met Barry and started learning more about digital currency group at that point we had invested in only 40 companies we were still quite small but also digital core currency group wasn't really even formed yet and so just getting to be a part of that process of really conceptualizing and thinking about how do we build this new concept how do we build really as UD CG is more of a platform we have all of these different ways through which we work towards our mission which I shared earlier but it's evolved so much I remember my first day of work we met with MasterCard who ended up becoming one of our investors and it's just a fantastic supporter but I just remember that first meeting you can see the confused looks in people's faces where they're like what bitcoin isn't that like weird Internet money what does Bitcoin have to do with us so in 2015 I think institutions corporations were just starting to learn now we see you know there's just this massive interest this blossoming of interest in what's happening with blockchain how people can apply it to different use cases but we've also seen there are so many more products and companies that are being developed some of these companies are now starting to find traction they figure it out their business model they've identified the right product market fit and so it's not even comparable now when I tell people I work in Bitcoin and blockchain they know more about it than I do I totally see what you're saying in terms of this evolution it's it's been really interesting even in the short time I've covered this but like how has that changed kind of like DCD strategy or even its overall goals like it seems you mean for a while that it that you guys were kind of focused on building a lot of crypto exchanges around the world but I think that maybe that shifted how would you characterize you know what that strategy said yeah absolutely so I think it's important to go back to where we were in 2013 so in 2013 coin base launched and why this was really the first time at least here in the US that you could buy and sell Bitcoin on a safe secure platform using a bank account that we hadn't really been possible before and so you started with coin base and then all of these companies around the world those exchanges you're referring to in countries like India the Philippines Argentina Kenya all of those companies had to be built first that core infrastructure layer had to be developed so we started really with the protocol itself needed to be developed over time and then there were new protocols that emerged like the cerium the cash rootstock ripple then on top of that you needed the exchanges the on and off ramps into digital currencies and then those exchanges had to work together so a lot of what we did in 2015 was ensuring those exchanges all knew each other helping them set up relationships helping them connect their platforms which has been a really important aspect of building the infrastructure needed that on top of those exchanges we started seeing payments companies emerged for example wire which enables you to send SME payments from the u.s. to China or Veeam very similar model these businesses needed that network to be able to build their businesses that wasn't really impossible until 2015 when we had all of these companies that were building banking relationships that were enabling people to move money into and out of fiat then on top of the payments companies we started asking okay we have digital currencies we're digitizing assets what about identity how do we deal with digitizing identity and so that sort of became the next wave of investment we started looking at then on top of that we started seeing a lot of use cases around distributed Ledger's right so if I have this digital asset and I have a Detroit entity associated with it how do I track that asset through its lifecycle so we saw a lot of companies emerge using the registry component of the blockchain and then from there I think in late 2015 early 2016 we really started branching off into all of these new very much Edge's cases around aetherium you know finally launched in 2015 and now you've had smart contracts that people started playing around with I think it's really just been a gradual evolution where each wave of companies of themes is building off what's happened in that prior wave of innovation and so it will continue to take time but I think watching the evolution and really understanding some of the infrastructure that was necessary to get to where we are today is something that most people don't really think about or appreciate and so another thing that I'm really curious about is um how is your perception over what uses use cases will take up how has that changed over time like what are some things that you thought would take off that happen why didn't they and then what were you may be surprised that did take off yeah that's that's a really good question I haven't asked myself that so I think the use case everyone thought would take off with Bitcoin right Bitcoin for global payments we had a lot of companies in 2014-2015 that were enabling merchants to access Bitcoin and we really thought Bitcoin would become a new global currency that a new payment rail a new payment network and I think that use case has been slower to materialize I think things are changing now a bit and with ripple being very successful at bringing banks on board and demonstrating the efficiencies that are shared letch can create but I think there were many businesses that were built on this concept and I don't think people thought it would take so long frankly so that sides been very challenging and he thinks that have taken off that have surprised me I continue to be surprised amazed at how much enterprise blockchain product is out there and not just that how willing enterprises are to engage with this technology which has been interesting although there continues to be this tension between digital currencies and just pure blockchain technology with no Bitcoin digital currency component which is really fascinating tension I can certainly understand why I think there's been a bit of a narrative challenge around the digital currency side but it's really amazing to see our companies working with some of the world's largest institutions on projects that actually touch the core business and so it's been really rewarding just to watch these entrepreneurs who've been working on this for so long who's been trying to be down these walls for so long it's actually starting to happen and what do you think is kind of gonna be the like the first real tangible thing that consumers are feeling out of all that activity because you know as you know both from I think last year's consents and even this year is like there's all this talk about different proofs of concept and keep much talking about like oh when we get to production and this is the everybody was saying that we're gonna do that we're seeing like a few precious here and there but like I don't you know I when I talk to people about what I'm doing they're kind of a little bit like oh and they really don't see how to can affect them so what do you think will be the first project we'll see I think the first project we'll see will be something around likely digital identity I think there's a lot of challenges with identity it within organizations today specifically how you verify authenticate attest we're already seeing organizations getting really interested in using blockchain technology to enable a new way to interact with our customer or other stakeholders in a specific value chain of which I think digital identity is kind of that first element if we're using a shared ledger how do I positively verify that I'm the person I say I am that I have the controls I should have etc so we're seeing a lot of our companies doing really great work they're particularly net key has been doing extremely well as those blocks tack and tirion and they just announced that they're working with Microsoft on a new decentralized identity sort of nonprofit entity which i think is very cool it's a very new type of partnership we haven't seen before I also think on the enterprise side there are just so many frictions associated with Global Payments I used to work in corporate Treasury at Exxon Mobile and it was it was just mind-boggling to see the amount of money that was being sent between the parent company and all of its affiliates all around the world it's extremely inefficient to move money around our world today to move value around our world today and there's a real business driver there if you can shave some cost out of those transactions within an organization that can start to become a very material cost savings over time but it can also enable very new business models where all of a sudden you don't need to have all this working capital sitting in bank accounts in different places in the world so I see ripple actually making a lot of very exciting progress with a member banks they're working with but also just starting to really promote the use of XRP as a truly global borderless value transfer mechanism that's interesting to me um that came out of nowhere I did yeah but it did and at the same time I think because were investors in in ripple and having met the team there and knowing what they were working on it was not surprising I think the shift back to ax RP has actually been a really material part of that that changed they're now starting to build an ecosystem again this is all about network they're starting to now create a network around xrp there's a lot more people who are interested in and looking at it and so once that network that ecosystem develops you could very well see an entire wave of companies get created that are building on top of ripple I think that's just so cool so you kind of referred to this earlier you were talking about like the different aspects of infrastructure that need to be built out what else do you still think needs to be built out in that respect that says the infrastructure side is actually decide I personally am most interested in I think one of the challenges with digital currencies and blockchain technology is when people speak about it I sometimes don't know what they're saying I think again there's a lot of people who have high-level visions of what this technology could do 10 15 20 years from now once fully deployed at sound we have these large networks that are that are alive and in production but I think today a lot of the infrastructure just hasn't been developed yet and we're starting to see that is creating real pain points because the challenge is if you go out and you say for example I'm really excited about a trade finance use case for a blockchain I want to use a distributed ledger for that and you go out and you try to build that you'll have to get one company to help you with the digital identity component you have to get another company to help you with the government's component of how you're going to govern your network then you need to figure out what protocol you're going to use to run your network what platform it's going to sit on you have to figure out who's going to do the systems integration there aren't that many systems integrators today who are doing work around this you need to figure out what the end-user application is what that looks like there are all of these different components that you need to fit together it's almost like taking a Lego pieces and trying to fit them together and again the challenge is how do you figure out what LEGO pieces you need how do you figure out which ones fit together that hasn't really been created yet there aren't really product categories in our industry so one of the things we've been working on is creating clear taxonomy and sort of to identify and figure out what does production-ready blockchain architecture look like and what are all the different design choices you're making what are the different products you're piecing together and what exists in those categories today but then here's the really interesting thing if there isn't something in a particular category could we create a business or could we get one of our companies sort of to pivot into that or can we work with our corporate members to figure out how we can build around that space and I think that's where you see companies like AWS really actively starting to take an interest companies like IBM who are seeing all this activity happening they're going to be the ones who support production level blockchains right they're gonna be the ones supporting enterprises and so I think they're really trying to identify how do we work with startups for building on our infrastructure and how do we create a business ready ecosystem so that when people come in with a use case we can quickly help them deploy that technology and you also brought up regulation what are the challenges of helping all the different companies in your portfolio when there isn't necessarily clear regulation or it's - it's conflicting in different jurisdictions sure I think a regulation is really challenging for everyone I do think all of the companies in the DC G family are have good relationships with regulators they're very proactive I think the industry actually thanks to the hard work of organizations like coin Center have been extremely proactive at going out and engaging with regulators and just for the listeners that was a previous episode I did with Jerry Brito and Peter Van Valkenburg and I will reference that the show notes it was a great episode there fantastic work they do is just fantastic it's very much needed and I think there has been a great dialogue that's been developed between various regulators and companies who are working in this space to try to remove some of the uncertainty around regulation and I think that's really the biggest thing if you don't have a clear regulatory framework for your business it's kind of like building on quicksand and then there's that fear that a regulation may get triggered some may happen that all of a sudden completely disrupts their business model so what are like some specific challenges right now where you're kind of like oh it would be helpful if Nina the regulators did X Y or Z yeah I think the biggest challenge is really around Bitcoin companies digital currency companies getting bank accounts that's really really the biggest biggest challenge if you don't still even now even everyday this is a problem we have operating accounts but more importantly transactional accounts or you can actually transact with your customers really challenging to obtain by more importantly really really challenging to maintain and so this is where I think as an industry and one of the dialogues have been having a lot is would it be possible to create a self-regulating organization can we as an industry sort of develop a set of best practices and start to self-govern to sort of create that relationship with regulators to show banks that we are being very forward-thinking in how we're sort of viewing the role of Bitcoin digital currency companies in the global financial system getting audited by professional auditing firms having data aggregation around market structures to sort of ensure that there isn't too much risk in in the way the digital currency market is growing and evolving there's a lot of risk of sexualization of digital asset exchange on specific platforms and I think I don't know what you need my net centralization wouldn't we mean by that yeah what I mean is there's a lot of systemic risk if you have awareness of being hacked or something right but even the risk of a disruption of service so today if 70% of the volume of trading happens on one platform that's really problematic for the industry right if all of the companies in the space rely on four or five key banking partners and one of those making partners has a bad interaction with their bank regulator their bank examiner all of a sudden you should have you know 20% of the companies in this space out of a bank account and you can't operate if you don't have a bank account so this is this is still a challenge I think it will continue to be a challenge but I do think industry leaders are all working together we a DCG are certainly constantly engaging with our companies we're constantly meeting with regulators really just trying to get the narrative out there but starting to look at okay if there isn't going to be regulatory clarity what can we as an industry do let's research kind of best practices let's find the most stringent regulation and apply that across all jurisdictions so that when the regulators do come to the table we'll have a precedent in place who interesting okay so hold that thought we're gonna break now for an important word from our sponsor on-ramp with so many companies vying for people's attention now it's important to stand out from the pack if you're looking to become a go-to brand that linkers and consumers minds check out on-ramp a full-service creative agency that helps appliance maximize brand awareness gain market momentum and accelerate growth on-ramp has helped numerous companies do everything from create their branding an identity to redesign their existing website to draw more traffic plus they've helped blockchain startups and projects whether you're launching your brand or repositioning an existing organization or just wanna freshen your company's look on ramp can come up with a tailored design project or a strategic marketing plan that ensures your firm's lead in the market learn more and see examples of its work at think on-ramp comm I'm speaking with meltem to mirror's director of development at TCG digital currency group so um but there is something that's been kind of interesting that's been going on which is and you know as we talked about there's like a lot of enterprise watching stuff but we are starting to see that some of these incumbents are getting into digital assets where do you see this trend coming from and where is it going yeah absolutely I think going back to the conversation we were having a few minutes ago one of the challenges is what is ready to go into production right if you're an enterprise and you want to do something around blockchain you have budget you have enthusiasm in the organization around it what's ready to go today it's digital currencies it's digital assets this is already happening in many places around the world so I think as institutions look at what's happened digital currencies they start thinking about hmm okay even if we're not on board with the idea of digital currencies like Bitcoin and aetherium and ripple we are on board with the idea of digitized assets so a very interesting project the CME Group just did with the Royal Mint and one of our portfolio companies vinco is focused on digitizing old and then enabling people to hold and store that gold in a digital wallet and so I think what enterprises are looking at it's really the concept of how you do that is really challenging and they can actually look directly at the analog of digital currencies to figure out how to do that so how do you get an asset onto a blockchain that's question one right so a lot of these companies are really starting to think about okay who issues these assets how do we get them into a blockchain or distributed ledger how do we facilitate storing of those assets in a secure protected way right using multi-sig to hopefully what does that mean in terms of the hardware we need to run internally what does that mean in terms of the hardware our partners will need to have then once that trading begins what are sort of the platform's we're going to use to facilitate the trading of these digital app sets and as I'm talking through this you seeing so many analogs so exactly what's happened in the digital currency space it's very similar it just happens to be in a closed network with a defined set of participants rather than these open networks that we have in digital currencies but I think as companies start going through that narrative they start engaging with companies who traditionally been in the digital currency space who are now realizing there's a tremendous opportunity to help organizations think about digitizing various assets they have and creating new marketplaces to facilitate the exchange of the specific assets and so speaking of digitized assets um tell us a little bit about you know kind of the investment thesis behind the etherium classic investment trusts why is it that DCG supports if you're iam classic as opposed to aetherium so I want to start by saying DSG's supports aetherium and ethereal classic there is no sir active choice to say we're not supporting aetherium I think our perspective is is twofold from a technology perspective from a protocol perspective from a product perspective we certainly see a lot of really interesting projects being built on top of Assyrian we talked to theory and companies constantly we've invested in a one so far but we would have readily invest in in many more so I want to separate the protocol from the token so we see a lot of value in people building on top of cerium from a financial perspective so we have chosen to invest in ETCs nerium classic because of immutability right what happened after the dow hack was concerning and the fact that you could fork a network and make a major economic decision as an investor looking at this soothing investor lens i think is very hard as an institution to get comfortable with that idea i just have a real challenge seeing cerium being a store value currency if that type of activity is possible so to us was happening in the etherium classic community there's a lot of discussions around you know they've set up a cap now in the number of tokens that will be issued which i think is important from a again an investment thesis perspective there are two development teams that are working side-by-side to sort of continue to advance and develop the protocol there are now companies starting to build on top of the etherium classic protocol so from a token investment perspective that's where our mindset comes from but a gun from a protocol perspective I think there is plenty of room for people to build on top of either aetherium or aetherium classic and I do think it's cerium the token has utility right if people want to use it to fuel different applications or that's running on top of a cerium great from an investor perspective I think it will be very hard to go to a Wall Street institution and talk to them about aetherium given what's happened in the past et Cie is something that they and identify with that I think is is more analogous to other assets well does DCG worry about potentially kind of alienating the etherium community you know I don't know how it is that they're taking kind of your support of etc' as an investment vehicle do you get a sense like if I mean if you still do support kind of gave their in community I wonder if if not something that you need to manage absolutely I I attend aetherium events regularly and I know a lot of people who are working in in both the etherium space to end on a theorem classic again I think there's rooms for both protocols to be successful as we've seen both tokens have been successful we don't aim to make any value judgments we are making strategic choices as investors right as investors in technology products and companies build on whatever protocol you want really want to be agnostic but from a value investing perspective from a token perspective we did our analysis we looked at aetherium and we have made the decision as a firm that aetherium classic makes more sense from unit that's it doesn't you know why is it that we see that aetherium is rising so much in price but either classic isn't I think both are rising and Volker Tiffany where's Andy obvious is a fraction of values Cheryl of course it's also much younger it's a very new concept they're still sort of pulling the community and the ecosystem together I think aetherium has been a really great platform it's gotten a lot of people excited about blockchain technology and digital assets so I think it's fantastic I think there's a guide punty room for both what's contributing to theory M's rise I think frankly a lot of it is speculation I talked to a lot of my friends who have never heard of Bitcoin who are not into crypto at on they're like oh I bought a cerium I bought ethers they don't know what the technology does nor do they care they just see people making a lot of money speculating in a cerium and so they want to get in on that and Justin but I feel like this thing has happened coin you you don't sure okay I definitely think so again we're in this new era it's funny I was having this conversation with some exchanges who've seen their volume just go through the roof right it's absolutely wild we're in this unprecedented time it feels very strange everyone's you know doing extremely well and actually people are growing at an unsustainable rate or some of our companies now are thinking about should we create a wait list like how many customers can we actually onboard every day because the demand is outpacing our ability to build that infrastructure right it's really wild it's really fun it's a little bit scary but I think overall yeah speculations a huge part of it greed is driving a lot of this behavior if someone comes student says hey I bought this thing I bought a stock right it was a dollar a year ago and today is worth $100 you're gonna be like oh that's interesting I want to get in on that that type of activity that those types of returns appeal to certain types of investors who are more comfortable with high-risk high-return investments so I think we're seeing a lot of that type of investors moving into the space and I think it's it's great I always tell people don't put more money into digital currencies than you're willing to lose right always always enable 2fa don't keep your coins on exchanges keep them on a hardware wallet that you own like manager on keys and your own bank and so I think the people who are getting into it they don't know what they're buying they don't really care what they're buying I don't think they just are having fun speculating alongside the rest of us nerds but they're really not that engaged with the actual applications and platforms I think that will start to change over time but I think right now people are just excited about the crypto boom and they want to get in and get in early but I would be curious maybe so much to do a poll to see how many people who buy aetherium Bitcoin name your and see I don't want to single out anyone if they actually know what they're buying I would speculate that probably 50% of investors may be even more having no I doubt that they're actually you got it right um and I actually I just want a reference for listeners who don't know she said TFA which is two factor authentication it's when you're locking in somewhere and then they check who you are by sending you a text message with the code but I am going to link in the show notes to a story I wrote about how people's phones were phone numbers are being hijacked and like their phone numbers were being stolen and then the hackers were breaking into their emails and their and their you know financial accounts and stealing Bitcoin by getting the two-factor authentication codes sent to their devices after they stole the phone number but anyway okay it seems sort of referenced a little bit if you know about this I see a trend like you were talking about how it's you know a lot it's driven a lot by speculation and what is your take on that like I've seen also that you've tweeted about how there are some hedge funds that have popped up to invest in this and you're kind of skeptical of that so I want to get your take on the whole thing sure I'm probably a skeptic at RF anyways but I like having my mind changed I've been wrong about a bunch of stuff I'm happy to admit that so it's good okay so what's happening with I cos I don't even know where to start it's just nutty it's wild so do you think in spite of me thinks it's really cool the idea of bootstrapping the network by providing an economic incentive for people to participate in securing the network in building applications in the network in validating transactions on the network this is how Bitcoin and aetherium and Z cash and ripple got started right like these this is not necessarily new concept the way people are applying it now to companies to products to applications I think is really fascinating I think aetherium you know the ERC 20 token standard has been a really fascinating sort of driver of growth around etherion that's part of what's driving this this price spike because a lot of people are saying okay I don't want to build my own protocol that's really hard I'm gonna use an existing protocol and create my own token on top of it and leverage that network to sort of bootstrap mine but I think the overall trend a gun I would say that a lot of people who are buying these tokens don't actually know what they're buying the other issue I have is that a lot of these projects that have gotten funded they have no product the network hasn't been created yet and so to me it creates really perverse incentives I don't know what the intent of these teams is right I can't speculate on that but I do think there is this negative perception that people have when you buy these tokens all these tokens are sold the founders of the protocol the developers walk away with millions of dollars and what's their incentive then to build the platform or the product right it's just a weird timing a mismatch issue and we see digital currencies that are you know worth hundreds of millions of dollars have massive market caps but there's no product there's no network there's no protocol there's nothing so what do you think would be a best practice you kind of referenced before that you guys are thinking about yeah this is so I think one thing is just really understanding the governance of the protocol and the tokens that are given to investors and developers right so if you're a founder of a new protocol new project that does an IC o---- I think there should be some sort of lock up similar to how VCS when they invest in startups there's a lock up right you invest your shares quote-unquote over a period of time and then you can actually sell your shares until a certain point in the company's growth once you've hit certain milestones and in fort i cos it's also important as an industry to sort of to start becoming a little bit more analytical around how these projects are structured what's fascinating to these no one really reads the white paper no one really reads like the fine print and then when they do there's somehow upset it's like no it's all spelled out right there we should be really analytical we should really be looking at how are these projects governed and managed and how are the incentives aligned I think this is all about incentives and I would hate to see I SEOs lead to some sort of negative perception issue around the digital currency space as a whole when new investors come in who don't understand the market who don't understand who haven't been through Bitcoin bull run and a Bitcoin crash we've probably both been through I just worry about that what that does to the perception of our industry we already have a perception issue that we were we've been battling for for years now to overcome and sing a lot of education and advocacy and just countless hours that people have spent sort of advocating and educating people about what this actually is I would hate to see I SEOs contribute to that negative narrative so that's really what I worry about and I do think as a community we kind of need to be a little thoughtful again and how we build infrastructure around I SEOs so when you you know create a token whose responsibility is it to create a wallet for that token otherwise you're gonna have everyone storing their coins on exchanges which creates a lot of systemic risk right you're then creating a massive honeypot for someone to go and hack in exchange I'm shocked that people will keep millions of dollars of crypto currencies on exchanges it's mind-boggling but if there's no wallet for you to store it in and you're not a developer if you're more of a traditional investor what are you going to do I think it's a real challenge so we need to make sure that as we're onboarding all these new tokens asked for doing icos that we have the platform's products and services in place to serve those customers in a safe way in a secure way and that we aren't creating an undue amount of risk within the digital currency ecosystem how long do you think it's gonna take to build that out a long time yeah and now the discussion is is it the responsibility of the protocol development team to develop wallets and sort of that infrastructure around the token is it the responsibility of each exchange to create their own wallet for that token how do you go through testing and auditing one of our firms Zeppelin does auditing of tokens write a program of these items doing projects yeah this opens and I mean you know and so we have some of this starting to emerge how do you manage custody of funds while the crowd sales going on who's responsible for that how do you get the tokens from the crowd sale then into people's hands post crowd sale all right these are all things that are being figured out can you do like a one-click move to my ledger wallet or my treasurer hardware wallet right that would be great so I think these types of questions are the ones I start asking and inka gotten a lot of brilliant people in the states are thinking about these challenges but it's gonna require coordination it's gonna require collaboration and it was simply going back to the hedge fund question why are you skeptical of some of the hedge funds investing in this space Chara sizing I'm skeptical because while I see why the hedge funds need to exist I'm sure people call you every day your friends call you and they're like Laura what is this IC o---- thing I need some ethers I need some dick coins help me and you we don't have time to educate you know hundreds of thousands of people who want to participate on choose how you set up a Bitcoin wallet here's how you set up a ledger here's how you set up this here's how you go on this platform so I see this as these hedge funds being important to sort of enabling non crypto people to get exposure to this asset class I think the challenge is is that a lot of the hedge funds that are being created right now we're in a bubble I do believe right now we're in a bubble my question is what happens to those funds everything's been not been to the right but there will be a correction at some point what happens when there is a correction how are these people managing their portfolios have these people manage portfolios before being an investor that's a very skill set right there's a reason that venture capitalist census is because they have really learned how to identify great companies great founders they've learned how to strategically invest if you are like you wouldn't make just anyone a trader on a desk right you need to have a very specific skill set and I see a lot of people who have no experience with trading having no experience of financial infrastructure have no experience with cryptocurrencies starting to get into building these hedge funds and I I think everyone should feel free to you know pursue what they're passionate about but I just worry again that is going to lead to bad outcomes that damage the space I don't know I wish people the most success in what they do I think it's interesting if you can make it work but being the regulated financial entity is very different than by cryptocurrencies in your spare time and I just don't know that people who are getting into that space understand what they're signing up for it's not easy being an investor that manages other people's money it's emotionally complex like it's very psychologically complex but also there's a lot of technology that goes into it you need to understand regulation you to have you know lawyers all of these things are just the infrastructure side where is needed so of course I fully agree with you that there's a bubble we're gonna see a pop but I'm sure the part of the reason that you're excited about this place is because you think that there's any real progress that comes out of this and some of these tokens will definitely survive and go on to become hugely valuable so which projects do you find exciting yeah that's such a great question there's so many exciting projects so ipfs were an investor in I'm very excited about what protocol labs the company who's created ipfs with their building they're about to launch file coin which is the token that incentivizes people to share their storage capacity on the ipfs network there are already a lot of projects that are using ipfs as their storage layer so I think this is a great example of a token that's being created too in centralize activity on a network that's already exist it already has people building on top of it and they're working with Navarre rava Conte and Angel list to create a new platform called coin list where accredited investors can invest in digital tokens so I think that's an example of a really intelligent thoughtful way to approach Nico and I like the fact that the product is already alive I am biased I think that project is really interesting I think what brave is doing with basic attention token is also very interesting web browser the brief web browser right so they've created this fantastic browser product there is a wallet embedded in it that enables you to pay for content but now they're coming out with something called basic attention token so it's actually interesting is many people have tried this kind of concept before we had this company reveal in 2015 that created their own reveal token they were like the first app token that no one really knew about it it took off for a bit but that has token that incentivize people to answer video messages kind of the way that 21 enables you to ask questions to people in exchange for getting a little bit of Bitcoin they were doing this with video and enabling people to sort of answer asking answer questions I think what brave is doing with basic attention token is an interesting conceptual test so basically what they're asking is we're gonna create this token that advertisers can use and consumers users of the brave web browser can use where if you're being served and add you can get paid to watch the ad or if you don't want to watch it you can pay a bit of basic attention token and say you know what time is money I'm gonna give up some of my money so that I don't have to watch this ad I love that idea it's such a fascinating idea but again the browser is already alive they already have lots of users using it has been in the market for almost a year now so I think they have taken the time through the develop develop the idea it's experimental yes is that a concept that will work I don't know but I think again they have a real product that's here people are already using it when the coin launches it'll actual function within the browser so these are the types of projects I'm really excited about okay so I I you know I could talk about this stuff all day but I don't want to move on to a few other things that you're doing um so when is the World Economic Forum doing with blockchain and what is your role there yeah absolutely so the the World Economic Forum is doing a lot of work around financial technology in general a lot of their focus is on the fourth Industrial Revolution so really this idea that increasingly on the world is going digital we're you know changing business models we're changing entire industries with technology and so one of the themes that has emerged is around FinTech and the role FinTech plays in not just global financial inclusion but also in making markets more efficient in bringing new stakeholders online and enabling all different sorts of new commerce and so the World Economic Forum took a very active interest in blockchain because it's such a critical component to enabling some of that change and so they've put a lot of energy and resources into setting up a FinTech and blockchain group which is run by Jesse McWatters who is phenomenally smart they're setting up a blockchain lab in San Francisco which I think will be fantastic but the World Economic Forum really wants to help shape the global narrative around this technology in its use cases and so a lot of it again is focused on that education and advocacy component in really taking the youth cases people are working on the progress that's happening in different places around the world and bringing it to a massive audience right and so they've assembled a group of 25 of us from the industry who are working across various streams so I'm in the ecosystem stream we have one that focuses on governance we've one that focuses on the technology component and understanding all of these different protocols and public versus private blockchains etc but we're really starting to just think about what are the frameworks that we can create how do we break down these concepts in a simple wave so that we can deliver them to an audience of regulators world leaders people who run our world's institutions people who run corporations people who allocate millions billions of dollars of capital how do we get them to easily understand this is what this technology is here's what it's being used for here are all the things that we still need to figure out and really broadening the umbrella so that more people start participating in our ecosystem but what's fantastic about it is half of the council is female which I really love because when we went to Dubai for the the gathering of all of the councils that meet it was fascinating to see you know many of the council's you know worth 20 30 % women but are 50 percent and we're one of the dirtier areas drink yes so that was really exciting to see well so this is actually perfect I'll go to my next question because I wanted to ask about your women and blockchain series um first of all what it is it just like something that you're doing in your own like on medium or what is it and why did you decide to launch that so the women and blockchain blogs that I've been writing and started out as a simple idea so I've met so many wonderful women working in this space but people always come to me and they say oh there are no women in blockchain like no that's wrong there are lots of women who are working on really important things across their companies and so I thought okay why don't I just reach out to some of my friends in the industry and I put together a list of I think six or seven questions I'll just email them the questions or we'd have a phone chat and I didn't transcribe it afterwards um and I'll just have them share their thoughts how did they get into the industry why do they think the work they're doing is important what I think they think is going to happen over the next two years five years ten years what are the things that worried them concern them etc and so I started I decided okay in March International Women's Day is in March and I said okay why don't I just do one everyday in March and it was something I just kind of did on my own mediums great for kind of just pushing out content and then I started getting all these women reaching out to me saying hey I read this I would love to share my story and so it started to grow and grow which was just really fun to see cuz it was just this nerdy little pet project I was like oh it'd be great to just share some of these stories I didn't really think people would read them but what I love is that so many people when I'm at events or when I'm meeting people they come up to me and they say hey I read the women in black gene series I've read the post that was done on this person and it inspired me to come to this event today I am now actively looking at working in the industry I am really excited about this technology and I love that I want there to be stories of women at all levels of organizations right there obviously some female founders and CEOs in our states that are very well known but for someone who's early in their career or someone who works for a regulator someone who works at a bank you can't always really identify with that person right so I think by sharing stories from a really diverse group of women we can create more reference points for other women who are looking at getting into the space and not just women for anyone looking to get into the space about what roles people have how they got into them and kind of provide inspiration so last question and this is something that I've been thinking about so much recently but where do you think this is all headed like not that life of the average person going to look like three five ten years from now you know when we've got like multiple blockchains going and and all that in the worlds of many box chains okay so I thought maybe one there is some maybe one there's the one box same general them all I don't know what the future will look like I don't think any of us do we all have ideas obviously the number one I think digital currencies are here to stay I think we now have so many people who hold digital currencies who are using them in the US I don't think people really use quote-unquote digital currencies as much as they do in other parts of the world or maybe there isn't as much financial infrastructure but digital currencies are here to stay whether it's Bitcoin whether it's another digital currency whether it's bank issued digital currencies or Herman issued Fiat on a blockchain the idea of digital money digital currency is here to stay I think we are not going to know we're using it so I grew up in Europe right and I remember as a kid going from country to country I had a little wallet that had all of the different currencies in it I think I still have a coin collection it's homework oh and I was nerdy from a young age but you would change all this money out and in today's world were still doing that we're doing it digitally but we're transferring from USD say into Turkish lira when I send money to Turkey why do we do that why can't we have one global currency that's sort of a reference point right now we reference everything to USD I could see Bitcoin or a digital currency being a non-political form of money right where it's a global globally accepted way to move money around and that's what you're kind of references and then when you go into countries you can frictionlessly exchange those tokens for other tokens that you can use in that country all right potentially something like that I don't know what that will look like but for example one of our companies BTCC in China has created this great platform mobi that's enabling people to do that you don't even know you're using Bitcoin so I don't think people will know they're using a digital currency all they'll know is the process of transacting is much simpler it's much easier you can move money around much more efficiently so I think that's that's one I think as it pertains to blockchain more on the enterprise side I think we're going to start to see a lot of identity products starting to leverage distributed Ledger's in some way I think the identity space will be fascinating to watch because identity has so many implications for how we live our lives a lot of people don't think about how important identity data is until something bad happens to them until something catastrophic happens in their country maybe but I think there are a lot of reasons that digital identity products are very important self sovereign identity is very important being able to actually own your identity management is very important and so I think some of those products go into the market again no one's really talking about blockchain anymore I think smart folks in the space they're starting to move past it doesn't matter if it's a blockchain the technology doesn't matter when I use my iPhone I don't say I'm using tcp/ip or you don't talk about that you talk about the products you're using or the use case so I think identity products will start to become used more and more frequently and I think actually some governments and large institutions are actively working on rolling out new digital identity products and I think once the country does it I mean Estonia already has it effectively but once the country does it we're really going to start to see that take off and then I think the trend towards digitizing assets and putting them on distributed Ledger's putting them in a watching registry facilitating the trading transacting of digital assets will be also massive area of growth and when I say digital assets part of its taking physical assets in our world creating digital representations and putting them into this ledger but another thing that really excites me is there are all sorts of assets that we don't think about today right like basic attention token our time is an asset our digital property is an asset we have virtual identities that were managing that they own assets right so for example if you have a hundred thousand Twitter followers that's an asset of sorts I think as people are thinking about these businesses these these new ways of creating networks and creating value some of its pretty far out there but it creates a lot of really stimulating questions about how we assign value to things in our world and then how we leverage the value that we're creating and so I do see you know we'll start with a more mundane digital assets right taking something like gold that people are going to buy and and really identify with as a store of value digitizing not great but I think thinking about the future of marketplaces when we have all of these different assets it's gonna be really fascinating that's more of like a 23rd year but that's we're seeing you know having a browser that has a wallet in it where you can use tokens on different platforms you have one identity you don't have multiple logins something like that to me is really what the future might look like we're not gonna know we're using blockchain I don't think it matters that we're using blockchain technology what matters is it makes people's lives better it makes the processes more efficient it makes things it makes our system more inclusive it allows more people to engage and actively participate in financial systems in marketplaces that's the things those are the things pardoned that we'll be talking about it's not about the technology it's about what are we using it for so hopefully you know five years from now we'll be having this conversation the podcast after we record it will be you know put onto a decentralized web that's backed by I CSS storage and then if someone wants to view it they can use tokens to pay for you to pay you and my amazing sound engineer Chris okay great well
