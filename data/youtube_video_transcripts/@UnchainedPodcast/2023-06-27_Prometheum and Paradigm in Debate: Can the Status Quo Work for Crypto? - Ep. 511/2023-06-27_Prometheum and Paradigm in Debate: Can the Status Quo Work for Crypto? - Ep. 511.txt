Kaplan co-ceo and founder of promethium and Rodrigo Seda special counsel at Paradigm welcome Rodrigo and Aaron nice to be here Laura good to be back Laura so Aaron in the previous episode you were saying that it is possible for crypto exchanges to register and um I'm sure you're very well aware this is a view that's at odds with most of the crypto community and meanwhile Rodrigo has actually written in-depth articles on how or why it's not possible so um Aaron why don't we just start with you why do you think this is possible and talk about what you think that path is uh it's possible because Promethean has done it essentially by operating within the compliant Frameworks of the federal Securities laws as laid out by the SEC promethium ATS has been approved as an ATS to publicly trade digital asset Securities and Promethean bit Capital was recently approved as the first special purpose broker dealer that can compliantly custody digital asset Securities under the federal Securities laws so essentially I think that's an example that others can follow and how to come into compliance okay so Rodrigo go ahead and lay out your theory on why it's not possible sure um I think just quickly before I start I want to give a quick legal disclaimer I'm a lawyer but nothing that I say here should be interpreted as legal advice so I think Aaron in his uh statement just pointed to the recent uh spbd license that they got and the approval for the ATS so I think two things to clarify there uh first is he's not really operating in exchange right this is a alternative trading system and I think most importantly what promethium currently has is a license but they don't really have a business because they're not able to trade any tokens under the current law Rodrigo what about the form D tokens the plethora of them what about the tokens that are issued in SAS which essentially are part of a Securities offer are those not tokens that could be traded under the Securities laws are those not digital asset Securities okay and before we jump in form to Define that sure a form D is a form that a company files when they do an exempt Securities offering there's been numerous tokens that have filed form DS which basically declare that their tokens are securities and being offered offered in the exempt Securities offering by filing a form D you're filing a basically a form with the SEC that says I'm doing a Securities offering for an exempt security that has a certain trading restrictions those trading restrictions can be removed under other rules under the Securities laws which then allow them to be publicly traded as digital asset Securities on ats's like promethium ATS so I think Aaron is wrong about this uh I he's right that certain projects have filed form to ease in connection with financings but if you look at those form D's all of them were filed for actually convertible instruments such like a Saft or a warrant which are distinguishable from any token that can be issued pursuant to them and is it not a security that is that instrument not a security right Rodrigo well let me let me finish Karen yes the Saft is a security but the tokens themselves were designed with the explicit intent that they are not Securities so I don't think it's right to take the position that's just because a project filed a form D for a financing that then a top a token that is subsequently issued is itself a security and that was issued a pursuant to an exception the token issued pursuant to the exemption in the Saft or in the warrant is by definition a security and a Securities offering anything else is completely incorrect your your complete thesis is wrong I don't understand how you could say that something offered in the Securities offering is not a security essentially it's like the argument that you have a Securities caterpillar transform into a non-securities butterfly I don't there's no precedent for that it's basically you can have warrants that issue that the warrant itself is a security and then when you exercise the warrant IT issues something that is not a security that's the whole structure that all token financings have basically taken and that's why every token that is issued in those token financing are securities basically you're creating legal Concepts in order to serve your purpose it's not basically the law essentially the reason the SEC has basically said that almost every token besides for Bitcoin is a security is because it's an application of the law I think what you're referring to there are you know gensler's statements about this and as I'm sure you know and and Laura's uh audience will know gensler's statements do not even speak formally for the SEC and they definitely don't have the force of law right you want to say the human statements have the force of law but the chairperson of the sec's doesn't it doesn't have a larger implication than what a you know ahead of corporate finance says you're basically contradicting yourself man I didn't bring up the Hinman uh statements at all actually uh and the one that's contradicting himself is Gensler you know you know we've all listened to the videos where he argues that a lot of the tokens are not Securities and now he's turning around and saying that they are right and just to be clear the law hasn't changed it's just against there's political calculus that has changed and I think if you if you throw it down on the law there's two important nuances that you need to understand you can sell any asset in an investment contract transaction and then that transaction or scheme is itself as security right that's that's going back to Howie uh the seminal case interpreting investment contracts uh where a court found that's uh a promoter that was selling interest in an Orange Grove along with a Services contract was issuing a security but no one in their right mind would think that the orange plots were themselves Securities right so I think the first step that you're missing Aaron is distinguishing between an investment contract and the ultimate object in this instrument is the security in this case the tokens right and I think tokens are the security yeah the second point that you're missing Aaron is that there's zero precedent applying Howie to secondary Market transactions right uh in in the case of digital assets if you go outside of digital assets the only case to ever apply Howie to secondary markets is uh Hawking versus Dubois which is a case dealing with real estate I'm not sure if you're familiar with that one but it's it's curious that the SEC in that case actually wrote an amicus brief arguing that diametrically opposed point that Aaron is making and and that the SEC is now making saying that basically in a secondary Market transactions where there's not an issue the issue is not a party to the transaction there's no contract so then there can be no investment contracts right so Rodrigo we're not going to agree on the law because we're just obviously have different interpretations absolutely but then what is the best way to protect the American public how is the best way to protect investors I think the the best way to uh protect American investors and also keep crypto in the U.S is to carefully consider the thoughtful legislation that has been introduced in the house and in the Senate and that frankly you're looking to distract from by claiming that we've solved this issue by saying that promethium is the you know the path to compliance when what you have Aaron is a license but you don't have a business so let's dive into all these issues because I I love that we got right into it right at the beginning but yes I have like a whole bunch of questions about what exactly can be traded here because we you know we have this audience let's make sure that they kind of understand everything step by step so you know in the last interview that Aaron um participated in you know we spent a fair amount of time on what exactly it would be that you guys could support on your ATS so obviously Bitcoin is not something that will be tradable there because that's not a security and everybody agrees on that but you know you kind of were saying that you viewed eth as a security uh you know when I asked you if you would list it that was your answer so the implication is that you were planning on supporting trading for it but how will you get it registered as a security um we have requirements on the compliance standpoint from the ATS the trading and the custody standpoint through promethium ATS and promethium Capital the components that you're referring to in registration is a consideration that the issuer has to make essentially but if it doesn't have like the disclosures and the registration then wouldn't you be listing an illegally registered security because you it will not support trading and anything that's in a legal asset we basically will support trading and digital asset Securities which is a determination that's made by our compliance departments at both promethium ATS and promethium Capital to make a determination whether a digital asset security exists so now you're implying you won't list ether because you're saying it was we have not had animal announcements we had not made any announcements as to the assets we will support and we will announce it in the near future I think it's very telling that Aaron can only speak in hypotheticals and in very vague language and you know he's been operating the ATS since 2018 right or 2017 is when they first and got started you know has listed no assets right so it's interesting how you attack us for choosing the harder route to achieve compliance by Opera actually getting the proper licenses when the shoot first aim later culture that happened led to billions of dollars of public losses essentially you your your company and the Paradigm has supported some of the entities that were basically so anti-regulation that promoted the biggest biggest violations the biggest frauds in American history and essentially instead of reassessing your thesis that maybe regulation should apply because it's the best way to protect the investing public you double down at saying that regulation doesn't apply and basically are arguing for new legislation which is going to take how long to pass let's say a year or two and then how long to implement a few more years then how long to get it right and in the meantime the entities that have essentially violated the law that have essentially put their customers at risk and essentially victimized their customers continue to get a to continue to operate I don't understand what's happening overall is a transition away from the crypto Financial Services the wild west ecosystem to one regulated under the Securities laws it's actually good for the industry it will it feels like so FTX you know that alleged fraud is like a different thing from like tokens right they were just in exchange and they took customer money there was no fraud with ftt so like there was no come on it was a Full Service fraud shop when it comes to the creation when it came to the trading the manipulation the lack of fear norly markets the trading guest customers issues the co-million customer funds and assets basically everything abroads across the what Aaron is trying to do here is distract from the issue at hand which is the fact that he's got a license which is great but he doesn't have a business and the real risk here is when he goes around and he says that he is an example of the compliant path and that it's dangerous to consider new regulation uh it's that that's irresponsible to say because the status quo it's what's causing these issues right we currently have a regulatory Gap that has been acknowledged by SEC chair Gensler in front of Congress going back to Hinman which you brought up first it was again acknowledged by SEC staff in the Hinman emails that became public as part of the Ripple litigation so we don't really have a workable legal framework today in the U.S for crypto asset security trading and to pretend that we've solved this issue is wrong and it's going to lead to the U.S falling behind okay yes but after this I I really want to walk through you know every scenario so go ahead the status quo was established by firms like Cooley and Paradigm essentially the status quo arguing that tokens were utilities and not Securities and basically investors didn't need protections that they didn't need any rights for fair and orderly markets was established by entities that basically were serving their own best interest to figure out how to get early liquidity such that they cashed out of projects instead of going through private markets and essentially what we saw is that the status quo which was established by those entities it really was the was this led to the customers getting harmed the American public being injured basically what you're arguing for here is that continuation of the status quo which will continue to let the American public be injured now in regards to us not being live for trading yet that doesn't mean I don't have a business you have to give us an opportunity to grow markets grow how many customers do you have how much volume have you had on your exchange since 2017. a definition we're not live and the ATS wasn't approved until I believe 2021 what are you saying I understand you're trying to I understand you're trying to shift the facts because they don't support your thesis but it's not right your representation of inaccuracy is just nonsense all right okay so you guys have done enough back and forth like finger pointing but let's just for a moment um assume that promethium has an idea in mind of how this all should work and let's explore that so you were saying that you don't need disclosures from the token issuers of the tokens that you're going to offer trading in is that what you said and if so no that's not okay essentially there's responsibilities there's responsibilities on the issue to ensure that there's proper disclosures and but who makes the disclosure if if it's not eth what like let's say it's like comp which is on listed on your website so then who needs to make that disclosure like can you that is a form D filing essentially wrong man the pointy filing does not include any disclosures have you looked at one okay that's not what I'm saying I'm saying in reference to form D it's an exempt Securities office basically they file the form date are you challenging Tuesday who files it the company which company files a form t which company I have to look specifically either comp or whoever the entity that controls it is so I think there are two things that are being confused here like one is a form D filing which again is not for the tokens it's for a convertible instrument which is different which includes the tokens and then there's the disclosure that Laura you pointed out and and that you know SEC chair Gensler always brings up the form D does not include any of those disclosures right so I think your point which is the right one is like how are you taking the position uh that this is a compliant path that's going to provide customers with protection when according to him there's nobody filing this question right I'll explain to you why because basically there's a pervasive non-compliance in the industry from the issuance to trading through clear and settlement and custody right promethium is trying to deal with the trading clearance and settlement and custody components I firmly believe that the investors are best protected on platforms that are compliant under the federal Securities for trading and custody of digital assets there's the fair and early markets requirements there's the basic the rules when it comes to segregation of customer funds Securities a lot of the issues we've dealt with could have been avoided if you had properly licensed entities okay you're referring to the issuance and the registration of tokens right all the problems can't be solved in one day right but we're trying to figure out which digital asset Securities you can list so let's just drill down more lithium can list registered or exempt digital asset securities okay so um the thing is that uh as far as I understand there aren't any tokens that fit in that description at the moment so there's three categories um and ATS can legally offer either uh Securities that are listed on a National Stock Exchange those that are offered under you know a valid exemption from registration for under federal or law and there's also those that are registered with the states under Blue Sky laws um as far as I understand there are no tokens that currently fall into any of those categories and when you came on the episode last that's true it's just not true I promise you there's a list of tokens that have filed for MDS can you name some the ones on the web the ones that you referred before and and but just name some of the ones that fall in one of those three categories I mentioned uh I believe we have and you're saying that the form D is one of those valid exemptions from registration under federal law that is right that is an exception from from okay it's under 4a2 right but what it's not it's not an exception for the tokens I think that's a key uh like analytical step that Aaron is totally missing it's like you file the the staff itself is a security all of these projects were specifically designed so that the token itself was not a security right so he's confusing those two concepts so you're saying the token is the Orange Grove and he and but he's saying the Orange Grove is and the tokens are because that's in the context of an investment contract but let's even let's assume that a project did file a form D for tokens themselves which again they did not it still doesn't work right because there's a bunch of other issues that need to be solved and that he would need massive SEC uh guidance and extensive relief in order to make it even theoretically possible I think the most uh clear one to understand is when projects did financing they saw the portion of those tokens pursuant to staffs that uh filed a form to eat right but there's a bunch of other tokens as well that exist and that have been distributed since in other distributions for example liquidity mining under Aaron's conception of this those other tokens that were distributed returning to liquidity mining would not be issued under an exemption and therefore it would not be tradable so then you're creating this world where you're splintering off parts of the token Supply in a way anymore exactly they're not fungible there's a bunch of other like uh you know follow-on technical details for example in order to qualify for a Form B you need to put a restrictive license uh on your security how do you do that with a token you can't because basically that's not true but when tokens were issued nobody put nobody had contracts that basically restricted when they could be traded in the public market license so on the on the Form B tokens it's called the restrictive Legend actually and basically it's those two tokens issued an exempt offering have a restrictive Legend which could be removed a year and a day later under certain rules including 144. and so my point is the tokens don't have that so they're not they're not you know we're not issued pursuant to to this exemption so okay but but Aaron are you but Aaron are you saying that your plan is to come up with a new way for token issuers to issue tokens that would be in no no under basically how tokens have been issued we'll feel comfortable that we are compliance within the federal Securities if we support trading and the assets mentions on the trade but if they don't have the restrictive legends that would right what does that mean essentially what that means a restrictive Legend is a concept basically it means it can't you can't trade in a public market for a year and a day it's like you put it have you ever I understand you're referring to a certificate you're referring to a certificated security what does that even mean it's basically a stamp on a certificated security so I don't you're you're basically completing it with a bunch of technical implementation details that Aaron is just breezing past talking in very you know uh ambiguous language and always in the theoretical and the fact that this platform hasn't been able to list anything I think proves the point that they can't do it the fact that our platform isn't live incidents we consider the telegram case in this context uh as you are probably familiar right uh telegram there the judge basically enjoined the distribution of tokens that had initially been sold to some investors pursuant to form the convertible instrument the one like Aaron points to and what the court said was we're going to look at all this together the initial distribution to the purchasers and the potential subsequent distribution to the retail consumers and we're going to say this whole thing is an illegal Securities offering so even like like understanding that I think you see how his proposed approach which relies on the first exempt offering and then tries to like dribble out all these tokens to retail would not pass judicial muster and I think the SEC would also have a big problem with it I I obviously and that's why we've had such difficulty obtaining the licenses we've obtained okay it means does not have to do with this at well man the spvd license only exempts you from the customer protection rule it doesn't allow you to list basically authorizes us to compliantly custody digital asset Securities under the federal Securities laws right we're talking about listening tokens we're offering tokens for trading not only the custom piece but on the sppd you're conflating the two we have an ATS which is a separate license from the special purpose broker dealer I I don't so and also your continued concept that oh we can't trade anything because we haven't go live live yet it's circular logic by definition we haven't tried anything because we haven't gone live yet right okay Aaron I did also want to ask you about something that you said in the last episode more than once which was you were saying that promethium can make its own internal determination of which tokens or Securities and then you know from there you can offer those on your platform so how are your lawyers coming up with that interpretation like is there any particular law or regulation that you can point to basically it is the determination in terms of specific tokens is based on in terms of what assets we support is based on multiple factors that include compliance Regulatory and other legal considerations but okay but you don't need the sec's stamp of approval you you don't need anything from them saying like yes we agree that this is a security you're saying we can come up with that determination on our own and then offer trading and is that the case essentially you must update your form ATS with the assets you intend to support and if the I believe it's finer doesn't come back to you in 20 days then uh essentially there's no objection oh interesting and Rodrigo do you is that would you agree that that is possible so they can make a determination but they don't have the power to cure what he argues are illegally issued Securities right basically you're saying I can make a determination which I also had some good support so I have a business uh I'll wait to make a judgment on whether you have a business the day you list your first token man but let's I know you guys keep wanting to send barbs at each other but let's just talk about like can this work can this not work they cannot okay and why why can't that work well like I think there's two levels to this right first promethium's ATS and spbd are only allowed to facilitate trading and tokens that were either registered or issued pursuant to a valid exemption like you said the world of those tokens is zero because tokens themselves are not Securities and we can we can talk about that again it totally breezed past that point right what are the utilities champ and then the second step to that is every transaction requires to be either registered or exempt right so even though the tokens were initially offered pursuant to form D you still need to have another exemption Aaron to do the secondary trading right Aaron has pointed before in kind of hand wavy language through rule 144 as the basis on which they would do this and I'd love to like understand from you how you think you can do this because there's a ton of issues there as well okay but before Aaron responds just explain rule 144 for the audience sure rule 144 is a safe however under 4a1 of the Securities act which is basically an exemption for any offer or sale other than by an issuer an underwriter or a dealer and what rule 144a says is that if you comply with the various requirements of the rule you're not going to be considered an underwriter right importantly the preliminary language to rule 144 says that it's like not supposed to be a run around to registration right this is so this is supposed to be extending people from doing the underwriting status not allow you to issue Securities to the public without registration so essentially and they can allow the restrictive Legend to be removed after a year and day and that digital asset security to trade on a public market ATS correct uh well you're skipping a bunch of other issues that would be uh I think prevent you from making that determination for example uh you need to confirm the holding period right you need to do it for a year yeah it's going to be really hard to do that with no restrictive Legends and in the context of a continuous distribution right you also have a lot of additional requirements for holders that are affiliates and we don't even know what an issuer is in this context right so how are you going to figure out who the Affiliates are for purposes of the volume requirements or the manner of sale requirements an affiliate has a definition as a term of a law and basically you can make a determination there there's zero guidance to apply that to the context of crypto so you keep on saying there's different guidance basically you want the law the SEC to tell you that the law applies it's so upside down the law Is Like Oxygen it's everywhere in nowhere at the same time you don't need to be told it applies I don't need you to tell me I can't murder someone that's the law okay and Aaron what about yeah that issuance issue yeah wait wait in regards to who's the issue of ethereum uh honestly uh it depends you can argue at some point it was the ethereum foundation but you'd have to look specifically into it in regards to if our business can work or not Rodrigo if it's Camp work why are you so concerned about us because why are you so amazing I'll tell you because you're portraying your business as the compliant path and saying that everybody else is to scoff law that is like willingly violating the law and then the next breath you're saying that we should stop considering the thoughtful legislation that has been put forward I'm not here to criticize you for like the sake of criticizing you I'm here to drive home the point that we're at a critical point in in the National discourse over crypto and that we really need to come together and look at the thoughtful legislation that has been put forward and understand that the status quo is not workable so let's talk about the legislation I believe it's the draft Market structure bill right and as uh we both have probably read that bill so do you believe that the companies when they do provisional registration with the cfd you see is a digital commodity deal or whatever the term was that they should be basically exempt or it should basically launder or eliminate any skeletons and they have their closet so there should be no regulatory resource recourse either from Regulators or the investors who got uh injured in their previous actions but there's really nothing that you're basically saying is a legit path forward I would say we have laws that are tried and tested over Generations laws that were able to handle the transition from paper trading to electronic and now electronic to digital I don't understand why basically we need to recreate the wheel here where we've seen the dangers so Aaron you've made that point a few times so but I just want to drill down on one other thing which I feel like it came up but I you know um I just want to get your take on this again so again we agreed that you're saying that promethium as long as it's compliance team and operations here or whatever it was makes its own internal determination that a certain token is a security then you can list that um but what about those instances where um you believe that the initial offering was an illegal Securities offering can you still list those I will have to be a determination made by our compliance Department based on the Prevail prevailing facts but you don't have a policy about that right now because that should seem like something you know right off the bat that you could just say yes or no again we're seeing how all this plays out promethium is trying to do compliant trading and custody of digital asset Securities and we feel Americans are best protected by platforms that afford the investor protections of the federal Securities laws we can't solve every potential issue essentially we're trying to move the ball forward we're trying to provide a pathway where people can responsibly participate in the space okay well do you do you at least have a notion of how many digital assets you're going to be listing in the beginning could you at least give us a you know because Rodrigo is saying no tote and like many lawyers I would talk to say no tokens fit many lawyers who have perpetuated a myth over half a decade or so and potentially uh put a lot of effort into promoting the idea that tokens are utilities and not security okay so it's give us a ballpark how many do you think you're going to be able to list in the beginning I think we will be able to support a significant number of tokens I don't know how many initially is that like hundreds or is that like more than two all right everyone we had a slight glitch so we don't remember exactly where we were in the conversation um so I'm just gonna start off with a question which is that um you know as you mentioned Aaron you were saying that promethium's own process would be to determine which assets are the Securities and then offer trading in them and I wondered did you talk that process over with the SEC and did they either give you guidance on your criteria and did they say that you can do that I believe that's standard practice for an atheist so you did not discuss this with them obviously there was standard discussions in the course of the application process at the ATS and the special purpose broker-dealer level that uh but there was nothing uh that I would say was a unique or outside the ordinary so meaning you didn't suppose specifically with them I anticipate there were specifics about that discussion uh but uh my co-ceo handles most of that so I'd have to go more into depth there and find out okay I don't want to just say the wrong thing but I I obviously when you go through an application process it's an in-depth process where many of the procedures that you go through are reviewed and basically all your operational procedures are reviewed okay and then also um JW verit or verret who's a crypto law professor at George Mason and who also served on the sec's investor advisory committee said that if Promethean makes its own internal determination to list an unregistered security it will quote absolutely lose its license and be a defendant in an SEC action just like coinbase so do you know what you know what would happen to you if you list an unregistered security if anyone violates the federal Securities laws I assume there would be regulatory actions against them okay so in a moment we're going to talk about some of the other issues around disclosures and other I mean there's five million different issues but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible join over ten thousand attendees for this year's biggest crypto

um you know I believe and I think chair Gensler has said this that the main purpose of registering is Security is to make required disclosures and that could be around things like the board of directors corporate policies executive compensation accounting which would cover things like Revenue how would you do that for something like ethereum that's not upon promethium to make that determination or from eths or promethium Capital essentially the issuer is responsible for ensuring that there's proper disclosures I mean I think the real answer to that Laura is that the current disclosure requirements that are meant to like are tailor-made for Securities are not purpose fit for crypto uh a security is very different than a digital asset right a security is basically a legal claim against an entity so you can think of an equity security you're part owner of a company you have legal rights to dividends and in that context it makes a lot of sense to disclose who the board is you know who the officers are what the financials are a digital asset does not have that relationship to any company right there's doesn't give you any legal rights to an entity it gives you technological powers in the network uh and it does not depend on a single issuer in fact many the common structure for crypto projects is that the issuer or the labs will dissolve right so once you understand that you realize that the disclosure requirements for Securities are not gonna serve the purpose of customer protection if you just Port them over to crypto and then I think when you apply that to Aaron's business uh you got to realize that they don't like yes they get to make the determination of whether they want to list something but they can't force projects that don't think of uh their token as Securities to provide the disclosures that would be required uh for them to be able to operate anything and that was frankly before he alienated everybody in the community so I think they're going to be much less willing to play ball with anything that he has to push them through so by trying to do things compliantly I've tried to alienate the community as opposed to trying to provide the investor protections that will allow the industry to flourish I mean we saw what happened we saw what happened after FTX we saw that institutions pulled back and the institutions that were in the space no longer wanted to deal with it as much and essentially the best way forward the best way to uh move beyond the events of the recent other debacles of 2022 is to have compliant platforms that allow institutions to feel comfortable participating in the space that's in the best interest of the industry you agree with me with that so I think you're wrong is that oh wait do you agree with me platforms participation to feel comfortable participating in the space because it eliminates the current lines and Regulatory concerns let him finish again my main point here is that we should not be distracted by promethium and and think that we've solved the regulatory morass that we have and actually engage with the thoughtful legislation that has been put forward that's my main point which we don't want to discuss the reason you alienated the community Aaron is because you called everybody a scoff law and you should have a little bit more empathy for the entrepreneurs that have been with the best intentions trying to make this work and you go around saying that everybody's violating the law willingly and that you've somehow magically pulled you know a rabbit out of the hat which this is like frankly like this is a space where a lot of people have been you know actively working on it uh and and it's even more insulting when you don't have anything really to show for it other than a license which okay what's a little bit insulting is that you base basically say people who are trying to do it the right way are trying to do the wrong thing and essentially what your argument is is that people who rush to Market and disregarded the investor protections should be rewarded and should continue to be rewarded as new legislation takes a half a decade to go into place basically you just don't care about the public and what's in their best interest essentially you want to support one by one final Point flourishing in regards to crypto Innovation crypto Innovation doesn't occur on the financial service providers it occurs on the issuers in the projects so basically you're saying and I've been referring to the financial service providers that have literally lost the public billions of dollars I'm not referring to the projects register a token today that's a different concept what I'm talking about is the companies when I'm talking about the companies that have basically and if you don't have investor protections you'll have hundreds of more FDX so basically you're just trying to promote that same situation yeah but Aaron like if you're saying that Innovation is on the token side it does feel like all you know the way that you're going about it doesn't recognize um kind of like the decentralized network of these nature of these networks and how there's all these different actors that don't necessarily know each other that all come together to create something so this leads me to my next question which is so you were saying that you guys make this internal determination about which um assets will be tradable on your exchange and um you're we're all admitting here that yeah probably the token issuers um who whoever or whoever launched the network they're not going to be the ones who will come in and register and make these disclosures so I was wondering will promethium be making any disclosures about the tokens that are on its platform we'll be making all disclosures that we have to make under the law about any sort of token we decide to support anything does not have to work with issuers we're in ATS basically we've determine which assets we support it's a different concept and so what will you put in those disclosures like will it be the things that we mentioned before like the board of directors the corporate policies the executive compensation all that stuff or other stuff like you know more actual stuff that's relevant you're telling me that I'm going to you're asking me what disclosures we're going to make what disclosures does coinbase make what disclosures they make right now they basically are allowing because they don't list Securities they're listing assets that people speculating and do not think the public deserves to have rights but they're not Securities like laundromats because they're utilities and you know everyone they go by tokens so they can speculate on it so when the laundromat prices go up they can save and when they go down they could save it's nonsense basically this is an investment it's so clear it's an investment commodities all the time I agreements and securities but bitcoin's not corn I agree with that yeah what disclosures will you be putting up like is it this all the disclosures that are required under the federal Securities laws right but so those would be like board of directors corporate policies executive so how does that apply for something like ethereum like I mean if those don't exist you literally put n a about where we're going to disclose we're going to disclose everything that's required under the federal security specifically about the law under exchange rule 15 c211 Brokers and not quote enter a quote into a quotation system unless there's current information available uh for that security so that means you need the projects to provide that current information that's not something that promethium as an ATS or an spbd can do right I'm not sure if we're in compliance with 15 C to 11. how are you going to do that if there's not enough courage you to go do some homework I don't need to tell you how everything's going to be in compliance I'm telling you it's in compliance basically I I like type thing or what oh well as we should trust people who propagate the myth that tokens weren't Securities in the first place the people who propped up FTX but pays the paper who basically propped up FTX as if there was their Golden Boy and then two months later three months later took a write down over a quarter billion can you but can you so so you're saying that you will have disclosures but if it's you know you so you're going to follow the ones that are required for Securities like board of directors corporate policies and you're just going to write n a for anything that doesn't apply to these crypto tokens is that what you're saying no I'm saying we're going to make all the disclosures and disclose whatever is required by an ATS and a special purpose broker dealer under the federal Securities laws okay so it is the the ones for Securities like board of directors corporate policies blah blah blah that's what you're gonna do we are going to make the required disclosures under the federal Securities laws right but okay but yeah what so what is required is all this stuff that we're talking about board of directors corporate policies executive compensation accounting Etc that those are the things that you're gonna put in your disclosures about the tokens whatever is required Laura so the reason we can't answer that question right is because it's not up to him to do that right he's required to only list tokens and only enter quotations for assets that have publicly available information that satisfy these requirements that can only be provided by the issuers right so he can't just decide he can't wave a magic wand and do that and I'd be really curious to understand how you plan to comply with that like maybe you expect you know additional SEC exemptive relief or something because we have not had any exemptive religions it simply can't do it right we have not had any exemptive release from the SEC and your implication of such is a little bit uh underhanded okay well then one other question I want to ask philosophical question are those facts actually even relevant for uh people who might want to buy crypto tokens like the board of directors corporate policies executive come and say is that going to help them figure out whether or not this token is worth buying is do you feel that those are the right things to disclose to help protect investors so again we're focusing on the disclosure what about the fair and orderly Market requirements of any trading venue under the Securities laws what about the customer protection rules and when it comes to clinical mingling of customer funds and assets what we've seen in the crypto industry is there per is there is significant Market manipulation there's bot trading there's wash trading there's layering okay but basically you're basically saying that it doesn't make sense for crypto to be traded in a fair and orderly Market well it does make sense it's the best way to protect investors I was asking about the disclosures in regards to disclosures obviously uh things are going to have to be determined over the course of time as like I said before we can't solve every issue when it comes to compliance we're trying to deal with it on the trading and custody side which we think is the best way to protect the public like when you're talking about disclosures you basically bring all the issuers potential issues on us what I'm saying to you the best way to allow the public to responsibly participate in the space is do it on properly regulated venues we can't Rome wasn't built in a day all these problems aren't going to be solved in a day but it's a step forward no one's confusing Promethean from Real Men come on okay I have a question I have a few questions Aaron so a few weeks back a Wall Street Journal opinion piece by U.S senator Tommy tuberville mentioned that one of your investors is Shanghai Wan Shang blockchain Inc and just to give people some context here launching blockchain group was an early investor in ethereum they bought ethereum tokens in September 2015. however tuberville's op-ed noted that its founder Lou Guang Q is a faithful member of the Chinese Communist party uh the piece mentioned they to prevent believes this is how the CC is trying to wield influence in the U.S financial system what response do you have to this notion that the Chinese Communist party is trying to infiltrate the U.S final Financial system by having invested in promethium I think that uh Senator tuberville's comments were species as an incorrect and stale based on Old information when there was a subsequent filing in I believe November 2021 it disclosed that in an Omnibus agreement all uh joint development was terminated with Wong Xiang and basically uh we had a both a cepheus inquiry and an SEC investigation both of which assault looked into the relationship particularly with hashkin and wongshan the SEC the excuse me the cepheus inquiry was never turned into a full investigation and the SEC basically subpoenaed us and asked us to provide all Communications with any foreign entity up until that point and basically at this point we provided all infrared requested information and then thereafter the SEC closed that investigation as well basically we then took actions to make sure that there was no access by anyone to any foreign information all all development was brought in-house basically everything was developed by promethium in America and promethium is an american-born bred and controlled company so basically I think that uh the Senator's comments were uh could have been uh avoided if he had done proper research okay so wanchank doesn't have any uh information on customers okay and if promethium could find other investors to buy them out of the cap table is would you consider doing that uh it would be something if we would consider if it made sense basically when you're a young startup you're looking to have a relationship with major entities in the space and as we've seen with uh hashkin and Wong John's relationship with ethereum uh they were a major player in the space uh and as we move forward we realized that it was not in our best interest to continue any joint development and brought everything in-house and basically made sure that uh uh all development is done by Promethean people internally we control intellectual all intellectual rights and property to anything we've developed and everything is housed in the United States and how did they become an investor in the first place uh they believed in the concept that tokens were Securities and that the idea that the token Financial Services ecosystem I believe would sort of migrate to one registered under the Pharaohs or one license under Securities laws and I believe that their Hong Kong subsidiary I'm not sure the exact name hash key something was licensed by the sfc is one of the firms allowed under the Securities laws to trade digital assets okay and also your broker was Network One Financial which also has Chinese affiliation some of the principles of that company are are also principles of network One Financial China which is a consulting firm for companies seeking to do business in China or Chinese companies seeking to enter the U.S market Network One Financial has also been the subject of 18 regulatory events one civil event and four arbitrations and a few of those include the notorious Long Island Iced Tea Company which pivoted to long blockchain and was subject to an SEC enforcement action so how did Network One Financial become your broker Network one was our placement agent in a capital race basically there was a relation there's a form where they agreed to raise capital in order and basically take a commission it's like any other placement agent how did you find them uh Network one has been on Wall Street for a long time to my understanding and I would point out how many violations do any of the major banks have on their record I think it's a way to sort of uh cherry pick facts in some capacity as somebody who you know spent a long time on their career doing Venture deals it's highly highly highly atypical for a seed deal to include any sort of investment bank and pay a huge Commission is it highly atypical for firms to accept 20 million dollar checks from uh the companies that they invested in and then put in another 215 million dollars on the back end so what you keep trying to do is distract from the conversation I mean it just seems a little weird when you say something highly unusual is it not but but that's not well it's sort of Highly unusual right it's not relevant to the conversation actually yeah I did look into this uh what you're referring to is the relationship between Paradigm and FTX and SPF actually not SPX specifically and svf um did that with multiple different VC funds and apparently it is a thing uh after I looked into it which is interesting to me too um but so Aaron you recently gave a talk at SG innovate and you which I believe is like a single four years ago four or five years ago Laura okay so here's a quote from from that you said how is promethium going to list tokens on its ATS where are we going to get companies from and ATS needs an issuer pipeline you need a product to issue on our platform the second part of our issuer pipeline is one Shang related entities promethium's lead investor and Technical co-founder is a company called wanchang Shanghai blockchain which is the largest most capable blockchain company in the world they've invested in a multitude of companies that are part of their Network that they anticipate listing to do an issuance and to list on our secondary Market it's wonderful the quality of their projects is immaculate It's a Wonderful product pipeline so tell us more about these projects and tokens that you'll be listing uh essentially at the time that's what we believed as of October 2021 we terminated any joint development in an Omnibus agreement that's been publicly filed with the SEC in regards to Wong Song or hash key hash key is a investor who owns approximately 19.2 percent of the company and that's it this that conversation was given I believe it's 2019 it was definitely before the pandemic and everything has shifted since then and so basically you can use statements in that were made you know half a decade ago but we were consistently in our belief that the federal Securities laws applied and they were the best framework by which to regulate digital assets okay so you're saying that there was a previous time in history where the pipeline was going to be Chinese blockchain projects and now you're focused on these assets that we discussed earlier and wongshan to my understanding have Investments across Asia including the significant presence in Singapore so I think uh while certain of them might have been Chinese and they were mostly in other parts of Asia as well and I think that uh that uh concept uh met its end uh which was uh sort of commemorated and memorialized in the Omnibus agreement okay but essentially that relationship of tokens being developed over there and being listed on Yorkshire okay all right so let's talk a little bit about your Congressional hearing as well um and here I'm just addressing a lot of you know different things I've seen in the crypto Community um did you coordinate in any way with uh either the SEC or house representative staff before your appearance at that hearing um there's it's I think it's pretty standard for there to be some communication between um the entities that invite you and uh in that capacity I mean we were somewhat aware of the topics they would cover but we didn't really know the exact questions okay there were times during your testimony when it looked like you were reading your answers what were you reading uh basically I had thought I had prepared good responses and was looking in my notes obviously we had prepared extensively to testify and there was a lot I wanted to make sure to cover so I wanted to make sure in looking at my answers that I was proper and thorough in my responses okay and so none of the representatives previewed any of their questions for you again we were aware of the topics they covered but we did not know the exact questions all right so now we're going to go back to discussing some of the structural issues which came up earlier so um you know and this came up in the first episode so you have the uh special purpose broker dealer license um and correct me if I don't get any of this quite right um which allows you to custody sorry then it's separate then you have the the ATS but at the moment the ATS cannot clear and settle but at some point you would like that to happen so that's at the special purpose broker So currently the special purpose Brokers are in custody and we anticipate in the near future being able to clear and settle the transactions that occur on the ATS okay so I'm sure you're aware in recent complaints by the SEC against coinbase and binance um the SEC has made it clear that there should be these three functions the exchange the Clearinghouse the broker dealer and they should all be separate so your current structure is not going to be quite like that so can you talk a little bit about whether the SEC is on board with that it's separate entities separate compliance functions separate operations separate operational procedures I would think that it is in line with the sec's view there I think what the issue is is that the his the industry has historically been incredibly intertwined with their different business lines where you have a basically a virtual currency exchange serving as a bank a custodian a market maker basically trading against their customers orders doing lending doing basically staking doing everything under the sun and they basically build these intertwined business lines and now in order to come into compliance they would have to have get proper licenses for those specific business lines and build out proper technology and compliance infrastructure for that and in some sense it's basically uh uncracking a scrambled egg already and basically what that would require in some capacity is arguably a complete Tech rebuild to come into compliance because the way that it's built is just not compliant with how Securities have to be handled processed custody Etc so I think that's what it's referencing there since day one we've built it with the idea of being compliant under the Securities laws and I am confident that we are within the parameters of what's being sought there so Color Me is skeptical that promethium with a you know part-time CTO and a 25 person team has the part-time CTO 50 person team what are you talking about has been with us for years come on I got your facts come on it's not right okay go ahead uh you know has built this huge Tech barrier that somebody like coinbase or Kraken you know could could not even uh accomplish right because they didn't want to consider the law I think the key Point Laura to understand here is that the SEC has repeatedly said in the coinbase and the binance complaint and also elsewhere that they want they don't want retail trading uh crypto asset Securities on ats's which is what Aaron has that they prefer that to happen on the national Securities Exchange which does have a lot more separation and a separate clearing party yeah the SEC has basically said if some of the current virtual currency exchanges the FTX is in the coinbase isn't the like we're trying to get registered under the Securities laws they would have to go for full exchange status because basically the functions they have were not atas ATS based functions that's my understanding of what happened I mean speech I encourage people in April 2022 and Laura maybe you can link this in the in the podcast notes I'll also send you some comments as well it says uh that he does not want this trading uh retails trading on atss and then he this instructor's staff to to figure out how they can trade on National Security Six changes right the way I see this if we're looking at a transition to compliance Securities ecosystems it's a crawl walk run approach it's never going to go from Wild West to Pure exchange there's always going to be an ATS step in the middle and I encourage people to look at the NASDAQ example NASDAQ starts out as an ATS they build out their business they expand and then they go full exchange I think it's a good model so Aaron I don't think you're crawling I think you're hobbled and I'm not even sure you're pointing the right direction man I I appreciate that comment good sir okay so Aaron you're saying right now you're in the crawl stage so what does run or walk look like is it somehow you you eventually like NASDAQ become a national Securities Exchange is that what you're saying I would want to say we run essentially you need to go in between you start off as an ATS that's basically you're crawling you're basically moving out you're adding more assets basically you're adding more functionality and then as you get to a certain point it might make sense then to move to a full exchange it's the idea of going from basically Wild West crypto Financial Services to full exchange it it it's a major transition that does not appear logical it's a crawl walk run it's a it's a developed approach and if you look at and if you look at like the CBOE when it started it trades two contracts for four hours a day and I believe it's only long there's perfect examples of how uh markets and properly licensed venues develop that I think will be uh interesting for people to take a look at okay and so um just to go back I want to understand so your spbd is it currently or do you think it will be in the future permitted to direct trade orders to your Affiliated ATS or to another execution venue wouldn't it be the other way around where essentially the ATS directs Traders there's a special purpose I'm sorry I didn't mean I wasn't trying to you're more familiar with this than me so feel free to correct me so under the current rules to my understanding for special purpose broker dealer in the release that was adopted in the Federal Register in April 2021 correspondent clearing is something that they're trying to avoid in order to make sure that there's not incredible systemic risk in a concentrated standpoint because there's no DTC component after so when you have equities right you have the trading venue then you have the clearing firm then you have DTC and NSC which is basically the custodian of cash and securities of Last Resort when it comes to digital assets there is no DTC there is no NSC so basically the spbd is you know a very critically and important component of that ecosystem and the idea there is to let those systems and processes develop over time see how it plays out and then potentially in the future may be allowed for certain things like corresponding clearing but again I think this is the part of a transition as in that Hulk for all Walk and Run and the way to avoid certain sort of systemic or contagion risk is to potentially prevent corresponding clearing at the special purpose broker dealer in the near future and at any point in the future would you offer would promethium offer instantaneous settlement the way that you know is currently done on major crypto exchanges I believe transactions are settled virtually instantaneously right now it's the same way it's done but basically are you talking about the actual blockchain settlement initial media blockchain settlement because I don't think that's how it's done currently well so as far as you understand I think um in order for you to be able to do that you would the SEC would need to give you relief from its trade confirmation rules that require broker dealers to send confirmations at or before the completion of a transaction but uh I believe that you have to send a confirmation as part of a trade of course but that's basically just a report a a disclosure and Reporting requirements basically like sending statements at the end of the month okay and maybe Rodrigo will know this law more than I do but this some you know I had some legal Minds point out to me that this might not be possible for you no it's it's I think we're I think we're okay there so let's now you know go back to the issue that we kind of discussed a little bit around like what it is that investors really should know before they buy tokens let's say that the federal Securities laws didn't exist and we were just gonna from scratch write up some rules around what it is that people should know to like make good decisions about which tokens to buy in in that world what would you want in those disclosures and either of you can go first I think in that regard what we're able to utilize is all the blockchain data because that actually gives a lot of information about the token and that allows you to make certain abstract determinations now we talk about like there's no legal entity the question of an entity is separate from the idea of there is information available based on the blockchain activity which in theory provides an alternative type uh analysis mechanism through which people can make determinations about the uh you know the potential prices of a certain asset so I think the key concept to grow up here is that the disclosure rules as currently drafted are in opposite to customer protection for digital assets because they don't cover what people care about right so I think things that are not covered are things like you know tokenomics uh like IP rights a lot of value to these crypto systems is also driven by parties that are you know unrelated uh so I think you know coming up with a thoughtful framework that addresses uh all those gaps in disclosures is very important Aaron you know you said that you think they should get blockchain data so like give some examples what would it what do you mean by that no I I just think it's an interesting resource to have some sort of actual understanding when it comes to certain activities on Networks in terms of the number of number of transactions and anything else that's going on in a network in order to determine historic price versus where it's going basically there could be issues in turn in that in regards to uh if it's a proof of stake networks token stake there's a lot of information which the actual chain data itself can give investors in terms of my uh making a determination in my opinion when it comes to a potential viability of an asset all right um well so we're nearing the end of this episode this has obviously been something where you know just given the conversations we've seen in the crypto Community recently there's a lot of attention around promethium and I'm sure you're well aware Aaron the blockchain association did Issue a foia request of Freedom of Information Act request for information on the sec's dealings with your company and I was wondering if there's anything you'd like to get on the record before it becomes public via that foia request nope I uh think it's interesting when people use abstract terms like suspicious uh I think that's a uh sort of a Cheap Trick In some capacity and I hope that uh everything that they uh bind will uh allow them to feel better in their suspicion another purpose broker dealer license could be something that's coveted by other players in the crypto space um Rodrigo might know that better than I do but that was the inkling that I got um and I wondered if promethium would be open to being acquired by another current crypto player such as an exchange promethium is a capitalist entity it would be based on a the facts and circumstances extra Ryan surrounding the offer which is a a an illusion in sort of abstractly to what they say in the Dow report into determination of whether AIDS the Securities laws apply based on the facts and circumstances all right and then um the last thing I want to ask about this special purpose broker dealer is that I believe it expires in a short period of time um like a year or two years is that the case I believe it's 2026 five years from the date of adoption which is April 2021 okay so two years from now so what will promethium do at that time I believe that's three years from now or two almost three years sorry sorry okay yeah sorry we will see how it plays out again it will make it be determined based on what is occurring okay well any final closing thoughts from uh I'll take a final closing thought from each of you after you Rodrigo sure um I think my main point in coming here is to try to stress the fact that we're at a critical point in the National discourse about crypto policy the current status quo doesn't work there's a regulatory Gap that has been acknowledged by SEC chair Gensler and the SEC uh staff and I am very worried that promethium is being used as a distraction to divert from the real regulatory progress that we need to make so I would urge our policy makers to engage with the legislation that is put forward so that we can provide a framework that includes consumer protection and also allows entrepreneurs a viable path to launching in the US uh those and what does Bukowski say those who preach peace need peace those who preach War need War essentially those who preach the uh that the status quo needs to change were the ones who established the status quo in the first place and the hypocrisy and the irony attended to that is very comical because the reality is is how do we best protect the American Investment public and the best way to do that is the federal Securities laws is it going to be a perfect fit I think it's quite good and particularly when it comes to the trading and custody of digital assets which is where we've seen the manipulation and the actions that have harmed the investing public so the best way forward is to have platforms licensed under the federal Securities laws which will ensure investors are properly protected ensure that there's proper oversight and proper regulation wait and but Aaron you said you thought the best way to protect investors was the Federal Securities laws but when I asked you what they should know in disclosures you said it was blockchain data which is not what the federal Securities like that was just abstractly an idea of what I think investors should be looking at and not specifically a comment on the federal Securities laws it was abstractly what I thought might make sense but not a specific interpretation of what the federal Securities Law Supply require right I mean yeah they don't require that um no no but that was just a a a a generalized thought as to how people could determine viability of an asset that's different than what the federal Securities laws comply require all right this has been a really intense discussion thank you both for bearing with each other and with me and um you know I'm sure the whole Community will be focusing more on exactly what all this could mean or does mean or doesn't mean um where can people learn more about each of you and your work so I'm uh on Twitter at rssh273 and I also uh write at policy.paradigm.xyz people can check out from ethium prometheium.com or LinkedIn or our Twitter great it's been a
