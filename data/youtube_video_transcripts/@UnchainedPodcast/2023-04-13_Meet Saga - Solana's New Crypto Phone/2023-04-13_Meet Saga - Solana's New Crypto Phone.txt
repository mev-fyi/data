get ready to meet Saga the game-changing crypto phone designed by Solana I'm Jeff Benson with Revenge now take a look and you'll see this phone is in fact smartphone it's calls and send text messages you can take pretty good videos and photos but it's so much more important because this is a red 3 phone designed for people who love using crypto and use it every day you've got three buttons along the side top volume bottom volume and this I'm gonna get your phone up and running you see this little button here this is for fingerprints oh there we go now taking a look at the home screen you'll notice that I've got all kind of basic apps it is an Android phone so it's gonna look a lot like any other sort of phone that you might be running with a Google based Opera so if you open up you'll see right away you've got your Google Drive your Google Docs all of your Google needs right there on the home screen there are two main things that really make the side stand out and be different from your typical phone first is the seed Vault seed Vault it's not a wallet but what it does is it works with your wallet and it works with the operating system to help keep your passwords and and Seed phrases safe so there's that and that'll integrate directly with the fingerprint so that you don't have to constantly be entering in in a 24 word now the other thing that really makes it stand out is the salon adapt store now these daps are not what you're used to this isn't this isn't from this isn't from Android it's not for my iPhone this is the salon adapter so you've got your wallets you've got D5 you've got nfts you've got social and then you've got everything else you can download any of these apps and use them directly on your device and it's meant to integrate directly with your wallet and the device this phone is really meant for people who are deep into crypto and not just any group into Solana specifically there's no ethereum that story this is the salon adapt store so you have to be sort of wedded to that particular ecosystem and right now there's not that much in way of applications that are really going to draw you to buy this phone but if you're an early adopter you can certainly expect improvements to be coming down the line there's going to be new applications there's going to be improvements to applications and the Integrations are going to get better and more seamless as people start figuring it out so they built the phone now the app developers need to come
