hi everyone this is an interesting and fast-moving conversation I had with Olaf Carlson we of polyphen capital at consensus 2019 we discuss all sorts of topics such as some really out there ideas like about decentralized autonomous corporations as well as more prosaic ones like why Heather has been able to maintain its dollar pic despite being only 74% fact plus we cover regulatory issues and how he feels what many believe is a competition in the smart contract space also this is just a couple days away but again I wanted to mention that on Monday May 27th I will be hosting a conversation about the future of Finance and human rights at the Oslo Freedom Forum in Norway as the world continues to move toward a cashless society paper currency is disappearing companies like Facebook Apple and $0.10 are becoming increasingly influential in the digital payment space will discuss how individuals and companies can preserve and protect financial freedoms in the digital age I'll be joined by Bitcoin author and educator Jimmy song cause a chief technology officer Elena for Nova and coin Center founder Jerry Brito to register to attend you can visit Oslo Freedom Forum calm today use

and crypto businesses to comply with crypto currency anti money laundering laws avoid illegal sources of funds and maintain healthy banking relationships cipher trace is helping you grow the crypto economy by keeping it safe and secure hi everyone welcome to this fireside chat with Olaf Carlson me and myself which we'll also be releasing on my podcast and confirms to the moon and back so I you know we've talked a lot on the earth but I think probably one of the times when people were most aware we were chatting was 2017 when I put you in the cover of Forbes that year you returned 2,300 percent to your LPS and last year amid the broader downturn of the 80 percent your fund lost 40 percent Allison when 2018 you parted ways with your venture partner Ryan sir how is publishing been faring during the crypto winter and what is your strategy Ben yeah so we've we've really doubled down on growing the business so at the beginning of 2018 we were team of five today we're a team of 20 so we've continued to hire aggressively and most of this hiring is sort of world-class technical talent in all the areas that you need to build a sophisticated investment team in the cryptocurrency landscape so these are experts in distributed systems peer-to-peer networking cryptography game theory and in addition to that sort of research side we've continued to hire folks that are experts on the off side you know so this is all the nuts and bolts of running a complicated fund vehicle so in my mind we really took the chance through crypto winter to grow the business expand double down get a new office and all the sorts of things that we believe is the right move during that sort of crypto winter in the macro market time span because for me we're very much long-term focused investors and so what that means is I don't really care what the price of Bitcoin is on any given month to me I think that we are moving to a world where crypto protocols will be worth trillions of dollars I feel like I've been saying that for a long time and it will sound crazy and until it doesn't so to me you know this is about investing in a long term future and doubling down and building a business and so we were just talking about how this is kind of a crypto winter where do you think we are in the technology cycle yeah so I think that 2017 as many of you probably know was very much your fundraising so there was a huge amount of money put into new layer one protocols new crypto tokens as well as more traditional equity based businesses I think that 2019 is out to be sort of the year of launches so just a month ago we saw the launch of a project called cosmos you know cosmos was the first implementation of the tender made consensus mechanism which was actually first specified in 2014 so a lot of these projects have been in the works for five years before you get to a final form kind of main net launch and I think the most sophisticated projects take time to mature take time to build so in my mind we're going through this sort of year of launches and a lot of these are really sophisticated projects that haven't launched yet so these are things like Definity polka dot file coin that are really ambitious projects and a lot of them have been in the works in some cases for as long as five years so I think that you know we went through this sort of fundraising cycle and all of 2018 the hardcore technologists have just been heads down building so to me it's a very exciting time to be in this market because just like etherium provided a sort of step function increase in what this technology is capable of relative to what existed in the market at that time I think that we're going to see many of these breakthrough sort of layer one protocols enable new types of behavior that really aren't possible with existing technologies that exist today so I'm glad you brought up aetherium because I'm very curious to know everybody's talking about where aetherium is how it's sort of like there's Toulouse and here we are you know really sort of waiting for it there in 2.0 like this more scalable version of aetherium but obviously it's not gonna be deliberate for quite a while and you mentioned affinity and some of these other kind of like competitive watchings I have actually they're just launched or already launched or will launch yeah so what's your take on that howsoever I I really believe in a poly chain world and what I mean by that is to me aetherium wasn't trying to build a better Bitcoin it was trying to build a new platform that could use dude new use cases that were it was not possible with the prior Bitcoin technology so by building the EBM or theory and virtual machine as as well as the solidity programming language whereby people can write smart contracts and more complex financial logic executed in that highly secure blockchain environment that's very similar to the environment that executes spear to pair transactions in the Bitcoin network you're able with the theorem to build more expressive contracts and for that reason you saw many tokens that all settle to the etherion blockchain whereas on a Bitcoin you really only have bitcoins so you have one native asset of that blockchain and then in a theorem you have the whole sort of decentralize Finance movement of smart contracts as well as decentralized crowdfunding things like icos and etc so in my mind aetherium wasn't really competing with Bitcoin it's just building a different system in the same way I think that many of these newer launches that are going to occur over the next year aren't just trying to sort of compete with etherium I think it's very myopic view to just think that this is we've already exhausted the set of things that you could ever use at cryptocurrencies for so in my mind I think it's really about expanding into novel use cases that aren't possible with the existing technology that exists today and I think that it's sometimes hard to imagine it's hard to wrap your head around but say with a system like file coin if you want to build a decentralized platform today you're tasked with very hard and simple questions like if you want to serve a file to the end-user where does that file come from it's really basic right every sort of web app mobile app will use today serves files from the centralized servers if you want to build a it's a decentralized or a peer-to-peer application that can serve files to the user you need to have a decentralized file storage architecture underneath so a system like file coin isn't trying to sort of compete with aetherium it's really trying to expand the suite of what is possible and enable new use cases and enable to developers to build things that previously were sort of unimaginable wait but there are a contract platform smart contract platforms that are 20-feet with aetherium yeah but next is Definity I mean what you mean it's like saying you know a theorem is trying to be Internet money and therefore it competes with Bitcoin I it's not to say that there's not overlap right between these platforms but in my mind like what we invest in are things that are going to enable new behaviors if you're just trying to build a better mousetrap I find that very much uninteresting okay so you basically think okay I mean like I don't think it we were singing yet at the same time I do feel like there are certain issues where there are multiple players vying but you think like there's a world where etherium Definity and tasers could all go good I think that these platforms are very different in important critical ways that lend themselves to different types of use cases so you mentioned like Tasos you know Tasos is really about the ability to formally upgrade the code of the blockchain through on chain voting using coins of actual code repositories so you're not voting on text like should we move to a different that's this mechanism yes or no you're actually voting on sort of pull requests into the code repository so it's a very formal system for upgrading the blockchain using token voting in my mind while some people could pigeonhole tezo's as oh just another smart contract platform in my mind like that's expanding on something that aetherium is really not aiming to do cerium will probably never have that sort of on chain governance and so in my mind you know a project like tasers like you mentioned isn't really competing with trying to win this sort of ICO platform or something like that I think tasers is trying to build something completely different that will evolve in its own interesting ways again much in the way that theorem wasn't just a faster Bitcoin or a cheaper Bitcoin or something like that if cerium really evolved to serve a whole suite of use cases that were sort of unique to that platform and then also some kind of but one other thing that's sort of a new development is now we've got these really big centralized players like Facebook trying to get into the space what do you think of what companies like Facebook are trying to do what do you think that they can compete against the centralized or decentralized projects and vice-versa like how hard would it be for a decentralized project to compete against these centralized crypto so I guess I have two things so one is Facebook is reportedly building a stable coin right which I think makes sense because for the payments and sort of remittance use case as well as for most people just a saving money use case they actually don't want volatile money they actually want something that's quite steady but that stable coins to me are sort of a ten-year stepping stone whereby once cryptocurrencies actually start competing with fiat money it's no longer interesting to have a stable coin that's pegged to fiat money right so I think that it's a it's an interesting sort of tenure stepping stone that's critical for this market both as a trading pair Anna's for use in sort of smart contract applications but is also not going to be there forever at the same time so what Facebook is trying to build I think they will have the most success if they build an open platform and so what I mean by that is much in the way that Satoshi Nakamoto built Bitcoin in such a way that Bitcoin era Satoshi doesn't have any sort of formal control over the Bitcoin protocol right whoever they are even if they were known today wouldn't be able to in a formal way influence the operation that protocol and that's by design I think given all the problems that Facebook has had with policing their platform and things like that I think that this strategic move for Facebook would actually to be to build public infrastructure and that public infrastructure could be incorporated onto all the Facebook platforms which of course are proprietary but that public infrastructure if they don't try to own it I think that's where they will have the most success so if Facebook just tries to ship some sort of pseudo private blockchain that they can sort of bend their will to me that's not even really a blockchain like in my mind a blockchain is a system that gets its security properties from economic incentive mechanisms it's not something that facebook.com can just go control so they can build their own sort of proprietary points system or something like that like airline miles if they want but to me that's significantly less interesting than building public infrastructure that they incorporate into their applications I think for them it could also be quite advantageous because they don't then need to be necessarily responsible for everything that happens in that public infrastructure right the people that made the internet aren't responsible for everything that's said on the Internet so I think that to me is the right strategy whether they do that or not we will see and if we get a lot of these centralized players that are trying to create these open public infrastructures then what does that mean for kind of a lot of the projects that you are investing in those I would love if every big tech company out there and made public cryptocurrencies that would be incredible to me like I I care more than anything about moving this whole industry forward moving the technology forward enabling new use cases and just getting people cryptocurrency I think that this really is a long-term goal of getting people to store their wealth in cryptocurrencies and I really do believe that over a very long time this does replace other types of major financial instruments like gold and fiat money so to me you know if big technology companies want to put their resources towards building public peer-to-peer crypto infrastructure I would be ecstatic all right well so we'll see how that goes I also was wondering you know I keep hearing from so many different players in the industry that they feel like the regulatory environment here really is not conducive to their work and I hear constantly about different teams that are trying to do workarounds and you know just have a lot of fear about operating in the US and so I was wondering how you're perceiving how the regulatory climate is affecting the development of your portfolio so you know I think in general regulators in the United States and globally are going after bad actors and I think that's what they want to do it's what their job is and it's what actually protects consumers that are maybe not fully knowledgeable into what what they're getting into but that said I think it's very critical that with this kind of emergent technology this emergent industry it's critical to use a light touch and not sort of snuff out any of this innovation in part to me you know this is a extremely global technology it's a global movement if any particular jurisdiction takes really a heavy hand with this it's just going to go elsewhere to me the whole thing truly is unstoppable sort of like the Internet in my mind it feels like inevitable it didn't matter what any specific jurisdiction thought of it so in my mind you know it's critical for the the u.s. to have this kind of light touch approach if they want to remain sort of a leader in the financial secretary technology sector and all the rest but that said I think that today it's not necessarily that the regulatory environment in the United States is negative it's more that it's unclear yeah well that's that's what I'm saying like they feel like they don't have enough clarity doc right yeah and I think that it would be prudent for regulators to put out again with a light touch more clarity on on what is what they view as sort of the right action did you know that if money laundering were an economy its GDP would be the size of Canada's large volumes of tainted crypto assets move through financial networks often below the radar of banks cyber criminals use unregulated crypto exchanges to avoid detection no wonder governments around the world are rolling out tough new anti money laundering laws for crypto currencies complying with those laws isn't easy banks and exchanges need the best crypto currency intelligence available to avoid penalties now you can use the same powerful AML and compliance monitoring tools used by regulators cipher trace is securing the crypto economy to learn more visit cipher trace comm slash Unchained let's also talk now about the defy trend which you did mention I've been watching this with fascination and obviously it's kind of just you know developed in a lot of really interesting ways but one thing I can't help but notice is that when you kind of look big-picture a lot of these projects are making things that remind me a little bit of the what happened in the financial crisis where maybe they're not being super prudent or you know just yeah just you look it and you're a little bit like okay this this is a lot of risk that they're willing to take on what's your take on that yeah so I mean the the mission to me of smart contracts and and more specifically to centralized finance is the ability for any two arbitrary people or groups or machines to enter into arbitrarily complex contracts over the internet and have all that be self enforced with software systems so the two groups or our machines whatever it might be don't need to know each other they don't need to have an underwriting process the whole point is that it's all fully programmatic all over the Internet totally global in all self-enforcing not to mention 24/7 365 so to me on a very high level that's an incredibly exciting idea the idea that we can move from pen and paper legal contracts into software based automated code contracts to me is quite logical it feels like the inevitable next step in the development of the internet right now that said what comes with that world is is immense freedom right if anyone in the world can enter into an arbitrarily complex contract with anyone else in the world without even necessarily knowing who that person is and in some cases the counterparty almost is the contract itself in some ways like it actually is the software system it leads to just immense amount of freedom and that is always a dual edged sword right there's going to be some people that use that quite intelligently and it opens up new use cases and it unlocks a financial opportunity and wealth for many people there's also going to be people who kind of stumble into that unknowingly and might use it in ways that I soon put it were too risky so I think that it's it's what comes with it for me it's a worthy trade-off and I would love to see the development of these more exotic dphi instruments continue yeah and actually just to continue about the dfi trend like what are you looking for next in that arena yeah so I'm very excited about the maker dhow project for sure it blends a lot of the elements that I think are important right now so one like I mentioned is stable coins if you want to have many of these financial applications being useful it's it's quite often the case that you need to have a stable type of money backing it so if you want to do a decentralized trade right against say Ethier or the etherium compatible token you don't want to always trade that against another volatile crypto burnsy you don't trade Google stock directly for Apple stock right you actually trade for dollars so I think that that stable coin infrastructure is critical and like I said for the next ten years I think it's going to be very very important so in my mind maker Dow is creating sort of the most robust most decentralized stable coin that I think is resilient from many many different types of attacks and it doesn't have any tether to sort of real world legal entities that can be a security threat to the entire sort of system unlike what we've seen say with tether right where the backing of that stable coin instead of being held in a smart contract and thus being outside of any specific jurisdiction but rather just in a self-executing piece of software is actually stored in a bank account in a jurisdiction and therefore is subject to all sorts of potential security risks in addition to that and the other thing that the maker Dow project is doing that's very exciting is creating a sort of Dow or decentralized autonomous organization as has been called of the MKR token holders that actually govern the way that stable coin system works so they select for example what are the collateral requirements in order to deposit into the smart contract to get a loan of stable coins what types of collateral can you put into that collateral contract what is the interest rate right on that collateral so to me I'm the this is a segue to the other thing I'm very excited about which is the ability to organize humans without using pen and paper legal contracts based in a specific geography but rather pure software systems so the maker Dow is an early case of sort of like a decentralized corporation right and when you think about the corporation itself in the corporate structure it really exists to facilitate the sort of gathering of capital from various disparate parties has a clear liquid secondary price right so you can always trade parts of the corporation and it facilitates turnover of management so the corporation itself is sort of separate from any individual human actor behind that corporation and so I think some of these down structures were seeing are sort of prototype corporations right there's capital coordination from many different parties all over the world on the internet that capital is stored in a contract with very very specific specified rules again at a code level for how that money can be spent and there's secondary markets for the actual sort of ownership rights over that capital pool and so that means that you have all the sort of nuts and bolts of a corporation right and I do think that we're going to see a continued sort of expansion of what is possible there we're going to see more experimentation and in general I think this structure has a lot of potential I think over the long long term you could even imagine kind of pen and paper corporations based in specific geographies actually start to move to software based systems where all of the human relationships are defined by code rather than abandoned paper contract based on a specific geography and so you almost have like an internet sovereign organization right that's not really based anywhere and so I think that's a really fascinating concept and maker doubt to me is like the tip of the iceberg right the veritable iceberg that I think we will see emerge over the next five or ten years yeah there's so much not impact there but the first thing I want to ask about is I'm glad you brought it maker down because as we know the dollar quote-unquote peg has not held and to get it up to a dollar the impaired holders have increased the interest rate to kind of like a rapacious twenty percent and so I mean what do you what do you make of what happened there its market forces so the number one way people are using maker today is to lock up ether they can get a loan then of a stable coin and then they can go buy another crypto asset so it's a way to get sort of almost decentralized leverage right and to me all that indicates is that people wanted to go long a hun cryptocurrency and you know I think that regard of what interest rates are it's driven by these sort of market forces so I don't think there's like a right or wrong thing it's where supply and demand cross but do you have faith that die which is the stable point will be able to keep its dollar peg yeah I think I I think it will over the long term I think part of that though is continually evolving the technology so for example later this year we'll see the launch of multi collateral die and this is where people can use many different types of collateral to back that stable coin outside of just ether these are the types of things that I think are really important to build a really kind of long-term resilient system all right and you also brought up desert which I wanted to discuss why do you think that tether actually did keep that stellar peg actually even better than died despite the fact that apparently only 70% of it is backed by reserves now um you know I I think that so in in 2016 there was an event where BitFenix whose parent company is sort of also owns tether you know had this sort of interesting thing where they lost some money through a hack and then sort of issued a token and were able through sort of a free market mechanism make everyone sort of whole so to speak and it did require any sort of third party interference it was all through sort of voluntary contracts and I think that was very very interesting it was like a sandbox for what things look like when it's just all sort of market based and I think similarly people had a lot of faith yeah this situation will work itself out that's my read on it I I don't think that I'm necessarily know more than others in the market about why tethered doesn't have some sort of discount right because when you buy one dollar it's hard to imagine it going over a dollar right but you've got to imagine there's some level of risk that it goes under a dollar so I I don't have all the answers yeah all right so then to continue the thought that you were talking about earlier what the decentralized autonomous corporations you know what would be key for that to occur in to be successful you know some way that people operate is for some form of on chain governance that works and here we are in this phase where like this is definitely something people are experimenting with but we don't have the system I would say yeah that has done Orange and governance well so what's your take on what we need to get there yeah I the only thing I would push back on is I do think that some projects are doing on chain governance well at what ones I think maker Dow and taste us the two we've talked about are great examples I don't think it's necessarily limited to those two but those are two that I'm very close to and I think that you know one theme here like I said before is that these technologies and the technical by technology I don't just mean sort of hard tech like new new peer-to-peer layer new distributed system layer something like that really what I mean this can sometimes just be a sort of human organization technology or almost like a social technology right and in my mind these new technologies are enabling new types of behavior that we've never seen and really aren't possible with a legacy system and so that the management of the maker Dao smart contract I think is a great example of that and I think that we will see other types of smart contract systems or peer-to-peer systems that are actually managed by what looks sort of like a decentralized corporation I mean for example some of the foundations that have raised capital in order to fund the development of a new crypto protocol or crypto coin that foundation itself is sort of a very loose tether to their real Geographic world and it mostly exists to have a bank account and have some sort of system to allocate those funds right in theory I think in the future we won't see capital being pushed into a nonprofit foundation that has a tether to the sort of traditional Geographic world like you'd see with like the Linux Foundation or something like that but rather that capital going straight into a smart contract and the a very formal system for how that capitalists so I do think that this is happening throughout the cryptocurrency space without going too deep into it I think this is also something that by Nantz is experimenting with or at least appears to be experimenting with through the by Nance token and almost disrupting themselves with their own decentralized exchange so to me I I do think we're seeing the beginnings of this throughout the whole cryptocurrency landscape did you see what happened with Aragon recently we they were having that vote on whether or not to use some of their funds to just focus on Iberian we're also focused on polka-dot and up until the last second it was kind of like half and a half but maybe a little bit in favor of just focusing on a theorem and then at the last minute this whale came in and tilted the vote in favor of also focusing on polka dot what did you make of what happened there like do you think that's a good thing or a bad thing or yes I have two thoughts there so one is that one of the I mean I would say the critical problem with token voting governance systems right now is the usability so until I receive a push notification that says like vote yes/no and I just click one the UX is not there and so to me once we have that you know then we will kind of see what a voter turnout so to speak looks like I think people have traditionally been used to the idea of voting in systems like the democracy system we have in the United States and it's not a very user-friendly voting system frankly if you think about it though instead like a product developer we're actually looking to maximize user engagement I think that we could build very very sophisticated and simple user experiences around participating in those votes so I think that's the first kind of friction point is that oftentimes you have to go on the command line like do a bunch of weird transactions and it can be tricky to participate in those sorts of votes the second thing I'd say though is that if you as a holder of one of these underlying tokens is opting into this system where the votes are tallied based on the amount of tokens tokens held I think it's your responsibility to comprehend that's what you're opting into so to me this type of vote where a quote whale could alter the outcome realm relatively more than someone who held say one one thousandth the number of tokens as that as that other person every one in theory should know that they were opting into that system at the beginning so to me it's it's just about making sure that it's all sort of voluntary if what's much scarier to me is the idea that there would be a vote that went one way and that some other sort of vague third party locus of control could come in and reverse the vote as long as the system is operating in the way in which it was specified I think that people should be happy that they opted into something that is transparently operating in the way they thought it would well so speaking of kind of like the way things people you know think things will go versus what actually happens we've seen a number of incidents in the crypto space where there have been this theory like around you know 51% it talks that you're sort of distant sent advice because if you do such an attack than the value of the token will drop and you know because people will sell their tokens but obviously in the fall we saw there were a few 51% attacks and was suitably on a theorem classic that didn't really affect the price lesson and we're sort of talking about the same thing with tether where like you would expect the news to have a bigger effect so why do you think that we're seeing this disconnect between like what people think will happen versus what happens yeah I mean I I think that the 'mark it is sort of the canonical version of truth in in these cases and I think regardless of what people think will happen it's what actually happens that sort of matters I guess and so people all the time speculate on whether cryptocurrencies will go up and down in price and I don't know to me if you know what you think is gonna happen is not what happened you're gonna be like I I don't think that it's easy to predict those those sorts of things and the fact how do you design how do your projects design for that then well so I mean design for what exactly what do you mean well I mean I feel like all of these systems you know they're trying to come up with the right crypto economics yeah yeah and but then it doesn't really play out in the real world oh well no I think it does matter though if it was trivial to 51% attack for profit over and over and over I do think that they you know again I think the price that asset would drop right so I do think that what maybe is is the case is that some of these attacks weren't as severe as people especially they could theoretically be I mean in my mind the real project of crypto currency and crypto economic design is not to secure against rational actors who are for profit but rather sort of irrational actors who are actually willing to burn capital and spend money in order to attack the system and that to me is a truly Brazilian security system alright well we'll see how crypto what stands such attacks in the future thank you so much Olaf it yeah thanks for [Applause] [Music]
