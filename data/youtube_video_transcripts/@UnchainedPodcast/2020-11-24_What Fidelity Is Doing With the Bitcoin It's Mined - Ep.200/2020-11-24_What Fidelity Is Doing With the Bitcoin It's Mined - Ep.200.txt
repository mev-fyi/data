digital assets welcome christine hi laura um great to be here congratulations on your 200th show thank you what does fidelity digital assets do and what do you do within it ah fidelity digital assets weren't institutional custody and execution services provider um and i'm responsible for our sales marketing and um research teams so mark many of our client-facing activities and also um our perspective in the marketplace and so uh why don't we dive into your story of how you got into krypto because you have extensive experience in traditional financial services so how did you make that transition happy to happy to talk a little bit about my background so i joined fidelity digital assets um in march of 2019 um prior to that i was with coinbase for about a year and prior to that i spent about 30 years in traditional finance and the the 30 years war um composed with i traded on both the buy side and on a proprietary basis early in my career and then as trading began to change um i did a little bit of a shift where i went to work for bloomberg and bloomberg intelligently put me in their electronic trading division in 1998 so i was a former trader selling trading technology to hedge funds and other uh other institutional participants and i was somewhat successful um and chose to join a startup um based in chicago called archipelago and archipelago was quite successful in helping to shape um to shape the narrative around in electronic trading archipelago was subsequently acquired by the new york stock exchange the business that i ran was spun off and sold in merrell um entered merrill merrill lynch in 2006 as an md imported that business over that became the basis of merrell's electronic offering and then about a year later joined my team at the new york stock exchange where i became global head of sales reporting to the ceo and part of the management committee it was a great time to be you know at the exchange lots of change rebuild of the technology platform changes in market structure and also the backdrop of the financial crisis so it was um you know it was just an incredible vantage point to see um to see multiple narratives kind of begin to play out new york stock exchange was acquired by a rival exchange in 2013. um i left to join um barclays and was there for about a year and a half um and then i subsequently retired and i think that for me um the change was we went from creativity a great deal of creativity in terms of shaping markets and then a period of intense competition and then full-on commoditization in about 10 to 15 years so the full-on commoditization was not particular not nearly as fun as the both the competition and the creativity so um i retired and um i was a little young to be retired most of my friends weren't retired but i started to think about you know when i was a happiest and most successful i felt like i was surrounded by some very smart people who were solving complex problems and that's what led me to crypto i couldn't help but notice that there were some very intelligent people um finding their way to to crypto and i took a look at at the markets and found them to be clearly dysfunctional and homogeneous and i thought maybe there's something i could could bring from my previous experience to these markets and so it was the market dysfunction that truly attracted me at first and the um underlying technology and all of the use cases and this incredible community that kept me here so very very pleased to be part of this community and i love the change that we're seeing kind of year over year month over month in terms of the development of this of the marketplace and the ecosystem and how did you end up coming out of retirement to work at coinbase that's so funny it's actually a funny story i um uh there was a recruiter that had given me you know some some guidance and uh i was working with him on a couple of searches either for me or for others and one day out of the blue he calls me up and says christine i have something a little off the beaten path and i said david is it coinbase and he said yes it is and so quite honestly i was delighted to speak with coinbase i couldn't have picked a better place to get kind of a really deep education in crypto um obviously market leading brand it was a wonderful team and a great experience so um engaged with coinbase during that period you know during the period of the run-up in 2017 where things were going absolutely kind of bananas and and joined them in in march of uh 2018. and tell me then about the transition to fidelity so the transition to fidelity look i think the what i loved about coinbase was the possibilities i mean they they clearly looked at digital assets as um there were great possibilities for lots of different client constituents and clearly they were an on-ramp for lots of different lots of individuals and so that was their kind of core client base and then they began to kind of grow into different um into different businesses but i came from an institutional background and and i felt that that a real necessary focus had to be um had to be placed on institutions and have and to have an institut an institutional player with an institutional focus i felt that that was sorely missing so um when i when i chose to leave coinbase um i wanted to leverage the experience that i had in the past and the clear uh you know the clear choice or the clear player was fidelity so engaging with fidelity kind of brought together um both of my passions for institutional uh for institutional engagement and this wonderful new ecosystem of of digital assets so it was a good fit for me um it wasn't it was less about leaving coinbase and more about joining fidelity and what role does fidelity see itself playing in the digital asset space it's a great question laura i think when we look at the space um i'm not sure if everybody realizes this but our digital journey goes back a number of years we um we began to kind of we began to study distributed ledger technology back in 2013 2014 we began to mine cryptocurrencies just in order to get more familiar with the asset so we ended up with the with owning the asset and we realized that there were a number of frictions that institutions faced in terms of the safe storage of those assets trading those assets um and there was a lack of overall infrastructure and i think that that contributed to our decision to begin to build institutional services and products given the fact that look fidelity does engage with a broad a broad range of participants both retail investors high net worth individual high net worth individuals family offices registered investment advisors pensions and endowments so we do have a broad perspective on the traditional ecosystem and i think that we've we viewed our opportunity to be um unique in terms of providing services to institutions prior to launching but prior to launching a commercial business we implemented a couple of proof of concepts that helped to cement the thoughts around building institutional products and services so it was it was not something we took lightly and i think we also felt that there were really robust on-ramps for retail clients but no one was looking no one was methodically serving the needs of the institutional investor and looking at the frictions that they faced and trying to kind of ease those frictions so you've just kind of listed out the general client base that you have but i wonder i've wondered how has that changed over time definitely so that there has been a big there has been a pretty big shift um and i would say this year in particular so 2020 has been a a pretty significant change i think it's been a significant change in so many respects um but we've seen a a fairly strong move in terms of the institutional adoption and and when i say the institutional adoption clearly there were institutions that were trading in in digital assets or engaging in digital assets prior to 2020 but many of those were natively digital hedge funds venture firms um liquidity providers so it was a fairly central it was a fairly um small um and not too diverse group they were similar businesses what we did see in 2020 was uh an adoption of a broader adoption of that that digital gold narrative and that digital gold narrative began to resonate with other with other pockets of institutional investors namely hedge funds ultra high net worth individuals and subsequently family offices registered investment advisors that serve both family offices and ultra high net worth individuals so we saw a broadening of the base in terms of the types of clients that we were seeing engaging in the ecosystem and so that look enter fidelity we kind of speak that language we approach risk in a similar way to how some of the more traditional institutions approach it and we were also a friendly face we've probably interacted with most of these firms in other asset classes and in other ways so we became a trusted brand for institutions and i think that that that contrib that's contributing to our success here so i totally understand all that and yet i do wonder if the fact that fidelity kind of was first amongst its group to really embrace this industry if that ever led potential clients to seem skeptical about you know the fact that fidelity was kind of putting itself out there and in general you know whether or not you thought being first kind of helped um or hurt you know fidelity uh and it's in you know attempt to kind of build out this business that's some unique pers that's a unique perspective i think when we i i do think when we um i'll drop i'll draw that that parallel back to you know we we also survey clients fairly often so on on a fairly regular basis we've we've issued two digital institutionally focused digital asset surveys um one was uh one was last one was a 2018 and one was 2019. um the results of which we unveil uh we unveiled the the following year we plan to rerun this survey as well um and what we look for is general sentiment around um around digital asset adoption it into the frictions that that clients face and then we look to see you know are these trends in place and in 2018 we saw that there was some interest of uh there were some interest became kind of a a touchstone piece for us in 2019 we started to see some some increase in the adoption and the positive sentiment around digital uh around um digital assets and then we also started to see that there were some thoughts around when we when we queried like what is missing about the what is missing in terms of the ecosystem and clearly they cited some of the some of the traditional frictions like regulatory ambiguity they said also that there was a lack of traditional players and i think there was that there was the hope that more traditional institutions would begin to adopt that would begin to adopt solutions and i think now we are seeing a little bit more of that but clearly fidelity was one of the first and i think it was significant that in 2017 abby johnson chose to to address consensus it's not that would be non-typical but that that was a fairly bold statement from our ceo saying look we see tremendous promise in terms of digital assets and we're willing to take both our intellectual capital the experience that we have in other asset classes to help build a framework to empower others to adopt the digital asset strategies and so that footprint was in place and we continue to test the market as well to see look are we on the right track are we building the right tools and services to serve the the client um that we feel most closely associated with and i think also because of how early you guys were and even now still today i think this is um a pretty prevalent problem uh one of the hardest uh or biggest challenges that people face in bringing new people in crypto is simply explaining what crypto is or what bitcoin is you know or why people should care about them or how they work and i know that this is a core part of your duties is you know the messaging around this and just to underscore how important this is like one of my most popular episodes is titled something like how to explain cryptocurrency to the average person or i don't remember the exact title but something like that and a recent guest on the show dan tapiero mentioned it to me saying that for him it was one of the most pivotal um shows for him in his journey to understanding how bitcoin works and what it means and blah blah blah and um it's funny that he remembers it all these years later to mention to me you know that was the episode where i finally understood this key issue so what are some of the most common questions that you feel and what are your favorite or most effective explanations that is first of all that is a great statement and i think everyone that's involved in digital assets in spite of how the length of their involvement has kind of one of those really strong reactions to either something that someone has written or some or a podcast where they're like wow this really pulls in so many more narratives or really helps to clarify some of the things that i think about and they think that's one of the things that we that we take pride in so clearly we have an institutional voice clearly we we have um an opinion on digital assets and it's it's our hope that we can help shape the opinions of others that are thinking about investing in digital assets so we did hire someone um a brilliant young woman to lead the lead the research for our our unit and we feel very strongly that content should be part of the narrative around digital assets and you would be surprised at some of the questions that we received so um incidentally the woman's name is rio vittorio we would be lost without her she's an absolutely exceptional talent and i hope that she will be on your show at some point but she is just truly uh truly an exceptional talent and the way we've leveraged ria's rhea's content is in a number of ways so what we try to do is either explain things about the ecosystem in in relative terms so that clients understand wow i understand this parallel parallel in traditional assets or equities per se this might be the parallel in in digital assets so things like the importance of all the importance of audit so structural components around either the technology the ecosystem or even regulation but we also talk about you know what are some of the prevailing investment themes whether that's uh bitcoin has a store of value bitcoin as exposure to uh to the the venture a an aspirational venture bet so what we'd like to do is to take some of the narratives that are in play and maybe help to reinforce others opinions or others or others that have um they're beginning to shape their narrative we hope that that the writings and the the thoughts help to reinforce their own their own narratives as well so okay i think we want it to be as constructive as possible we want the dialogue to be as open and as thoughtful um we've also included some thought leaders in terms of contri you know as contributors to some of the research so we it's not just us thinking about like in a room thinking alone we partner with the rest of the rest of the ecosystem for really balanced thought thoughtful pieces and we've also taken um you know brawling we're all on zooms so we've leveraged some webinars as well so we've had a couple of webinars with um with some great speakers uh dan morehead from pantera um kathy wood from arc and we intend to kind of live continue to leverage that medium as well and we find that that really does drive home a narrative and i think when we think about creating that content we also create that content um and tailor that content based on the segment that we might be um that might be interested in so let's say it's uh a group of family offices that that content we can help to shape um for a family office audience as well so we're lucky enough to be exposed to a number of different types of clients and also another a number of different um client coverage teams that interact that interact regularly with them so we listen to their feedback and we listen to their concerns and we hope to address those those concerns and shape them in terms of uh by leveraging this content and so you did allude to this earlier but let's dive into it a little bit more how has the pandemic change or or you know any of the other related events this year change the conversation what new questions are people asking or what new levels of understanding have they had because of these outside events yes i don't think i fully answered your question around what are some of the things that people are asking about um but clearly the clearly the pandemic has um has really helped to shape the narrative around uh around digital assets so we clearly hear more from from folks that have not been have not been act active in assets in digital assets up to you know up to fairly recently but um clearly the fed actions have had a profound impact on digital assets and on the digital gold narrative and when we go back to some of the content that we've collected as a result of the survey we look at those frictions so one of the frictions was um regulatory ambiguity we're beginning to see some really constructive statements from a number of regular regulators whether it's the cftc even in their um enforcement action against a noted exchange they noted the potential yeah the the potential for for digital assets was still quite viable and great that that's pretty constructive the and clearly like a watershed event was the occ making a statement saying look it is it's okay for banks to hold digital assets on behalf of their customers that's that was a that's a critical piece so when you look at that as a friction you know we're taking that off and then i think also the the number of high-profile um you know very successful established investors either in the global macro space or the hedge fund space making profound statements around the value of uh bitcoin in a portfolio as for in terms of diversification building on that digital gold narrative that's really helped to reduce the kind of career uh risk of of investing in digital assets so i think you know clearly paul tudor jones and most recently stan druckenmiller con you know constructive you know brilliant investors um across a number of asset classes and across diverse market type market uh times um that that goes a long way as well so those are the types of those are the types of questions that we hear so could bitcoin be part of a of a diversified portfolio we seek to help clients um do the work to understand could that could they fit bitcoin in their portfolio and what and using what type of vehicle is it so holding spot bitcoin is it exposure to a fund is it um is it finding actually a professional manager to um to to uh to leverage um so someone that is experienced in digital assets or has implemented a more dynamic strategy so it really is about consulting with that client about the best options for them so currently as you mentioned before fidelity digital assets focuses on custody and execution what are some other services and products that it feels would help kind of fill out its offering well so we great question laura i think we um so we felt that uh custody and execution services really were the pillars of an institutional offering and i think we still have yet a lot to build in terms of you know a really robust ecosystem what we're focus what we focus on is when we think about institutions or hedge institutions let's say let's choose hedge funds you know head hedge fund would like to actually leverage or use capital more efficiently it's very challenging to kind of begin to deploy capital and have to place it on multiple exchanges so in building our um our execution services platform we sought to create you know one single counterparty and access to multiple pools of liquidity but i do think we can also do a better job there and when we think about easing those frictions we think about capital efficiency could we make it could we make it a little bit easier we look at the growth in lending and we look at that as a potential opportunity to to build out an adjacent service as well when we think about liquidity aggregation liquidity is still highly fragmented in this marketplace those are the types of frictions that we think about and we think about easing on for for for our clients so when we think about product adjacencies or building out a business we always think about look is this is this a benefit for our clients fidelity potentially benefit from this as well and honestly is it is it good for the broader ecosystem as well so and fidelity digital assets has also expanded to europe and asia in particular singapore do you find that institutional investors in these different geographies have a different attitude or approach to investing in crypto you know for instance do their concerns or questions differ from those of us investors or our do you find it's like different types of investor investors in those places that are interested what are the differences you see so there are a couple of differences and quite honestly actually i'm gonna go back to the survey um we opened up the survey this past the this past survey to european investors and we were actually pleasantly surprised to see the numbers um were quite robust with respect to um uh to interest both in um throughout particularly throughout europe the and that's been consistent i would say there are similar there are similar trends but slightly slightly more a little bit more regional differences um we also see that uh in north america like we don't have um mining is not as as prevalent as it is in asia we do we have more interest in terms of uh of mining operations and other um and other slightly uh slightly different um strategies that are being employed um aside from that we do see a fair amount of consistency and the same types of challenges as well in terms of aggregating fragmented liquidity and accessing markets as well and when you say in asia people are more interested in mining um obviously the fidelity center for applied technology does do mining is that what you were referring to or um what exactly did you mean by that no i think look i i just think that uh fidelity does mine cryptocurrencies um but we don't we actually don't see as we see we see a little bit more traction in the us we are seeing a little bit more traction in the us but mining is really quite an established business outside of the us that's that's really what i meant and um i so i understand this is a different uh unit you know from fidelity digital assets but i think it's somewhat of a mystery what fidelity is doing with the bitcoin that it mines and given the news this year with microstrategy and square um you know it just sort of seems like perhaps what it's doing is some smart financial move that has made big news recently i'm glad you i'm actually glad you asked that question because fidelity fidelity center for applied technology is is really you know is obviously part of our our organization and quite honestly fidelity digital assets wouldn't be here without the fidelity center for applied technology and what we do there is we study lots of different technologies so whether it's distributed ledger and we implement the proof of concepts literally there and then test their viability to for uh commercial process for to see if they can actually be viable commercial businesses so the center for applied technology is doing lots of very cool things some of which i'm not even aware of the the we think of them as our r d in terms of um making a smart making smart decisions around the use of digital assets look i think a smart decision was to allow our donor advised funds to begin to accept appreciated digital assets to fund those those accounts that was you know that was game changing that's i think that's something we come to we've come to expect from fidelity and i think that that spirit of innovation that lives in fidelity center for applied technology does bleed out into the rest of the company um the we do we own the bitcoin so fidelity does own the bitcoin and quite honestly in terms of the appreciation yeah i think it's been a decent move yeah i'm sure a lot of other companies are wishing that they'd gotten in as early as you have um so in a moment we'll be talking about a future bitcoin index fund and other federality plans but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible crypto.com the crypto

with christine sandler in august fidelity investments president peter jubber filed form d documents to the sec to establish a bitcoin index fund called wise origin bitcoin index fund one it has an investment minimum of a hundred thousand dollars so i think we could probably guess um what type of investor or client this is for but can you elaborate on that and you know just you know is this somebody who like why would would they prefer this over something like spot bitcoin look laura that's a great question i think the in in creating the product we um in in interacting with our clients as well there are some clients that that can't hold spot bitcoin in a portfolio and need that kind of wrapper of a fund in order whether it's the downstream impact of actually holding bit physical bitcoin in in a fund um whether it's tax treatment or what have you we found that there were a number of clients that wanted exposure to the asset class but did not have the luxury of holding um spot bitcoin or or it was just way too cumbersome the opportunity to create would probably not shock you that a large asset manager would have potential designs to create asset management products in in a new asset class that we that we know and love so um we are we announced the intentions to to launch this fund and primarily it's to accommodate those that really did have uh challenges in terms of of holding spot bitcoin in a portfolio so yes it's geared to institutions um you know either either accredited uh individuals or institutions and um you know we look forward to that fun launch fairly soon any date you can put on that i can't i wish i could i wish i could more to follow and you don't currently offer futures but is that something fidelity's thinking about doing it's um it's it's unlikely that we would offer futures at least in the near term um we're typically not we're not a huge future shop as an organization the um it's not outside the realm of possibilities but it's not on the near term roadmap clearly we have seen though a trend where um a lot of investors particularly on the hedge fund side have looked to futures as an on-ramp or as an entree to this asset class we can't deny that and we can't the the growth in open interest is absolutely underscoring a broader institutional narrative as well i know one thing i wanted to ask about is driving ethos behind the rise of bitcoin and crypto more broadly is the fact that it cuts out intermediaries you know that it enables people to transact peer-to-peer that it democratizes access to finance so given that premise where do you think financial institutions and institutional investors fit in in this world i think it can fit in they can fit in in many places i also it's also our belief that the infrastructure that we're building at fidelity digital assets will help empower other intermediaries to build out businesses as well and clearly we're seeing that trend so while we offer products to directly to to customers like that are investing that have investment philosophies and investment strategies predicated on on bitcoin and other digital assets we're also taking our our infrastructuring and offering it to others to help them build um digital asset businesses so whether they are payment processors or financial intermediaries that are looking to to expand their offering they leverage our technology so clearly we're potentially empowering our the next phase of competitors but we feel that the ecos the broader ecosystem could withstand that competition and the more robust the overall uh the overall ecosystem gets the stronger and healthier the markets will be and what types of businesses are you seeing interested in those sorts of solutions so we are seeing a number of intermediaries so that we are seeing some interest from banks um we actually announced a sub-custody deal with um another another custodian a custodial bank and trust kingdom trust we uh we serve as a sub-custodian for uh bitcoin for them um and we expect to see more in the space um we they may not look the same as as kingdom the beauty of this is through api connectivity you can tailor the experience to meet the needs of the underlying the underlying investors and also you can keep when you in a subcost city uh in a stop custody offering the custodian um maintains control and maintains the client experience so they retain they retain the ability to shape that client experience while leveraging our strong technology so it's potentially a win-win situation it gives them the ability to potentially propel into a new asset class without having to build from the ground up and so to go back to the most recent survey that you published in june um one fact that struck me was it said that 25 of european investors found the fact that cryptocurrencies are free from quote free from government intervention to be appealing whereas only 10 of investors in the us feel this way i guess i was surprised because i sort of view libertarianism as being more popular in the us so what do you think accounts for this discrepancy i would be speculating but my my perspective um might be shaped by i think americans feel that the dollar is is a pretty safe stable currency that may not be the same perception throughout europe where there has there had been historic instability around individual currencies and i think that may help to shape somebody's that that may helps to shape some of these opinions i think if you queried someone that was in south america i think you might see you know even you know even probably even higher numbers um definitely you know that is definitely something that we see um that's not consistent globally and we lightly touched on regulation or um the lack of clarity around it and i wondered um you know that's something that a lot of people in the crypto space have been talking about and saying they feel it's sort of hindering development at least here in the us what's on fidelity's wish list when it comes to better crypto regulation we are really excited to see um we were very excited to see the sec's reaction to wyoming's um no action letter stating that one of their banks was a qualified custodian what we think is is really important is that the period of consultation that the sec has kicked off could potentially yield not only greater clarity but a really collaborative effort in terms of shaping the thought of what me what it means to be a qualified custodian for digital assets and we absolutely welcome that dialogue so that on our wish list is absolutely more regulatory clarity and quite honestly we're almost indifferent as to what structure it is whether it's a bank or a broker-dealer or an ats quite honestly we would we'd run to the to to that regulated entity and create a business that that um was most regulated we're open to contributing to the discussion around uh regulatory clarity and what what potential best practices should be and there was news recently that sec chairman jay clayton will be stepping down at the end of the year and um i'm sure many people wish him well but i also know that a lot of crypto people who work closely with regulators were pretty excited because they feel that he's been a little bit of an impediment to the development of the space and a lot of people are also saying that this is quite positive for a potential bitcoin etf sometime soon how do you feel that a bitcoin etf or um or at least you know the the idea that there could be one soon will affect um your work at fidelity i look i think the the opportunity to have a bitcoin etf um would be fantastic i think the um while we're still talking about a nascent industry and ecosystem i do think that that's that a bitcoin etf would be met with you know great great praise and just look at the look at the recent inflows um to grayscale grayscale is is probably the only immediately accessible product if you woke up one morning and said i need to have exposure to bitcoin you can immediately access it through um through the grayscale bitcoin trust we do think that there will be more competitors coming that to balance out balance that out but clearly an etf would be um would represent kind of really broad-based access to the to the product if there's one concern are we ready for it like are we ready for that kind of volume um let's hope let's hope the ecosystem that we've built is resilient and strong enough um it'd be a horrible place plant if we didn't and fidelity digital asset has said for a while that it might offer ethereum in the future um i think an article even earlier this year said it might even happen this year do you have any update on when that might happen or what factors would would you know enable that to happen it's clearly on the roadmap laura i would be remiss if i i would be remiss if i could uh stay to date um but definitely on the roadmap and um speaking of ethereum ethereum 2.0 is coming online and already staking has become an established way to produce yields on other crypto networks are institutional investors interested in that do you see fidelity shifting to begin offering that service i think to be a digital asset custodian um and offering um and offering proof of stake assets you definitely have to be you have definitely have to offer staking services it definitely it puts you at a disadvantage um so i would expect us to to build out those services once we uh once we can support um ethereum um to be quite candid most of what we hear is bitcoin so on occasion we do hear from from investors that are seeking asset access to ethereum but most of what we still hear is bitcoin so it's still the predominant institutional narratives around bitcoin and why do you think there's such a difference in interest i think that this digital this this digital gold narrative which is the prevailing um which is the prevailing investment theme has really resonated with the more traditional side and that's the site that's the the client that fidelity digital assets is engaging with most frequently i do think the broader ecosystem has um thoughts around whether it's defy or ethereum they may have broader use cases the clients that we're interacting with are primarily interested in bitcoin and i don't know how far you've dug into the um ethereum 2.0 system of sneaking and slashing but there are some people who are saying that uh given the way that it's set up that eventually ethereum could be even more deflationary than bitcoin do you think something like that would um peak the interest of institutional investors i i would i would imagine so laura i think to be honest with you the uh bitcoin is definitely the entree vehicle for many of these institutions we still have kind of basic conversations around can you please explain what this all means so you would be surprised at some at the lack of penetration among among the traditional uh the traditional ecosystem you'd you'd be surprised we talk about it every day but this is not it's not the vernacular for many of the tradition many of the traditional um investment community yeah i mean that makes sense to me in the sense that like most of my friends have no idea about those words so um you know i just extrapolate that to probably you know the rest of the us um but just to understand kind of like the process of you know adding something new a new asset or whatever um you know you kind of mentioned d5 and i'm sure it's too far in its infancy to be under serious consideration for a fidel fidelity product but what are the kinds of like metrics you would look for or um just what factors you know would tip something over into okay now we probably would start offering this well clearly we we are a client facing or you know we're a client-centric organization so we're going to look to um to to our clients for the that the demand side of it and when we think about adding new assets we think about both the the technical piece of it the the safety and stability of that asset and then the underlying network that supports it and so those are the primary factors i would um and i think those those are the ones that we would um we would most broadly consider and then begin to do the work around look is this something that we can support with our existing technology how much uh how much of a build would it would require robust support we're not um we're typically not a speculative company so i would we would probably go pretty slow given the fact that we're bitcoin only we'll go pretty slow can i just ask because you did talk about how the creative period in your career has been more fun what is your opinion of what's going on at d5 i think it's fantastic i absolutely think it's fantastic i've it's been an incredible thing to see these proof of concepts play out in real time and truthfully the the work needs to happen on the governance side and on the resilience we need greater transparency but it has been remarkable to see these these proof of concepts play out it's just absolutely breathtaking yeah i would agree as just covering it it's sometimes just too fast to keep up so on the horizon it looks like we might be seeing more central bank digital currencies how might fidelity use cbdc's in its business well you know i don't think we've we've issued any kind of forward-looking statements around cbdc's but i do think we we believe that cbdc's will be um i think i was on a panel a few months ago and someone asked the the moderator asked would you think we'll see cbdc's anytime soon and i think i was the most bullish saying i think we will see them in at least the near term couple of you know couple of years we'll see you know viable central bank digital currencies and and the reason that i think that we will see them is i think the ecosystem is growing so quickly particularly when you think about use cases for real the real world the tokenization of real real world assets and leveraging things like smart contracts i don't think it's outside of the realm of possibilities that you would use a digital dollar or a digital a central bank digital currency to interact with that ecosystem i think they'll exist side by side with traditional fiat currencies i don't think that that that's outside the realm of possibilities at least in the near term one to two years away how that that could be used clearly to plug into an ecosystem in a similar way to how stable coins have kind of facilitated other activities and uh within the digital ecosystem as well your cto just published a blog post announcing a call for hires that included a call for more than 20 engineers what kinds of products and offerings does fidelity have in the works so we've got a lot of so we've got a lot of um great plans for the 20 engineers that we hope to to join our company um part of it is building up continuing to build out this robust resilient ecosystem part of it is executing on the existing plan that we have for uh development when we think about the products and services we will we'll go through the same analysis that any company would would go through is it you know is it better to build um buy or partner with someone and quite honestly we may um we may partner with other strong institutional players in the ecosystem to get a product to market either quicker or if we feel it's a more it's a more robust offering than we could build ourselves so look for us to to think about filling those institutional gaps with types of with products and services so whether it's activity in the lending space whether it's the reconstitution or production of fragmentation in terms of liquidity those are the types of things that we'll be working on so we think about our client needs obviously our resource our own resources and then you know really helping the broader ecosystem as well so a lending product would be something on bitcoin wherein the depositor could withdraw dollars that's something that we're thinking about and um as for the what you were describing before is that capital allocation for the different like hedge funds or other institutional investors that use your execution service so when we think about that we think we think about is the ecosystem friendly enough for a hedge fund to implement the types of strategies that they've implemented in other in other asset classes and so that's that's truly how we think about think about the development of the ecosystem so what do you see as the big gaps right now between the way that an operator could work in the traditional financial system versus in crypto things like there's a lack of cross margining so let's say you um let's say you are hedge fund along the futures lack of cross-margining across spot and futures that's potentially challenging for them i think what we've asked what we've asked participants in the ecosystem to do is to stitch together the pieces what they want us to do is to begin to stitch together the pieces for them so that is more broadly what with what we're thinking about and what we're working on all right well to satisfy the twitter trolls i'm going to ask you when fidelity retail of course inevitable we think about it all the time and we do get look and we do obviously get a lot of inbound interest from from retail clients and as we said before though for us to be a really great institutional provider we have to remain focused on this institutional client um and not to and not to uh take away from that focus the it's not outside the realm of possibilities but it's not on the near-term roadmap to offer uh to offer um access to retail retail has some wonderful wonderful robust options whether it's you know players like paypal and square that are known to them in other you know where where they use them all the time or a more digitally native um offering like coinbase there's some really robust options for for retail we feel our efforts are really more more focused and better focused on the institutional community i think we can actually help scale and breadth and resilience so from your answer i mean obviously i understand why you're focusing where you are now it seems like you know you're kind of leveraging your particular strength um but it does sort of feel you know at some point in the future that a fidelity retail offering what happened so what would need to happen before you would make that move like are there particular metrics that you're looking for in the marketplace or um you know what are the factors that would come under consideration in that decision to be candid with you i think there are so many factors that would contribute to that to making that decision the ability to to the ability to provide a really robust offering and not you know that that's that's the absolutely critical piece we're definitely a client first organization um if we couldn't provide something that's better um we probably wouldn't do it i see okay all right well this has been a super fun discussion where can people learn more about you
