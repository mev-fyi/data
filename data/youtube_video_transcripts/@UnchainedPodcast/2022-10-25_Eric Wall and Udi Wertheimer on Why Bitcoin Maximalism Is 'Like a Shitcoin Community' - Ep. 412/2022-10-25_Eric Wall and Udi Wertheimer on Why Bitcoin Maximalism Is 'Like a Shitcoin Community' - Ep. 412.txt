hey y'all ever since I started covering Bitcoin in 2015 the community has undergone a large shift this mostly occurred due to the block size Wars of 2015 through 2017 but the culture of The Winning Side has undergone an even more dramatic shift since 2017. for the last couple years Bitcoin maximalism has seemed like the dominant strain of Bitcoin culture at least in perception and online this past summer some prominent bitcoiners began to speak out against maximalism and since then there's been a noticeable uptick in the number of voices denouncing it in fact my two guests today have gone so far as to Market Eric wall and Udi wertheimer and I originally planned this discussion all the way back in August but Eric came down Sick right before our recording and because my editorial calendar was full it seemed like we had missed our moment but the trend of criticizing Bitcoin maximalism has not died down and because of bitcoin's prominence and importance in the overall space it seemed worth unpacking what happened and where Bitcoin goes from here Eric and Udi or bitcoiners but don't feel that believing in Bitcoin requires dunking on every other coin out there I found their criticisms of Bitcoin maximalism refreshing and interesting and hope that you find them thought provoking as well and now on to the show hi everyone welcome to Unchained your no Hive resource for all

here to discuss our Eric Wall crypto blogger and Udi wertheimer recovering Bitcoin Maxi welcome Eric and Moody hey thank you Laura so let's just start with how you guys each got involved with Bitcoin Eric you actually kind of like recently uh recounted this on a previous show so why don't we start with Udi yeah I don't know each time I get asked this question I make up a new story let's see what I come up with this time so I you know my background is is software engineering and I think that I always had this um interest in decentralized applications back then it didn't mean anything like what people are talking about today was stuff like I don't know sharing files on like sharing MP3 files on on on like networks like BitTorrent or whatever they just seem really interesting I think I've somehow heard of Bitcoin through that and um I think I had some attempts playing poker online at the time that was it must have been like 20 I don't know 2014 whatever so through poker I had like this notion of um how difficult it can be to transfer money to to places you're not supposed to and um and also I think you know poker had like only poker had a big issue where Apparently one of the big poker sites turned out to be like a big Ponzi scheme that never had the money so you know I had a good grasp of that concept of money that you don't actually control and you see a number but it's not really you so Bitcoin clicked like pretty quickly um for me and I think for most people uh it did at the time because it seemed unnecessary but for me like I was oh I I completely understand what this is for and you know over time I just couldn't get my couldn't couldn't stop thinking about it I think it's the normal story and start transitioning into software engineering in that space and then over the years what would you say your involvement has been you know um probably I'm trying to focus on like consultancy for software projects into crypto space so either either like open source Bitcoin stuff earlier on and then whatever crypto projects happen to be I um I do a lot of work in the Israeli Bitcoin Community um both for you know we had like there's there's actually a pretty impressive um Bitcoin community in Israel that that doesn't get a lot of of um doesn't really get into the Limelight in in the global you know Global scope of things but it's it's actually like pretty active and a lot of people are um you know since the very early days have been helping people to onboard to bitcoin um so we've had some interesting education efforts there um but you know for me it's been mostly like either software engineering and then over time I started seeing that actually there's there's like um Financial aspect of this too that that didn't interest me at all at the beginning but over time I got more and more interested in it all right Eric how about you why don't you tell us how it is that you got into Bitcoin yeah so I also tend to tell a different story each time um so I guess this time I'll say that well soon in 2011 2012 I was searching for Internet subcultures and communities online and I was into like software security and penetration testing and through through that way I I was into the dark web a lot darknet and I discovered Bitcoin there actually in 2012 and I thought that Bitcoin was the intellectuals I thought that I'd found an intellectual Center Online an internet subculture which had concentrated a lot of the brain power from all different parts of the internet um so I got into it that way I was studying computer science at the time uh and Bitcoin sort of became parallel to to my um to my academic interests so talk a little bit more about that like the culture when you first started and Udi you should answer too because I think both of you now are critics of a certain part A Certain dominant part I would say of Bitcoin culture so let's just have you describe what the culture was when you first started yeah so Bitcoin touched on a bunch of different interests and different political and monetary and computer science fields at the same time so it was this very interesting intersection between you know Game Theory Austrian economics computer science cryptography cypherpunk cyberpunk type of communities all at once which I thought made one of the most interesting places to be on online I thought that you know if you weren't into Bitcoin and you were on the internet you were not using the internet correctly you hadn't found like the the most interesting place so I mean if you go back to like the old Bitcoin talk firms was actually like a very interesting Community there was ideas not only related to bitcoin but all types of ideas were discussed widely and broadly and most discussions included very very intelligent people very knowledgeable people uh but also people coming into the discussion with many different types of views so you'd have like a mix of very different ideas and the discussions used to be pretty open you know people had different ideas but they were able to discuss them in an open way and and and constructively criticize each other there was a lot of different Dynamics there were aggressive types weird types but the conversations were sort of fluid and going in strange directions and was very interesting to follow and OD actually before we ask Udi just do you want to very briefly say like what you think the contrast is to the Bitcoin culture today oh uh I mean it's yeah it's it's changed a lot um I mean now these days you know when I got into or so when I when I started to criticize a smaller like shitcoin communities in 2017 they would respond in a very like dogmatic way they had like small script that they had been taught that's sort of how what it's like to interact with with the with the Bitcoin Community today unfortunately so Bitcoin has become like a much like like a small coin Community with not a lot of intellectual stamina or uh intellectual breadth unfortunately all right so we'll dive more into that but Udi why don't you also describe what the community was like when you first got in and then maybe you can talk about how you think has changed yeah I know I think the to me and I'm sure that every you know every person remembers it differently and by the way I did get um I didn't get an important feedback about that from a friend who told me you know you tend to look at anything that happened you know five ten years ago with some you know with rose tinted glasses and you seem to only remember the good things so there are definitely a lot of cringe weird stuff and weird debates and weird a lot of political arguments early on as well however I would say that that you know to me at least it was fun you know people were people were realizing this is a new invention they're still figuring it out and there was a lot of fun involved in doing that you know it wasn't I didn't I didn't feel like people were in the most part too self-serious about it like took it super important like this is like you know we're gonna use Bitcoin to save the world and it's a gift for god um it was more you know a fun experiment and let's let's you know let's find out what we can do and and how we can use it and I I feel like that you know sense of fun was really lost and it kind of got replaced with a sense of morality as if there is some inherent morality to you to using and owning Bitcoin and and not using and not owning it is is kind of immoral in the sense that if you if you you know if you if you're exploring other networks and then there's an immorality to it because you are slowing down the the um process of Bitcoin fixing the world to me that you know that just that that kind of like Eric says it used to be both fun and intelligent and now if the conversation is about morality then really there's not much intellect left like it's it's you can't really have a discussion about the morality of Bitcoin like some people will think it's more all to own it I guess and you're not getting some people are gonna think it's immoral to not only there's not going to be a an agreement there's not going to be like any discussion you can learn anything from and you know the point about turning into obviously a lot of Bitcoin people will not like me saying this but I totally agree that the Bitcoin um maximalist community at least not maybe not all of the Bitcoin Community but the Bitcoin Maximus Community seems very similar to the Iota Community or the Ripple community of 2018 um in the most starkling resemblance is that you when you talk to a Bitcoin Maxi you know exactly what they're gonna say so there's never ever new information presented in the conversation with the Bitcoin Maxi you can chart the entire discussion before it starts and and that is exactly what it was used to be like talking to Ripple people and Iota people back then they had the script that they got from their leaders not you know not formally and officially but just it's just the way it worked it had that script if they knew what they should be saying and um and you could tell exactly what they were going to say before they even opened their mouths and that's what it's like to talk to bitcoin Maximus today that's what it's like to listen to a Bitcoin Maximus podcast today or or a TV show or what have you so you know maybe it's fine maybe that's the way that you grow Community but it's definitely different yeah the way that the way that you see this in its most clear form I think is when you're discussing within a very with a very aggressive person who's coming at you really really hard and then when you give a counter argument to what to what that person said what he does is that he doesn't respond to a counter argument he just tags another person because he doesn't know like what is the following what do we say in this situation what do we do when the guy answers this like that's not in my script so they tag uh they tag a smarter person and then I'm like why did you attack that person with them don't you know that like oh I don't know the answer to this part like I don't I only have this part of the script ready so this is what Bitcoin Maxis does also now like when you when you answer them in a too complex way they don't you go off the script they get confused and it's very weird to see people be so sure and be so aggressive and then they're not able to like even back up with their statements to to like comments down basically I would say that what you're describing here is more like kind of the cultural aspects of Bitcoin maximalism but I was curious like is there what would you say is like the philosophy like what are the talking points generally of Bitcoin maximalists I mean they're and you know there's like there are two ways to look at it probably because and I don't think all Bitcoin maximal is defined themselves in the same way I I think there's a kind of a reasonable type of Bitcoin maximalists who would just say look I am just not interested in all the crypto stuff it's either you know too complicated too risky not interesting boring I have you know other concerns in life I have other things to tend to and Bitcoin seems to feel a need for me it gives me what I needed I don't really care about the other stuff I think that's perfectly reasonable it's probably a good you know probably a good fit for most people looking into crypto at least at the beginning so that's you know that's fine but then there's a the more extreme type of Bitcoin maximalism which it's it's kind of hard to Define exactly what they believe in but I think seems to be defined mostly by non-bitcoin things so like what defines Bitcoin maximalism well that you're not allowed to use ethereum that's that's what it means and it's you're not allowed to use a Solana and you're not that's what Bitcoin maximism is it's really not even about because if you go and ask most of the Bitcoin maximizes do you use Bitcoin daily do you use lightning Network do you use most of those people would say no or you know maybe they would say yes but that would be a lie um I'm not saying all of them but most but um so really it's not even defined by what you should be doing it's more defined by what you're not allowed to be doing and what you're not allowed to be saying and talking about again for for some reason for apparently moral reasons and I think it's it might so it's it stems I think from from um really a place of Goodwill where I think in 2017 and the Ico era really 99.99 of crypto or scams and I'm probably being generous uh it was probably more so you know and bitcoiners were just like you know some some bitcoiners at the time were already you know they made some money in the prior years and and suddenly they had a lot of new crypto people trying to sell them on the Ico staff and they you know they felt kind of targeted and a lot of them fell for it and and lost a lot of money so I think that a lot of the anti-crypto stuff kind of came from that era and it made sense back then it made sense to call everything a scam in 2017 because everything was almost you know similarly there was also the whole you know block size debate I don't think we want to get into at the time but it also kind of strengthened this this defensive idea in the Bitcoin community and and I think that in the context of 2017 it kind of made sense because there were a lot of things to defend against there aren't any more so if you look at you know if you look at the way that crypto projects Market themselves today for example it's very rare that someone would say we are the next Bitcoin I think that the only like major Point that's still doing that is to certain degree ethereum like some of the ethereum community would say that if he's just a better Bitcoin and it's ultrasound money and while Bitcoin is just sound money and it's going to replace it and it's just better in every way that's that's probably one that that still has that to some degree but almost no other coin is doing that um definitely not the big ones they're trying to compete with ethereum they're saying we're going to be the next ethereum so I feel like it's you know it's kind of just not relevant anymore to say oh you're not those coins are not a better Bitcoin well yeah we know we know they're not a better Bitcoin they're not really trying to compete with Bitcoin they're not saying that they're a faster Bitcoin for faster payments no one's saying that anymore um so I just think that that ideology is kind of outdated it used to make sense but these days it just I think you know if you talk to someone who's coming into crypto for the first time this year or last year and and they meet a Bitcoin maximalist they just they're just like I don't understand why this person is saying the things they're saying it doesn't seem too it doesn't seem to relate to the motivations that I have as a newcomer to the space and just I don't care that Solana is not a better Bitcoin that's not why I asked you about it like I don't care this is not I understand that Bitcoin is more censorship resistant and and it has a cap Supply I get it but that's not why I'm interested in buying Solana so let's either talk about that or let's you know we don't have to have the conversation so I just feel like it's an outdated narrative and it doesn't work anymore wow yeah Eric do you want to comment on that and actually one other thing I wanted to ask you about was I wanted you to elaborate on something you said in the debate you had with Justin Bonds on my show where you talked about how the Keynotes at Bitcoin conferences have changed and you said that they used to be people like Andreas Antonopoulos with a really strong technical understanding of Bitcoin and now it's more like people like Michael Saylor who you know he's a CEO of a public company that has bought a lot of Bitcoin um but obviously it's not uh someone who has that kind of level of programming knowledge of Bitcoin and I just wondered if you wanted to you know talk about that plus you know what would Udi discussed in terms of the shift that we've seen in Bitcoin I mean so obviously different parts of the community behaves in different ways but if we're going to talk about like the cult of Bitcoin sort of the Inner Circle which sort of permeates the rest of the culture also there is something that has been happening there there's this eschatological phenomenon where it almost feels like bitcoiners have the this idea that if they just follow the Ten Commandments or or the the virtues that are being communicated by their leaders they will inevitably fall into unimaginable wealth uh in the future at a some particular day down the line and everyone who didn't follow these Commandments will die and disappear so this is this is basically so it's it's it's and they give you almost like a road map for your life also it's not only you have to avoid uh Temptation like you have to avoid short-term Temptation for the long-term goals and if you do this you will also you will get a wife that will respect you and she will carry many many babies for you um so and and and if you eat the right type of food then you will become strong and so it's it's it's these kind of values that uh have sort of so it behaves very much like some weird cult that's sort of how I see a Bitcoin today and it does also affect like which who are the leaders that they tend to listen to and I when I think about like Michael Saylor I think of him like not very much different than you know what Charles hoskinson is to the cardano community it's someone that you can uh sort of disappear like he's he's has that he has this mesmerizing quality when he talks and so does Charles hoskinson and Charles hoskinson has a lot of intelligence intelligent things to say about you know uh Netscape and old browsers in the 90s and he talks in this you know worldly type of way about phenomenons and trends but it you know doesn't really get that close to what the actual technology stack looks like and what the challenges are and one thing that you never mention are the shortcomings and the mistakes that you've made so you you just focus on these very um positive aspects of the vision and the goal and you sort of charm and you draw people in that way and I think that this is one of the reasons that bitcoiners behave like a shitcoin community these days is because they follow the same type of leaders that only tell them about you know the gospel they only teach the gospel whereas we used to have normal people that were very into the technology and into the like they weren't trying to like push a gospel on you they were trying to educate you on how this technology Works what the drawbacks are and the community was more like I don't know I don't know I don't know if I would say like you know the community chooses its leaders or the leaders it changes the community I don't know like which one of those it is but it is a symptom of where we are today with the community that we don't have leaders that speak about like the the quirks and sort of the negative size and the things that we need to fix and the things we need to get better at but only talk about you know how amazing this community is and that we're the only ones that are on the path for truth and we are the ones that are going to who are going to reach salvation by following this path basically yeah I mean you go you go to a Bitcoin conference and the the main topics you will see are well the most popular topic is just macro we're just going to talk about the macro environment and then there's going to be probably some smaller tracks about what food you should eat and what kind of religion you should have like literal religion and and um very very few discussions about technical things um and even the actual technical discussions are usually about like you know tools that people build like a new type of wallet or a new type of you don't get like when you you go to you know to Devcon in in Colombia you'll see talks about Mev and you'll see talks about you know what are the risks in the move to proof of stakes a lot of the talks will be critical and to to a certain degree and and um if they're going to be discussions about the risk they're going to be discussions about mistakes that were made and how to fix them and you just don't see any of that at all in a Bitcoin conference I think there are two reasons one is that you you know is part of the culture you're not really allowed to criticize any decision that was made in Bitcoin in the last five years and the other thing is that not much happened in the last five years so what are you going to talk about you know like if you want to say if you want to talk about like like kind of the Bitcoin roadmap what are you gonna say like you I think the most honest thing you could say is well you know in 2017 we kind of at least publicly we kind of doubled down on the whole lightning thing and I think if if if if we look at the lightning in in any sort of objective way we we can pretty much determine that it didn't make a lot of impact like this that's the nicest thing I can say about it you know like it's it's just didn't make a lot of impact like there's very little users and very little activity and it's just not you know no one cares that's that's that's the absolute nicest thing I can say about it so okay so if we want to talk about the Bitcoin roadmap it's not an official road map but but what turned out to become the the room up in the last five years I think the only kind of way to discuss it is is being disappointed by it and and and thinking about what we can change for the future there's really not a way to to say that it was great because it wasn't I I think you can't you can't say that it was phenomenal um if you look at you know the last change to bitcoin it's been Taproot I guess and me and Eric level making fun of Taproot I recently went to uh I I was on stage on the main net conference and I asked the audience how many people I asked to just people raise their hands if they ever used Taproom before and there was one person in the audience of I don't know a few hundred people who raised their hand um it's just no one is using it okay I'm sorry and I know and just explain that's like a uh I forget it it's like a multi-six something or other I I forget what it is it's um you know in the way of of Bitcoin upgrades it's like this complex mix of multiple things um probably like the most immediate benefit is that it makes multi-sig a little bit easier and a little more private and a little bit but you know it's a very marginal thing it was the introduction of Schnur signatures and like localized abstract syntax trees in a combination that allowed you to do like more complex script and multi-signatures for example in Bitcoin okay but in practice it's you know it's not currently it's not very used and you know maybe you know in a few years you will see it pick up to one percent two percent usage and I mean okay it's fine there's you know there's nothing wrong about it I just think that um you could really I think it makes sense to be honest with yourself and say look there just wasn't a lot of impact made not by Tap Root not by lightning and maybe that's what Bitcoin people want to optimize for minimal impact that's not completely unreasonable but if if that's the case then I think we should be honest with ourselves and and you know and that's not the way that things are presented that like you know lightning is presented as a major success and tapu was a major success and I mean it just wasn't you know like there's no way you can that I I don't I don't think it's uh necessary to say that there were failures or something like that but it's just minimal impact and that's the nicest thing you can say about them one thing I would say about this transition we've seen in terms of the people that are um kind of the big names in Bitcoin is that just even I as a journalist would say I've noticed a shift in the sources that I would consult about Bitcoin things and I actually do feel that the censorship of the Bitcoin subreddit was a big driver of this cultural shift because I feel like people who are intellectually curious and you know just want to know the facts and kind of like you know then make their own judgment I feel like when when you get the sense that there's a place where uh people kind of are trying to make you think a certain way like you sense that and you don't you don't like that you know you you want to go elsewhere where you don't feel like people are trying to like force you to think a certain way and so I do think that that we subreddit when it became a place where you know certain views were just forbidden I do think that that really changed the culture of Bitcoin not only in what people thought but in terms of what types of people it attracted because again those intellectually curious people they would they would sense that in and like not be interested we we actually discussed this a lot in the debate again that Eric and Justin had about Bitcoin but I don't know if you guys want to add anything on that and actually the last thing I would add is I do think even the Dragonstone slack Channel which was a place where just a small number of insiders would get together and kind of plan different PR campaigns and memes to shift public opinion in their favor in this case um they were on the small block side of the block size Wars I do feel like maybe that's a similar thing again where you know it's like this kind of controlling of the media and um just trying to shape people's minds but I don't know if you want to yeah talk about the way I view it is you know there was definitely at least two political camps at the time and and we know that one of them had you know the the a certain control over the Bitcoin subreddit and they had um though that the direct the famous Dragon Den group but it's like political groups allowed to organize I don't see a you know I don't see an issue with with you know it's fine they had similar motives and they decided to organize and and and and optimize for their desired outcome I don't I don't see that as like a problem and obviously the other side did it as well you know they had uh bitcoin.com and they had their own discussion forums and their I think it's fine um but um there's certainly maybe an unwanted outcome that that you know one side one and the other side lost and decided lost lift and we ended up with um this kind of one way to think everyone else just moved on so for for a certain period of time I think it was beneficial because we didn't have to fight all the time anymore and we could focus on other things But as time progressed it just I think became more and more obvious that there's just one allowed confirmed narrative lift and everyone else just went elsewhere so that you know that might have been a loss to lose all of that intellectual power or some you know some people you know especially like again I think it's great that we don't have those fights anymore that's that's that's good but we it was at the cost of any sort of of discussion I feel like so maybe not the best one so in a moment we're going to talk about why it is that now we're seeing a wave of people kind of turn on maximalism plus we're going to run through a whole bunch

Laura Link in the description back to my conversation with Eric and Udi so here we've been talking about how maxillism became a very dominant part of the Bitcoin culture and yet this summer a number of people have been turning on maximalism it's been really fasting to watch and I wanted to hear your thoughts on why this is happening now uh it's a part of mine and Udi's master plan of course why don't you guys start about you know how it is that you turned on it well my Mossad operator called me and said look this Bitcoin thing has been going on for too long and we're paying you for years to to Make It Stop So like do something about it and I realized I might lose my job so I called Eric immediately no I I I I mean it's um I think you know I've had some conversations with other people about you know this General topic for a while and I think that a lot of people both people who have kind of publicly left the Bitcoin maximalist camp and and also a lot of people who are who stayed and are even some of those who are loudly supporting the Bitcoin maximalist Camp I think that a lot of them would agree at least privately with what we're saying here and have been concerned with this for a while you know for the more public figures there's definitely a sense of of kind of audience capture where you know maybe someone with a large audience on Twitter or YouTube or whatever you um feels like they can't really say the things they want to say because if they do they will be canceled and lose their audience and maybe their source of income and so on to me when I started realizing that I'm it's really affecting you know one the way I think and two the way that I am allowed to speak about things I was just like okay you know what I'm just gonna cut off completely I'm just gonna rip the Band-Aid off and I'm not even gonna leave room for questions because I don't I don't want these people in my life anymore so I was I was very aggressive about it and I think a lot of people end up you know in the Bitcoin Maximus Community semias is like a central enemy in the plot um but uh you know for me the benefit was I don't have to deal with that anymore you know like it's very obvious where I sin now and I don't need to like um be cautious around what kind of things I say um but I think that a lot of people have similar feelings and and maybe I don't feel comfortable being as abrupt as I was but um well I think one turning point was when Nick Carter revealed that he had invested it yeah and then he uh was attacked on Twitter for having invested in something that wasn't strictly a Bitcoin project and then he ended up writing this really long blog post saying hey if you thought I was a Bitcoin maximalist then here's some news for you I'm not um that but but I feel like Eric Voorhees long before that even also you know but he was sort of like the outlier for a long time But Eric what are your thoughts around how this shift happened a lot of people were sort of straw man the position that I have and that Udi have and that Nick has you know that we think that maximalists are uh toxic and they're mean but to me that's never been the issue like when for example when censorship started to happen on the Bitcoin subreddit initially I did like go to the other like rbtc and I think that you know maybe this is the new Reddit because we we need a censorship free separate but I later went back to the our Bitcoin forum and the reason that I went back was because the core developers were still active on our Bitcoin so our Bitcoin remained the intellectual Center so the only thing that you know I really really care about is you know goes back to why I got into the space in the beginning is because I thought that I'd identified an intellectual Center on the web or intellectual conversations were happening and so for many years like when I uh around well not that many years actually but around like 2018 2019 where I would first of all I wanted to get like Drive chains into Bitcoin I wanted to extend the hash rate of Bitcoin to apply to other chains so that I could experiment with with other functionality without like harming the the Bitcoin base layer later I found out that you know there was a great technology for this called Roll-Ups and we're now looking at introducing that thanks to UDI by the way we Udi has been like trolling people on Twitter and directing hundreds of thousands of dollars of uh money that has gone to research projects which I've actually I've been sitting on on the human rights Foundation side and delegating that money into roll-up research on bitcoin um anyway so uh for a long time I was trying to think of how do I you know get enough trust in the Bitcoin community so that I can have enough respect and Trust within the community to express certain ideas about you know different ways of architecting sidechain systems roll-up systems and I wouldn't be like shunned out of the community so I cared very deeply about maintaining the respect and maintaining my identity in within the Bitcoin Community uh so that I could change the community so that could impact the community but I think what has happened recently is that Bitcoin is no longer an intellectual Center and I therefore don't really have an interest in changing that Community like those are not people the the the the the loud bitcoiners today they are not really a community that I see uh you know I don't really see a way of changing them to become to turn into a community that you know there's any purpose really in in getting them on your side so what what I think has changed now is that you know now we basically say it but that's let's not try to you know walk on our toes to cater to what this community feels and thinks because they're not going to teach us anything they're not going to you know make us understand cryptocurrencies or Bitcoin or macro in any insightful way anyway so what we're what we're doing now was this change sort of this summer is that we're now thinking okay so the Bitcoin Community sort of sucks but there is still a great cryptocurrency here that's called Bitcoin still has very interesting attributes let's try to invite people into being bullish about Bitcoin to being positive about Bitcoin but they don't have to associate themselves with these other people that we understand they look like weirdos they're they look like a chicken coin Community they're not very smart but that doesn't mean like that doesn't have to be the end to be all and end all of Bitcoin you can still be a bitcoiner and there are people who will listen to what you have to say give you good feedback and we can sort of create a community for intelligent people who like Bitcoin this is the reason that you know we sort of said it and just came out and said we don't we don't associate we don't identify with what the community is right now so you know this is why I think people are coming out and saying you know like I'm not a Bitcoin Maximus I don't identify with those people I don't have this you know I don't have weird food politics or I don't have uh you know weird views on how I should conduct myself in a human being just because I like Bitcoin so we're just pushing all that aside and we're doing it not to just destroy Bitcoin or destroy Bitcoin Community we're doing it in order to sort of clear the field like do it like a spring cleaning for for new things to grow in this Forest that has become overgrown with a bunch of rotten fruits and meat eating flowers yeah it's like yeah I I just I think I think of that maybe similarly but also a little differently um the what we see is the Bitcoin Maximus community on Twitter and and Bitcoin conferences I think it's a very very very very small portion of the Bitcoin Community very very small if you you know if that is true that is true that is true but whenever people say this it sort of takes away the attention from the fact that it is pushing oh it is the important people away like the Carter for example who's the best spokesperson probably in the world when it comes to you know for Bitcoin mining and then you know the the the climate aspect of Bitcoin mining no there's real yeah there's real um there's real Damage Done by the small group very real um but um but it's it's it's it's very small it's very contained like if you look if you go to a conference and the podcasts it's literally the same 10 15 people that interview each other on their own podcast and then go to the same conferences and talk about the same things five times a year and five different conferences but it's literally the exact same thing and exact same people so it's it's very small and contained so like kind of the way I look at it is you know the real Bitcoin community you know there's a recent paper from grayskill saying that 80 percent more than 80 of Bitcoin holders also hold other cryptocurrencies eighty percent Plus so that that idea of only holding Bitcoin is almost extinct it doesn't exist in the real world the the real bitcoiners are in my view and and based on just the conversations I'm having with people who are bitcoiners the real bitcoiners as far as I can see are very similar to the ones that that you know that we met in the subreddits um five years ago or seven years ago whatever you know when I go to crypto conferences I meet people who hold Bitcoin almost all of them but not all of them but the definitely the vast majority of them they're bitcoiners um sure they're more interested in in maybe in ethereum or in Solano or what have you but um but the whole bit when they see the value in editor you have no intention of not holding it so kind of my goal and interest when with this you know with this speaking out is that I'm hoping that we can get more of those people who are the vast majority to kind of speak out and say hey yeah I care about Bitcoin a lot I believe in the future of Bitcoin I want to help improve Bitcoin I also like ethereum I also like whatever um maybe I dedicate 90 of my time to those other things which is reasonable you know people who hold dollars they dedicate most of their time to their job and their family and not to the dollars that they already have if we believe that Bitcoin is the money then most of the Bitcoin users are not going to be obsessed about it 24 7 Around the Clock every day and every time they breathe but they have some interest in it and they do want to make things better and I think it would make a lot of sense to shift the you know what we see on Twitter to better reflect that because that's the reality the reality is that most people who hold Bitcoin are not insane about their diets and they do not all subscribe to the same church and you know they they're they have they're very diverse set of people um and institutions you know and and what have you so I think we need more of that you know like Eric mentioned the grant for Roll-Ups for roll-up research it's interesting a lot of the money that goes into these grants is is coming from the crypto world it's either crypto funds or crypto exchanges because they're the ones making money right so when when it when the time comes to donate to some non-profit stuff that's related to bitcoin most of the money is coming from these people it's not coming from Bitcoin maximalists because they don't have money to donate so it's it's coming from from these institutions and I think that if we bridge that connection and and Eric kind of mentioned that I was trying to do that last year to make that bridge so that we can gain funding but also you know research and and some some discussion synergies with the larger crypto Community which used to be part of Bitcoin like it wasn't it didn't used to be like two separate things it used to be Bitcoin and crypto hand in hand Bitcoin was seen as like the king of crypto that's a term that people used to use it's not used as much now the because the Bitcoin Maximus Community kind of rejects that they're kind of saying no we have nothing to do with crypto and and crypto is bad it's scams and it's Ponzi schemes and we have nothing to do with that and Bitcoin is entirely different while in reality the major use case of Bitcoin is participating in the crypto economy that's still the the main thing that people do with Bitcoin right they they buy Bitcoin and then they use it as collateral or they they um they traded into other coins back and forth so that's that's the main use case so yeah so let's I just want to um describe one quick thing here before moving on because I think there's like real problems in Bitcoin that we need to discuss but um there was a recent article on coindesk that was titled the rise and fall of Bitcoin culture and the writer is someone who has been in Bitcoin since 2012 and at a certain point in the essay he calls out this you know kind of what he with term kind of a recent culture change in Bitcoin and then he just he says that this is the aesthetic best described as Boomer Uncle um on meta and he's he describes Uncle Bitcoin as Bitcoin only wanting ethereum to be a security more than the Securities and Exchange commissions q and on style conspiracies about Joseph Lubin and consensus uses outdated terms like icos and all coins revealing they are trapped in 2017 Time Warp hyper bitcoinization is inevitable even though nobody knows how a Bitcoin based deflationary economy would work in practice proof of work is the only viable consensus mechanism for all possible use cases until the heat death of the universe and then the last is some kind of Michael Saylor inspired esoteric Bitcoin metaphysics which I thought was hilarious and of course he also mentions he said you already know Uncle Bitcoin only eats steak so um it was pretty amusing um but so we've talked plenty about the culture but I want to talk now about the risks to bitcoin since you know as we've discussed the culture I think has kind of put a damper a little bit on some of the intellectual discussion in Bitcoin for people who are interested in learning a little bit more about how bitcoin's security model is under threat due to the over-reliance on fees I would urge you to listen to the debate that Eric and Justin had on the show not that long ago there's a number of things we're sort of running out of time so I just want to um talk about some of the other issues we can Circle back to that but first let's just talk about lightning which has been discussed as the major scaling solution for Bitcoin um however you know there hasn't been crazy adoption on it um at the moment it ranks 74th amongst all D5 protocols in terms of total value locked um Udi I saw you um kind of mocking a tweet from Samson Mo of blockstream who said the lightning network network has a theoretical throughput of 40 million transactions per second that's the equivalent of 14.4 terabytes size blocks every 10 minutes um so Udi yeah do you want to just start with there and it just in general talk about you know how the perception that maximalists have about lightning as a scaling solution compares to the reality yeah I think what happened you know in um we kind of backed ourselves into a corner there because in 2017 the main argument against Bitcoin and against the small block Camp was that Bitcoin is slow in order to to facilitate the needs of the mainstream it needs to be with way way bigger blocks and then the Box needs to be faster and and all of those things and kind of to win the narrative over there I think what a lot of the small camp people kind of said as well for that we have lightning and and lightning will fix that and since all of those competing coins like Bitcoin cash and and presumably you know I don't know rep Paul and Iota and to some extent ethereum they're just saying they're faster Bitcoin well don't worry about that lightning will be faster Bitcoin it will be way faster but it turns out that's not what people want like people are not sitting around waiting for a faster Bitcoin that's not that's not you know that's not why all the attention to ethereum and Solana and other layer ones happen uh last year it's not because they're fast it's because people wanted to do those activities on defying with nfts and frankly just gamble and those networks allowed them to do that they weren't concerned so much about speed they just you know wanted to make sure they're not paying you know fifty dollars per transaction or whatever which is unusable so that's the only thing they cared about all the other stuff about fast micro payments that are settled instantly like no one cares I think we kind of backed ourselves into a corner when we were like well lightning is the future of Bitcoin where it didn't even have product Market fit so you know we can discuss the technical merits of lightning and why it doesn't work very smoothly right now I I would say it doesn't but I think you know we can talk about the technical reasons for it but I think the real reason is there's just no product Market fit and if there was then either the technical problems would have been fixed because there would have been a clear profit motive to fix them or you know the technology would be changed to the point that maybe it would even be unrecognizable but it would work but clearly people don't want it people do not aren't currently looking for a payment Network that allows them to use Bitcoin quickly that's just not a thing that people are interested in right now if there were there are tons of ways to solve this problem but there's just not a just not a top priority for anyone so you feel like actually a lightning adoption has been slow simply because um it's trying to solve a problem that people don't have pretty much yeah pretty much and it's it seems like the interest that people have is not in the payment use case right now it's just not it's just not where people are and and where there is some advancement in crypto payments it's usually with stable coins and not with Bitcoin because paying with Bitcoin is you know for tax reasons and a lot of practical reasons it's just a pain so it's it just isn't in a very very much in demand a lot of people don't want to sell them but they're Bitcoin they want to buy more and stack it and and have you know and hold it for the long term they don't want to use it to pay for things so it just the product Market fit doesn't seem to be there I'm not saying it never will be but right now it's it doesn't seem like it's a major use case well let's talk about like where the crypto Market has gone and then kind of how Bitcoin could try to fit into some of these things that have taken off either of you can jump in on any of these issues I'm just trying to get through a bunch of topics more quickly so obviously D5 you know there was defy summer it was like definitely a big thing for a while obviously has dampened down with the rest of the crypto Market but you know one of the benefits of that is the auditability as we saw all these different collapses with like Celsius and Voyager or whatever at least you know these loans made with the D5 protocols they you know were the the lenders were able to get their money back so clearly there's certain benefits there we could also look at the fact and Udi I heard you talk about this on what Bitcoin did metamask is the most popular wallet uh probably at the moment um obviously it's an ethereum wallet and um I think maybe I don't remember if it supports other teens at the moment but def definitely doesn't support Bitcoin and then the other huge trend of the last two years has been nfts they tend to be priced in Ethan Saul so again Bitcoin is sort of out of that market I don't know you know when you look at these different trends that have happened in crypto over the last few years you know when you look at any of them do you see a place for Bitcoin to fit in or you know why do you think that Bitcoin has been completely cut out you know in the D5 front obviously rap Bitcoin exists wbtc um on ethereum it's pretty big it's probably the most popular or the most used you know asset on ethereum after eth itself and stable coins I would I wouldn't assume I think that's correct so and that's you know so like that's pretty good and and I think it proves that there's demand for for that kind of stuff for using Bitcoin as collateral on other chains I think it's very unfortunate that the Bitcoin you know the Bitcoin Maximus Community seems to kind of best ignore this completely if not even assign some immorality to that use case but at best edit ignores it and I think that's too bad because it shows that there's a real need and a real demand for for use of the Bitcoin asset even if not the Bitcoin network but the Bitcoin asset in that way and that's a good sign um I think that there's probably still some opportunity left there that is kind of no one capitalized on yet because it's this kind of weird taboo Topic in the Bitcoin Community but I think that over time hopefully will fix itself so that's one thing you know the nft front it's totally like I think it's a real shame that there was no attempt it might be too late now I don't know when the nft marketplace kind of wakes up again and if that happens but It's Kind it's kind of a shame the Bitcoin Community kind of distance itself from it and you know but nft started on bitcoin with with uh where Pepe's way back in the day and on counterparty which was sort of a layer to bitcoin that was a long long time ago and didn't have the name nfts but that's exactly what they were and they had a Marketplace and they had some activity and they had their own you know sense of drama um over there so and there is like this small micro Community that's still kind of doing those things but at large the Bitcoin Community seems to have dismissed nfts completely as a scam and I just I just feel like you know if the goal with Bitcoin was to make it as a currency to be used as payments and we know that most people don't want to use Bitcoin as payments right now or crypto at all as payments like most people are not interested except for with nfts exactly then whenever whenever there's a group that pops up that that shows that they do have that willingness and that's exactly what nfcs were like they you know they had full use in the billions of dollars per month with people paying with ease or with soul it didn't exist anywhere else that people were willing to pay with eth and those are new people by the way a lot of them at least were completely new so those people that went to YouTube to like look for a tutorial and then download made a mess set it up for the first time probably made a lot of mistakes did the whole stick of self-custody which is usually very difficult to you know explain self-custody to new to newbies but for nfts they went right for it even though the ux was horrible you know so they they were really motivated to do this stuff and the Bitcoin Community was just completely dismissive of that like you know what yeah there seem to be millions of new people who want to go through the crypto funnel and we don't want to be part of that at all we have no interest in in even presenting Bitcoin as a as a alternative there and that's very unfortunate I think and I hope that for the next time you know I don't know what the next big hype cycle is going to be who knows but I don't know maybe it's gaming maybe it's something else who knows but I hope that next time we can collect ourselves and and and and come up with a way to present Bitcoin as an alternative currency alongside eth and Seoul and stable coins and what have you because we have to because if we're not if they're you know if the next 10 20 million people are on board to a world where Bitcoin that simply doesn't exist then it will just end up being this Niche thing that only has people who on boarded five years ago and and very few new people so I think we need to find a way to do it in a way that you know in a way that is not scammy in the way that we're you know it's going to be different it's not going to look like Soul because uh we don't have a Bitcoin Foundation that is funding all of those things so it's going to be different it's not going to be a for-profit thing probably but I think we should be there we should participate somehow Eric what are your thoughts on all of these different areas that Bitcoin is missing out on right now yeah so I think the Bitcoin Community has identified one important uh aspect here which is that in crypto we're in in Bitcoin and it's it's going to be pretty important to be the payment rails for stable coins so this is something that the Bitcoin Community has actually successfully identified and this has been a theory of mine for quite a while that whatever the rails for stablecoin becomes cemented within the industry it will be very easy to then later integrate the the native token for which that system was built so if you if you do it for example if you do if you have a roll-up for example an ethereum roll up and that becomes the dominant crypto payment Network that it'll be very easy to get native ethereum into that payment rails but if it's lightning that becomes this payment rails then it'll be very easy to get Bitcoin in so whichever sort of payment mechanic that becomes popular that's going to pave the way for then introducing that coin but right now most people aren't making Bitcoin or ether payments that frequently but people are using stable coins like stable coins is one of the killer apps of of this industry and I was I was listening to um Michael Saylor at the Huddle Hall conference where he successfully identified this which I thought was very interesting where he said that you know we have to make we have to we have to use stable coins on Lightning because still people use stable coins if we can get them to use lightning and stable coins then it'll be easier for them to then just transition into using Bitcoin but now here's the problem so if you then take this like if you think about okay let's use stable coins on Lightning now this becomes a technical challenge so the lightning light lighting Labs has a theory like for how to solve this use case which is that they want to piggyback on the liquidity of the existing Bitcoin lightning Network so that you don't like if you want to use usdt you don't need a link of channels with usdt liquidity through all those links in order to route usdt through the lightning Network what you do instead is that you just need stablecoin liquidity in the first link and in the last link and for all those intermediate steps you swap from usdt into BTC and then Bitcoin the Bitcoin liquidity of those all those intermediate paths the Bitcoin liquidity can can be used and then you just convert in the last step so this would this is an idea that would Leverage The liquidity of Bitcoin in order to transfer stable coins over the lightning Network now the problem is that when you do this when you when you try to use lightning in this way not only do you suffer the routing fees of the lightning Network which can be like substantial actually because in the lightning Network you don't pay based on uh how much data uh you're pushing through the network you're paying based on uh how large your your actual like the amount that you're paying uh that that's what you get charged based on uh so you have you have a fee based on how big your payment is and then you also have uh in in this situation you would have two other fees also you have to you have to pay a spread from swapping it's the stablecoin into Bitcoin and then you have to pay a spread again of pay of swapping Bitcoin into stablecoin again so there's two spreads here and these spreads like now it depends on who are you connected to and like who's your route with it's not like there's one Central order book where all this liquidity is trading has to do like where have you connected to what there's their liquidity situation look like so the the fees that you will get hit by trying to transfer the centralized stable coins are probably going to be pretty substantial they won't be competitive compared to other cryptocurrency networks and you also have you're also using one of the most complex decentralized Technologies to transfer a very centralized coin so it doesn't really make sense to try to merge this already centralized coin through this complex decentralized mess that has all of these ux quirks and that also pay a bunch of fees on that but I mean this Insight requires a level of analysis and and that's the problem right it requires analysis and that's not something that is abundant in the current bitcoin climate and ecosystem like that's not a discussion that's gonna happen uh so we've talked about this OD I think that you said well you know there are some people that are uh funding these Bitcoin only type missions very aggressively that they may just you know eat the fees for the users to sort of push this in into reality but my point is that so even in the cases where the Bitcoin Community is able to identify that there are some use cases where Bitcoin sort of needs to get into then the intellectual rigor of of the community is not such that they're able to discern what is a viable technological roadmap for these experiments anyway and this is sort of the sad thing and when I was listening to that conference when I was listening to sailor talk about this I was they had a they had questions afterwards so people came up and they asked questions and no one dares to question like ask these difficult questions they're not saying about what about you know the swaps here like what about what what about the the ux of this like are we are we actually is lightning really going to be a good lightning is not even that good for Crestron Bitcoin at the moment or we are we even sure that this can be competitive to transfer these stable coins of all different sorts and flavors so there's you know there's just no pushback because you don't wanna speak against your leaders like they it's all it's it's too much fantasy and there's not enough reality and I don't think that the the current discussion climate in Bitcoin is sort of doesn't really Foster the type of realism that you need to have in these debates here's here's what I think Eric I I I I see that I see this differently I think that um as far as you know people are focusing in the Bitcoin Community more on like practical use cases like stable coins maybe I don't know maybe nfts in the future maybe something else as as long as there's an interest to focus on where there is actual demand like people have the demand for using stable coins and as long as the Bitcoin Community has some focus on that I think things will work themselves out I think that's the main thing that's been missing like there there's been for the last five years there's been this drive to not listen to what the market wants and to reject what people seem to be demanding and to have like this moral superiority of we know what's the moral thing to do and if you try to do something else you're wrong if we're taking a step step back and saying well you know what it looks like we need stable coins we need to figure that out somehow then I think people will figure it out it'll take time but I think eventually they'll find a way to do it you know maybe the the way that it will be solved is by using stable coins in a new system that will get the name lightning because the name lightning is good and has a good brand recognition but other than that has nothing to do with the lightning Network whatsoever that's fine I don't know whatever but I I think as long as people are allowed to focus on those things probably someone will figure something out uh the the main issue was that was like experimentation with this thing was what was was almost illegal in the Bitcoin Community before and if that changes I think that's that's the you know that's the main thing that needs to be broken and then I'm optimistic okay we're gonna we're gonna wrap up with two topics one is El Salvador one of the biggest narratives for Bitcoin adoption uh the past year and a half has been El Salvador adopting Bitcoin as legal tender by and large it seems many bitcoiners view this as a positive development but other people are critical noting that El Salvador's President ayuba Kelly has authoritarian Tendencies obviously that's antithetical to the original cypherpunk ethos which obviously would not be aligned with like a kind of strong man state so what do you make of this support for El Salvador's adoption of Bitcoin amongst a lot of bitcoiners even though at least for some of their initiatives such as the Bitcoin Bond and um just the general usage of Bitcoin by salvadoran's don't appear to really be taking off yep so I think I thought it was to me it was very very clear that this type of thing is something that we gotta approach with humility like we don't want to be caught cheering for an authoritarian on stage jumping around like fan girls and then being super bullish about like lightning Network becoming the payment rails for the entire country because if we do that if we're like cheerleading that narrative we're gonna fall on our faces like there's not going to be any like the volcano bond isn't going to get filled most likely and you know bukele might do things that doesn't reflect well on bitcoiners if we're sort of singing his gospel problem problem is that we did all those things so now we look very stupid unfortunately and I think I thought that was very very clear that we should you know say hey okay that's great this can you guys want to use Bitcoin will come and we'll try to help you use these tools as in a effectively enough as an effective matter as we possibly can we can try to teach you but you know falling in love with this whole El Salvador story and thinking about moving there and talking about how great everything is in El Salvador and great bukles that is obviously like a huge strategic misstep for the Bitcoin community that the community unfortunately committed yeah I don't I mean I you know I don't want to talk about the politics of El Salvador because I don't you know I don't live there and I don't know and and there's a lot of you know I don't know what the Kelly is really like I have no idea and it's it's really none of my business so like my approach to this is I don't think I should be criticizing him I also don't think I should be vehemently supporting him there's that's that's that's you know just like any other world leader that I don't know much about I think more than anything else it's kind of unfortunate it's not I'm not really concerned about how the Bitcoin Community reacted to El Salvador as much as um kind of sad that there wasn't anything else to react to in the last five years so like that's that you know ideally in a better in a in a best case scenario this would have been like small news that no one would have paid attention to that's that's the truth because the El Salvador thing is also low impact and you know we can discuss like how they could have done it differently and whatever but it's not it's just low impact what you would want to see is more focus on the high impact things and then deal software thing you know it would be a fun conversation to have once every three years but that's it that's what it should have been yeah so there's yes there is this great article by David Chapman called uh Geeks mops and sociopaths which I think everyone should read it talks about what happens to internet subcultures you first have the Geeks and then you have the mobs and then you have the sociopaths and I think the problem with cult-like behavior is that it's very predictable so a sociopath for example will very easily identify what are the strings like what are the things that I need to say in order to get all these people to trust me to get them eating out of my hand so the Bitcoin Community believes that it is that they're cyber hornets and that they're they create this you know toxic shell around the culture of Bitcoin which makes it very safe like my argument is that it's acting in such a predictable almost algorithmic way that if you just identify how to play those notes you can immediately become a very influential figure in Bitcoin and I think this is what Michael Saylor is doing very successfully I think that this was what bucket did also just say the things that the community gets turned on by and they pull down their pets immediately for no money uh is what they're doing um so this article that I'm referring to highlights that perfectly how it works the psychology then I the Dynamics behind it and I think that everyone should read that it's a lesson I think that you know just because you are behaving in a specific way it doesn't mean that you're impervious to to infiltration and if you want to be if you want to have real protection you need to be chaotic you need to have free flowing ideas you need to be a bit random there can be an ethos it can be a philosophy that can be a ethics that you try to withhold in values that you try to preserve but if your whole Community is algorithmically responding to what people say in a very predictable way then you have no defense you have no defense and this is how they're behaving at the moment all right let's move to the last big topic this um maybe actually is something more serious and important to focus on as I'm sure you're very well aware ethereum has made a number of changes in the last uh I guess like a little over a year that have changed the monetary supply to the point where a lot of the ethereum communities says that eth is quote-unquote ultrasound money um certainly the issuance has been drastically reduced it is what people say is the equivalent of three Bitcoin havings and on top of that when you combine potential High usage on the ethereum network you can actually get a truly deflationary currency which Bitcoin won't be for another like over a hundred years so I was curious you know how you thought the competition from eth and Bitcoin would play out and how maximalism is affecting that competition and you know basically whether or not you think ethereum really is a threat to bitcoin at this point yes I'll say something quickly and then you can you can take it from there so one core thing here that I think is super interesting is that Bitcoin bitcoiners big part of their belief and why Bitcoin will become the global store value and the Supreme monetary asset is because Bitcoin Supply is finite it's ultimately scarce it's the scarcest asset and therefore other currencies that if you have two currencies and they're next to bitcoin the other the other currency will just fall in value a little bit faster than than Bitcoin will preserve more of the value so this sort of Market Dynamic will just push in favor of Bitcoin so this Adam Smith's invisible hand or what have you it's just a a market effect that Bitcoin because it's most scarce will ultimately dominate everything but so so bitcoiners still have some arguments along that way but if you look at the specific Supply mechanics now ethereum is probably going to reach Net Zero Supply inflation quicker than Bitcoin does and when Bitcoin breaches zero percent inflation then ethereum might already be heavily into the negative right and it does it like so what Bitcoin is trying to say here is that well it doesn't matter like what the actual inflation rate is anymore it's the predictability of the inflation rate it's the it's the trustlessness and the ability to validate this monetary policy that is the important thing but supply and demand if you have a supply site that is shrinker shrinking faster I mean this is that this was the whole theory of the stock to flow model the whole theory of the stock to flow model was that the one that has the scarcity Supply goes up higher in value more quickly and I think you know this was this this is been a huge mistake by the Bitcoin Community to play this supply side narrative so heavily because there's always going to be these altcoins that can out-compete you on that aspect and this is what we're seeing now so like we played this you know sound money meme very very hardly very very strongly and we're gonna lose on that aspect yeah those are just some of the thoughts that I have in the southern suburb I think for Bitcoin um predictability and neutrality are the two things that matter the most those are the value propositions that Bitcoin has in other assets don't and whether or not you know how valuable it is none of us knows but I think that um if Bitcoin has a unique value per position that's what it is it's the it's the neutrality and the predictability of the monetary policy you know centuries in advance and I think it's possible that the market will value this at this more than eth if if it doesn't have that I don't think East can ever have that I don't think that's a bad thing I think Etha is different but I think they're each fulfilling very different needs so you're not worried you don't think that ethereum is like a threat to Bitcoin in that regard I'm not worried in the sense that you know I always my you know my investment thesis for Bitcoin has always been I don't know if the world is going to value that what Bitcoin has to offer or not I don't know right how was how can anyone How can any of us know such things I I understand what Bitcoin offers and I think there's a chance that the world will value that very highly and maybe not either way I don't think it's going to be influenced by Ether a lot eth is doing something else like Bitcoin does not have the ability to compete with what eth is doing and and the way that I usually um try to explain what I mean is that the Bitcoin technology the Bitcoin Network and the Bitcoin blockchain they all exist only for one purpose which is to facilitate the Bitcoin the asset so Bitcoin the asset is the focus of all of that on the other end for eth I would argue if the asset would not exist for any reason other than to facilitate the existence of the ethereum platform that's why the youth asset exists so they're very different things the ethereum platform is supposed to be like a development platform for things to be built upon Bitcoin is not Bitcoin is a specific thing it's a specific asset I don't think ethereum can do a good job of doing both of those things and I don't think Bitcoin can do a good job at trying to be a developer at platform that's not going to happen either so they're very distinct creatures you know my thesis for Bitcoin whether it's validated in the future or not I don't think it's going to be influenced a lot by ethereum and vice versa so I'm not worried that ethereum does something that hurts Bitcoin no uh interesting they can they can coexist and also they can both disappear we'll see you know on on that point of of narratives in the ethereum community I kind of feel like I have to say this you know we're talking a lot about the Bitcoin Community but I think especially for people who are listening into this who are probably mostly not from the Bitcoin Community I think that the the important thing to to take away in my opinion is that this kind of thing that happened to the Bitcoin Community is not um unique to bitcoin it can it can and does happen elsewhere and it's you know I Eric mentioned red Paul and Iota they're they're very obvious cases but we're seeing that on the ethereum side too um this sort of maximalism and assigning morality to certain you know Financial positions and immorality to other I think you know with all L1 War we saw that happening very um violently last year um I think a lot of like kind of ethereum figures were felt kind of almost forced by Their audience to take a very extremist View and saying like oh you're trying out Solana don't you know that Solana is like a scam and it's a VC trap and if you're playing that then you're hurting other people so it's it's literally immoral for you to check out uh Solana apps that kind of thinking is is not healthy it's not good yeah don't go there yeah I do think it's a less dominant um strain in ethereum culture but you're right that it does exist as well so one last thing one last thing what Udi said about you know the predictability of Bitcoin and the monetary policy I think that you know Bitcoin could maybe actually have an upper hand versus ethereum with just this predictability narrative like maybe even though you know ethereum could be more ultrasound than have deflationary Supply you know maybe that could be very alluring but maybe Bitcoin could be even stronger with having this very predictable narrative now I think that what sort of ruins that is this wrench that has been thrown into the spokes of the wheel where you'll have you have people like Peter Todd talking about that we have to oh we have to change the monetary policy of Bitcoin to introduce tailor mission in order for the security budget to work so the people who do get into these intellectual esoteric elements of this debate will then have to now balance these two arguments between the predictability of Bitcoin and then the uncertainty of the security budget of Bitcoin maybe those two things can't really shatter out I don't know so that's sort of where the complexity is in this question yeah and that's exactly what I was going to say about the programmability that if one of the Technical Solutions to resolving the security problem is to increase emissions then obviously it changes that but anyway oh you guys this was super fun um obviously there's so much that could be said about Bitcoin maximalism somehow we had this whole discussion we didn't even get to Eric's rainbow chart um there was just a bunch of questions I had at jettison but you guys why don't we just end on where it is that people can learn more about each of you and your work uh Twitter be a good Bitcoin or eat your uh don't eat your vegetables um don't listen to Eric and Udi they're just trying to ferment Division and they're trying to ruin everything so don't follow those guys my recommendation I mean Twitter I guess yeah the links to your Twitter accounts will be in the show notes yeah definitely my Twitter account I'm not gonna spell it out for you because my last name is really long so if you really want that there's going to be a link below all right you guys it has been such a pleasure having you both on Unchained thank you Laura it's going down forever Laura [Laughter] uh yeah I guess that's what you would say at this point in the cycle for this forever um thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about Eric Udi and Bitcoin maximum check out the show notes for this episode Unchained is produced by me Laura Shin with out from Anthony Yoon Matt pilchard Juan arvanovich pamajimdar Shashank and CLK transcription thanks for listening [Music] foreign
