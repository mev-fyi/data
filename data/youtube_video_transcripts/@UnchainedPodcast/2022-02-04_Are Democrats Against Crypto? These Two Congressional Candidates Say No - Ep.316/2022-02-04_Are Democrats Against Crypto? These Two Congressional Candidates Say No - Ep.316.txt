at coindesk and co-author of the age of cryptocurrency wrote about it michael said laura shin's compelling blow by blow account of the remarkable birth and growth of ethereum shows that its spectacular wealth generation was not without struggle by shins telling the story of ethereum is a grand human drama its lesson is that for all the talk of decentralized code-based virtual machines a successful crypto project's biggest challenge is that it must survive its user community's internecine conflicts and rise above the egos of its brilliant but humanly flawed founders if that intrigues

two decades of experience i started coming crypto six years ago and as a senior editor at forbes was the first mainstream media reporter to cover cryptocurrency full-time this is the february 4th 2022 episode of unchained with the crypto.com app you can buy earn and spend crypto in one place download and get 25 with the code laura link in the description today's guests are morgan harper a democratic candidate for u.s senate in ohio and trina karani a democratic congressional candidate for california's 41st district welcome morgan and srina thanks for having me thank you so much for having me laura there's a perception that the democrats are more anti-crypto while the republicans are more pro-crypto and although i know there are plenty of democrats who are also pro-crypto and there are also some prominent republicans who are anti i do think for the most part uh the more vocal supporters at least tend to be republicans and the more vocal critics tend to be democrats and there's obviously a whole new crop of democratic candidates who seem to be pro-crypto such as you um but before we actually dive into all those issues why don't each of you give us your backgrounds what you were doing before you decided to run for congress why you decided to run and then why you're pro web3 and mark morgan why don't we start with you sure well yeah no thank you again for bringing us together it's exciting to be here with both of you and and talk about crypto and you know just yeah a little bit about me i am from columbus ohio originally born and raised i had some early life experiences that just made me aware of the fact that we don't really have a level playing field in terms of people's ability to access opportunity and that put me on a mission to do something about it so i i figured out oh public policy policies driving a lot of decision making got to figure that out got a master's in it became a lawyer and then eventually worked in washington at the consumer financial protection bureau after the financial foreclosure crisis and that's when i really just started to wake up to the reality that in many ways we don't have a policy problem we have a politician problem and we need to have more people that understand what's going on on the ground and really trying to use these positions to get things done to run and win if we're going to see what i believe should be the vision of our core american value american dream is that everybody gets that access to opportunity that's why i'm running for the united states senate and uh yeah look forward to more of the discussion and then and just add at the end why you're pro web3 well you know what's been interesting and i first learned about you know things like crypto bitcoin when i was at at the cfpb and you know i'm all about trying to make sure that we have a level playing field and that we have people being able to access opportunity and what we've seen over the past 20 years especially is the economy has not met places like ohio with that opportunity there's been a lot of capital accumulation on the coast and a lot of places in the midwest are not faring as well and people don't feel like they have access to the traditional financial system as well to be able to build wealth and so you know in conversations with people about um crypto blockchain technology web 3 you know hearing that this might be something that gets us closer to level the playing field and and from people in ohio who are excited about it so that's why i want to learn more about it as well and trina what's your pre-politics background and why did you decide to run and why are you pro up three yeah of course i love all of these questions so i am running for congress as you mentioned in california's 41st congressional district and i grew up here and my parents worked seven days a week i grew up in their small business and i realized especially now that that level of hustle still doesn't support families especially here and across america and so morgan i love what you're mentioning around the wealth gap around generational inequalities and the fact that we need to be able to create new pathways and new systems to be able to allow people to get there i'm an engineer i went to uc riverside my hometown's uc and got my degree in mechanical engineering and dove straight into sustainability acknowledging the climate crisis and the fact that we need to do something now i started building companies related to food energy and water and have most recently been building a financial technology company to be able to create access to capital and the fact that most entrepreneurs most american people don't have access to capital don't have the ability to buy in to our financial institutions well i don't want to say the way they used to because they didn't really before either but especially now we're seeing a lot of these problems exacerbated across a fold when we're talking about being able to buy a home when we talk about the fact that who actually is getting mortgages who's able to be able to have the capital to do the things that they need to do and we're seeing increased disparities across the board so i think um started working in crypto actually uh with our the last company that i was building republic which also has a revenue sharing token so actually launched a token last year um to be able to create more opportunities for people to buy in and realize that you know when we talk about web3 i love the the definition of web3 right we talk about web one where it's read only right you come to the internet to consume web 2 where you're reading and writing and you know people are creating content and web 3 where we now have the opportunity to own our assets right and rather than the centralization of power that we've traditionally seen with technology we now have the opportunity to decentralize that power and actually bring profit back to the people so morgan as you mentioned you used to work at the cfpb and the founding of that can be credited to senator elizabeth warren who is probably one of the more vocal anti-crypto voices can you talk a little bit more about your experience there and how that informs your views on web3 and why you think that that could address some of the problems that you've seen through your experience yeah the cfpb was a real pivotal experience for me just as a professional as a public policy i would hope to be a leader and um and yeah you know so some of some of what i learned there as i mentioned the introduction you know is the first place where i ever heard anybody talk about crypto and that was because we were founded as an agency that was supposed to be also monitoring new developments in in financial markets that consumers might be interacting with and we had a team that focused on that and it was that team that started coming back you know from california talking about um people being interested in this space and starting uh you know different companies or investments and things like that and so i wasn't really responsible for that as part of my portfolio of course you know in the 2012 2013 we had much uh bigger issues in some ways that we were facing with still dealing with the the outcomes from the financial crisis and all of that but um but i i noted it and i was um this is interesting and you know the the other thing that i would say about the cfpb that made it unique is that is it was founded to be a data-driven agency that you know there's this perception that the federal government and i will say honestly it's a perception that i held before working there of the federal government's just always bit behind the eight ball it's a lot of bureaucracy it's not cutting edge but that we wanted to be an agency that was directly you know engaging with people getting getting information actually asking and collecting more information by having things like a consumer complaint database hearing from people directly about what was going on and different markets that they were participating in and then coming to the table with people who are in industry consumer advocacy groups all the experts to then be best informed to make good policy and develop appropriate regulations that both understand the opportunity of different products but then are protecting people from the risks and you know that has informed everything about how i think about public policy and it's interesting i i'm i've been surprised especially during this campaign about how scared people are of disagreeing and you know i put some of that at the feet of big tech uh which is you know one of i i think our main problems right now as a society just in terms of breeding this polarization and people everybody getting in their rabbit hole and not having to really interact with people who have different opinions than they do but that's something that we need leaders to be aggressively working against and bringing us together to talk because we can't have people going to congress to develop public policy to be leaders in a place like the senate or or the house who aren't willing to engage with people who have different opinions than they do and especially on this topic i mean you know i i can't speak for any other elected official but just you know to me they're very they're very few things that we could just be hard no on you know especially when they're somewhat newer we need to be in a posture of gathering information and doing what's best for the people that we represent and you know again my orienting principle is if there are people in the state of ohio that are interested in this that are finding that it's creating pathways to wealth that they hadn't experienced before then i need to be representing them in a in a good way and getting more information and supporting them and then yes also understanding how we mitigate any risk but at a minimum you know be in a posture of openness and understanding as we think about you know different policies and regulations and one thing that i noted was you wrote up a tweet storm about how you felt the real issues when it came to consumer financial protection really had to do with existing financial institutions in the traditional financial system as opposed to scams and frauds in crypto i mean although of course you acknowledge that those do exist in crypto can you also talk a little bit about that well you know it's interesting and i'd be curious that sharina has this this experience as well whenever we're talking about something new people like to pretend as if what's come before is flawless right and without any any weakness and and that's what i wanted to emphasize in that that tweet thread is that we have some real issues within the existing financial system that a lot of people have just acted as if it's its normal course that of course we're gonna charge people fees because they don't have you know enough money in their account even though it's perfectly possible for the bank to know when they are approaching the end of their balances and to warn them of that and then not have them do an additional transaction that technology exists but instead we let banks ignore that information and then continue to charge people things like overdraft fees that are just predatory and really targeting people who don't have a lot of money in the first place and extracting more more income and wealth from them and so i want to i want to always shine a light on the truth is one of my goals as a person and again as a leader and and to not let those types of arguments shut down any discussion of the future because it's a very typical rhetorical tactic i've found and especially with the existing financial system and especially with you know a lot of i would say black people different communities of color who have been left out of the traditional financial system uh honesty is the only way to get people to take you seriously at this point because people know i mean it hasn't the traditional financial system hasn't been serving them in the same way and there's more awareness of that than ever and so you can't just again have this position of hard no when we have people who know exactly what the weaknesses are and are looking for better opportunities shrina your campaign is interesting because uh and i i believe it's the first congressional campaign that sold nfts for fundraising and when you launched them you wrote up a post about how you felt that they helped solve some problems with political fundraising can you explain what you mean yeah of course well i think the reason why we did the nft drop had a couple of sort of motivations behind it i think first and foremost morgan i love that you're you're really highlighting the fact that education is a big problem here that we have to look at the past and say hey we've had some real problems in the way that our traditional institutions have existed and so if we're looking at why inequality exists in the first place um we have to look at how things have been done before and so i think step one is educating the american population we talk about educating the elected officials and we need to make sure that we're bridging that gap to the rest of the community right um and so i think part one is is education right how do we make sure that we can get more people on board to even understand what this new pathway even means and what it looks like and then when we talk about political fundraising i'm sure morgan can attest to this but it it it is not fun right when you sign up to be a candidate you're doing it because you want to change things because you want to get policy done and instead you're being told that you have to do 30 plus hours of fundraising on the phone talking to donors right and trying to get money because and this is something i was just looking up last week but female candidates on average actually lag behind by about half a million dollars in terms of their marital counterparts and what they're able to raise and so especially as a female candidate especially as a woman of color you're really trying to make do with a lot less compared to your competitors and to the other people that are in the field and so you have to get creative and i think nfts were a really interesting way for one it sparked a lot of conversation around what is an nft what is crypto a lot of people in the area say oh yeah there's a new stadium right didn't the new you know stadium get renamed crypto.com oh yeah i've heard of that i i think i know what that is um and actually being able to facilitate a conversation around well i thought you know you're a pro climate uh you know a strong bold climate agenda candidate how can you be supporting crypto how can you be supporting um something that has such a massive environmental impact and it's like well we did it on solana our uh footprint of an entire nft drop was a couple of dozen google searches was the equivalent right and so acknowledging that yes this is an industry that has had a footprint that's because we're still relying on non-renewable sources and so if we're able to have a more renewable energy mix first of all we'd address this problem you know at its core and a lot of these technologies are taking on if you look at ethereum in 2022 they've committed to changing to a proof-of-stake technology right and so we're seeing changes in the industry to actually commit to these things so i think being able to further the discussion around this um has been an incredible opportunity for us with the nft drop um and of course helped us you know save quite a few hours on the phones uh to help with our fundraising friend of porter that's great so in a moment we'll talk about the effect of um adopting crypto on your campaigns but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible join

morgan and sharina uh before we went to the commercial break morgan it looked like you wanted to add on uh the discussion i was having with sharina about fundraising yeah yeah well because sherry really hit the nail on the head i mean the fundraising aspect of running for office is one of the primary reasons why more regular people don't run and uh and i and i think that it's not a surprise that there is a pretty big overlap between people who are attracted to more independent types of candidates i yes i am a democrat proud to run as a democrat but i am doing this in a very different way than most democrats who have run for office especially in the state of ohio in that i'm not taking corporate pac money we're individually funded and it's that grassroots model and it gets at this idea of we have had a generation of deferring to traditional power structures to parties that then tell us what we should be believing and who should be who's best positioned to represent us and we're in this era where i've said it a couple of times but the jig is up to an extent and we don't know if these people have actually had our best interests at heart and we want to have people that can be firmly on the side of doing what's right decentralized power having more freedom over our lives and then also elected officials that recognize that's our goal um not in a in my opinion a false far right way but in a true ownership and having the ability to really um build your life in a way support your family in a way that isn't just deferring to these traditional power structures so um to me that's you know that's one of the key parts of having political leadership that is free to do what's right and then also people who are in this space i think have this idea that yeah some of these traditional financial structures as well haven't really served a broad swath of the population getting to that place of economic freedom and one of both you know support candidates who get that but then also um because that's the vision that we have for our lives is you know being able to have more ownership and control and so since adopting a pro crypto stance what effect have you seen that have on your campaigns and then extrapolating from that what effect do you think crypto in general will have on the midterms i can start um and it gets at one of the things that trina actually had mentioned in terms of environmental impacts i mean that is one you know especially as someone who i i identify addressing the climate crisis and recognizing the opportunity and addressing the climate crisis from an economic perspective as one of my top priorities and investing in renewable energy in a place like ohio that is positioned to be a manufacturing leader that we make sure that renewable energy is a core part of that as we rebuild our manufacturing sector for some people you know it can seem inconsistent to you know be willing to talk about crypto blockchain technology and also have that position as a strong climate advocate and so you know it was interesting for me to hear how you know street has been talking about that and and you know making sure that people have full information about existing environmental or energy usage from the some of the technologies are that already are in place and then yes of course doing whatever we can as we explore the opportunities with blockchain crypto to minimize any negative environmental impact i think it's it's possible based on the conversations that i'm having with people but that has certainly been a common question that i've gotten but you know also though i've had a lot of people in ohio who have reached out once they saw that i was talking about crypto and blockchain to be supportive and talking about how they've had the experience of you know being able to get a little bit of a financial cushion for the first time in their lives and a lot of women who have reached out saying you know i haven't heard a lot of women talking about crypto it feels like it's been a very you know male dominated space and that you're out there is is really encouraging to see and and then people who don't feel like they fit into any political home or category that are reaching out to say you know happy to see someone that you know they would never follow a democrat otherwise but this is interesting to hear you talking about this and that you know might be willing to support so on a number of fronts um very you know interesting reactions and sharina what about you yeah i would say a lot of my experiences uh very much echo morgan's right in terms of being able to reach new people people who often see the world of politics in black and white democrat or republican and i really like what morgan said about the fact that we are here to put the issues first right if our job is to serve the american people then we need to make sure that we're actually representing the interests of the american people and a good chunk of americans own crypto right and so this is not something we can put by the wayside this is not something that we can ignore and we actually have a responsibility to address to make sure that people have guidance to actually work within this industry in a legal way right people are looking for tax reporting frameworks they want to make sure that they're actually following the rules but there are not very clear rules to follow and so i think we have the opportunity to continue to educate the american population we have the opportunity especially as a congressional candidate we were talking about the fact that california has a lot of congressional districts and the nation has a lot of members of congress and a lot of congressional candidates and so finding ways to really separate yourself from the pack i think is also a way that we can continue to sort of lead the conversation in terms of what innovation looks like what it means to have elected officials who are open and willing to work with technology and with new pathways to actually create more access for more people so i think there's a lot we can do here when it comes to education when it comes to sort of setting ourselves apart as an american people in terms of how we're approaching crypto and being able to create pathways for more people to actually participate so at the moment the administration is definitely considering a number of different different measures for uh regulating crypto you know when it comes to things like stable coins or you know tax implications i mean there's there's just any number of issues that they're looking at if you were to be elected to congress what regulations would you want to put in place i'll maybe i'll start in the administrative because i actually i wanted to also go back to just the role that this will play in the midterms and i think the administration talking about that uh connects connects to that question as well where you know we do run the risk i would say those of us on the progressive side of things democrats as there's this perception out there that we're the party of no no no you know and whether rightly or wrongly and that you know we're not on the side of supporting you know entrepreneurs or businesses small businesses even medium-sized businesses to an extent and so you know i do think it's important that we have a posture again of being open-minded and talking to people who are building in this space and and this is you know just another example of that and so i i think it's good that you know the administration is saying and projecting that they're going to put out an executive order and gather more information it sounds like you know it's going to be gathering more information from different federal agencies that might touch this space and figure out what what the opportunities and the risks are as we move towards appropriate policy solutions and you know just based on a lot of the conversations i've had it sounds like that's what a lot of people in this space are craving and it's very consistent with what i would hear at the consumer financial protection bureau people want to be able to know what regulations are to then have more predictability as they're building companies and innovating in the space and so um you know what the the specifics come down to i'm you know still kind of figuring that out but my sense is people are actually looking and welcome you know having a real discussion about substantive regulations and what they might look like yeah at the risk of uh sounding like a broken record i think it really does come down to education right i think that the first step which is why i'm also excited actually about this executive order is that we do need to gather information and we do need to look to the different agencies but also the industry to take a look at you know what what do we need what guidance are people looking for and i think that comes down to a few things and i think as the industry continues to evolve and as we continue to talk to folks in the space i'm sure we'll be able to build out the list of things that we need to fully address but i think some of the basics include tax reporting frameworks right we need to make sure that exchanges actually understand what they need to do to abide by federal regulation because there really isn't federal regulation and so how do we make sure that exchanges understand how to do that how do we look at kyc aml and cft frameworks in a way that actually protects people's privacy but also abides once again by federal regulation and make sure that it's consistent with the basic values of crypto when it comes to transparency and openness but also privacy right um i think there is an opportunity to have safe harbors for new types of organizational structures we have the rise of dowse we have this ability for people to sort of organize in a way that doesn't necessarily have precedence and so what does that look like from a regulatory perspective and so i think ultimately what it comes down to once again is education making sure we understand where we are now as an industry and what needs to happen moving forward but also creating that space for innovation to continue and make sure that we're not over regulating and actually stifling that in that innovation but allowing it to happen within a sort of safer capacity and so morgan kind of addressed this earlier in the conversation even though i didn't ask it directly but i did want to ask you sharina you know as we mentioned some of the more prominent democrats such as elizabeth warren who is very influential in the democratic party like she's uh criticized bitcoin for having a high genie coefficient uh meaning that the wealth is quite concentrated in the hands of a few uh she said things like defy is the most dangerous part of the crypto world and you you just mentioned like uh kyc aml and i know the administration is kind of maybe looking at trying to apply that to um what are called self-hosted wallets which are just you know not not wallets on an exchange but i just wondered like you know what what would your message be to some of these more prominent democrats who you know have this more negative view about crypto i think once again it starts with education right we need to make sure that we're actually listening to industry and looking at some of the facts right as we talk about kyc aml and cft where is some of this you know more illicit and nefarious activity actually happening and the majority of it's still happening for one in a cash-based economy and it's secondly happening in traditional institutions right and so the percentage of crypto that actually has some of this activity is incredibly small and so i think we have to look at the data we have to once again look to industry experts and actually understand what's happening in the space um and sort of set the the playing field to a certain extent to be able to address that we still don't know what's going to happen in the future we are at the very beginning of this new type of technology and we need to address the fact that we're at the beginning and and there are a multitude of pathway that this could go and how do we set regulatory frameworks that once again allow the innovation to continue while doing it in a way that isn't exacerbating inequality that is actually allowing new pathways for more people to enter the space and make sure that we're protecting privacy we're allowing people to custody their own assets in in a way that is safe and understood and can be regulated um but also allows people to control their assets in a way that um traditional institutions just don't allow great and so what would each of you like the crypto community to know about you that's a that's a great question well you know so uh coming back to one of the points that you all were just talking about because i do think this is really important that that is another topic that people come to me you know since i've been tweeting and engaging different podcasts and all of that is this is just a replication of the problems with the existing financial system this is not decentralizing anything this is replicating the centralization of power that is one of the reasons why we have uh income and wealth inequality in in the us at such a an alarming rate and that we have to get to the bottom of and so that's one of the things i'm always asking people about is you know is this truly open right and are we you know what are the transaction fees looking like are we replicating existing problems so i think that is important to to talk about the other thing that i would say you know in terms of what i want people to know about um me but then also just something for the crypto community to think about as they're engaging with different political figures is you know just a couple of days ago here in columbus i had a debate with one of the republicans who's in the primary for the senate seat josh mandel who is someone who is very active in the space and and i believe talking and engaging with a lot of people i think there's a real risk whenever anyone is is considering themselves a one-issue voter that you need to be very careful about what are the other things that people stand for and even if it's not it doesn't feel like it's very important to you if there's somebody that maybe you like on this issue but is also questioning separation of church and state for example is that really going to be furthering the vision that we all have of economic freedom of of decentralized power of the type of country that we want to be living in and rights being respected and so uh you know i i believe it's important that the community exercises an appropriate level of discretion in terms of who they're supporting and what else they stand for to make sure that we're all we're all shooting for the same thing and i believe that we're best served by a country where we're respecting people's rights but then also yes jointly working together to try to decentralize power and achieve more economic freedom shrina yeah thank you so much for sharing that morgan i have actually a very similar perspective when it comes down to as you're assessing the political landscape and as we're building out the crypto industry a lot of it comes down to the basic values what are the things that the crypto community values that a lot of the words i've i've heard used are openness our transparency our grassroots are ways that we can create a new system that actually allows more people to participate more people to actually own the system that we're building together right how can we turn users into owners right it's a conversation that we have a lot and as we go back to those basic values looking at the political landscape in terms of which candidates which policies are actually reflecting those values that you care about and i love what morgan mentioned around not being a single issue voter because there can be discrepancies and there are so many nuances across all of the issues and so going back to the basic values of this new system of web 3 of this new industry and this new world that everyone is trying to build together now and making sure that that's reflected in in the the people in the elected officials that are going to be representing you and are going to be carrying your voice on a congressional level um and so i really hope that people sort of take the time to actually assess you know what is it that's important to you who is representing those values and how are we making sure that we're building a future that is more sustainable that is more equitable and that is safe for people to participate in that you can have your privacy that you can make sure that you and yours and future generations are going to be able to continue to live the life that you would want them to live

great all right well thank you both so much for coming on unchained thank you oro thank you laura don't forget next up is the weekly news recap thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap the second largest hack in d5 history wormhole was exploited on wednesday for 120 000 wrapped eth according to twitter user tony intern the attacker was able to steal almost all of the wormhole wrapped eath which accounts for 20 of the 1.6 billion dollars in wrap teeth locked into solana with ethereum hovering at around 2600 the exploit is worth over three hundred million dollars and ranks as the second largest hack in d5 history data from wrecked shows wormhole is a cross-chain bridge meaning wormhole locks assets into a contract on one chain and mints a wrapped version of the asset onto another chain according to paradigm researcher sam cz's son the attacker spoofed a guardian signature and minted 120 000 eth on solana without having to bridge eth in the first place a guardian is a node that signs off on transactions between chains by creating a fraudulent guardian signature the attacker was able to mint wrapped eth on solana out of thin air and moved the fake wrapped eath to
