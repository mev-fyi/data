or use the railway app at railway.xyz today's guest is Jason Gottlieb partner at Morrison Cohen and chair of the digital assets Department welcome Jason thanks Laura it's great to be back with you the SEC has been in crypto news for all sorts of reasons recently let's start with a big one sec chair Gary gensler's dancing around the question of whether if is a security in the housemaking Committee hearing earlier this week what did you think of chair gensler's refusal to say whether or not ethos is a security look eth isn't a security it's uh frankly pretty obvious to me but even if it were it's too late to do anything about it at this point right the SEC has statutes of limitations it was first issued before five years ago so there's really very little that uh the SEC could do about that right now now statute of limitations are very complicated thing so there's a lot of asterisks there we won't get into that here but I think that chair Gensler is facing an uncomfortable reality even if you wanted to do something about it there's nothing he could do about it and he knows that if he's caught in a sort of trap there if he declares yes I think eth is a security it could have all sorts of terrible knock-on effects in the market and would really have a devastating effect on the consumers that he's purporting to try to protect on the other hand if he said well eth is not a security then you'd have a hundred thousand crypto projects saying we're just like eth what's the problem here so he was he's caught in this very uncomfortable position where he doesn't want to say anything but of course if you have the chair of the SEC who can't even tell us a basic thing like whether eth is a security and then in the same breath tell us but everything in crypto is very clear the rules are very clear the guidelines are very clear it just comes off as as nonsense to everyone else who's listening to that I I mean I guess something that surprised me in your answer is you very clearly said that Eve is not a security but chair Gensler has implied in the past that all cryptos aside from Bitcoin are securities so what gives you the confidence to say that but also then since he's kind of said it before like why didn't he just say it I mean I guess you kind of answered that but anyway I just find a lot of this sort of contradictory all around it is and it it speaks to the absolute mess of ambiguity that we're struggling with in the crypto markets it's one thing for the SEC to wave a hand and say we think all digital assets or Securities uh but obviously that's nonsensical as a point of view a digital asset is software right and you can sell it as part of an investment contract there that much is clear but what's really new and truly Innovative about cryptocurrencies is that you can separate the the software the digital asset from the investment contract right you couldn't do that in the old days if somebody sold you a stock certificate on a piece of paper and that stock certificate came with rights to dividends and ownership and voting you you couldn't you couldn't take the the rights and the essential Securities off the piece of paper they were stuck together right and if you took that away all you got is a piece of paper you can't do anything with a piece of paper but you can do things with tokens right eth is something that you can use for all sorts of things whether it be technological building or payments I mean I I I paid Gabriel hey Anderson eth to send my son a a birthday message it's hard to say that I engaged in a Securities transaction there uh with our our machete wielding uh screaming friend so it it makes no sense to assert that this is a security and it's another example of the SEC trying to shove cryptocurrencies into Securities rules that aren't built for them but however let's just say hypothetically that each does get named to security at some point in the future like what would be the knock-on effects of that how would that change the way it's traded or um how would that change the asset itself well it would have an immediate hit and you can see this from every single time that the SEC has attacked projects either directly when they say this project token is a security or when they in as in the case of the of the sec's case against wahi uh and we've seen it also in the New York attorney general's case against kucoin that declared ethos's security whenever a regulator comes out and says this token is a security the value of that token takes a hit because there's immediate doubt in the marketplace about what's going to happen am I going to be able to buy or sell this on exchanges our exchange is going to be forced in some way to consider de-listing them and in this way you know myself and many other folks who practice in this area have been decrying the sec's targeted efforts to attack crypto projects particularly when they're not in the room to defend themselves because it it ends up damaging the very consumers they're trying to protect all these people out there who hold if take an immediate hit on the value of their Holdings for really no good reason at all like nothing has been accomplished so this is far from being investor protection uh it it really is harming people who are holding eth in the markets so now let's talk about the other big news well there's I feel like there's so much big news around that's easy this week but on Monday the SEC charged bittrex with failing to register as a broker dealer exchange and clearing agency and in the complaint they listed six tokens including algo OMG and Dash as being Securities what were your takeaways from this complaint and what do you think it pretends for future enforcement actions on exchanges I think that the takeaways the SEC is going to continue its pattern of Regulation by enforcement and in particular regulation by enforcement against people who aren't in the room against absent parties right there is nothing that OMG or or Dash or iht or Mana can do to intervene in that lawsuit or to stand up and say hey wait a minute this is wrong we're not Securities or even to employ the kinds of defenses that we alluded to earlier on say statute of limitations issues right right from the very beginning of the bittrex complaint the SEC is saying from 2014 to the present bittrex made available all of these Securities and then if you dig down further into the complaint you see that the allegations are that OMG did an Ico in June 2017 and started trading on bittrex in July 2017. that's more than five years ago which takes a lot of the types of causes of action that the SEC could possibly bring pertaining to OMG directly off the table but they're walking in through a side door and doing it here so when you think about tokens that they have scrubbed to make sure that they're not Securities they've got the strongest argument they can to say that they're not Securities but the SEC gets to just come in and label them Securities and in a few paragraphs in a complaint and they don't have to meet any statutes or limitations it really does a grave disservice to the people who put in all the hard work on those projects and all the people who are holding the tokens for those projects well what about exchanges that listed those tokens like OMG and dash and algo so it puts exchanges in a very difficult place because exchanges might wonder do we now have to delist this or are we going to get in trouble can the SEC come after us we're just listing this and I think to be honest there's a little bit of enforcement fatigue that's set in in the industry when the SEC first declared that xrp was a security a lot of the exchanges said okay we understand where the SEC is coming from we don't agree but we don't want the trouble so we're going to quietly delist xrp and then when the SEC came out in the wahi case and named nine other tokens Securities I think a lot of exchanges set sat back and said you know something we're not going to let the SEC just willy-nilly name things as Securities and force us then to take them off of our platforms because between that and the settlement with poloniex where the SEC declared that many of the tokens were Securities but never actually identified which ones it then becomes a complete guessing game we have no idea what the SEC is going to come out and name next or why so in sort of a Fool's Aaron to to try to start guessing which uh which of these tokens maybe the sec's next Target and whether the SEC can possibly improve any or all of these cases in a moment we're going to talk more about enforcement actions against exchanges but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible

conversation with Jason the SEC also recently filed charges against bixie saying it operated as an unregistered exchange some are saying that this case could be a playbook for how the SEC could go after coinbase so what did the SEC take issue with in regards to bxc and why is this being seen as a precursor to a potential coinbase case well if we look at both bxc and bittrex we can see what the SEC is focused on they're focused on section five of The Exchange act which deals in affecting transactions in Securities section 15a of the exchange act which deals with being a broker without a license and the section 17 a little B of the exchange act which is performing the functions of a clearing agency without being properly registered as a clearing agency in the bittrex complaint and in his testimony before Congress Gensler went a little further on these points to say that these are traditional exchange functions that have been separated in track five markets to avoid conflicts of interest that might occur up between these functions in in effect transactions exchange transactions brokering transactions and hearing transactions so you know he's describing this very traditional Trad fire world and telling digital asset exchanges we think all of your digital assets are securities and therefore you must fit yourselves into the boxes of being a Securities Exchange or an ATS a broker or a clearing agency and that's what you can do and that's all you can do these are our rules follow them or you're done and I think that you know that portend is very poorly for a lot of the industry because that attitude would suggest that there is literally no way to be a digital asset Exchange in the United States because let's face it you can't be a clearing Agency for digital assets that may or may not be Securities you just can't follow all the rules for that you can't be an exchange or even an ATS you can't follow the rules for that and if you want to have digital asset Brokers then and Federer needs to approve digital asset Brokers and the SEC is not letting that happen either so on the one hand the SEC is saying hear all the things that you're doing that are bad and all you have to do is follow the rules but what they're not saying at least out loud is oh by the way you can't possibly follow all these rules unless you give up the whole digital assets thing and just go back to traditional Securities the overall effect of that is the sec's rule is simply no you can't do crypto in America and that's the reason we're seeing people increasingly start to move offshore and so is this why when chair cancer calls on crypto companies to come in and register that people say this is sort of like a disingenuous statement because there isn't anything that they can actually do in that regard that's absolutely true and uh commissioner purse has called that out saying you know we tell them to come in and register and they come in and we send them home with a court date you know what has happened when I've gone in to speak with them and when others of my colleagues have gone in to speak with them we've gone in with projects that want to do the right thing that really want to register and find that there are problems in the rules of regulations that won't let them follow those rules they just can't do it with digital assets so all the well-meaning projects out there and the vast majority of these projects are well-meaning right if they're calling me if they're calling other lawyers and saying please help us follow the law we want to talk to the SEC and figure out how to follow the law these are these are not the fraudsters in the space these are not the Bad actors these are the people who want to do it right and want to follow the law and we go in and talk to the SEC and what we hear time and time again is well you know we see some problems with that we can't give you legal advice on how to structure it the right way so good luck to you and this just hasn't been very helpful we've been asking literally for five six seven years for a rulemaking effort that could provide a path to follow the law because the good actors and again they're mostly good actors they want to follow the law but they find they're caught in this trap where if you want to do digital assets it's virtually impossible to follow every bit of these regulations and that's a big problem it's a big problem in America because it leads to a situation where uh we are not allowing a path for good actors to be out there which means a you're abandoning the space to some less good actors in in some instances but be the good actors are are going abroad or uh foreign run companies are stepping into that reach so if we want to honor investor protection in America and and we do we have to provide a path for people to actually be registered to be lawful and then we can look to those investor protections if not we're basically telling investors sorry you're on your own you know go somewhere else and maybe they go to a European exchange or BVI exchange that are are following rules and are registered and are very good but maybe they go to some other exchange that doesn't have the same kinds of investor protections that we would like to see and that's just bad for American investors yeah I saw another argument like a slightly different way of saying the same thing which was in the letter by House Republicans on the financial services committee they said that they didn't believe that National Securities Exchange regulations made sense for digital assets because cryptocurrencies can be used for non-investment purposes so that was like another way of saying like you keep you know trying to fit fit these companies into a certain box and and it doesn't work um so now let's just talk about this effort to expand the definition of an exchange which I feel like this is maybe a a more challenging or even bureaucratic and therefore more boring thing for uh people to wrap their heads around but can you explain how it is that the SEC is proposing to change this definition and how that could impact the crypto world yes so the SEC has a proposed an amendment to uh rule 3b16 which talks about requirements for exchanges but by expanding the definition of Exchange in the proposed rule on which they invited comment there were numerous comments from people in the crypto industry that said hey hey wait a minute hang on a second the definitions that you are proposing would sweep in D5 would sweep in a decentralized protocols and force them to do things that they literally cannot do so you know anyone who's uh listening to your show is going to be familiar with D5 and D5 protocols but effectively it's just software so if you have a software protocol where people can interact on a peer to protocol basis with that software there's a limit to what the software can do it's designed to be limited so that it can be simple right you you perform your functions and everything is going to work the way everyone thinks it ought to work and that's the reason that you don't need the human intermediation but what the exchange rule Amendment would propose to do at least at first they were they were doing it in a super sneaky Way by not mentioning defy at all it would sweep in defy and say the D5 protocols have certain obligations for uh reporting and and other kinds of other kinds of obligations that typical exchange would have that makes no sense if you're dealing with just software right there is no human there to keep track of all the records and make sure that they're doing the reporting so a lot of crypto companies said hey wait a minute you're Sweeping in defy in ways that that D5 cannot possibly accommodate and for that reason we should slow down on this in last Friday's meeting the SEC agreed to reopen the comment period which was the only Silver Lining here but the storm clouds surrounding that silver lining was that uh chair Gensler made it very clear that yes the The Exchange act amendments were designed to apply to DUI and were designed to sweep in D5 and as a result you know there's a comment period open and I do encourage everyone out there to get in uh comments you know send your comments into the SEC but at the end of it I don't have a lot of optimism that they're going to change the rule as it is so I I think that we're going to see actions you know potentially being considered against D5 protocols under these rules which is going to be a a complete mess because it the rules are nonsensical to apply to D5 protocols and I think in the enforcement actions would similarly be nonsensical I completely expect the crypto industry to flood the SEC with their own comments on this just as we've seen in the past but at the end there where you said that it would be a complete mess what would that look like for the SEC to regulate defy in the way that it seems they're proposing through this rule change I mean in a way to use a very you know Silly analogy right if D5 Protocols are are just you know their fruits like they're apples their bananas they've got their one thing that they do it's an apple you can eat it that's what you can do and uh you know the sec's exchange rules are basically mandating that uh all fruits should be mammals should be bears and you know the Apple can't be it just can't be it doesn't work so we're going to have some enforcement actions uh against apples uh blaming them for not being bears and it doesn't make any sense to do that I think what we're giving up is the idea that D5 can work in principle at all the SEC operates through intermediaries right when we talked before about exchanges about Brokers about clearing agencies these are all about intermediaries because the SEC and in fact the the rest of the federal government has decided it can't possibly look everywhere wear all at once for everything the the federal government is not Michelle Yale they're not everything everywhere all at once so they've decided to rely on these intermediaries to do their policing for them if you have a defy protocol what that does by its very nature is disintermediation we don't need the intermediary because we've got the software and the software is going to work the way it works every time and that's it and instead of looking at that software and thinking that's interesting how can we develop this further to try to avoid hacks to try to avoid people who are manipulating the software in ways it was not designed instead of thinking about the ways we can try to innovate but protect consumers The sec's Exchange rule is saying well you know if you can't if you're not an intermediary then you can't do it at all and again this is just uh you know it's it's blaming an Apple for not being a Securities Exchange yeah SEC commissioner Hester purse his commentary on this was quote it seems perverse to me that we would be encouraging centralization um and she was referring to you know just all the collapses that we saw in 2022 and crypto among centralized entities well Jason this has been an extremely Illuminating conversation

trading on the Bluebird app Twitter is partnering with etoro to bring crypto trading to the app this is shocking I had no idea that Twitter did not already allow crypto trading why is there so much spam etoro is a social trading platform for Mom and Pop Traders so if I had to guess I'd say the crypto Traders on the app are mostly on the pop side Twitter has also launched a hashtag feature where if you type a dollar sign before a stock symbol you'll get the stock price although I just tried this with Twitter's own stock and got an error which is probably a bug apparently the hashtag symbol has been used 420 million times which seems kind of suspicious 420 really why is Elon Musk a parody of himself Bitcoin is one of the most searched terms but I imagine we won't get the exact number until it hits 69 million this follows the news of PBS and NPR quitting Twitter over being labeled government-funded media which does seem harsh I once interned at NPR and I can assure you they're funded by basically no one must be somewhat relaxing to be in Elon shoes right now though like you can't make Twitter worse thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about Jason and the sec's
