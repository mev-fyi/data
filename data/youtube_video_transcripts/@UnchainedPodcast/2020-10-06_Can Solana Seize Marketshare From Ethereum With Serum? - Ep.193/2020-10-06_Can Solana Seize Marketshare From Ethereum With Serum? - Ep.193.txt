advisor to project serum and anatolyakovenko co-founder and ceo of solana labs welcome sam and anatoly thanks for having us yeah thank you let's start with each of your backgrounds sam you have your hands in number of different things in crypto plus you're famous for your tweet threads and i have often seen a lot of people on twitter wondering when you sleep so why don't you tell us how you came to be involved in crypto and what are all the things that you're working on yeah so uh you know i guess my background i i went to mit serve had no idea what i was doing there um stumbled into uh finance ended up being a quant trader at jane street capital um and and partially because it was an opportunity for me to potentially be able to donate a lot of money and partially because it was just a really good environment and i i really liked it um and they're very good to me and it was sort of a an exciting job um so i was there for a bit over three years and then 2017 happened and i sort of had an itch to to start something an itch to you know go go on my own and try building something so um i left and ended up starting alameda research uh which is a uh crypto quant trading firm and so it does you know arbitrage quantitative trading otc trading market making things like that um across the crypto ecosystem you know trading something like a billion dollars a day uh notionally um and i you know that was sort of like chapter one in crypto uh for me and then later on on 20 i spring 2019 i started up ftx which is a uh you know global crypto derivatives exchange um and and you know kind of been growing that out um to uh it's also you know somewhere around a billion dollars a day of notional and then uh you know more recently i started up project serum which is a uh decentralized ecosystem built on solana um and then to sort of like get your point about doing a lot of things and and you know how i managed i mean i think part of this is that you know i i i get i have this itching and i get super impatient if i feel like i don't have enough on my plate if i feel like i have more slack then i sort of feel like oh boy there's something i can do with that and so it's a few the things i do naturally expand to fit that um and i you know i think a lot of this i think really a huge part of this is having a team that i trust i think that's something which like there are a lot of really good teams in crypto but even there's a lot of really bad ones even a lot of the good teams don't have trust and so it's like you don't have the ability to uh to uh you know grow beyond yourself in some ways um and uh and so anyway that that sort of helped a lot um so i i nap now and then i have you know bean bags uh under my desk as as has been voted it's a you know bed in a side room at the office and uh you know i'll often just like get a few four hour naps in uh and uh you know go back to posting on twitter in between and anatoly how about you how did you come into the space and what do you do with solana labs um i guess i'll start with my background too um i went to school in urbana-champaign like 99 2003 so i was there through the dot-com crash and i remember my advisors telling me that like computer science might not be a good career choice uh i had a actually one of the solana labs co-founders greg and i and a couple other folks had to start up doing voiceover p stuff they didn't pan out because of dot com crash but we ended up at qualcomm i spent like most of my career working in optimizations like kind of trying to make this like you know this this was at like you know before iphones right like we're trying to take all this desktop complicated software and stuff it into effectively like a you know microcontroller embedded system that people were calling a phone and try to make it work um so that was like kind of where i cut my teeth as an engineer and it was a ton of fun and always like kind of a constant challenge and solana actually comes from that like period solana beach is a town in san diego where we used to kind of we uh like you know wake up surf bike to work by comb surf again um that was a fun decade i ended up in san francisco in 2017 and he's kind of saw this like crazy boom for crypto during that time um and i had a startup with another one of the qualcomm co-founder steven we were trying to um this was like a side gig we were trying to buy deep learning hardware and offset the capital cost of this with uh crypto mining right like i'm sure there's people pitching the stuff still but like this was purely for fun right like how do we like get a bunch of gpu cards together and do something fun with it um but both of us started really like thinking about like what is proof of work why does it work why is it interesting um and i had this light bulb moment literally had like two coffees and a beer was up till four in the morning and i realized that you can use the same you know premature resistant hash function but instead of measuring how much enthalpy goes into the puzzle you can measure how much time goes into the puzzle that it solves so and like once the light bulb went off i had this you know like i realized that all the stuff we worked on at qualcomm like this decade of like working in wireless protocols like optimizing stuff for communication it's all applicable in blockchain because all you really need is a source of time outside of the system like before consensus um and that was really kind of the foundation of the company um i was kind of lucky in the timing too um qualcomm was being taken over by or there was an attempt to buy qualcomm by broadcom and like a bunch of people weren't happy and were kind of scattering to like the googles and facebooks of the world and i knew a lot of the super senior like operating systems like network people and got them on board and to join up and build this thing and philosophically we kind of took everything that we learned from optimizing mobile platforms mobile operating systems and ported into a layer one and i think we kind of have this unique perspective that um you should always be building for hardware that's gonna come out two years from now which a lot of folks i think don't have in the space for listeners who are maybe wondering why they're on the same show um hopefully you figured out if you don't know about pro project serum that it is being developed on solana and so there's a lot of interesting things to mine um around this issue of uh you know stuff that anatoly mentioned and um yeah just around scaling and different layer ones and where things are gonna go um but let's actually maybe just dive into the main problem that well as far as i can understand that i think you were trying to solve with solana um which is around scaling here we have a lot of layer one chains that are attempting to solve this with a technique that's called sharding which spreads validation across the blockchain into smaller pieces but that essentially makes each shard its own blockchain which then makes it harder for decentralized decentralized applications to interact with each other across the shards and solander takes a different approach to scaling how do you do it and why did you take a different approach well i i'm i'm actually like curious why people took didn't take our approach but basically this comes down to like um like the foundation to limit the communication is like the shannon hartley theorem right you have noise you have power and you you can stuff it as many bits as you can and you can increase power to overcome noise but the bandwidth of the channel like how much bandwidth you have is the limiting factor and this is true for like complicated systems like layer ones or like radio towers as well so like when you see you know like what is like 4g to 5g it's literally just using a wider set of frequency bands like just more bandwidth right to stuff more information through these pipes um and the way we approach this in like mobile is to use more hardware use more cores more silicon because this stuff is improving at an exponential pace every two years somebody's going to double capacity like we just saw in video release um a card 30 90 or whatever that's got 10 000 cores so from our perspective like when you have something like a blockchain which is limited by you know like how many participants you can concurrently keep track of and how many packets per second you can send across the network and how many folks you can talk to they're fundamental limits to these algorithms right folks have r d has been done already right since the 80s and 90s um and our approach is then okay well how do we increase the bandwidth of this thing just horizontally scale it on as much hardware as we can and two years from now it'll be double that right and like that this is an exponential curve that you just really can't fight um like if you're if you're fighting against this curve you're gonna lose so fundamentally this has been our approach to scaling this but um the reason why i think uh another kind of philosophical reason why we went for the this path is that i think if you get rid of the store of value as a use case and i'm not sure you can argue that proof of stake networks are fundamentally store value what you're left with in a smart contracts platform is price discovery right you have a single like kind of engine for state transitions those state transitions have financial value and everybody in the world is trying to extract free money out of it it is by definition like like an exchange right it's not like a spot exchange where you have bids and ass and things are kind of simple right you have these really complicated programs that can do arbitrary things but you look at this giant mondo state machine and you do your best to figure out hey is there any free money here if there is i'm going to send a transaction to get it right and everybody in the world is doing this so if that's the case right if our only use case is price discovery then what we need to build is something that is moving as fast as the news that a state transition occurs somewhere like i mean meteor strikes some cornfield right and we need to change the price of corn that should reflect across the world as fast as you know information travels for fiber right and our job is to like get those state transitions replicated across the entire world as fast as we can so this is kind of like the use case that we've been building for and how we've been approaching this problem and i think kind of like it was awesome to meet sam because i think he kind of like i remember him actually saying this like in in our conversation that we only really need to be as fast as the news and this was like the first person actually talked to that realized like i think had the same intuition about the the world that like stuff that's faster than you news is just trading statistical noise it's not actually important this is so fascinating i love the way that you describe that about how a blockchain is almost like an exchange and people send transactions to try to extract value i i love that description yeah and i i just actually also wanted to quote from kyle simani of multicoin capital who has invested in solana um and he just described you know uh something about the layer two issue which i the way he expressed it was so fascinating to me because mainly because so many developers are working on layer 2 solutions he wrote quote developers building smart contracts don't want to deal with layer 2 and sharding or cross-chart application state and logic or cross-shard latency or security models in side chains or liquidity routing and stage channel networks or how they might run computations off chain using zero knowledge proofs the entire point point of having a smart contract chain is that the chain itself abstracts all of the lower level complexities and economic system necessary to deliver trust minimize computation allowing developers to focus on application logic so yeah that was that was really interesting the way he expressed that because like i said everybody is working on layer two um but something else i wanted to ask you was that you've said that solana can handle 60 000 transactions per second and right now i think you have about or selena has about 130 nodes so you know on the other hand bitcoin has over 10 000 nodes ethereum has about 9 000. do you think that 130 nodes is sufficiently decentralized to not be vulnerable to attacks or even collusion as some people have surmised has happened with eos which also has a limited number of nodes so all i mean i interested in what you say i'll say like one thing that i've noticed here is like i you know what does what exactly do you mean by decentralization because you know one sort of interesting thing worth noting is that like if you look at for instance ethereum as it is right now and you look at the miners who control the security effectively of this you know the distribution of hash power by miners it's the top three have more than half the hash power and it's in fact like anything like a little bit less decentralized than like this lana validators are right now it's also the case obviously that solano like launched recently and that number is sort of like growing exponentially um but it's like one thing that strikes me whenever people ask about sort of like number of nodes on it is like you know what's the goal post here i i think this is like a key question um and this isn't like a question about like us versus ethereum um because i think this is a question for like the chief security officer like visa who's going to take a bet on running stuff on these networks and how do they analyze security and censorship right like how do they actually like how are they going to approach approach this problem assuming like everything we say is meaningless right like from their perspective words are meaningless what is what is my risk that i'm taking by using anyone in one of these networks and the way i think you can analyze this is you can look at whatever algorithm you're using nakamoto pbft there's some threshold to where the network breaks right and then what is the minimum number of machines that i need physical entry to get to that threshold um it's with proof of work it's actually like 51 will get you there right that's it's lower than that but like it's without arguing with anybody with any professors 51 is clearly that but with proof of stake it's low it's 33 in some cases it's a little higher depending how you tweak things um so then the job of like like when we ask what is decentralization it's that minimum stat and ethereum it's pretty low and so in bitcoin as well uh we kind of run in this world where we don't have any like attackers on these main networks because the reputational cost is just too high but you see stuff all over on ethereum classic right so like if cso of bitcoin or or see like a chief security officer a visa is going to look at how do i deploy money on ethereum they're going to sandbox that risk assuming the network can easily be taken over so like they do things like circle and usdt where they effectively control the funds and they honor the redemptions when they when they feel like it right and they can freeze your accounts and things like that but at the end of the day the funds are at like bitfinex or circle right and that that's this is how like i think where these networks are still immature even what we consider mature ones like like bitcoin or ethereum when you go when you look at proof of stake um tesla's cosmos every proof of stake network right now out there um have about like less than eight entities that control 33 of the network so those numbers are still pretty small um our test net called tour de soul it's about 90. so it's like 10 times bigger than that our mainnet is about eight as well and that's simply because of stake distribution right like capital when it's lazy it just kind of goes to a single spot and it's got this pareto distribution where most of the top tier validators attract the most capital right most of the top tier mining pools attract the most hash power and this is what's keeping these networks centralized and it's not really a question of how many copies of the ledger you have how many full nodes you have that that's a meaningless number it doesn't add to the security it's not going to make like the chief security officer visa any like feel any better if there's 10 000 copies of the ledger if three mining pools can basically break all their assumptions about security okay so i don't know if i like really understood every last thing that you said but essentially what you're saying is that the way i frame the question is um it's not like the comparison doesn't really make sense because of the fact that there are these concentrations of power where if you do know the three people who when you add them up together they can collude then you can target a small number so in a way it doesn't matter that solana has a small number is that what you're saying uh we actually well we one so one point is our main at is about 180 full nodes validators our distribution on um task net is about 480 so it's much much much higher um than just like three or five but the number of full nodes right but you were saying it's three for ethereum so the number of no the number of full nodes that add up to some meaningful threshold in the consensus is what matters not the total number of full nodes because the copies of the ledger are meaningless right okay yeah that's what i thought you were saying okay i think sometimes just like actually a lot of chains could probably use quite a bit more decentralization in you know the effective weight of who's validating these or producing these blocks and i think that includes almost every chain in the world if you're not willing to rely on things like reputation and people you know not wanting to to nuke and get fully slashed in order to try and attack a chain but another thing i think worth noting and i think this is almost like uh commonly misunderstood and i this must until i thought about it is that you can scale up the number of validators on solana you can scale up a lot and like it you know it sort of has been growing and probably will keep growing if the network keeps growing you know if the number of users do and the key things it doesn't like really hurt performance that much so it's not like this is the only way it can get this number of blocks through is by having this number of validators now i think antolino is way more about this than i do but it's not a fundamental limitation you know in any way okay so it's not like eos where like they had to have a small number of validators to keep that high throughput so so um when we say like i and this really surprised me in the industry like that people weren't measuring tps this way like for us tps is a meaningful number because our consensus messages are smart contract transactions so our capacity to process like transactions like serum transactions or payments is the same as the number of consensus messages we can use and that what's limits the validator step so like to me like doubling tps but not doubling the number of validators that can participate in consensus is like almost like a joke right like that that's not like a meaningful doubling of anything interesting right like it's kind of like you're cheating right like you're stuffing more like kind of fake transactions into a single meaningful one and and batching a bunch of them and delegating that decision to somebody else so um kind of like for us right like the way i see it is like for this space to succeed we need to get to a point where we have like 3 000 machines that are required for somebody to get physical entry to stop the network and at this point like somebody that's like at visa or mastercard are going to look at this network and be like well it's probably mathematically impossible to go do this right to do this attack unless there's like a like a bug in the in the technology itself right but like actually physically go find these like 3 000 people and break into their like setups and get a hold of their private keys and then sign in valid state right that's kind of an insurmountable problem and at that point we will start being competitive with real regulated financial networks so for us like every time like nvidia doubles their cores right we double our capacity for tps which doubles the number of validators that can participate in consensus which allows us to get to that meaningful number where somebody that's at visa or mastercard just kind of gives up they're like oh okay this thing is just impenetrable like let's go use it because it's cheaper it's less of a headache right like to actually go use this versus deal with the red tape and like all the other stuff that they do and this is like to me like kind of what we're striving for as fast as we can so on our test net we're running this like a ton of mistaking agents that people are running instead of staking directly and this is what allows us to evenly distribute the stake across like almost all 500 validators and this is why it takes like overall you know around 100 or so to get up to that 33 number and when the validators have doubles we can like keep increasing this kind of like decent meaningful decentralization threshold you keep mentioning visa and mastercard and i have to say this has thrown me for a loop so you're envisioning the likes of visa mastercard wanting to use solana is that it i think sam is like you know like an entrepreneur that's way ahead of his time right because he has vision that like all finance is gonna a good chunk of finance is gonna run on these systems because they're just better right they're like they don't require any people right you build a software it runs on the thing that cannot be broken into right there's no like all the all the craft is taken care of there's other people like that that want to take down visa and mastercard right but you're like target like who who do you what's your vision for solana like who will use it and what it will be used for because for you to keep talking about visa mastered was not what i was thinking i i think like like i guess the way i see it is um if we get to like a number like we meaningfully have meaningful censorship resistance like it takes you know one to three thousand machines to be break into to censor the network we can start moving real finance over right from like traditional finance down to these systems and the early adopters are going to be folks like serum because they're cryptocurrency traders who already get it right but like who knows maybe like sam starts a like a large-scale credit card company next right like and starts competing directly with visa mastercard because he sees the tech is there and it's super easy for like a million people in malaysia to aggregate funds to lend to a mortgage in san francisco like i don't know right like so but it would be decentralized okay this is okay this is what i was confused about right okay so yeah i think it's like the business model of visa and mastercard like the companies but you replace their internal ledgers with a public decentralized ledger and so it's like you actually take you know the the technology of the company and you get it on chain okay now i get it because i was a little bit like okay now i get it yeah yes you're talking about a decentralized version of visa or mastercard not the actual okay well who knows maybe there's maybe there's some visionary product manager there i don't know right like i don't know the organization all right we're getting and we're getting this like getting super speculative um but but you know right now you do have this ability i believe um i've seen that you have claimed in other articles that solana can handle 60 000 transactions per second but i was checking the stats and right now it's about 450 or 500. so why do you think solana hasn't yet seen more crypto projects or you users migrating to solana i mean tps is kind of like um it's capacity right that capacity is there but people need to have like a meaningful reason to go use it it's like why would i switch operating systems or why would i go from ethereum to anything right like this this is kind of a build it and they will come is a really bad way to um get product market fit right we have to like have a meaningful reason for somebody to go do this and with serum they just couldn't do it anywhere else okay so we are going to talk about serum in a bit but i actually first just want to dive a little bit more into solana because you use an algorithm called proof of history which you you know sort of alluded to in the abstract earlier can you explain what that is and how it works yeah so um so there's folks building these things called verifiable delay functions um and there's some very sophisticated implementations of these that have all these complicated cryptographic tradeoffs our approach is what you know a bunch of hardware qualcomm folks would do which is shout to 56 in a loop that you sample so recursive shot to 56 um it's because it's recursive it's a thing that has to run on a single core single thread and because it's running in this kind of single threaded environment it is the speed of which it can run is bound by the fabrication process at our modern day fab like dsmc or intel or global foundries because that process is kind of so like fine-tuned and exact at this point in you know in our state of technology right like uh we have a very you know somewhat granular but a very good approximation of how much time it takes to generate any number of these hashes so we can effectively approximate time based on the number of hashes produced by this process and for for an attacker to increase that number meaningfully they have to build a better fab and that's a 40 billion dollar investment so that that's kind of a very very expensive proposition um for somebody to try to you know get something that's you know 10 times faster something like that so from our perspective this is kind of like you know you think of proof of work and uh bitcoin and asics as kind of this physical bound that secures the network um proof of history is not uh it doesn't secure the network it allows us to schedule things in a very kind of compact way where there's no gaps and this is what allows us to kind of scale throughput scale the number of block producers per second like increase censorship resistance and you know process more transactions it's not a security thing but without it to maintain a high level of security we would have to reduce group up and your block times are counted at milliseconds right yeah so right now the block time is 400 milliseconds um i would like to get them down to like 80 milliseconds which is the round how how long it takes for a speed of light to go around the world through fiber okay yeah well i i mean for i can understand for trading on a global market that yeah that would be uh the goal but yeah i mean this is obviously a huge leap in terms of block time because you know we started with bitcoin it's roughly every 10 minutes ethereum's like kind of every 12 to 15 seconds um yeah so this is definitely much faster um but one other thing that i just wondered is when i was learning about this proof of history and this like clock problem as i guess it's called i was kind of like how is the time of a block different from a block height right you know because like if you're if you're thinking of time is like just every single so so obviously the way we do time is like you know it's like um year month day hour minute right second but you can you can create like a unique number from that and so in that regard you can think of a block height as also like being a unique number so then i sort of didn't understand like what what how is proof of history different it just sort of seemed like a different way to describe the same thing do you know what i mean like which is a way to put blocks in chronological order so um people think of proof of work the bitcoin blockchain right you can estimate how much time it took to build it right but that estimation is using interpreting the chain as a source of time after consensus so to give you an idea why that matters is like you know first radio towers went up two towers transmitted at the same time over the same frequency you get noise right because those waves interfere and information information can't propagate through right you can't you don't know what what's being transmitted so the really the first optimization people tried is they gave everybody a clock that's synchronized and they can alternate by time so how well that clock is synchronized how low the error is between like the drift and the clocks is how fast they can alternate so modern day like cellular networks are like roughly every i think the slice is like five milliseconds at this point um because the clocks are so well timed and so well synchronized um so that allows you to increase the number of participants that can transmit per second and that is exactly the same as um the number of block producers that can transmit per second because if you look at bitcoin right it's got this puzzle that's designed to be solved once every 10 minutes no matter how big the network gets because if um two people solve it at the same time you get effectively an undecided state of the chain right we don't know which is the the actual final block right so then that's noise that's kind of similar problem to to the electromagnetic interference um so with bitcoin the way they try to solve it is by the increased difficulties such that it's really extremely rare that two blocks occur at the same time ethereum is probably the fastest possible implementation of proof of work like this like once every 10 seconds kind of thing our approach is to use this external point of reference as a source of time which is the number of hashes that somebody has computed not the actual value of the hashes it's just like give me a data structure that shows that you spent like you know 400 milliseconds somewhere spinning in a single core like prove to me that you waited right and because you have to prove for like 400 milliseconds and samus to prove for 800 milliseconds that gives you a slice of time to transmit your block and sam is forced to delay until your block is done um and then that reduces the number of concurrent blocks in the network and we can effectively kind of start stuffing more block producers in the same second oh so that so then because i was going to ask you what happens if two blocks are mined at the same time but you're just sort of saying like it's not that doesn't really happen it because yeah so so it does happen and that consensus takes over just like it does in proof of work or pbft or any other chain it's just we're like all of it all of engineering is taking the best case and doing your best making it the average case most of the time okay and so so then so if there are two two blocks that are mine at the same time that's where your proof of stake part comes in is that yeah okay so so okay so we're going to discuss a little bit more about that in a moment but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible

anatoly okay so yeah so this is because i i was you know doing all this research and i was like wait there's proof of history plus also proof of stake i was like what is going on um but but that is the answer is that if two blocks are mine then the staking comes into play is that yeah so steak so staking is the sybil resistant portion that is kind of like proof of work solves civil resistance with electricity because you can't you know you can't use the same electricity twice and we use proof of stake to solve the same problem but the actual consensus algorithm is based on pbft which is practical byzantine fault tolerance okay which i don't know what that means so do you want to give a really quick description um that's basically the the i think i mean edmund will argue that avalanche is not pbft in its own thing but i think every proof of stake network at the end of the day is pbft if it comes to any kind of finality um so it's it's a algorithm that was discovered by barbara liskoff in 99 i believe so it's fairly recent if you if you think about research um and it's a way to solve the n generals byzantine generals problem nakamoto the proof of work algorithm the the consensus algorithm used with proof of work in in bitcoin is is another solution to this famous and generals problem so pbft is a way to do it with um cryptography and some way to do you know if you have cryptography and some civil resistance you can kind of build these things on top of something that has you know good enough communication like the internet and and the general problem is or the the the way to describe it is basically how to um create cooperation amongst different people who don't know each other and and do it in a way where they can kind of communicate effectively that's sort of like my very general way of describing it it's a way for uh well like it's based on this uh famous problem which is called the byzantine general or the ant generals problem where you know you have some number of generals and constantinople and if all of them attack at the same time then they win but if some of them don't then they lose and they're trying to send messages between each other to coordinate when they attack and the problem is that constantinople can you know depending how the problem is set up they can you know stop the messenger so they can create their own spies at some fake messages and things like that so how do you solve this problem under different kind of modes of attack vectors um so pbft is one such solution there's a there's other solutions that have other assumptions and nakamoto is probably like you know that's the most famous one all right so you have this blockchain which as we discussed has the potential to process orders of magnitude more transactions than existing blockchains but right now or at least the most recent number i could find was that there's only six daps currently on solana or maybe it's maybe it's a little bit more than that um and i know so i know we haven't talked about serum yet but we will in a second um but i do know that serum is interoperable with ethereum and i wondered in general you know and this was sort of something that came up earlier in conversation with him like is that your strategy for getting more activity on on on your chain to try to attract d5 developers from ethereum like what is your playbook for getting activity i mean like our so like i think that the space is still really small like if you if you look at the number of you know guess how many github users have coded in solidity like take a while for 4 000. it's 840. oh really if you if you just do a query on github like how many like users have have like have code that they submitted in solidity it's pretty small right so really small um but that that's not to say that like 840 engineers is like a huge engineering company right that's like 200 million a year an inch burn for something absurd right like that that's like a lot of people right that that are building stuff um so it's both small and large enough to where it's kind of um it's dumb to ignore ethereum right dump to bet that something is gonna grow bigger than it um and my view on the space is that with proof of stake networks and smart contract platforms you kind of end up in this like kind of fungible block space world where it doesn't matter where the transactions run right it doesn't matter if like users with some issue token and ethereum they whether they do the exchanges on uniswap or do it through serum they really care all they care about is that they have token a they got token b at some price right or they have like both token and token b and now they're providing liquidity right and earning a yield or something like that they just want to interface with the crypt with crypto systems right they don't really care about ethereum unless they're maximalist which is fine um because you got to build your tribe right but like at the end of the day right you got the users that want to trade it's not going to be really important to them where those orders execute so all we need to do is kind of build some cryptographic certainty about that execution and route it through you know from ethereum to serum and somewhere else and back to ethereum huh okay so so you are it sounds so it sounds like i was right that sir the reason that you made serum interoperable is like that's kind of your your strategy of forgetting activity it's a big on-roading thing like right now everyone has metamask and no one has soul flair sulfur is like the you know one of the most common solana wallets or solid or or one of these but not everyone has it obviously but in d5 at least if it has metamask and so a lot of this question is like you know what does interoperable mean there's a lot of different layers of this but like step one is you start with some ethereum in your metamask wallet and somehow you have to end up using this new chain and like or you know making use of it somehow and maybe eventually everyone's got solana and everyone's got spl tokens in their wallet and then this is like no longer like a crucial step but like at step zero no one has them and we can get there and are you trying to get spl tokens used in metamask well there's a lot of different approaches and like you know we would certainly be super thrilled for metamask to support like that'd be really amazing there are other things you can do too though where you can build your own applications that can uh you know interface with metamask and can you know utilize the the ethereum that you have on it which is what it's doing right now so right now the kind of first bridge that came out it's a solana-based wallet solid but that you can hook up to your metamask account and have them talk to each other okay yeah so let why don't we just talk a little bit more about serum um so when people go on there what will their experience be and like who are you trying to to target because serum is um like a more like a central order book type of experience rather than these automated market makers that have become very popular in d5 so does that mean that you'll attract a different type of trader or um are you trying to attract the defy traders or you know right tell me yeah it's a good question and the long answer like the sort of like long long long vision for this like ultimately is sort of everything like like sort of ultimately the answer as an only said is like can you get a significant fraction of like defy and and crypto and like the world's financial ecosystem maybe the world's technological ecosystem happening on on chain like it's sort of you can think pretty big here um but if you sort of then zoom in and say all right well sure like what are the first steps you know i think that like the first thing that those are launched on serum was a central limit order book so it sort of looks like a centralized exchange except that it's not it's on chain and i do think that that does attract a slightly different crowd of people you know tends to attract people who trade significant volume and are looking for significant liquidity as opposed to people who are looking to stake or to get yield um or to like you know put seed liquidity for their like illiquid token you know and not have to think about it um and so i think it's like it is like a different crowd and i think the reason we started with that is that it was like hey i think it's one of the most powerful things like if you look at where volume is in crypto like 90 of it's on central limit order books but b it's sort of a proof of like a you know a proof that this can do cool things it's like here's a thing that you can't do on most other chains and it's done it's here and it works and it's sort of like you know a really good first product from that stance of being valuable useful and really demonstrating what can be done but sort of going forward the next things that are going to be released i mean a lot of people are working on things but the ones that i'm aware of that are like uh you know the closest to coming out are going to be a lot of things that allow you to build the pieces that are in the the current ethereum defy ecosystem on solana and and on serum and so the answer is pretty soon it'll have both it'll have central limit order books it'll have amms it'll borrow lending it'll sort of span both the like things you would see on a centralized exchange and the things you see in based defy but they're all on chain which means they're also all composable and interoperable and so you can do things like take your amm and have it you know instead of trading against it like directly you could trade against it through an order book if you wanted like the amm can literally itself go provide on an order book or you could take your borrow lending protocol and give either the order book or the a m or both at once leverage by composing them on top of each other and so all of these things grow even more powerful for having the other ones there and and i think like over the next month um most of the things i just talked about are going to be uh you know live in the ecosystem and so okay so now i understand because i guess i thought that project serum was just this one order book exchange but then earlier in the beginning of the show you called it an ecosystem and i thought why is he calling an ecosystem but now i see because you're launching like these amms or a lending protocol or whatever these other kind of defy like things but in so within serum oh interesting well so one thing you know just to go back to what i was asking in terms of like the type of person who would use project serum um you know i saw that high frequency trading firm jump trading is going to do market making on project serum and i wondered how did that deal come together um they're first of all a veteran of market making but they also have this investment arm that's active in crypto and i just wondered you know did you reach out to them or did they reach out to you and like what was the appeal for them yeah i mean you know we sort of had conversations about things that you know related to crypto over the last couple years we got it got you know got back in contact around this and i think basically we had a similar vision um and i think we both had the vision of like thinking about what's the biggest thing and the highest upside thing you can build as opposed to what's the next step from where we are and that that just like really that points you in a very different direction because if your goal is to get like you know lower cost amms right then you're like we just need another factor of 20 in throughput or in lower cost and and that'll be fine you know whereas if you're saying like all right so step like three out of five is going to be trying to get like capacity for you know a third of the world's financial ecosystem potentially to be on the ecosystem all of a sudden that factor of 30 isn't looking so good like it's like a factor of 3 million you know it's like like just orders of magnitude upon orders of magnitude bigger what you're demanding here and like sure that's sort of like a ridiculously lofty goal although i think it is a real reach goal but you don't have to have that lofty of a goal if literally your entire goal is to have a well-functioning efficient order book with the matching engine on chain that alone prices out almost every chain in crypto a single serum order book right now is using like you know way more throughput than the entire ethereum network is and so you know we sort of like had both had the same thought of like you can't go moderately big and and still expect this to be scalable you need to go really big you need to really care about scalability and you need to have the product vision to get there and you need to have the like resources and wherewithal and and knowledge and partners to have a plausible shot at building out so much of this and then to go to one something both you and anatoly have echoed almost every chain other than ethereum's ghost town right now i need sort of like a relative statement except for bitcoin yeah except for bitcoin well it's interesting bitcoin itself is crackling there's there's nothing not much built on top of bitcoin but bitcoin itself that the chain is obviously the biggest by far yeah yeah um uh but in terms like smart contract platforms in terms of platforms or the goals for other people to build applications that run on it um everything's on ethereum you know tron is number two with like probably one percent of ethereum or five percent maybe and then the one after that's gonna have like you know five percent of that and it's just like there's nothing and so team after team has failed and sort of has demonstrated that doing something isn't enough you need to build something so cool and so impressive and powerful without requiring first having everyone move over that you can create a compelling enough pitch that's almost going to bother trying it in the first place you know that's a high bar yeah well a couple of things that i wanted to ask first of all um because i wasn't totally sure about this so i'm assuming that your decks will handle non-ethereum assets uh as well and so i just wondered like when people trade tokens from different chains that have you know different consensus mechanisms different block times different levels of finality how do you guys handle that and like i also wanted to try to place this in the kind of um world of like polka dot versus cosmos like like is this what it sounds like this is also a potential solution to that interoperability issue that they're trying to tackle right so it's a really good question and there's basically two ways that you can try and think of this and uh two serve paradigms and one paradigm is a cross chain swap where the order book is literally listing a bitcoin all right let's get like bitcoins a little funky but it's listing you know usdc against dot you know like two totally you know i i token on ethereum versus like you know polka dot and and it needs to you know to transact those two when two people trade and there's a lot of ways to try and settle this but as you say it's a little bit nasty right like you have to deeply understand both consensus protocols it's only going to be as fast as the slower of them certainly like you're not going to be able to settle this until both have settled um so if one side's bitcoin then like it's going to take half an hour to settle anything here um and you need to build in these really complicated processes to deal with like the fact that none of these things can natively talk to each other and so like how does how do you know if someone delivered like what's he you know what's it how did you make sure that's not like one person sends their friends another one just never does and you can do it but it is nasty um this is sort of what layers to do like this is a lot of building a layer two is sort of solving this problem in a very specific instance of like your kind of customized semi-centralized layer two versus ethereum often only in one direction but you can generalize that it is doable um it's extremely finicky like the pseudo code specs for this it's like a 10 page document and we even cover all the like there are some cases where like this edge case we solved it we're not going to write it down here it's too annoying and like it's just you have to think of everything right you're like i know every education of every chain and you can do it you can do it but it is like really annoying i was thinking how are they gonna i was just like it just sounds like so much work exchanges do this exchanges do this like every day right they accept dots and they issue bitcoin and people are able yeah they run right most of the time well and the whole that most of the times the whole thing right it's actually really easy to do this if it only needs to work like 98 of the time right because you just like build a note on both chains the problem of course is like what you do like what's it mean if one  up or lies like how'd you deal with that in like a decentralized permission slowly and that's like with centralized exchanges there's this like you know kind of wild card you can play which is like all right no longer decentralized we're gonna have a human go look at it and figure out what happened and fix it and like with ftx we have to do this every day like 20 times a day like you know some transaction we're running some weird error like halfway through ran out of gas in like some non-usual way and so it it it gets cancelled but in a way that like our automated systems didn't predict and we just get this alert like something's weird here i can try and take yes but i might not get it right like humans go look at this and make sure the right thing happens and like that's the thing that's really hard to do with a dex like the whole point of it x is not to have that so you can do it but you have to automate every single edge case so okay taking a step back this is something we're aiming for but this is like a many months project for and many months just to get two specific chains to work with each other and every time you need to add a new chain there's like another month of ironing out that chain there's another way to do this though which is more modularized where instead of having the order book trade an erc20 usdc against a polka dot dot token um you can have bridges and so one one thing you can imagine this instead is there's this you know solana ecosys you know serum ecosystem on salon you draw a circle around it and in order to enter it there's like a wrapping process that happens there where you know you send in your erc20 token and you wrap it into an spl token which is a solano token that's like fungible one to one with it and then the deck itself is just trading all these wrappers against each other yeah it lets you kind of separate these processes and it means that like the entire matchy engine is independent each step on like understanding three blockchains and this takes a lot of the pressure off of the system so the thing that we have right now it's just like there's one bridge which is live and there's more which are going to be coming live soon which are just like a way to to wrap and unwrap tokens on them and okay and so you're you keep saying rap but like for wrapped bitcoin on ethereum that's using a trusted third-party provider to do that but are you saying this will be done via smart contract in a trustless manner yeah and now you get to what exactly trustless means and sort of the the real answer here is that it's not a binary it's sort of a spectrum and a lot of the things that sort of present themselves as such there's somewhere on the spectrum right and wbtc is like generally known to be on the centralized end of this where like it's just a custodian you know it's bitco then you have things like you know run btc tbtc which are various sort of like more decentralized ways of doing this you can imagine close to one end if you have all of the validators of a blockchain validating these cross-chain transactions then they're sort of validated with the full weight of the consensus and so one thing you can do right is if you take two chains and you get every validator or block producer or whatever they use on each side to be with sort of the same consensus thresholds to be validating that these that the swapping is happening then that's like pretty decentralized you know that's like even more decentralized than just getting like 10 000 friends and strangers together and having them vote which is what a lot of these things you know it's sort of a lot of magic in the middle but basically decentralized but not trustless like you have to trust you just you you don't rely on one person you have to trust that like you know most of 10 000 people are sort of honest on the far end there's something even stronger you can do which is sort of the like fully the most restless version where you're actually running like clients which is to say you pre-program into each blockchain exactly how the other blockchain works so you can feed them raw blockchain data and they can figure out what's going on on you know the launching program does and so you don't have to have people voting on what happened in the blockchain it's sort of pre-programmed but then again you have to think very hard about what happens if there's like a fork that like this program didn't anticipate and so that's sort of like as far as you can get here and yeah there's just sort of this spectrum of these bridges and i think that like the sort of like standard first place to start is like a multi-stake you know you have like rather than like a bitcoin custodian you have like you know a group of people who are multi-sig that you know that are sort of like validating you know each running nodes and validating that like the swaps are happening correctly um because that's like one version of a thing that you can do um anatoly also actually has like more information i think on the most recent state of some of these bridges than i do um so i'm going off of like two-month-old information about what was going to be rolled out when sam basically nailed it like the like the way i think about it is effectively like custody like and you have a a spectrum of centralized custody like rap btc right or what you deposit into an exchange and it gives you a virtual token under exchange to trade with right to something that's like in the middle where like it's like tbtc like run and then you have something farther to the right of decentralization like proof of stake networks where you have you know you have finality right that's controlled by some set of validators that are signing things so you know imagine these validators all colluded and like manufactured fake headers that's no different than like a decentralized or any custodian right kind of like running away with the funds that you've trusted them so this this kind of spectrum of decentralized custody goes all the way to full blockchains like clients running inside each other and cosmos like as you mentioned there's spec ibc kind of covers all the corner cases of like what happens if chain one forks or both forks at the same time right like who actually gets what um and fundamentally like i think the interesting thing there is that um many like the combination of these methods are probably what's going to be used by consumers like when a user deposits something like hey i wanna i wanna bridge you know urine from ethereum to solana and trade out on serum they can do the deposit against the likelihood and somebody could basically run it through a multisig and issue them the token and take the slow path for a fee right they basically okay i'll i'll wait for full finality for like you know point zero zero one percent for you but you can go trade urine right now right right like but because as soon as you have like risk right if you have like opportunity for risk and speed right and and finance there's opportunity to make yield there and somebody will take the other side of that um so users actually will probably be able to always kind of see a fast path and underneath behind all this is like how do we reduce settlement risk how do we make this more decentralized more censorship persistent that's almost like all back-end work that users are really unlikely at the end of the day to deal with okay oh this is really interesting so something else that i wanted to ask about was serum has two tokens srm and msrm and why don't you just describe what the purpose is for each yeah so serum is sort of the fundamental one um and like for most things you can sort of ignore msrm so serum is you know what does it do it does i mean the first answer is it's a governance token and so it can vote itself to do more things but i you know currently what's it do so first of all 100 of all the revenue from serum uh you know the from you know all the projects on serum uh they go to the serum token and so you know what this means like exchange fees you know go to go to serum whether through a buy and burn whether it's through yield and that's again it's sort of like up to the serum tokens to decide how they want that um so they sort of can control all of that and and gain from all that um they also are are the government since they can vote to you know change fee rates and things like that and then the the other thing that they they do is there's a staking system in a node system and the nodes basically manage a lot of the uh processes that go on on serum and so in particular you can get some extra oomph out of on-chain stuff if you're able to have people staring at it and poking at it and and what does that mean you know i'll give an example so all of the borrow lending protocols on ethereum how do they deal with liquidations let's say someone's about to go bankrupt what happens there's like keepers that kind of find something that looks like it's kind of running under the collateralization ratio or something is that what you're talking about it's like yeah it's sort of like that it's blockchains aren't very good at like you know they sort of just like keep sitting there doing what they're doing the natural way to have mechanics something like liquidation which is what most people do is at any point anyone can try and liquidate someone so i could see your account and i'd be like oh man there's lower account there is a count i'm going to try and liquidate her sorry like you know type in you know i send command she's like liquidate laura and the bar landing for all calls like no you sam she's nowhere near her margin limits like obviously she can't be liquidated and she's like whenever i send that command it goes and tests but if you are in fact below your margin limits and i send the liquidate command then it liquidates you and what's it mean to liquidate you well somehow it has to deal with this fact that you've got all these positions and assets and stuff and you got to go somewhere so it actually means to liquidate someone is you volunteer to take them and so actually happens like i claim laura is like below margin limits and i'm going to take your report like i'm going to take your portfolio on and i send that to the blockchain validates it and that's like an example of like an external actor who comes in to help the system in a way where like they can't sort of do anything terrible because the code you know the blockchain code just won't let them liquidate someone if they're not below margin um but there's a function that needs to be filled and relies on something like that that in particular is actually quite an intense and scary thing to put on someone's shoulders because they might be taking on a huge position but there's a lot of sort of like less scary versions of that that are important for maintenance of stuff on service so to give some examples one of them is there are certain times when like some sort of cue is filling up like you know all you know some there's some like data structure is like you know a queue of all the trades that have happened recently or something and you need to clear that out periodically or else like the dex just holds it's like all right we're out of space like there's nowhere for me to write this it's like sitting there like pleading with someone to like realize that happened and like clear out this buffer and as soon as someone does just starts running again and so that that's like sort of a an example of of a node duty um on on serum is like watching for all these things and like taking care of them when they need to be taken care of and what they share in common is that you can't like steal anyone's money this way it's not like giving a super power to these nodes that lets them like screw anything up it's just like a you know a task that needs to be done and like waiting for someone to do it so that's one example of it and basically it's you know serum holders who are sticking to these nodes which are then performing these like on-chain duties and another thing you could think about is like validating cross-chain transactions so you know for a lot of these bridges like who are natural people to be validating that that swap happen correctly one is like the solana validator is one answer and the you know serum nodes is another so okay so that sort of serum it's basically like economic gain from everything that happens on serum governance of it and then staking for maintenance of it plus you know whatever else people do with it i haven't yet gotten to mega serum uh but that's sort of like you know that's background so okay what is mega serum so msrm which is mega serum um is i think a super super cute thing i i'm really happy with it it's it's a wrapper on a million serum so you can take a mega serum and just crack it open get a million serum out and take a million serum you can wrap them together and get to make a serum so far it seems kind of stupid like who cares oh here's why you care first of all it's a little bit better than a million serum so it you get like you know to get feed discounts for a holding serum when you trade you like bigger fee discounts for having a mega serum then you do 4 million 0. and like in all of these various ways you get like little bonuses graphing a mega serum and in addition each of the nodes which is like you know voting and managing these processes uh in order to form it it has to have a mega serum staking to it um so you can have you can stick to it with just serum like you can collect a lot of people with that but at least one person has to activate it with like by staking their mega serum to it so now you're like okay this is still stupid because everyone just obviously creates makeup serum because it's better and now you get to the second core part of making sure which that they're scarce so there can only be a thousand mega serum in the world ever which is only 10 which could only soak up 10 of the serum and so basically what they are they're almost like nft like in a way uh and they're functional within a thousand of them but you know it's like a a sort of you know wrapper on a million serum that's like a a bit better and allows you to activate a node but they're they're they're they're scarce you know it's not that everyone can do them and and you know you can trade these and so if you're just looking to like have some serum in your wallet you you're you know buying it and selling a lot like you know you just stick with serum um and if you ever got a mega serum you'd probably sell it and the reason you'd sell it is you sell someone who'd probably be willing to pay more than a million serum for it because they really want to be able to activate their node and i you can only do that with one of these and they're the world's out of them so um so that's basically what a mega serum is yeah it remi it's like um flying business class or something it's like limited number of seats but you get these extra perks and yeah or i don't play video games but i imagine like some kind of special video game level that you know you can achieve and yeah exactly and it's like in practice this sort of thing where if you're like a really core member of the serum ecosystem and like want to do a lot of stuff there like most of them are like very excited to have a mega serum because it like allows you to do more stuff whereas they're just sort of like coming in and out and doing some trades sometimes and like buying it you know trading for serum for profit back and forth like you you know you sort of wouldn't bother getting the the like you know long-term uh gold chart or whatever all right so we've covered um i think pretty much most of the aspects of solana and serum but i just did wonder you know going forward like what are kind of the next milestones and what are some of the new things that we should be watching you guys um for in terms of what you'll be rolling out yeah so on the serum end i mean a lot of people are building things and we'll see what comes through i'm super excited for a lot of them um there are also some which i i can't say yet but i'm super excited about the two things that i'm most excited about that are going to be coming out soon which are going to just unlock so much one of them is a bar lending protocol and a bunch of people are working on those and sometime the next month one's going to go live and that's going to enable borrowing and lending but also margin and futures and leverage and everything like that because you just compose it with anything the other thing which is the more unique thing is a thing called pools which are going to be coming out in the next week and a pool is a really really cool uh kind of primitive structure and it's sort of the common element between an amm wrapping staking borrow lending and a ton of other things in d5 what it is is a fully customizable way to have like this pool of assets and these tokens that represent ownership of them is it like balancer it sounds like balance sir yep that's like another example it's like a more customized example where you know with bouncer you have these balancer tokens you know balance or pull tokens which represent ownership of the pool of assets in the balancer pool and you know you can kind of like create and redeem them and then separately there's this other thing where you can like trade against these balancer pools using the sort of amm curved like thing and so that's like a more generalized version of uniswap udu swap is also a pool but it's like a a you know more restricted ones there are only two assets in it the fully generalized pool so um you can specify everything from you can sort of do whatever you want with them and so you could just write a program to control each piece of it and what that means is that you could take a pool and with the address that controls the assets you could write it such that it took the assets and provided liquidity on a dex with them and so if you wanted to you could have this pool that like instead of amming it sort of like replicated that that that curve but did it by providing on a dex or you could build a pool with where it's just an amm with any arbitrary curve of like you know you know instead of this x times y equals k then it could be any function of the world you just write it down on chain and put it in in the address and then that's that's what it'll do and you can control what you need to to to put in to create chairs in the pool you need you can control what you get out for redeeming them you can customize both of those and so in its very simplest form it's just a sticking thing or like an etf or something like that you put assets in you get ownership out and then you can't crack that open but you can customize what happens with each piece of it and it just makes it super like clean and straightforward um to roll out a really large number of of protocols um and so i'm really excited for that to unlock a lot of projects at once and that's gonna be coming out you know in the next week all right well this has been super interesting where can people learn more about each of you and solana and project serum um well solano.com just go there or if you've there's a ton of documentation about like just kind of design and as well as developer docs but jump into our discord like we're friendly people so and sam yeah oh god there are so many places so you go to pri and they all link to each other which is good but you know project serum.com to see sort of an ecosystem website uh you can go to our discord you can go to our telegram channel go to our twitter account follow me on twitter um all of those like all words lead to serum so to speak so okay great well thank you both so much for coming on unchained of course thanks for having us yeah thank you thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about sam anatoly
