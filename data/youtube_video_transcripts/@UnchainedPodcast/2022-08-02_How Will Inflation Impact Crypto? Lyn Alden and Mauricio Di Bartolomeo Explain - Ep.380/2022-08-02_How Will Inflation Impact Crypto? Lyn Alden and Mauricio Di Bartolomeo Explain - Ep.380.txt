co-founder and chief strategy officer at leaden welcome lin and mauricio thanks for having us thanks for having us with inflation at 9.1 there's been quite a bit of concern about where the economy is headed and that will also have big implications for crypto and it already has mauricio let's start the conversation with you because you have a really personal and fascinating story about inflation and it's a story that brought you to bitcoin tell us what happened there um yes and and thank you um so i'm originally born and raised in venezuela uh and so um actually venezuela has been experiencing double-digit inflation since 1983 so i was literally born into double-digit inflation uh i i was born in 85. um so i i um i spent a lot of time as a kid trying to understand a lot of things that seemed broken uh in society um and um and so you know inflation was always bad in venezuela from what i remember but it took a turn for the absolute worst when authoritarianism essentially started getting entrenched in the country uh and corruption uh started going running amok essentially and and the um the chinese party essentially took away or dismantled the the institutions that protected democracy and so i went through the sort of inflation to hyperinflation uh transition and it was in that hyper and this happened just to give people context chalice took office in venezuela in 1999 and he took office when the oil barrel was trading at around 15 to 20 dollars and chalice essentially uh as he was installing his his sort of communist system into the country oil was rallying and so this kept offsetting the effects of his budget because as he kept doing things that made people want to take their money out of the country oil revenues went inflating and so that sort of negated the impact of his of his agenda in the economy and it wasn't up until 2013 when he actually dies so chavez dies and an election has to be called in venezuela and this is the election where everybody thinks that democracy is going to get regained and we're going to have a triumphant return back into a country that you can vote but this is this is not what happened in fact the the sort of maduro who was at that point left in charge took the reins of the country on a fraudulent election and it was at this point that inflation switches to hyperinflation and and from 2014 onwards venezuelan inflation goes from some hundred percent to now into the thousands and eventually peaking into the millions of percent that sort of surpassing the inflation that was seen historically in zimbabwe argentina and others and when i found bitcoin was in fact in during this turmoil um as as many people were leaving venezuela uh because this hyperinflation despair created the biggest migration crisis in amer in the history of america of continental america from venezuela outwards all of my friends were leaving and they were depressed and everybody was understandably very very sad in this my youngest brother was actually just graduating university and we were all encouraging to leave the country but he didn't want to leave he refused because he didn't want to just didn't want to leave and in his reluctance he starts trying to find businesses that work in this environment and he starts mining bitcoin and when i went down to visit him again he was essentially his positivity and his and the success of his business was affecting everyone around him and all of a sudden his friends started mining bitcoin my parents started mining bitcoin my uncles and aunts and cousins started mining bitcoin and as i i see they're the only guys with smiles is everybody else is leaving and so this is the point you know we can go deeper into the story sorry i was getting overextended but that's how i fell in love with bitcoin and i knew we couldn't build a business in venezuela to to grow and to contribute to the community and so that's why we decided to set up latin in canada uh and and we can get into what we do later atlanta but but it's a tool to help people in that situation yeah i love how much your story kind of you know brings like a lot of this history to life because you know even if it's recent history um a lot of times i feel like when we talk about the economy it can feel very abstract but actually lynn offers a really great perspective in that regard because a bunch of lin's recent writings on all this have been analogizing the early like 2000s up until you know the present day to the period kind of from the 1920s to the 1940s so lynn can you explain your theory there and then also give us some light shed some light on what you see as the current causes of uh inflation the way you know the way i i would break that down is that you know a lot of countries have had very high inflation but if you look at the broad set of of developed markets um super high inflation is you know it's pretty constrained to certain decades and so the work that i did um on that kind of cycle analysis was inspired originally by ray dalio he proposed a long-term debt cycle and the theory there is that in normal credit cycles right so so debt as a percentage of gdp builds up some degree of amount some of that is mal investment and then there's some sort of inevitable downturn or contraction it could be caused by the central bank trying to tighten it or it could be some sort of external shock or it could just run its course and then you go through a period of de-leveraging but because of the way that our currency systems are designed that's when policymakers will step in they will cut interest rates they will encourage credit growth again and as a result you generally don't deleverage all the way as a percentage of gdp than you did in the beginning of that cycle and you see interest rates end up lower than they started that cycle and so instead of looking like a debt sine wave a debt percentage of gdp sine wave instead you have like an upward sloping sine wave uh cycle after cycle you keep getting higher highs and higher lows in terms of debt as a percentage of gdp and you get lower highs and lower lows for interest rates and so the long-term debt cycle kind of says well what happens when you hit zero or in some cases mildly negative you know there's really not much more they can do and you start to you know debt itself gets super high interest rates for near zero and then that's when you're more likely to experience uh you know pretty significant currency devaluation uh basically they run out of the tool to to you know cut interest rates alone and so they shift towards deficit monetization and can shift towards uh large fiscal deficits it could be could be up to including things like helicopter money that we saw during the pandemic basically literally sending people money but it can include all sorts of physical programs that are monetized in large part by the central bank generally speaking i mean there's there's studies that show once a country gets over 100 percent that's a gp yeah i think that i think the study i was looking at before from hershey capital was 130 debt to gdp there's like a 98 chance you're going to default in some way over the next 15 years and if the liabilities are in your own currency uh you're most likely going to quote unquote to fall through inflation meaning that you know people get paid back the number of units that they're owed but but they will be significantly devalued that they won't be worth the same as anywhere near the kind of the same as when they're issued and so most of my analysis shows that much like the you know the 1930s and the 2010s roughly uh were kind of the aftermaths of these big long-term debt cycles starting to pop specifically the private debt cycle and so in the 1929 crash there was a lot of private debt coming undone and you go through this very long stagnant disinflationary period and you had rising populism rising economic discontent both in the united states but also elsewhere in the world especially in europe what we're seeing now is that you know the 2008 crisis happened you had again a big private debt bubble unfolding then we went through a very long malaise very slow economic growth it wasn't obviously the same as the great depression we have better technology we have different monetary policies this time around but you know for both the united states and many other countries in the world this is a very slow growth decade again you have rising populism rising economic discontent in many places around the world and in both cases when you kind of have another shock of some sort in in the prior cycle was war and in this cycle it was a pandemic you know you have a very fragile system and when it gets hit by something that's when they that's when they really go towards fiscal and that's when you start to get that more inflationary type of response and what makes that type of inflation different than say the 1970s is in the 1970s uh one the inflation was from bank lending so banks were creating a lot of loans and that was increasing the money supply rather than mostly fiscal deficits and number two in the 70s because debt was very low as a percentage of gdp they could raise interest rates in order to try to quell inflation whereas in the 40s yeah as inflation runs up to sometimes double digits they still had to hold rates low because of how high debt is and so i'll i'll stop there but essentially that's the thesis that we're in an environment where debt is so high and so we're likely to experience periods of you know high inflation without necessarily corresponding interest rates i mean we can get into other things like under investment in in assets you know energy lack of energy cap back supply chain problems there's all sorts of real constraints that are the one side of the equation while the pretty substantial increase in the money supply is the other side of the equation before we dive into those other factors i'm curious for both of you you know like i said i think you offer different perspectives how is it that you think inflation or in the case of mauricio what you described hyperinflation how do those things change the way everyday people think about money or the way they think about um yeah just kind of their investments or the way they spend money and in general how does that affect the way the economy runs yeah yeah i could give you kind of my two cents based on on what i saw in in venezuela and and for before i get into that i want to make a quick distinction in the way i interpret inflation versus hyperinflation because i actually people tend to think of inflation and hyperinflation as an extension of the same phenomenon but i actually think that they're two very different phenomenons and they have different root causes i think inflation as we see it today and as we understand it in the u.s is just a rational actor's response to an increase in the money supply so if the money supply increases by 20 i will reprice my assets by 20 because i still believe that the assets are valuable just there's a different ratio of units to value if in a hyperinflationary scenario i actually think that this is a political issue it's a hyperinflation kicks in when a person loses all faith in the central government in the government and the central bank and all bets are off and the government has no means to bring the economy back in the rails and so it's basically hit the liquidation button and you're just liquidating anything that comes in whether it's local currency anything that is is tied to the local system is getting chopped uh that's hyperinflationary and and the two i would argue make subtle shifts in your behavior on a day-to-day basis right so when it comes to inflation you don't necessarily think of you know 20 inflation annually or 30 efficient annually as a shift that will make you go and try to sell your local currency immediately and sort of not live off of it it's a lot it's a lot more manageable when inflation starts running high one of the things that starts happening this is again subtle changes with inflation but a subtle change with inflation starts running double digits is time horizons become shorter so if you were gonna invest in a five year project now you're looking for a three year project and as inflation goes higher you're looking for a two year project and a one year project and a three month project and the paybacks need to be higher and higher and you keep looking for more and more aggressive returns and that leads to short-term thinking and short-term behavior when hyperinflation hits it's a completely different game because i i describe this as you having two jobs you have your nine-to-five which you have to work to get paid and the second you get paid you have another job that goes on until infinity because you need to get rid of that asset before it melts in 24 hours and so you you're forced to become a trader an investor in many cases what governments do in hyperinflation is they lock all access to dollars and so when they do this they effectively send people into digital assets or the barter system uh because everything gets monetized you know cars get monetized any asset that can get repriced gets monetized in lieu of the currency and so it it i remember distinctly you know buying tires to then be able to trade them for sugar and so these types of things and this sounds crazy uh for someone in north america to talk about today but it's very real back there and and to lynn's point i actually we can get into this later but the strength of the dollar today is causing it's a wrecking ball for emerging markets and frontier markets right now it's causing social discontent on a daily basis and we're going to see populism rise up again in these places not big bear or bad news but you just need the writing's in the wall and so i think it's a really interesting trend how a lot of these 1940s analogies are are playing out in my opinion will play out in the next few years yeah i would just urge listeners who haven't heard the episode with one says casaras to listen to that because he describes that very scenario that you're talking about where his mother picked up him and his sister from school and she literally had her salary in paper bags like in cash and she made him and his sister run through the grocery aisles ahead of the person who was like updating all the prices on the food with a new sticker because the value of the argentine peso was plummeting so rapidly and they were you know having to gather all the food and then run up to the cashier and every time there was any money left over she would send them back for more food and his sister was like why don't you just save your money and then we can you know buy more food later when when we need the food and his mom was like no because it's going to be worth less tomorrow and you know that was it just was like such a it created such a big impression on him as a as a high schooler and so that was why years later he kind of immediately understood the significance of bitcoin lynn do you want to weigh on on this question about how inflation kind of changes the way people act i think he described it perfectly uh basically if you look at it from let's say the business perspective for example it's very hard to make long-term plans especially for long-term contracts involving money if you don't know what the value of money is going to be and that can apply up you know high single-digit inflation or it can you know it's even worse obviously the higher it gets and i also agree that inflation and hyperinflation are fundamentally different generally with hyperinflations you know something severe happened to the economy's ability to out out you know produce things right so the kind of the most famous example might be weimar you know is after a disastrous war there's other ones like you know disastrous um uh you know government changes kind of extreme government programs authoritarianism that israel would be a key example zimbabwe you know another thing basically when you're kind of going after what what has people produce things and you're not having all those natural incentives work normally or you're just severely impaired because of your infrastructure from a war from things like that those are the types of of conditions that can lead to outright hyperinflation and another factor is that you know to touch on uh what riso just said is that a lot of countries what makes you know a frontier an emerging market different than a developed market kind of at its core is that a lot of them you know their debts are denominated in in dollars or sometimes other currencies like euros but most of it's dollars which is a currency that they can't print and so when you look at say the united states europe japan these are developed countries their currencies i mean their debts are denominated almost entirely in their own currencies and so if they start to have a debt problem they you know they have a lot of leverage they can pull to kind of kind of have that move down more slowly china's now in this exit in mostly the scenario as well they have some dollar based debts but a lot of it is is based on their own currency so they're kind of a hybrid at the moment still but as you go out to emerging markets they have these these external debts and the problem is that you know the federal reserve can increase interest rates they can do quantitative easing they can do quantitative tightening they can do things to purposely strengthen or weaken their currency it's like imagine if you took out a loan for a house in in gold right and then gold went up in price relative to your currency that'd be terrible because your your debts are getting stronger compared to your asset values and compared to your cash flows and so that's something we see through unfortunately through a lot of markets right now and that's why you get these whenever you have that dollar strengthening period you generally get emerging market crises truly worse on frontier markets and that eventually slightless back and hits the united states because people are selling you know various entities are selling dollar diamond assets to get dollars which means they're really not buying a lot of treasuries and and also it's you know it's very hard for american companies to keep selling goods and services at the same pace they have been because we're all interconnected and so it's just it's a very challenging time the money system really that's been in place for decades is really kind of you know it's got a lot of issues right now that is you know both in developed markets and then also in emerging markets and i do think that yeah people's behavior changes around that based on what's happening with their money supply so let's also now talk about the impact of inflation on bitcoin and why don't we limit the remarks to you know kind of the inflation that we're seeing here in the u.s and europe we can talk about hyperinflation a little bit later um although i i think while so we we sort of touched on that so yeah just what do you see as happening to bitcoin in this environment again a bit of a distinction between what behaviors are happening in north america versus the rest of the world i think in north america there's still a sort of tendency to think of bitcoin as a risk asset and not necessarily as a reserve yet and so it is because of this i think that you see a trading with a high correlation to say the nasdaq or the s p 500 and so the the thinking here around i think in north america and investor markets in general people still see bitcoin as one more tool to add a little bit of upside i guess or or excitement to their portfolios and and they are sort of opportunity driven and they'll make decisions based on macroeconomic indicators of the fed etc what's happening in other markets is very different because what i think we're about to see as a result of this wave of inflation that's affecting the rest of the world is the strength of the us dollar is places like argentina colombia you know they're having to deal with local inflation and they're they're going to probably start placing restrictions around the dollar this is exactly what happened in venezuela venezuela they locked us all out of the dollar and that that was the exact circumstance in which i found bitcoin and i found bitcoin at the time because there was the only thing that when when the government locks you out of the the dollar market you stop being able to buy dollars through the bank so you have to start buying dollars through p2p so literally people and these people that you will call will tell you i don't have dollars right now because liquidity dries up too there's you know everybody wants to buy dollars nobody wants to sell dollars and so what ended up happening in venezuela who filled that spot was bitcoin and it was actually done by bitcoin arbitragers so in these environments buying bitcoin trades at a premium uh to what it would cost in say the united states or what it would trade in a different market and the the natural seller of that bitcoin is an arbitrager that can basically sell you that bitcoin into bolivares use those believers to buy dollars top up their exchange account somewhere else buy the bitcoin and lock that arbitrage so long and short i think we're going to see a lot of bitcoin demand from not investor markets uh and i think that we may not see the same level of spike that we saw in 2017 2018 uh or 2016 because stable coins weren't so popular and and uh available back then i do think that because stable coins exist today and the de facto protection tool for a hyper-reflectionary person suffering from hyperinflation is the dollar broadly i think you're going to see a lot of that demand go to stable coins this time around but i still see the the demand for bitcoin primarily coming from non-investor markets in the next year or two yeah i think we can we can just also start off by dividing inflation into two types right so there's monetary inflation and then there's broad price inflation um and how bitcoin relates to them is very different um so monetary inflation is the actual money supply itself going up and historically that tends to somewhat precede price inflation going up because it's you know it's hard to get broad price increases if the money supply itself is not going up very fast and when the money supply does go up very fast for for multiple reasons uh you know that takes a little bit of time to you know trickle into the economy and and people start adjusting their prices upward until all you know that the equilibrium gets refound at whatever higher rate the new prices levels will be and there there have been some really good charts by macro people showing that if you look at say bitcoin price year-over-year compared to global money supply in dollar terms you know if you translate all the different monies around the world you translate them into dollars and what is that money supply doing on a on a year-over-year basis so the rate of change generally bitcoin's bull markets coincide with increases in the money supply uh globally and that that can take two forms it could be that money supply itself in a lot of places is actually going up as we saw in 2020 2021 or it could be that the dollar is weakening significantly and so you know the number of dollars that that you know that money supply kind of translates to is going up uh because which is relevant because the dollar is as we discussed before uh a lot of you know the the international debt around the world and so bitcoin is very positively correlated with increases in in the money supply and vice versa when that starts to contract now that we actually have you know unusually high price inflation in the developed world we had you know the biggest broad money supply spike since the 1940s that that kind of goes back to my prior analogy where i described it and now we're getting one of the you know the biggest price inflation increases since the the 70s and the 40s but we're also in a period where the central bank is is fighting back so the federal reserve is trying to raise interest rates they're no longer doing qe they're starting to do small amounts of quantitative tightening so so they're letting some bonds mature off their balance sheet and so that's putting downward pressure on a lot of asset prices and because bitcoin is still small and volatile and not not uh widely held and not super understood still by the broad public it is perceived as a risk asset a lot is being made of how low energy supplies caused by the russian war in ukraine has impacted inflation particularly in europe how do you see the war continuing to impact inflation do you think it's possible to pull back inflation at all while russia is still at war uh well so their natural gas prices spiked in late 2021 which was before the war broke out obviously the war added a lot of uncertainty to the whole mix and is now contributing to inflation but that energy supply side problem is bigger than just russia and the war and so generally if looked back in history there are these commodity cycles because you know it's the it's the industry where you can't control the price of your own product which makes running a business very hard and so when you have these kind of periods of oversupply prices are low you know the market starts to work and and basically nobody wants to put new capital in uh because they won't get good returns on on on their capital but eventually demand keeps going up and eventually supply starts to dwindle existing supplies and you start to get more of a squeeze and it pushes the price up and that's what encourages new investment to come in then of course they end up over building and getting causing the next cycle of oversupply and so because of the the the length of time it takes especially for some of the long duration commodity uh projects and this this also involves you know oil and gas those tend to be like these say these 15 year long cycles you know you might have a decade decade of of you know kind of a higher like rising at higher prices and like a decade or more of just like stagnant low prices over supply and so partly just from where we are in the cycle we are in a period where we you know we've had low prices for a while until recently and there's pretty low capex and so now that we have kind of the the fiscal uh stimulus to kind of increase demand for a period of time and because we're just you know our our supplies we're we're not keeping up with with kind of organic demand growth uh we're in this more inflationary kind of shortage type of environment for energy and i think the only way out of that longer term is to bring new supplies to market but then of course there are areas in the world where it's worse than others so the united states and canada are are pretty good on that front we have a lot of our own supplies obviously whereas if you're in europe or japan you have to import a high percentage of your energy and for europe in particular i mean a very large percentage of the natural gas comes from a handful of pipelines from russia uh and so obviously that's that's a very challenging political environment but it yeah i just think it it's it's now a narrative that it's it's because of the war and while that's certainly making it worse it the actual like huge spike you saw in natural gas prices uh preceded the war by several months so it's just that whole thing is adding fuel to a fire that was already there and so at this moment you know i'll already we're gonna see that interest rates will be rising probably for some period how do you think all of that will affect the adoption of bitcoin yeah so i just wanted to basically add quickly on what lin said about how hard it is to increase oil production so in venezuela big oil producing country when chavez took office we were producing 3.5 million barrels of oil per day today venezuela produces less than 700 000 barrels of oil per day and so this just shows you how even to maintain your production capacity you have to invest a great deal to just keep it the same otherwise it just deteriorates and i would argue that this is what's been happening everywhere outside of oecd countries that have this type of infrastructure and so it's just to sort of to highlight how difficult it is to bring bring back production online even if you have the reserves to go explore in the context of interest rates going higher and and how that could potentially impact bitcoin my personal view is that as interest rates go higher and conditions continue to tighten up that's going to put a headwind not just on bitcoin but most risk assets again and because so much of the demand is disproportionately driven by u.s clients it'll take all of argentina to buy up with michael sailor cells so you know it's it it it is it is a big deal it is quite imbalanced in that sense and so i think that because of that is going to be in many ways a headwind but what it will do this increase of interest rates and and strengthening the dollar because that's what it does i think that is going to shoot the demand for stable coins internationally so i think that both bitcoin and stable coins work as the sort of yin and yang in digital assets uh that when one is not soaking up the the the capital the other one is and so inevitably it gets to the same end point but it's just the conduit on how it gets there can shift uh that's kind of my view i i agree with that you know one one caveat i would add is that you know if you if you map bitcoin correlations onto different things the correlation to interest rates are pretty mixed but in and of themselves uh like we discussed before it's more linked to money supply growth is more linked to you can also link it to pmi cycles so purchasing managers index is kind of a a measure of economic growth or contraction and more specifically acceleration or deceleration those are the types of things that bitcoin is heavily correlated with so for example in 2017 during the huge bull run uh in bitcoin and broadly in crypto the federal reserve was raising rates throughout that whole year but the the key difference was that you had a a period of economic acceleration so they could raise rates into a a pretty strong economic environment and so the the other factors were were better for bitcoin than the raising rates uh was bad for bitcoin right so you had you had more good things going for you than bad things going for you and we really run into trouble is when the central bank you know the fed is is hiking interest rates or or otherwise tightening monetary policy into a slowdown and so that's what we saw in late 2018 when you have that big bitcoin capitulation and that's also the environment that we that we found ourselves in uh throughout this year so far and so those are the pretty dangerous environments for for really for risk assets in general and then yes as you go out the volatility spectrum towards uh assets like bitcoin um they tend to be you know pretty impacted by that uh we are starting to see signs that when you look forward uh you know maybe a couple quarters they're gonna have trouble raising rates probably past that point you know we're already starting to see forward market expectations of you know different ways that the market prices out what they think the fed's going to do over a given period of time those have already gone down compared to the levels that they were at you know a couple months ago and we're also you know we've seen yield curve inversion so even though they're increasing the the short end of the curve uh the long end of the curve is is no longer going up in the same way that it was before and so you have that that inversion that is generally indicative of potential recessionary conditions uh upcoming and it usually starts to signal you know maybe not the very end of a tightening cycle but it it it becomes increasingly hard to keep tightening policy when you have an economic contraction of that type and so i i do think that right now we're in this kind of dollar hardening period as as the fed is kind of hiking into a slowdown but i think you know if we were to repeat this conversation next year i think we probably would be in a somewhat different you know policy regime by that point so in a moment we're going to talk a little bit about um how recent events have affected certain bitcoin narratives as well as this possible impending recession but first a quick word from the

game fi or nfts join the community of innovative developers today and build the future of web3 with oasis network back to my conversation with lynn and mauricio so as we've been discussing for like roughly the last year there's been inflation at least in the us of 9.1 percent and during that time bitcoin dropped in price from 31 000 to 20 000 and this is despite sort of the long-time narrative that bitcoin serves as a hedge against inflation what do you think has happened to that narrative does it still hold up if so why did it not hold during this period or you know if not why do you think it didn't hold so i think i think you know lynn probably can add more more color into this but my general view is that it did work as an inflation hedge because you don't necessarily have to look at inflation in the last two months and then bitcoin's performance over the last two months i think the inflation that we're seeing today is a product of the excessive money printing that we saw back in 2020 and if you actually look at bitcoin's price performance from the sort of darkest times of the covet crisis which is when every when the government sort of started printing on returning on the jets and you look at bitcoin's price performance from say i don't know april or june like even a month or two post the actual covet event the base that you should use if you should be using for that calculation is closer to 5 000 or 10 000 and so when you when you draw that line from five from ten to twenty or from five to twenty so you i actually think it it has worked as a monetary base expansion hedge and perhaps right now when that is now trans translating itself into consumer price index increases uh it's bit of a lag effect on it and that that's kind of the way i think about it it's sort of like a delayed effect from when the monetary base increases and from the time that that happens and when it permeates down to actual prices of goods and services uh but i don't know lynn if you if you agree or disagree i i agree and this touches on what i mentioned before that that you know the multiple charts show that bitcoin price is very highly correlated to broad money supply uh growth uh and so it's highly correlated to monetary inflation which as researchers point out precedes price inflation and so now that we're actually having the headline price inflation and we have the central bank trying their you know to raise rates into that that's not the environment we should necessarily expect bitcoin to do its best i mean if you look at broadway supply growth year of year it's gone down significantly it's still is still positive over the past year but that rate of change has slowed significantly compared to what it was doing in 2020 and early 2021 and so and in that sense it you basically it did serve as a inflation hedge and now that inflation ironically is behind us as there's a different type of inflation here i do think that that does however impact the public narrative around it i mean if they see they're you know they don't see the m2 growth most people they're they're looking at the gasoline prices and they're seeing bitcoin do poorly while other things are going up in price i don't i don't think it i don't think it was very good from that standpoint you know that's like a quote-unquote marketing standpoint for the asset but i think that from a macro analyst type of lens i think it behaved you know kind of rationally and this you know it's always hard to predict ahead of time what it's going to do because you know an observation i made before is that you know it tends bitcoin tends to do very well in say rising uh pmi environments meaning economic expansion tends to poorly in falling pmi environments and so my big question going into this year is what happens you know normally in a falling pmi environment usually it's a disinflationary environment if you don't have supply-side inflation or you know like wartime finance like huge fiscal types of things and so this was the first down pmi period in a while where we'd have high inflation and so my you know one of my questions was what is bitcoin going to do and i think we got an answer to that which was not great so far i think the real test comes in the next couple years if the fed is unable to keep tightening into that situation and he started to get that kind of longer run type of inflation and he started to get i think the the second stage because right now they're in there they're in their aggressive tightening phase i mean we haven't had 75 basis point you know overnight increases in the in the federal funds rate for decades right so i think that right now it's the the the bigger force is how how aggressively they're trying to tighten monetary policy into a slowdown more so than the headline inflation itself it's so interesting you know because i have seen so much commentary from different people saying oh bitcoin as an inflation hedge hasn't worked what's the new narrative so i find your perspective here really interesting and and a really good point but i did want to ask a little bit more about the uh staple coins point that mauricio made earlier because i mean i i think that's so fascinating and i feel like that could kind of undercut some of the interest in bitcoin so as we kind of continue to see these economic conditions play out how do you think we'll see that you know give us more detail on what you say that happening to sorry what you see that doing to stable coins and then how you see that affecting bitcoin so i i largely agree um and i've been i've been pretty bullish on the proliferation of stable coins uh for the past couple years um something i wrote back about back when i was analyzing ethereum and other assets basically saying that you know there's a lot of things i found concerning about some of those ecosystems but the stable coins was to me the clearest use case years ago bitcoin was the unit of account on offshore exchanges you'd use that as your trading pair and but with the introduction of stable coins uh it displaced bitcoin as the you know kind of the asset you go back to as your unit of account and then also you know we're seeing its usage in you know for more practical purposes in these countries that are struggling with with currency crisis and you know an argentinian described it very well he's like you know i have uh local money for the next month um and then i have dollar like stable coins for the next say six months 12 months 24 months and then anything that i want for like three to five year savings is you know in bitcoin or real estate things like that and i think that's that's a reasonable way to think about it for a lot of these markets because you can't have all your liquid savings and something that can go up or down you know 80 in a pretty short period of time but there's still you know when you look out long enough time horizon i mean bitcoin's money supply is going up by something like one and a half percent and of course every four years that rate's gonna get cut in half you know basically and you have the dollar supply showing up going up pretty rapidly we have nine percent inflation and you know still very low interest rates and so i think that you know over the long arc of time bitcoin is a harder asset than than dollars but it doesn't serve everyone's kind of intermediate term savings needs in the way that stable coins do that's why i'm i'm i'm long-term bullish both on on bitcoin and then intermediate to long-term bullish on stable coins now at the moment because you know a lot of those stable coins are used for that type of trading environment you know we have seen a reduction in the amount of stable coins outstanding and i'm only referring to the fiat uh the fully collateralized ones not like the algorithic ones but you know we've seen a reduction in in tether circles uh you know that that's held up better but overall if you add them both together there has been a reduction yeah and by the way there's been a reduction in the algorithmic ones too but it wasn't the kind that anybody would say is a positive one but anyway exactly yeah that's a lot of yeah you would think that over time some of that demand would then flow into the quote-unquote real stable coin to the actual collateralized ones um but right now yeah we're seeing kind of a contraction stable coins but i do think that when this you know kind of uh you know hardening is kind of you know less aggressive i do think we'll eventually see a liquidity come back into the ecosystem and probably the continued increase in stable coin market cap yeah no i i would agree with that and so i i like to think of it as um so again just judging or going off of the experience i had in venezuela and just to put some context as to how people get into digital assets in these markets it's very different than the journey here uh you know the journey here can go through some you know if just to talk about specifics you know if somebody was a big uh you know austrian economics fan and then they got really into sort of you know money supply etc and then they read a few books and then they they found this sort of intellectual curiosity path towards bitcoin and then they got there and they had all this time to analyze and build this conviction you know contrast that with you just got paid it's gonna become half the next day you are told to then go look for options that your government's trying to prevent you from and you're then presented with these alternatives that are many times not in your language uh in a currency that you don't understand in a format that is unknown to you um and you can't really even understand the terms and conditions and so it's in that situation the as many unknowns as you can remove from your equation you will take it you will be a happy camper and so if if in this situation i tell you that i have this dollar but it just comes on a different wrapper and you just have to get an address to get it and then you can go out and buy it that is a much easier decision for me to make than to say oh i have this thing called bitcoin it is quite volatile today it's worth this many dollars tomorrow you have to sell it to secure the number of dollars that you are now acquiring from me most people think in dollars and if you give them another thing to go in in and out of they're just it makes the decision harder and so i think that because of that stable coins are they almost even have i would argue a human rights element to them because they allow you to opt out from a tyrannical monetary system into something you understand and i think in a long enough time frame bitcoin will serve as that human rights option for the dollar eventually if and when it gets there right and i think that's why both of them are almost like a sequence of dominoes in human rights right like i think i think you need i think of fiat currencies left as a set of like dominoes that like you know are destined to fall and you know the second last domino is the us dollar and the last kind of domino would be called gold or bitcoin or real estate or sort of harder increasingly harder assets become the farther out dominoes and so this is how i see this playing out i think right now my domino fell venezuela right like our currency should have been dead 20 years ago i've said this often times in my lifetime i've removed 14 zeros from our currency and it's still out there out there today but people still flock to the other dominoes right and that's kind of how i see them i see i see stable coins as almost like a necessity uh for people to bridge their way into bitcoin and that's why we're big believers the stable coins you know myself in atlanta yeah and speaking of the human rights issue i should say that we all met at the human rights foundation's oslo freedom forum where definitely a lot of this was being discussed and you know just to circle back to the stable coins thing i uh recently was asked by somebody who like you know he's not in crypto but um was just sort of interested in it and he said oh don't you think that when central bank digital currencies get released that then that will kill off bitcoin and i was like oh no no no no what's going to happen is that then people will get used to transacting with a digital wallet with you know some kind of blockchain based currency they'll learn how to do security for it etc and so you know maybe in the beginning you know all the kind of interest will flow directly to the central bank digital currency but over time i would imagine that that then just widens the market for things like bitcoin yeah i agree with you that probably in the short term we would see you know more interest in stable coins so as we've been mentioning a lot of economists seem concerned that we're on the verge of a global recession you know whether or not that actually happens sort of remains to be seen but um if we do find ourselves in one what do you expect the effect will be on bitcoin the recession can you know a global recession i think you know one of the things i'd like to think about is like the the world is it's a set of interconnected systems so it's it becomes kind of difficult for the the entire globe to experience the same economic conditions at one point usually one place is suffering the other place is thriving so a good example right now is is what's happening in in the middle east right like uh dubai uae all those guys are again again getting very active on the investment side you know they're announcing all these new funds and initiatives and again you know the world the the oil consumers are suffering the oil producers are doing well and so it's really kind of hard to to kind of figure out where we're all net out but again i think today investor markets make up a disproportionate amount of the buying supply in bitcoin and so i think there will be a heavy tilt to what happens to these investor market economies because again the the consumers in these economies are disproportionately bigger than everyone else combined and so you know if the us and europe suffers even though these aren't the countries that need bitcoin the most they will likely impact prices the most and so i think it i guess it's not really a great answer but it's really hard to to uh to kind of for me to kind of sess out how it will shake out for bitcoin because so much of the price is driven by the people that need it the least and so that that kind of distorts the the signals and i think as we as we go through so i one is that you know a lot of economic indicators do suggest that we're you know probably in the early phases of like a recession or recessionary like conditions you either have a significant economic slowdown or an outright contraction depending on what region you're looking at and so for example europe is generally in you know rougher shape than the united states but even the united states economy uh looks really problematic right now uh historically bitcoin tends to bottom before the depths of the recession but of course that the sample size for that that cycle is not very large in that sense what i'm referring to is the pmi cycle so not all economic slowdowns result in recessions and in the united states for example the you know the pmi cycle is you know the purchase managers index that's roughly a three year cycle uh and so you get it's kind of correlated very strongly to the price action we've seen in in bitcoin over the long term and right now you know bitcoin price has been going down pmis have been going down and so my overall base case would be to kind of expect a choppy period for a while i think it's going to be constrained uh as you have you know pmi is still going down uh whether or not we see new new lows i really don't know um that that's more of a trading call and there's all sorts of things like you know there's there's pockets of leverage and liquidations that can happen like we saw uh recently you know you never say which firm is going to end up having to you know basically sell at the bottom uh and get liquidated so there's all these like specific events that can you know either have bitcoin already bottomed or still has yet to find the bottom but the thing i would look towards mainly is the part in the cycle where liquidity stops getting worse which i think will precede the bottom of the economic recession and then that's the part where you probably want to be in digital assets again that's why that's where you probably want to be in bitcoin and that's why i would expect to see a lot of inflows back into stable coins as well so i i still see struggle ahead but i think that it'll probably end up bottoming before you know kind of the the economy does but it remains to be seen i mean it depends every every cycle is going to be a little bit different i think a lot of the pain's already you know you know been squeezed out of the market but bottoms you know can take a long period of time i mean if you looked at prior uh bitcoin bear markets you you can just chop along sideways in no man no man's land for the better part of a year or a couple years and i wouldn't be shocked to see something like that happen again yeah i i would second that because i have seen uh those myself we you know kind of spend uh part of the last you know section of the conversation focused more on sort of the developed part of the world but i did want to circle back to the developing economies what's your sense of kind of like how the global inflation or these indicators of recession have affected the adoption of bitcoin and developing economies or you know as mauricio would say the people who need bitcoin more so i mean chain analysis showed that you know adoption rates among developing countries are generally higher on a per capita basis but but as mauricio pointed out that the actual capital volumes are are largely driven by you know north america europe that's where a lot of the capital is so we do we do generally see in a lot of those markets that there is a lot of adoption because they're you know they're the ones that have a more obvious use case for it right away if you there's a lot of people in the united states for example they're like what what what use case could bitcoin possibly have i can't i can't conceive of a use case for this or stable coins or whatever asset we want to talk about whereas you know if you look at any country that has authoritarianism in it right which according to freedom houses is somewhere around half of the pop of the world population lives in either authoritarianism or semi-authoritarianism so the the self-custodial and censorship-resistant nature of bitcoin is useful for them and then two all those areas with with kind of persistent currency problems persistently high inflation the more alternatives they have either to get dollar access or to get something even harder over the long term like bitcoin that increases their their options to opt out uh of those currencies and so i i do think that's going to be a big story over over the the coming decade is more and more people in in countries uh running into these issues it's you know shifting out into things like bitcoin and stable coins yeah i i mean i i agree i think you know i i keep going back to this concept that you know we're about to at least in my view i think we're heading into some pretty hostile economic environments in many parts of latvia uh particularly when it comes to dollars and accessing dollars and i i go back to even though i i hate i hate saying that uh because i i know i've been through something very similar and it's very painful um and it was it is that same environment in which i found bitcoin in the first place and so the message that i've been repeating on and on to our team here today because we over half of our clients come from latin america and that's largely because we offer the services in spanish and we're kind of right place right time what i keep saying to them is far from being a headwind this is the moment that bitcoin was created for for that part of the world and this is this is the time where they're going to need it more than ever since it was created and it's our job as a community as content creators as educators to let them know about all the options they have because they're going to need them and again to lynn's point it might not be the biggest dollar tickets the ones that are coming on but to those people being able to protect a hundred dollars i would argue is more meaningful than for someone like michael sailor or someone else to be able to protect 10 to 20 million dollars and so again it goes back to how this impacts people on their day-to-day and and it's it's very very meaningful and that's why it has the viralization potential because i have never seen somebody spread the word of something with so much joy as the bitcoiners that were basically telling other people to mine bitcoin in venezuela in 2016 2017. it was like telling somebody you found el dorado and and i think that's going to happen again i wish the best everyone in these economies that are they're kind of about to go through this but you know we're we're going to hopefully be right there trying to do our best to help well i actually wanted to circle back to you and ask to you ask you more specific questions about venezuela because so as far as i understand uh the government crackdown and bitcoin mining there and so i don't really know kind of like what uh bitcoin usage or adoption looks like on the ground nowadays or even if in general people don't have as much access to it you know what is the kind of perception of it after that experience yeah so i think you know to to lynn's point it has a lot of people bought bitcoin on the uh inflation hedge narrative back in 2017 and a lot of them probably did so again just now in this current cycle and naturally a lot of people or some people if you bought a 20 and you're looking at the current prices you're you're in pain uh especially if you didn't have that much wealth to protect in the first place and so there has been this sort of unfortunate association with bitcoin as a risk asset even in those markets and i think that's also what's driven many to even explore stable coins in the first place um you know we get so many questions about stable coins and different rails to avoid or to pay lower fees uh because in that time like a fee fees are everything down there uh and right now you know frankly ethereum is very hard to transact on that's led to the proliferation of using stable coins on things like tron you know solana et cetera uh and and and i i found that to be to be quite interesting and so again bitcoin's volatility can many times play against it in these types of situations but again it's it's it was the genesis that enabled this whole ecosystem to exist right so i think bitcoin is the very long game and for the medium to short term uh i think stable coins will be the trojan horse that sort of get us the adoption that we need and then if and when they need it we can hop over into into the sort of you know the the arc the bitcoin the noah's ark which will be bitcoin i guess if the dollars thinks that i think we'll have huge problems i don't know if they'll if the art can fit us all but uh but it'll be interesting one of the one of the developments i'm watching along those lines is to see uh what comes out of this this tarot announcement from lighting labs um because if we you know uh to his point stable coins have migrated from blockchain to blockchain in response to fee pressures and all sorts of things like that so they you know they started on on on top of a bitcoin layer they went over to ethereum theorem got expensive they went over to tron and other blockchains and you know a lot of people don't care really what what what blockchain it's on as long as it works and it's fast and it's it's cheap because i mean the the stablecoin itself is centralized anyway what matters to them is that it's you know at least the central hub is outside of their country and that that's the key part for them and you know we've seen an announcement from lightning labs that they have you know this new proposal called tarot uh that you know with the taproot update for for bitcoin they can potentially bring you know really any asset but i think the the one everyone's thinking about is putting stable coins on lightning and again it remains to be seen what timeline that might happen on if it'll happen uh if it does happen will people use it but in theory that's a very fast and cheap way to send around stable coins it also gets around the fact that say in the united states i mean you don't you don't really see a lot of lightning usage because you know if you spend bitcoin one people don't want to spend their bitcoin and two it's a taxable event even if they do and to be able to kind of use some of the speeds and features of lightning network but trans you know transacting on a dollar basis over bitcoin rails i think is pretty interesting so i'm gonna watch that space see if those if those two kind of separate areas converge at all or if they remain you know kind of their current state of being mostly separate there are some stable coins that run on liquid on bitcoin but the vast vast majority of them are over on you know tron and ethereum and these other blockchains yeah i agree that actually that would be a really um that might be a way where we see lightning take off because otherwise i don't think there's been a huge amount of usage mauricio what were you gonna say no i just plus one on tarot i'm i'm watching it like uh yeah i'm watching it closely and staying very close to the to the to the well following the lightning team pretty closely elizabeth ryan and all those guys they're doing great so i i'm i'm excited what that could bring and what that could do because actually uh i went to el salvador last year uh for le bitconf just to kind of see how how things have been evolving with chivo and one of the things that i came back with was i was very impressed with lightning you know it is it is sort of spotty in the sense that there's still some people that you know have some challenges with the concept of bitcoin in general but there were so many people that were lightning savvy i paid for you know drinks taxis and stuff on lightning i paid for i played a street vendor with lightning um and so it was really really eye-opening for me to see that and and i came back quite encouraged to be honest i was a bit skeptical on my way down but i came back pretty optimistic you know it's so fascinating because my next question was just going to be about el salvador and i recently had a salvadoran journalist nelson rauda from el faro he actually he was at off with us and he was saying that he noticed for instance that even though salvador and president naio buchelli is extremely popular bitcoin was the subject of kind of the first big protest of his currency and that in general there isn't much uptake of bitcoin in el salvador only 14 of the country's businesses have made bitcoin transactions it was since it was introduced in september only three percent perceive any business value in it only one percent of remittances have been through digital wallets so what he was saying on my show is that he felt that president buchelli's embrace of bitcoin is more of a publicity stunt for foreigners so what's your opinion on his comments there um so i i don't necessarily disagree that it's a publicity uh i think it's been done as a way of drawing attention to el salvador and uh just to make a point we're talking about el salvador right here on this show right now because of it and that wasn't gonna happen uh i remember the last time i mentioned el salvador was probably 15 years ago and so um not only are we talking about it here i've been there to a conference my company invested into sponsoring the event we took a team down we are looking at the at the market closely and i would argue that it worked um i would argue that it has brought a great deal of investment now i am um i've been through too much to uh align myself or say i fully agree with any politician in latin america uh and so i've learned my lesson in that front and i do have some concerns about his administration and some concerns about some of the decisions that have been made i don't love the idea that the first thing you did after bitcoin price went up was to take out a load to build a pet hospital i don't necessarily love the idea that you announced bitcoin city with like fireworks on the back you probably could have done without the fireworks but again if he wanted to do this with ill intention he could have launched his own token he could have done you know a lot of other things that would make it easier for for him or for that administration to be corrupt around it and i would argue that they the the decisions that they've made and the assets that they've purchased have kind of signaled at least to me that they have good intentions now from intentions to implementation there's a big gap and a lot of things can go wrong but at least i i i feel encouraged by the selection of the asset and kind of how it's been brought to the public in fact i think if you consider the fact that chibo was rolled out in the time frame that it was rolled out to the amount of people that it was rolled out um i would argue that it probably should have had a lot more bugs and issues uh if it's trying to sort of become available to millions of people on day one i don't really know a single wallet that has gone through that um but uh but again those two cents i mean i think a lot remains to be seen but i think that the benefits of that decision are not going to be seen by the sub by people from the summer they're in three months or six months they will likely be seen it'll start burying fruits in a couple years from now once we go into another cycle and for lynn i wanted to ask you about the initial plan to sell a one billion dollar bitcoin bond which didn't happen i was just curious for what your take was on that so one of the challenges that they're facing uh and now this has spread to a lot of frontier markets is that um going back to that whole dollar-based liability thing we were discussing earlier uh you know they issue these dollar bonds and global investors are not don't have a very strong appetite for for frontier market debt right now and el salvador in particular you know when they started announcing bitcoin you know their bonds started selling off and it wasn't even necessarily because you know it was actually doing any harm to their economy quite the contrary at the bare minimum i think it's been good for their tourism and their and their you know their brand awareness but nonetheless global investors got spooked around that along with you know other actions it's hard it's hard to map out one-to-one you know always why why are global investors selling bonds of a specific country but it's not been a very great correlation and so that you know the whole idea of that bitcoin bond potentially gives them another avenue to get capital with especially among say you know bitcoiners that want to see that country you know do well both for its own sake and because it's you know it's now like the biggest test case for bitcoin and i think the challenge there is any sort of top-down thing that that's going to be hard i mean you can argue that it maybe they came in too early maybe they could have done something like you know they could have put it a little bit in their reserves they could have said you know they could have done two they could have made a legal tender and they could have done various tools that are less aggressive than the you know kind of how hard they went into it there's all sorts of different scenarios that they could have done and i think because you know of the bear market conditions and things like that it doesn't seem like there's a ton of demand for those bonds right now but i think that i think that's not shelved last i heard i'm not the best person to to follow up on that i think that's still something that you know the the interesting parties are talking to and it is something i'm gonna watch to see if they ever do get that issuance off the ground or not i don't really have a strong opinion on the success of of how that's going to be at this point last year when it was announced i mean i talked to adam back about it we were on like a podcast together kind of you know feeling out what they were going to do and it's you know it's it's potentially optimistic that you know they could have a different way to get capital but at the end of the day it's going to come down to execution and whether or not the the buyers show up yeah so while i have you both on the show i had to ask about the situation with crypto lending obviously mauricio you're directly involved in that um but we've seen numerous crypto lenders run into trouble and two of them had to file for bankruptcy celsius and voyager um in terms of block fi another one of the troubled lenders it was reported that ledin did put in a bid to try to provide them new funding although now it looks like blockfi has an agreement to be acquired by fdx so how is it that ledden was able to avoid not just the operational issues but also be in a position to try to rescue another one of these failing lenders um yeah thank you for the question i think it's a it's a hugely important topic obviously in our industry and i think i would you know to kind of give you a summarized version of what i think happened i think this just sort of brought to light the fact that not all lending companies uh were created equal and they were not all using the same or they were all not managing risk in the same way and so if if you look at most of the issues that led to these platforms being where they are now um they are not there is not one particular event that you can point to there's it's a combination of things that that basically added up together and so some of these platforms were getting client assets and turning around and placing them in d5 protocols and they were putting them on lending protocols and bridges and these bridges got hacked and they started suffering losses from that from from that outside right then a lot of them were using the anchor protocol at terra to generate interest for their stable coins and a few of them had a lot of close calls and because this is all decentralized it was very easy to identify who has had the close calls when clients were able to associate platforms to anchor rightfully they started withdrawing assets from that platform and when they started withdrawing assets from that platform that started exposing another issue which was that these platforms were creating asset mismatches because they were taking one asset that had no institutional market and they were converting it to a different asset so that they could lend it and they created an asset mismatch into what they from what they owed the client into what they had currently earning interest somewhere else and that created this rush of liquidity to try to get it back to the client and a good example of this is if to stick teeth there was no way to come back and that created some issues and the other one was that many companies got into maturity mismatching they were taking money from clients the clients could withdraw at any time and they were turning around and financing one two or three year loan projects and this this basically meant that they didn't have the capital to fulfill the withdrawals and when all this happened that put companies in the same place at lenin just very short we don't expose our client assets to d5 protocols so we were not exposed to we were not affected by any hacks or the issues we have only bitcoin and usdc so those are the two most liquid assets the biggest demand in the institutional space we are the the only in the first lender that does proof of reserve at the stations every six months that our clients can verify that we gave the account at the right balance that's unique to latin and and we have maturity matched across the board and we have assets matched across the board and so this is really why we what we're not in the same situation and why our balance sheet is essentially intact we didn't have any loan losses in any side of the book or the house institution or retail and that puts us in a position where we can now look at opportunities uh and you know hopefully cement ourselves as a bigger player going forward and so then how were you generating yield you you lent you can still lend to institutions and you can do the proper credit analysis as an example we didn't lend the three arrows but they didn't pass our our counterparty onboarding analysis uh but others did and we work with them still uh you know and and they've been great we monitor almost on a daily basis with the our institution institutional partners we look at their balance sheets uh we interview their management our our security team tests their technology stack uh we test their strategies to make sure that what they're telling us checks out and so we we are i would argue very very diligent when it comes to that side of that that side of our business and unfortunately some others were misrepresenting these risks tremendously uh and and you know we got to the unfortunate situation where we're in now and lynn i'm sure you're aware there were people criticizing some of the bitcoiners who had said not your keys not your coins but then had also promoted these platforms and i saw some people were criticizing you for having written a blog post where you said that people could put a small amount of their bitcoin to work in a platform like blockfi what's your response to people who criticize these centralized crypto lenders so i think it comes down in large part to whether or not it's you know whether or not you do risk analysis and whether or not you're transparent about it right and so when i recommended block five for example or i wrote that blog post about it i talked to the ceo uh and i used it myself but i also made it clear in the article i was like this is not fdsc and short this is this is you know here are the risks that can happen to them here's how they you know state they want to deal with these risks and you know when it came down to the whole thing it's like okay if you want to do this i mean you shouldn't put you know any sort of like super meaningful like you know large part of your stack on these types of platforms because you're taking on counterparty risk which can go against kind of the main point of of bitcoin self-custodial money but i'm an investor at heart so i always try to find areas where i can you know take these uh small bets here and there and so you know i think that there's on one hand there are a lot of people say aggressively marketing celsius right i think that's that's something i wouldn't go anywhere near another hand you like as mauricio point out there's a spectrum of quality here and so you had you know on one hand you have something like celsius and then you know block files so far held up reasonably well and then ledden uh has held up very well and so it really comes down to understanding the one that you're you know trusting with your funds and then also just managing your size carefully i i tend to not view the world in black and white instead i view it in terms of you know just analysis uh analyzing things on a case-by-case basis and so i don't think there's necessarily sort of hard conflict between you know not your keys not your coins versus you know willing to put capital work somewhere i just think that this is still a very early industry it's obviously a very volatile industry and you have to really understand the risks that you're getting involved with uh when you when you engage in this type of of lending yeah and it's clear i mean for anybody who's read any of your blog posts that yes you deal in nuance in general i would say we seem to be at an inflection point both in terms of the economy and the crypto markets so what are some new lessons you'll be applying as we move forward into this next phase of a possible recession or coming out of this uh very tumultuous period with the crypto markets um i think one big lesson that this this left uh the the markets in general was that um you know don't trust verify uh i think people are going to be a lot more diligent right now when they're considering where or what platform to interact with i think rightfully so i think what will also what this will also lead to will be eventual regulation uh which i think will be good for the space because it'll potentially or hopefully stop things like terra from happening again or quadriga from happening again and so um i think that's that's kind of par for the course with how i had seen or how i had envisioned this this kind of play out you know i didn't envision the blow up losses from terra but i did think eventually regulation would come you know and it would probably be triggered by one of these unfortunate events uh so i think we're about to see a sort of a big divide in in in the world because i think there's going to be the the sort of g7 you know very powerful nations that are going to create very good regulatory frameworks where people are going to want to comply but i also think that the recession and the strength of the dollar is going to cause a lot of authoritarianism in other parts of the world where people will want to be opting out of those systems very quickly and and to have no regard for that regulatory framework and so i think there's going to be the polls are going to get pulled farther apart in that sense i i think one of the big lessons to yeah there's there's a quote uh from matter matt o'dell um uh stay humble stack sats um and it's you know it's kind of like i think that's you know cycle after cycle i think that's it's one of the best phrases just because there's so much risk in this ecosystem uh there's outright fraud basically imagine if you could just market penny stocks to the public right i mean that that's kind of the wild west that that you know large swaths of this industry are still in the technology and as enabled you know things that you know types of scams that would have otherwise occurred and say paper form and direct mail or whatever things like that can now happen much faster over the internet uh and so i i do think regulators are going to catch up to some degree on some of this and clamp down on some of the worst parts of it some of the exchange practices or some of the some of the you know the more fraudulent types of tokens that are out there you know even large established projects as we saw can can fail spectacularly and so i i do think that there will be generally more analysis and caution i think especially among you know regulators and institutional types of of capital but i also think that a number of you know a number of retail investors were hurt uh in different parts of the cycle and they've you know i think that some percentage of them i mean some might just leave the industry for a while other ones i think will will have learned something and gravitate towards you know safer things like bitcoin stable coins assets like that and so i i still think that you know there's long-term growth ahead i think there's real useful technology here and i just think that can't get over your skis in terms of leverage and in terms of risk you're taking and being able to you know wanted to go into any sort of new project and then as well as this the ethics of the industry uh when it comes to marketing you know projects like that to the public yeah i would say from working on my book that one of the things i learned is when you go through these really challenging periods as long as you survive it actually just makes you stronger in the end so we'll have to see what happens thank you both so much it has been such a pleasure discussing
