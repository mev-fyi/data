which came out on tuesday is stephen ehrlich editor of forbes crypto asset and blockchain advisor welcome stephen thanks laura it's a pleasure to be here and thank you for for joining me as well so yes so let's dive in i mean your book your book just came out i mean one question that just immediately comes to mind is why did you decide to write a book and why did you pick this topic having covered the initial coin offering craze in 2017 and seen just how quickly the whole thing took off and how it transformed the lives of so many different sources of mine even my own life actually it really felt like something historic happened and it felt like something that was worth chronicling in a book so at that time i felt well this would be a good moment to you know try to capture what happened and so that is why i decided to cover this and also i've wanted to write a book ever since i was a young child so felt like a good time to achieve that goal yeah no it makes sense and and one thing that also kind of jumps out immediately when i think about the book is is the title i mean it does um it does sort of crack the veneer of a happy-go-lucky group of optimists looking to to build a better future i mean you really go deep and talk about some of some of the the conflicts that arose among this early cadre of founders that that broke along like economic um political economic lines and visions of how ethereum should should happen so um i mean why did you choose that title and then what do you think people who read the book should understand about the early days of ethereum my editor and i wanted to capture the fact that this was a book that was really about people and about the human aspects of this technology and so that was why especially just the phrase that kryptopians was something that you know he really advocated for and for the subtitle idealism greed lies in the making of the first big cryptocurrency craze those elements are all part of that time period in crypto and frankly i think they're probably also you know they probably also capture the current time period as well i think probably there's a mixture of that in pretty much every area of crypto but you know it really comes through in the story that there are definitely elements of all of those things and so you know that that basically just captured the the story yeah and it's funny in one section of the book you talk about the the red wedding day um and the book the title itself uh reminded me a little bit of of just like game of thrones and palace intrigue so so it is kind of a interesting um sort of analogy there um so let's talk about some of the people obviously the the main character in the book is someone that i'm sure all of your listeners have heard of vitalik buterin the russian board canadian computer scientist founder of ethereum what makes him such an interesting person to cover vitalik definitely is a very interesting character he is not somebody that anybody would call i mean these are pejoratives that are used but you know basic or a typical fill in the blank i mean you could use any word there and i don't think anybody would say vitalik is typical in any way he's really a singular person and he has a very complex personality and when you have someone like that who is a little bit you know different not exactly kind of a certain type of person that you might be able to predict like you know how they would be but also somebody who has a hard time asserting himself all of those things kind of you know are not necessarily qualities that make for a good leader and a lot of people looked to him as a leader in the early years of ethereum but he wasn't necessarily willing to assert himself in that way and because there were so many different competing motives from different people and a lot of infighting that created a lot of problems for ethereum and really those problems dragged on for quite a long time and it's funny i mean as as i read through the book uh i mean you see vitalik's progression maturation as as a leader in in some regards when it comes to making tough decisions when it comes to business personality etc but he definitely does seem to struggle too about knowing who to trust knowing whether certain people are just being nice to him because they want to ride his coattails or if they genuinely do care about him and and it's a lot for for an early 20-something thrust into the the center of it turned out to be a multi-billion dollar economy so that is an interesting journey to follow yeah and one thing i wanted to add was he was so naive when he was young that it didn't even occur to him that some people might have these ulterior motives he was so pure that it never occurred to him that people might be trying to use him or that they might act toward him one way but a different way or toward others and so his inability to really understand human nature was another issue at you know at the core of kind of some of the dysfunctional issues and ethereum leadership yeah i mean they kind of put into perspective it sounds like this was really his first job i mean aside from writing articles for for bitcoin weekly bitcoin magazine i mean this was his first exposure to office politics and yeah certainly his first management experience but but vitalik's just one of the characters i mean for people again that are still relatively new to the space i mean they hear the name gavin wood they think about the founder of polkadot they hear the name charles hoskinson and they identify him with cardano they don't realize one that ethereum ever had a ceo or that it was charles or or that gavin was a developer for ethereum who who built one of the main clients so i mean just very briefly can you just introduce us to a few of the main players from early on um that sort of appear throughout the book so the main developers of ethereum early on were vitalik and gavin and also somebody named jeffrey wilkie as we might say in english but in dutch it's jeff vilca and those three really coded up ethereum obviously they had help from other developers but they were kind of the the main three and there were other people in early ethereum leadership such as charles hoskinson who early on was the ceo there were other co-founders such as amir shetrit who was working on colored coins at the same time anthony diorio who funded the project early on at joe lubin who then later went on to found consensus and was ethereum's coo during that early period and mihai alicia who worked with vitalik on bitcoin magazine yeah it's funny i mean joe and anthony stick out i mean in some ways they're seen as as the money i mean joe with with consensus an entire book could be written on the the development of of that company and sort of the roles played in in ethereum because uh uh just because of some of the palace intrigue but also it really tried to create i guess but joe called it a adventure studio where they were trying to build companies but also developed the blockchain at the same time so it was a very difficult challenge and and and people that followed the consensus closely have will know about some of the issues and and hurdles that it has had to overcome through its development what were some of the challenges when it comes to building ethereum there might be a misperception out there that it's just a bunch of computer nerds in an office just coding up a blockchain but there are there were um i mean there were some issues when it comes to funding to development to just the legal status and then also the workforce the composition of the team so so what were some of the big challenges and and um and dividing lines that emerged um for you as you were researching this book so in true decentralized fashion there were multiple people tasked with different things and they were spread across the globe and there was a group in zuk who lived in a house together and they tackled a lot of the administrative things around holding the crowd sale from switzerland you know tax issues legal issues etc but there were also people who were working on trying to make sure that they could hold the crowd sale in the u.s and have us investors participate and so there was another crew in new york that was working with a legal firm here to try to get an opinion letter that would state that in this law firm's opinion that such a crowdsale would not be illegal and meanwhile there were the coders around the world who were working on the coding vitalik himself actually spent quite a bit of that time in asia so you know even though gavin had hired a whole office of developers for his c plus client in berlin you know vitalik who was working on the python client was often not there jeff vilka was in amsterdam and his team was spread across across the globe there were some people who were actually working from the balloon office but they were working for him not for gavin so it was definitely very decentralized and what were i don't want you to give away all your secrets but but what were some of the dividing lines or or the big personality clashes uh amongst this sort of decentralized team so yeah this gets into some of the things that i think have not been known before my book and one of them is that after a period jeff and gavin started to grow apart and there were there there was definitely i guess you could call a rift and so people have to read a little bit about how this develops but this was not something that their friendship started out with it definitely grew over time and you know part of the development of ethereum is what caused that to happen and and i hinted at it earlier in the interview but there was there was a red wedding day which was kind of i guess almost like like a bloodletting in a in a figurative sense where the team kind of found a new reconstitution to move forward maybe he could just briefly talk about what happened there because it involved some some very big names and sort of how it enabled ethereum to to move into the the crowd sale and so on and so forth so a lot of tensions had been building in ethereum very early on and all of this came to a head at a certain point where a certain group got together and they did some research on charles who was kind of charles hoskinson who was sort of seen as one of the main causes of the tension amongst the group and frankly quite a big problem for ethereum itself and so they came together and they had a plot always sounds like very um nefarious but it's really more around just a plan to to have this discussion but their purpose was to have charles removed from ethereum and that is what culminated in the red wedding day or the games of game of thrones day as people called it and at that time is when charles and amir shetrit were both removed from the project this this has been chronicled before although i do think there are some new details

finalized and how much money did the foundation end up raising from it the crowdsale finally launched july 22 2014 and it went for 42 days which was a number they picked based off this book they liked douglas adams is the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy and they raised if you were so if you were to convert the bitcoins as they came in it would have been 18 million dollars but since they did not do that ultimately by the end they got roughly half that in dollars yeah i know that was also a point of contention in the book that that people will need to to to read about so the crowd sales done but that's not where the the challenges ended obviously then ethereum had to work on on growing and and i i think for really the first time it had to deal with hostile actors as well and and sort of handling some of the ramifications there a few events that you detail extensively in the book include the dow hack the shanghai attacks and also a heck of the parity client so maybe you could just briefly touch on on the three of those and um because they're each a little bit different and forced the foundation to really sort of move quickly to to avoid really significant damage or or i guess crippling damage in the case of the dow so with the dow this obviously was just an application on ethereum but because the hacker got what was then about five percent of all ether this definitely caused a crisis for ethereum and frankly also the dow itself had 14 of all ether and so the remaining nine percent were also at risk because the dallas smart contract was just vulnerable and so in that regard that just created this huge existential crisis for ethereum which we did discuss in the tuesday show so if people haven't listened to that they should definitely check that out but that obviously i mean it led to the creation of ethereum classic and that really is sort of seen as this stain on the history of ethereum there are a lot of critics of ethereum who will point to that as evidence that ethereum is not immutable which is you know in their minds a point of criticism for a blockchain sacrifice yeah and so you know after that the other attacks were kind of different the shanghai attacks which were a series of district um denial of service attacks on ethereum over the course of a month they basically ended up making ethereum stronger because they just kept attacking these different weaknesses in ethereum itself this was not the dao it was ethereum itself and obviously that did create a problem for ethereum and it was you know something that all the developers were working on but it didn't quite create create the same existential crisis because they basically just kept fighting off the attacks and patching each of the vulnerabilities until finally they stopped and frankly ethereum at that point just became stronger and became more well equipped to handle what eventually became an onslaught of activity in the next year as the initial coin offering craze took off and for the parity multi-sig attack those were really on the parity multisig wallet um there were two of them and the second of those really impacted parity itself much more than anyone else so it almost seems you know that that really was was almost targeted at parody but clearly you know i think a lot of people became aware of the importance of wallet security through both of those incidents yeah the shanghai attacks that the ddos attacks are interesting to me to me as well because um for listeners who don't know a ddos or denial of service attack it doesn't actually breach any any security it's really designed to just kind of overload a network or a website to to on the point where it stops working and um i mean you detail exactly how that would happen in in the book but it's not necessarily something being breached it's uh it's more or less an attacker willingly or unwittingly depending on the circumstances i'm just just causing traffic overload to the point of uh of just clapped as late yeah so one person i just have a couple more because i know we don't want to go too long on this um at this point we can't have any interview about the book without mentioning uh ming chan um she she features prominently throughout and and is certainly a controversial figure so maybe just please explain who she is um the role she played in in the foundation and and why she was so so controversial ming was hired as the executive director of the ethereum foundation in the spring of 2015 and she was hired at a time when ethereum was trying to kind of professionalize its board and at the management of the foundation so she was hired along with three other board members and she almost immediately caused some drama and did certain things that cast suspicion on her motives and when i say that actually i should rephrase it as a to certain people she you know caused this suspicion but to vitalik he either you know even though he was informed of those actions that cast suspicion on her motives he either chose not to believe what whatever those suspicions might be or to have those suspicions himself and he listened to her and ended up giving her a lot more power and the board members ended up leaving over this situation they kind of were put in a little bit of an impossible situation which vitalik himself wrote a letter explaining he agreed that yes they were in an impossible situation but then after that it really became about ming and vitalik essentially running the foundation and ming was very controversial because many people in the community did not think she was doing a good job they felt that there were many problems with the way she managed the foundation and because she was their boss they couldn't necessarily express those issues and feel that they would be dealt with appropriately and so the problems that people perceived with ming just dragged on for as long as she was part of the foundation yeah and then um her exit also um as he deeps on the book was very protracted and and i think it ended up finally coming to a head when a bunch of italic's friends i believe it was in thailand almost had an intervention with him where he kind of eventually came to the conclusion that i guess for the health of the foundation and and ethereum they had to they had to move on but but but it is it is interesting and um and also kind of paints a picture into the type of people that move into crypto because we hear a lot i mean ming had impeccable credentials i mean mit university of michigan i mean on paper she looked like a terrific hire and today i mean we hear all about people from wall street applying to work at crypto firms and and sometimes there is a bit of a culture clash sometimes sometimes it's just a personality it might not be a good fit and sometimes uh i know as you did to the book when we talk was looking for mink's replacement he looked for someone that perhaps didn't have like the same sparkling resume but but would be a better culture fit so i think that's an interesting thread that you you pull out in the book so i know we're getting close to time but one of the other big themes he touched on are our icos and sort of how that craze started off and ended up throughout 2017 and early 2018 i mean just brought unprecedented levels of fundraising and attention to crypto and i wanted to your thoughts because this has obviously been covered extensively by you and numerous other journalists around the world i'm curious like any big takeaways but also why do you think icos took off when they did because there were plenty of crowd sales and and token generation events whatever you want to call it i mean ethereum around one a couple years prior that that did not raise hundreds of millions of dollars so why do you think the icos really just exploded in late 2017 early 2018. because by that point with the ether price as high as it was it created a whole new class of crypto whales before then we'd had the bitcoin whales but now suddenly there were all these ethereum wheels and on top of that now it was much easier to participate there were things like my ether wallet which just made it possible for people to participate from their web browser and that's what they were doing and you know this was something where you didn't need to be an accredited investor and in the private market the private markets in general like for startups were remaining private for much longer you know in previous eras of in history startups went public much more quickly than they do nowadays and so there was just kind of i think a lot of hunger for people to get more return on their investments and crypto really was providing that and since you know with just with a little my ether wallet wallet people could participate in these icos and very quickly become liquid and turn that into real money and that's why we also saw these pumpkin dump schemes and continue to see them to this day because crypto assets are liquid very quickly and you know it just creates a lot of incentives for bad behavior yeah and and you detail my ether wallet in in the in the book as well and and and and basically how taylor stopped sleeping to answer uh customer service requests as they were coming in and they supported more icos and so that is a fascinating part of it part of it as well and it kind of likens back to exchanges and how you detail where they with the dow they let people buy dow tokens right with with fiat and just kind of eliminated that friction um so that's always an interesting little tidbit i know we're getting close to time so just just to wrap up um i wanted to ask you to look at the research you've done for your book and sort of how that applies to today where defy is now the big thing not necessarily well defy and nfts and both of those have gone through their own cycles of of of hype nfts currently are white hot and basically like do you have any projections prognostications uh about like what you think how some of those new new trends might play out based on the work you've done to put this together well something funny that i find is that both d5 and nfts are moving to daos so i'm actually wondering if this next big trend is just going to be dao's but it's going to be all the things just move to daos because you know a lot of a different like you know fwb is an nft group or um i mean that nouns dao is like another dow but it's around nfts i mean there's there's so many of them and then if you look at you know like ave or a compound or whatever all of these are either trying to decentralize or have already decentralized and they're using governance tokens so i actually feel like that is the overarching trend and we'll see what happens but i am keeping my eye on it because obviously i am in the market for what my next book will be and that actually was going to be my last question i'm sure you're going to take a bit of a breather now that this is out but if you were going if you had a plan to write a second book what would the topic be well i let's just say i can't say too much about that right now but but um i might have some news on that pretty soon so keep keep posted i'll i'll keep you posted all right that sounds great well once again laura thank you for joining me on on unchained it's a pleasure to speak with you and

unchained thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap for those of you watching on video i apologize for their lighting where i am as i'm on the road and so i'm just making do with what i have russia's move on ukraine shocked crypto markets the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies slid roughly 10 in the hours after news broke that russia had launched a military operation in ukraine the crypto markets dropped from a high of around 1.76 trillion dollars to a low of about 1.58 trillion dollars between 11 30 a.m utc on wednesday and 1 30 a.m on utc on thursday liquidations were also severe with over 860 million dollars in positions wiped out in the 24 hours between wednesday and thursday afternoon 3 30 pm eastern specifically making it the largest liquidation event in february according to the block these liquidations could more than double if the price of eth falls below 2100 which would result in an automatic liquidation of 500 million dollars in eth if the positions of seven siblings a large maker vault holder are not re-collateralized that being said following an announcement from us president joe biden of sanctions against russia bitcoin rose by more than four thousand dollars russia's decision to enter ukraine was met with vociferous opposition by some of the biggest names in crypto very upset by putin's decision to abandon the possibility of a peaceful solution to the dispute with ukraine and go to war instead wrote ethereum creator vitalik buterin who also added that the invasion is a crime against both the ukrainian and russian people digital currency groups barry silbert was even more upfront tweeting war memo capital begins internal investigation of toby honish on tuesday i published an article on forbes describing how in the course of reporting and writing my book the cryptopians my sources and i found the person that we believe is the 2016 dow attacker toby honish who denied it in an email afterward his new venture mimo capital expressed surprise at the result of my investigation but also said it was conducting a new investigation into honish using a third party firm out phishing 17 open c users lose nfts openc customers fell prey to a complex phishing attack on sunday morning according to an internal investigation completed by the nft marketplace the attack was not specifically connected to openc emails domains or its official website overall the attack took place across 15 hours during which thousands of dollars worth of nfts were stolen in a tweet thread recapping the phishing scam open c nadav hollander explained the scam was most likely a targeted attack as opposed to a systemic issue regarding a contract upgrade on openc that tricked users into signing a malicious smart contract going forward hollander is confident that fishers will have trouble executing similar attacks because openc is adding eip 712 to its new contract this upgrade will improve the security of signing off-chain messages such as signing a message to join a waitlist raffle or token gated discord group hollander also noted that openc would be helping victims of the attack even though it stemmed from outside the nft marketplace speaking of openc and buggy code a complaint filed by timothy mckimmy in texas federal court claims that he is the rightful owner of board ape 3475 despite ethereum's blockchain showing that he sold it for 0.01 eth earlier this year due to an alleged bug on openc's website in his suit mckimmy is asking for the return of his sentinel of tea and damages over 1 million dollars he is accusing openc of negligence and breach of contract the current price floor for a board api club nft is somewhere around 200 000 china outlaws crypto fundraising china's supreme court ruled that raising money from the public via digital assets is illegal according to a statement released on thursday while china has banned crypto in the past this new ruling allows china to officially charge digital asset fundraisers with criminal sentences and jail time luna foundation guard buys bitcoin to back its stablecoin the luna foundation guard announced a one billion dollar token sale of luna the native token of terra a smart contract blockchain specializing in stable coins dokwan the founder of tara described the 1 billion raise as the largest ever cap formation in crypto investors who participated in the sale will see their luna locked on a four year vesting schedule luna foundation guard lfg for short because crypto is a non-profit organization focused on supporting terra and ust the largest stable coin ontario and fourth largest stable coin by total market capitalization writ large notably proceeds from the 1 billion luna sale will be used to purchase bitcoin and create a forex reserve available to tap during times of extreme market volatility to keep ust's value pegged to the dollar according to a thread by tara the move is designed to assuage concerns regarding a crypto bank run scenario and bitcoin is the ideal asset for such a plan although the widespread adoption of ust as a consistently stable asset through market volatility should already refute this a decentralized reserve can provide an additional avenue to maintain the peg in contractionary cycles that reduces the reflexivity of the system the ust forex reserve is an lfg initiative to provide a further layer of support for the ustpeg using assets that are considered less correlated to the tarot ecosystem like bitcoin in addition to the terra news a judge in new york ordered terraform labs the development firm behind terra to comply with an investigative subpoena into whether terraform labs had violated u.s securities laws via mir protocol a synthetic asset defy platform kwon who is also the ceo of terraform labs initially pushed back against complying with the sec and had filed a separate lawsuit against the securities regulator bitmex founders plead guilty arthur hayes and benjamin dello founders of and executives of the crypto exchange bit max pled guilty to violating the bank secrecy act on thursday which carries a maximum sentence of five years a press release by the u.s department of justice listed their transgressions as willfully failing to establish implement and maintain an anti-money laundering or aml program at bitmex both hayes and dello will pay a 10 million criminal fine canadian regulators are not a fan of self-custody according to a report from the leader post the ontario securities commission contacted law enforcement agencies regarding tweets from two prominent crypto ceos flagging the commons because the regulator felt the executives were offering advice on evading sanctions the news comes after canadian law enforcement asked canadian crypto trading platforms to freeze assets associated with a list of cryptocurrency addresses involved in sending funds to the freedom convoy trucker protests the flagged tweets came from coinbase ceo brian armstrong and kraken ceo jesse powell they recommended that users concerned about government seizure move their assets off of crypto exchanges to self-custodied wallets in response to a comment asking if kraken would comply with authorities to freeze accounts paula had this to say 100 yes it has slash will happen and 100 yes we will be forced to comply if you're worried about it don't keep your funds with any centralized regulated custodian we cannot protect you get your coins or cash out and only trade peer-to-peer as for armstrong he simply professed agreement with his fellow ceo tweeting in response to a question about coinbase custody in canada i agree with at jess powell on this despite canada's attempt to freeze funds associated with roughly 30 bitcoin wallets on-chain data shows that around 20 btc have been moved since last week with some of the funds ending up on coinbase and crypto.com which disclosure is a sponsor of my show as of press time it's unclear if the funds were cashed out or whether crypto exchanges not listed as financial institutions in canada would have to comply with canadian law salesforce employees speak out against new database product two weeks ago cnbc reported that salesforce a top 75 company by market cap in the world is working on an nft cloud service however as with many nft projects that hit mainstream companies the software
