ethereum merge occurred on the kiln test net this week taking the smart contract network one step closer to its transition from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake a moment in time called the merge by ethereans according to a blog post by ethereum foundation developers kiln is expected to be the last merged test net created before existing public test nets are upgraded from there the merge will go to mainnet and ethereum will be fully secured proof of stake that being said a date for the merge on mainnet has yet to be set only once the merge successfully occurs on the public test nets will an exact date be known ethereum's approach to the merge comes as data from etherscan shows that over 10 million ether have been staged to the official eth2 deposit address this surmises a roughly 29 billion bet by eth stakers that ethereum will successfully merge at current prices with ethereum's market cap sitting around 337 billion dollars that means roughly eight percent of all eth is locked into the network's consensus layer formerly known as eth2 with the merge analysts are expecting a drastic decrease in each issuance for example hop protocol's lido cohen

gensler received a strongly worded letter from eight members of the congressional blockchain caucus the letter claims that the securities and exchange commission's recent investigations into crypto firms are inconsistent with standard procedure and might be at odds with the paperwork reduction act the representatives asked chairgencler to answer 13 questions pertaining to the burden of voluntary
