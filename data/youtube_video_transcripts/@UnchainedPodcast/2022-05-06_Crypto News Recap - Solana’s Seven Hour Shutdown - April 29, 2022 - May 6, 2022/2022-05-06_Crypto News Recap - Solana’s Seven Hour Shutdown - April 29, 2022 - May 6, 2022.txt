[Music] thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap solana had a tough weekend solano went down for roughly seven hours on saturday according to its twitter account the network lost consensus after an enormous amount of inbound transactions 4 million per second flooded the network in a post-mortem the team explained that the influx of transactions targeted a new nft drop using candy machine solana's popular nft minting tool since the price had a fixed floor and not a dynamic dutch auction the first user to call the mint received the nft which created an economic incentive to send a huge number of transactions in hopes of winning the mint the team wrote due to the overwhelming amount of transactions the network validators ran out of memory and crashed leading to consensus stalling until validators restarted the network via discord and google doc coordination this is not the first significant outage for solana which experienced a 17 hour shutdown in september 2021 which solana says shares characteristics with the blackout last weekend solana will be adding fee prioritization in its v1.11 release along with three other mitigations in the wake of the network failure finance and elon are teaming up elon musk is no longer the sole purchaser of twitter according to a thursday filing musk has raised 7 billion in funding from oracle co-founder larry ellison venture capital firm sequoia investment behemoth fidelity and finance the crypto exchange will be putting up 500 million dollars towards the acquisition by the way speaking of fidelity senators elizabeth warren and tina smith sent a letter to fidelity ceo abigail johnson about fidelity's plans to enable people to save with bitcoin in their 401ks saying that bitcoin was too risky of an asset it also noted fidelity may have conflicts of interest because fidelity has been mining bitcoin and because it offers a crypto fund to wealthy clients bitcoiners aghast at bip 119's speed a bitcoin improvement proposal or bip introduced an opcode called check template verify or ctv and it was written by bitcoin developer and researcher jeremy rubin and it caused quite a commotion in the bitcoin community this week bip 119 is not controversial at face value essentially it allows bitcoin transactions to be used in a restricted manner in the future meaning transactions can be programmed in a limited fashion in bip 119 terminology this restriction on future use is called a covenant it sort of works like a baby smart contract according to ruben allowing bitcoins to be programmed via covenants has interesting applications for example exchanges could batch transactions during times of network congestion and settle at a later date additionally bip 119 would increase the speed of the lightning network and make trustless coin joins easier to execute however rubin has asked the bitcoin community to vote on the soft fork upgrade via a speedy trial in which if a soft fork would be voted for by 90 of block miners within a specific period then the upgrade would be approved speedy trial was used in approving the taproot upgrade which went into effect earlier last year however unlike taproot which was proposed in 2018 bitcoiners are worried that bip 119 has not been studied enough bitcoin og and educator andreas antonopoulos called ruben's choice of a speedy trial activation entirely inappropriate peter mccormack the host of what bitcoin did tweeted i'm nervous that something might get activated that a bunch of people just don't agree with the sec is beefing up its crypto
