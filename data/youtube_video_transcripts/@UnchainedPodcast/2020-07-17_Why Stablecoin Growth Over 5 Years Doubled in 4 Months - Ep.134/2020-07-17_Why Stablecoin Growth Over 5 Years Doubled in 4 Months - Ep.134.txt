metrics published a report this week called the rise of stable coins what are the top takeaways from your report so the top takeaways are basically so as when I started the report I started by looking at kind of the history of stable coins over time but when I started getting into the data I refocused it around specifically the rise of tether so over the last three to four months the supply of tethers specifically has more than doubled which has pushed the supply of overall stable coins to new highs and why did you decide to look into stable coins now you did talk a little bit about how Heather has risen can you put some numbers on that yeah sure so to put it in a little context so it took about five years for stable coin supply to reach six billion overall it only took another four months for it to grow from six billion to 12 billion and pretty much all of that growth happened after the March 12th crypto crash when crypto assets including Bitcoin and theorem dropped over 50% in a day so in the report I really into why that happened and why the rise was sparked by this crash in kryptos which is a little counterintuitive in the past when we've seen spikes and sample coins especially teather it's kind of coincided with Bitcoin price going up and what did you find basically what happened is first of all there there was a big increase in demand for stable coins and tethers specifically following March 12th that happened for a variety of reasons the first is that there was a rush rush to safety after March 12th so people started piling into stable coins trading volume also went up so there was an increased demand for stable coins which also often used as a quote currency in trading but this rise in demand caused tether price to rise above a dollar you know so typically only think of stable coins that pegged to a dollar their horn whole point is that they should be stable at a dollar but this large increase in demand after March 12 led to this increase in tenet price all the way through the end of May and that increase in price then led to arbitrage opportunities so because of stable coins nature as a pegged currency any time it deviates from that $1 peg there's opportunity to make money so when we see this huge increase in supply billions of stable coins suddenly being printed a lot of that is tied to the fact that if whoever is printing these stable coins are buying them at a dollar can then go and sell them immediately on an exchange and make a lot of money essentially and so wait which stable coins were veering away from the $1 peg so all pretty much all of them went significally above their peg on March 12th specifically and that was because of the price crash and waited to kind of bit mechs liquidation spiral and crypto prices just crashing but most of them are covered quickly except for tether tether is kind of a big outlier here while the rest of it stable coins USD see impacts went back close to that $1 peg tether stayed above that peg for a couple months and it's just kind of like fractions of a penny above the panic but that small amount above the peg has huge consequences and can lead to a lot of baggage our 13 News and so why why hast had there been far and away the most dominant stable coin yes so if you look back throughout throughout its history tether has accounted for a 90% plus of the overall stable client supply its past is a little more sorted so you know as most people in crypto are huerta there has a little bit of a sketchy history there's questions about whether it's really fully backed and reserved but for whatever reason that has never really stopped it from becoming from being the dominant coin the the big thing that happened is first of all just at a first mover advantage it was basically the first big stable coin it started getting momentum from there and it basically became when the dominant trading currencies and as I show on the report to shed there has a lot more liquidity than other stable coins so since it has more liquidity that kind of baguettes more liquidity people more people used to there questions about what really is driving this demands it's a little harder to figure that out especially if you're just looking at on chain and market data but there have been a lot of reports that tether is used extensively in Asian trading markets especially in China it's used a lot for OTC trading it's used kind of as a replacement as a Fiat on-ramp in places where there's restrictions about trading Fiat directly for for cryptocurrency and I think kind of that that gray area that tether lives in which I was just referring to about the regulatory kind of sketchiness that's a lot of what makes tether attractive in a way to certain traders or OTC desks or whatever who are kind of living living in the gray area need to quickly get current get access to cryptocurrency and might not be able to if they're playing within you know the regulations of their jurisdiction so that's driven a lot of it and again it's this kind of even though tethers supposed to be picked to a dollar it's almost like a feature of tether in a way that it's not pegged to a dollar rather than a book because since it's it fluctuates more than other cryptocurrencies that just leads this kind of disproportionate explosion and supply of people who are trying to profit off of it basically and can you just walk me through the arbitrage opportunity so essentially I'm assuming you buy another coin just yeah walk me through how that works how are people making money from this yes okay the kind of simplest most basic straightforward way so you know Ted they're on paper the way it's supposed to work is you put a dollar into the tether Reserve then you can get a dollar out or USD T out so whoever has access to printing more tether to putting more money into the reserve which is we actually don't really know exactly who has it but it's a handful of kind of traders and and exchanges and stuff they they can then go in and essentially pretty much either $4 each sell it on exchanges right away which trading for more dollar and make quick quick money so that's not the most basic example but anyone who has access to buying tether add a dollar which even if even if the price on most exchanges is over a dollar there's still opportunities to buy it for a dollar if they're on other exchanges or the kind of best way is just going straight to the source putting more money into total reserve and printing each other anyone who's able to buy it for $1 can then go and sell it for the higher price and there are kind of you know markets on different exchanges to for trading tether directly to USD or even other stable coins but I think a majority of that happened from people printing new tether and then selling that new tether immediately for for a profit and but normally when there are arbitrage opportunities they kind of go evened out because yeah yeah why didn't that happen why did it stay above the price yes that's kind of one of the mysteries of this why did it stay above the tech for so long because yeah exactly like you said like kind of arbitrage it naturally will pull the price back to a dollar as people are selling it so that that's women ministries here is how did it stay so far above the peg for a couple of months and I'm not sure I wish I had a better answer about that it's a little opaque just with the nature of tether it's a little pick how this entire process works of printing each other who gets it we're not really sure a past research has shown that when new tether is printed a lot of it goes directly to a certain set of exchanges Biffen x being the biggest one OTC does as well which are hard to track so yeah it's it's it's confusing exactly how this process is working but this appears to be what happening I have a interesting graph in me in the report that shows the days where tethers prices above the pack above $1 on one axis and then the other axis is the new tether supply that's being issued and we actually use it we use a metric a coin metric called free float supply which shows the amount of supply that's actually getting out there into the public as opposed to the supply that just is being held by the Treasury so if you look at these two together the free float supply the increase in free float supply just perfectly lines up with the days that tethers price is above a dollar and then as soon as it goes below a dollar the the supply flow stops and that kind of picks back up when it's above again I know what do you but what do you think that means that correlation yes so that's that's kind of the missing piece of the puzzle that I would love to figure out next but I think it means that someone is essentially whoever has access to printing this tether is printing it at large quantities when they have the opportunity to do so and then when there's not the money-making opportunity there's just not as much incentive to print this tether so they stopped printing it which is it's a little confusing because there is there is some sort of demand in the first place that's causing the price to go up above a dollar right there's increased demand coming from somewhere there's someone on the other side is buying the tether right but we don't know exactly who that who they are or who's who the people are selling and we don't know why demand to stay high for so long but there's something happening there a connection between the two that's that's driving the supply growth all right in a moment we're gonna discuss how stable coins work why it is that traditionally the supply is first one with the price of Bitcoin what happened on Black Friday etc but first a quick word from the

speaking at t-- quorum submit your presentation ideas and the tases community will vote on who comes to the podium next sign-up and learn more about the virtual series at t-- quorum comm back to my conversation with nate Madri traditionally stable coins supply has risen with a price of Bitcoin and obviously that changed this year but you know why do you think that if happened as I mentioned when I kind of initially started do this report I worked at history I should mention too that this reporter was partnership with bitstamp and bitstamp it kind of asked us to go back and look starting at the history of sample coins always happening so I think throughout a lot of tithers history early history so 2017-2018 when Heather was rising with the price of Bitcoin that was more intertwined to Bitcoin surahs' and there's a lot of theories about what happened first whether tether was being printed first and then sold for Bitcoin and Rose versa but I think this this situation 21:20 is different I think the arbitrage opportunities have really come comes the forefront here a lot because the market infrastructure in general has just improved so much since then there are more opportunities to do this Heather has a lot more liquidity than ever before and because because those billions of dollars of tether got printed in 2018-2019 there's now just so much tether out there which which makes these other opportunities possible basically all right so let's now just dive a little bit more into the stable coins so why is it that you think that some of the stable coins remained truer to the one dollar price than others like in general how is it that these different types of stable coins may recognize you know there are different categories how do they typically remain stable in price most other stable coins stay a stay more stable I'm us TC is probably the biggest example it's the second biggest stable coin so yeah I mean normally there's the process is pretty simple you know it's as long as they have kind of a dollar in reserve for each of these staple coins it will it kind of goes by supply and demand right like if supply if demand goes up faster than supply then price is going to go up but for the most part these staple coins operate relatively transparently I think us DC and paxos and others have done a better job of doing this and they're just more freely available on coin based and other exchanges but yeah there's there's some I think just the nature of tether of it being a little more through backchannels where a lot of this trading happens it's not you know USD seems mostly on coin based and other exchanges but these are spread out everywhere you know no one really knows what's going on but I think that's part part of what leads to the price fluctuations we did see fluctuations of a couple of other stable coins to die in particular went way above its peg that's more related just to its decentralized nature since dye is backed by cryptocurrency and it's backed by a bunch of different people or entities instead of one company that's holding it all when the price crashed the crypto price crashed on March 12th that essentially caused a lot of the collateral backing die to be liquidated and that that caused an extreme shortage of dye in the system so that's again the supply and demand at work of a sudden there was much less than I supply dye price shut up and it's still it's still up as well so the mechanics are a little bit different there and then another one that we saw off its bag was gem and I go into USD and that's more related to a really low supply that there's only like 10 million or less actually that has been printed so there's just no liquidity there I think and no real demand for it and so what types of crypto users tend to be holding stable coins a majority of it is used for trading and so I there's another chart I have in the report which shows if you actually look at the addresses that are holding tether especially the etherium version of tether because tether has been printed on multiple blood chains but if you look at the addresses that are holding it so I actually broke it down by basically with wale addresses so if you look at addresses that are holding at least a million dollars were with each other or more those addresses are holding I think it's close to four billion tether out of the total supply so a huge amount of tether is being held by these very large addresses most of these addresses are exchanges so that shows and there was a big uptake in me and the amount that these addresses were holding after March 12 so to me that that shows that a lot of astable coins that just held on exchanges essentially parked on the sidelines as kind of a safe haven asset either just so that so people can just have kind of a crypto form of safe steady asset ready to reinvest if the market goes back up or it might be the exchanges themselves you know a lot of exchangers are might be changing some of their Fiat into tether or stable coins to take advantage of con Portability and liquidity and kind of inter exchange settlement so I think that's that's the big first chunk and of course the exchangers are holding those but it's individual investors who have it on the exchanges which complicates a little bit but then the other interesting thing we saw is that if you look at also smaller addresses those addresses are holding $1,000 or less with each other those also skyrocketed after March 12th so it looks like they're kind of two different things probably happening there's money being held on exchangers there's money being held on the sidelines again there's there's the man just for training itself reusing as a quote currency but then there also appears to be individuals outside of exchanges just holding smaller amounts and it's a little harder to figure out what exactly they're doing with it it could be potentially that people are using it more as a medium of exchange like for example you know Global remittances cross order payments tether and status table coins in general it's kind of a perfect use case for them especially now with everything that's happening in the world so I suspect that's probably happening as well but it's a little harder to kind of find the evidence for that directly and maybe for some of those people who live in economies with currencies that are undergoing inflation they might be simply using it for savings - yeah exactly I think that's a big part of it - I would love to kind of look through economies where especially where they're fiat currency is to get is get it is decreasing compared to the dollar they can just kind of park it in thethe very stable coins instead and it's a way that to hold their value while no matter what happens with their regular currency and you talked a little bit before about why it is that stable coins tend to be traded more in other jurisdictions and it was so why is that why is it that traders in places like the u.s. or North America just maybe aren't as you know huge users of stable coins we are starting to see more shift from USD to sample coins as well even in the US but I think it's it's mostly we see a disproportionately large amount of users in Asia and China specifically just because of China effectively bans you know Fiat - crypto trading a couple years ago so I think that's why you see more there but we're seeing in the US as well I think it's you see it all over because it just it makes more sense for for crypto use cases that you get less fees than if you're converting back and forth to fiat it's easier to essentially have more liquidity you can easily send it through out exchanges so do you feel like there are certain segments that use certain staple coins yeah definitely that there are different use cases for the different stable coins and there's another chart in the report that looks at the median transfer value of different stable coins and there are a couple kind of PUSD which is by neskowin and 8 USC which is will be to kind of exchange back coin so it's a really high median of medium of exchange values so it's like $10,000 plus so that's shows that it's either been used for kind of large trades or maybe enter exchange settlement but then the rest of them kind of range between $1,000 and less paxos is at the bottom towards $100 that shows that being used for different purposes you know paxos might be used for more kind of medium of exchange type type deal well tether which is I think the medium transfer value is about a thousand that's probably still being used morphic trading I think though even even that being said I think we probably see it a little lower than median transfer values a little lower if it's truly been used as medium of exchange or even for remittances so it'll be interesting to see how those those values change kind of over the upcoming months and years yeah and the other thing that's fascinating about this chart is that the tether one fluctuates a lot more in terms of the median transfer value than some of the other ones like PACs or H USD which is a low B's yeah yeah so it's interesting I guess that means maybe whales are moving in and out or something like that yeah that's probably a larger trends happening yeah yeah related to exchanges too because you know the exchanges shift large amounts around it that'll get caught in there as well well I guess maybe not as much the median but yeah and then what about a stable coin velocity against Bitcoin and ether what did you find there yeah so stable coins have a significantly higher velocity than and then both Bitcoin and ether and velocity is basically just a measure of the amount of times that unit of supply changes hands throughout the best year so like every time it's transferred from one address to another that gets counted towards velocity so so Bitcoin and theorem are both around six or so six or seven so that means each unit of supply will change hands about six or seven times throughout a year on average stable coins are much higher on 50 60 plus so that shows that they are being exchanged much more frequently so they're getting passed around that shows they're being used more like a medium of exchange it doesn't necessarily mean that they're being used as a medium of exchange but they have those properties again it's probably somewhat related to trade because they're just used use back and forth and trading but I think it's interesting because it shows that stable coins are basically starting to take over this kind of medium of exchange narrative that people have talked to a lot you know even going back to bitcoins you know what the Bitcoin white paper was talked about potentially being a medium of exchange I think we're starting to really see stable coins fill that void as opposed to Bitcoin and aetherium which are more used as you know store value or kind of other other purposes yeah and we see that also in the chart called total adjusted transfer value where for the first time and I guess it's just maybe the last month or so that the total is just a transfer value in stable coins has exceeded that a bit coin which for pretty much all of history at least until the beginning of your chart which is in January or the winter of 2019 that it's always been Bitcoin so what is what do you think of that what does that say to you yeah so I think it's a really interesting flipping it's interesting that it's happening now I kind of look at take a step back I think stable coins are basically the first killer app on top of Bitcoin and aetherium you know it's a stable coins are very simple application but there are an application and most mostly built on ethereum so I think it's interesting that we're starting to kind of see that this first big application built on top of block chains are starting to move past you know Bitcoin specifically and it's been passed aetherium for a while so I think it's a sign of things to come there going to be more and more of these different applications on block chains and will be interesting to see the interplay between these different types of tokens and apps and the chains itself like a stable coin gonna start is it going to be beneficial to aetherium is it going to start being parasitic to aetherium we'll see but I think it's gonna be really interesting watching it over the next couple years yeah yeah I saw Camilla Russo tweeted recently that the market cap of all ERC 20 tokens has exceeded that of a theorem itself and I wonder if that will change when a theory moves to proof of stake or just how all that yeah there's just so many fluctuating factors at play right now yeah there's so many variables yeah all right well and is is there anything that you're looking toward in terms of the future about where stable coins are going or any metrics you're watching yeah I think the biggest thing I'm watching right now is just more in the regulation front no there's there's new regulatory scrutiny on tether and I kind of feel even though tether is is so huge and it feels like it's been on this precarious ground for a while now so I'm watching pretty closely to see whether this new round of regulation or there's actually going to change things or not and I think the other interesting thing that I'm watching is the rise of stable coins within defy within decentralized finance especially u.s. CC that was being incorporated a lot into decentralized finance and that could kind of be a transition between these more speculative use cases with stable horns you know arbitrage trading etc it's more kind of real crypto native use cases which which could really take the adoption to the next level yeah yeah and the thing that's interesting about the US DC was that news about how they blacklisted that one address all the to five people were up in arms about alright well this has been very fascinating thanks for coming on unconfirmed thank you so much Laura don't forget next up is

to this week's news recap first headline Twitter hack reaches VIP user accounts to perpetrate a Bitcoin scam a coordinated attack hacked numerous high-profile Twitter accounts such as those of Elon Musk Bill Gates Kanye West Jeff Bezos Joe Biden and Barack Obama to run a Bitcoin scam the corporate accounts of Apple and uber were compromised as for the accounts of a host of influential players in the crypto space including finance Gemini coinbase coin desk Charlie Lee and others Larry Cermak director of research at the block compiled all the high profile Twitter hacks in chronological he says quote the takeaway is that the hacker started with large crypto accounts and stuck to only a few formats and addresses the hacker then moved to non crypto celebrities two hours after the first hack it's totally unacceptable that it took Twitter to act as long as it did at 4:17 p.m. Eastern Time it was absolutely clear to anyone that was paying attention that Twitter was compromised it took Twitter two hours at 6:05 p.m. Eastern time to start acting initially these hacked accounts promoted a Bitcoin giveaway scam associated with an organization dubbed crypto for health later the hackers posted tweets with a Bitcoin address along with messages such as I am giving back to the community all bitcoins sent to the address below will be sent back doubled if you send $1,000 I will simply two thousand dollars only doing this for 30 minutes enjoy while Twitter reacted quickly to remove many of the messages similar tweets were sent again from the same accounts indicating that the hackers had completely overwhelmed Twitter security the popular social media platform how to eventually disable some of its services temporarily to prevent the scam from spreading further on Thursday the Federal Bureau of Investigation that it had open n attack an investigation into the hours long hack according to reports the Bitcoin was promoted and the tweets received over 300 transactions and Bitcoin worth more than one thousand one hundred thousand dollars indicating that some twitter users did fall prey to the scam a Twitter investigation revealed that the hackers had compromised employee accounts in a coordinated social engineering attack security experts have suggested that the blame for the incident squarely rests with Twitter due to security flaws in its service however a new report by vice even suggests that the hackers may have convinced a twitter employee to help coordinate these takeovers following the hacks the social media platform is now restricting posts containing crypto addresses it has disabled the ability to share strings of numbers and letters on its site typically used in crypto addresses according to tests conducted by the block research litecoin XRP

20 token ecosystem seems to be having his own big moment according to data compiled by Camilla Russo founder at crypto media publication that defiant the ERC 20 tokens running on the eat on the

14th fueling rumors that the exchange is exploring options to go public a coin based spokesperson said that the upcoming meeting is meant to quote facilitate a wider understanding of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology last week there were reports of the exchanged may be planning a stock market listing later this year the announcement of this investor day comes at a time when coin base is facing flak from the crypto community for providing its watching analytics software to the US Secret Service coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong wrote a tweet thread to defend his company's decision of lysine analytic software to government agencies he argued that blockchain analytics software has been around for a long time and said that people still have the option of using privacy coins if they wanted quote true privacy however on Twitter Larry Cermak of the blog pointed out various inconsistencies that he saw in Brian's tweets saying quote what's still not clear is whether coinbase is giving government agencies access to the full cluster of all their addresses coinbase has always had a notoriously difficult set of addresses to cluster that data is only ever probabilistic unless you are coinbase remember that in 2018 coinbase served client's data of 13 users to the IRS when you combine client data experts with perfect knowledge of the cluster it creates a new dangerous dynamic
