deployment tool set block daemon helped eliminate technical debt by offering flexibility across networks and nodes try it with Bitcoin on block daemon comm slash Unchained my guest today is Barry Silbert founder and CEO of digital currency group welcome Barry hi Laura something I find so interesting about you is that even though you have a more traditional financial background than other people in the Cardo space you previously played a role as a sort of renegade or at least somebody who found and was able to capitalize on a new niche so in that way it's not like that just similar from what you're doing here in crypto for listeners who don't know your pre Bitcoin background can you describe what you used to do yes so after college I graduated from Emory in 98 I became a investment banker and worked on a lot of bankruptcy and restructuring deals during the last the internet bubble and bust and eventually decided I wanted to each that entrepreneurial scratch that I had and I left banking to start a company called second market which it was a really interesting time to be doing a fin tech startup because this was actually kind of 2004 when I did it startup just starting starting a company wasn't all the rage and there wasn't a whole lot of money out there and you know raise few $2,000 and and started a company that that basically we set out to build a stock market for private companies at the time the only way that founders and employees and investors could get liquidity was through an IPO or an M&A exit and I thought that was just totally crazy you need work ten years your life and you still you know we're making $50,000 a year and so yes a launch second market and I think we were successful in creating this this whole new path of liquidity that's become pretty pretty common now yeah and that was mostly for companies that were not yet IP owed which is a much more common trend nowadays right we were we were lucky because Facebook came along and Facebook was one of these situations where they had such success and they had such a large employee base that had that got stock that had just a lot of money tied up in the stock and a lot of investors weren't to buy it and so we were we were successful in creating a market for the Facebook stock which definitely put SecondMarket on the map and then that helped made it it made it it made it like socially acceptable for a company to allow their employees to get liquidity and it made it possible for investors to get involved in these companies before an IPO and so we were really active with Facebook and Twitter and LinkedIn and a bunch of other companies before they went IPO and so you had a successful company and then you left it all to get a Bitcoin how did you learn about Bitcoin first of all some you know everybody's Bitcoin journey is is I find it so interesting and and for me you know being like a former banker and then I guess a fin tech entrepreneur I I didn't first get excited about Bitcoin from you know from from a technology perspective for me it was in 2011 I heard about it for the first time and it might have been around one of those first articles that came out about Silk Road and I think it was around that time and I had just read a book by Charles Hugh Smith entitled unconventional guide for investing in trouble time and essentially this was kind of post credit crisis and this is a 2011 at the time I still thought that we were gonna have another leg down in the market I thought that we weren't through the worst and so I was reading this book and I was talking about places where you could put money that should perform well in periods of dislocation and if I remember correctly the conclusion of the book was it was like buy gold it was like invest in yourself by farmland and things like that so I was really I guess I was very open to the idea that there or that there were going to be investments out there that were not going to be correlated that would perform well and you know kind of in the financial apocalypse and that's when I heard about Bitcoin and and and so I like most people I spent it's been easily six months being a complete skeptic but I kept then coming back to what I kept on I had all these you know the the typical it's not gonna work because of you know government regulation or it's the codes gonna be flawed or whatever the case may be I'd had I had all of these objections and all those reservations and and eventually I came to the conclusion this would've been really 2012 that Bitcoin really did have a potential to change the world and if I didn't have the cojones as I say to do something I would regret it the rest of my life if I didn't at least put some money into it and so I started buying Bitcoin in 2012 I remember the first Bitcoin I bought you know of course it was over Mount GOx and I think it took me it took me like 30 days to figure out how to get money to Japan to mount GOx and I was I had to open up like a Dwolla account and I tried to wire money from my bank which got rejected eventually got got money there and so I started buying Bitcoin in 2012 below 10 bucks and and I put I put you know enough money into it to matter and you know the price went from like 10 to 15 then it fell back down to 5 and and so early on it for me it was really all about the digital Gold's use case and so that was my first first foray into Bitcoin is you know just buying it as decorative investment and then you are saying that you felt like you know you need that the show that you had the cojones to get involved so how did she then go from just buying it by the way Pat's story about Dwolla and mal cogs like so many of the Bitcoin entrepreneurs that don't mean that sorry did you lose the money that you put in no mal Cox no no I I was lucky enough or smart enough never to keep anything at mal Cox oh I see put it into a hardware wallet yes well eventually I believe I moved it initially no I had a brain wallet if you remember those it was basically it was you know 15 words it was actually a brain wallet dot org or calm or something and so I've moved it off at Mount Cox into a brain wallet some of the initial folks that I became friendly with in the space where it was Erik Voorhees and Charlie Shrem and Peter vastness and and Ira Miller or folks like that and so they helped me kind of set up a wallet system and then eventually blockchain I guess comm came out Peter this company and eventually moved it onto that so I was I was way clear of now GOx fortunately when that happens go lucky for you so to finish actually where that question was going how did you shift from just buying the coin to launching digital currency group so I like most people you know you go through like these there's like these five phases of kind of Bitcoin acceptance so you start off as as being dismissive like this stupid or it's not gonna work and then you get to being well you know maybe it might work but I'm skeptical and then you get to the point of being intellectually curious where you start reading and listening to podcasts and things like that and then you get to the point where you're ready to put some money to work and so that's where I was the kind of last phases evangelism which I clearly fell into eventually but so I was I was buying Bitcoin in 2012 and the the price went from like 10th it was like 50 or 60 or 70 and thought it was super smart so I started like using my Bitcoin everywhere I could and remember you know buying gift cards through a gift buying like thousands of dollars of diapers from Amazon with a 5th Bitcoin was like 50 bucks like using the gift card well you would like you know used the Bitcoin to buy the Amazon gift card and then you would use like a car to gonna buy things and something in the early days we were all eager to help accelerates you know the adoption the usage of Bitcoin so we were using it everywhere we could and so I have not got back to calculate how expensive those diapers actually are but but anyway so I was so I was I was you know price went up and and and I was the point where like anytime you make 5 10 X on an investment in a short period of time you know it's smart to take money off the table but I was still very very excited about the potential for for Bitcoin I think at that point time I started to appreciate the potential for you know not just cross-border payments but you know like you know ledger use cases of blockchain and it was around that time that the initial kind of class or cohort of companies started getting forms by entrepreneurs that were actually back up all because prior to that you know a lot of people's running around you know not even forming entities just kind of you know rolling out products and so I decided that instead of selling the Bitcoin I would actually use the Bitcoin to invest in these companies and so at the time so my first investment was in coin lab which was Peter Vestas company and corn lab was the was the first company that Tim Draper invested into and I was very worried about reputational risk I was running second market and and I knew that you know having Tim Draper being the the first guy to write a check into the company if the whole Bitcoin thing imploded it would be Tim Tims name that got sullied not mind so that was the first check I wrote and then the next one was probably bitpay Tony and Steven they were living in separate cities they you know had not yet quit their day jobs to go full-time in a bit peso put some money in sap it pay then probably coinbase was next that was when Brian was coming out of out of YC and so that was kind of the next phase it was like okay moving from Bitcoin into investing into the companies and the idea was one this infrastructure was really important like in order for Bitcoin to be successful you have to have them that the wallets and it changes and you have had the mercial processors but also it was a way for me to you know diversify out of Bitcoin but stay exposed and the thinking at the time was you know if Bitcoin ends up not being the winner at the time I don't think there was really anything else Vic when I'm not being the winner I was confidence that you know Brian and Toni and Stephen others would you know you know reorient it reorient their platforms or whatever the winning currency is and so with angel investing which I had been doing a lot up to that point I'd probably made a non Bitcoin deal so I'd probably made about 20 or so angel investments I just started seeing a lot of great companies getting formed in 2012-2013 and just started doing a lot of a lot of investing and eventually I got to the point at second market where you know if you talk to any of my employees at the time I wouldn't shut up about Bitcoin I mean you know it just it has that that impact on people and and eventually the I was I was having them some board meetings my board at the time was Tomas Paulo that's here from social capital and it was a Lawrence Lenihan first mark and Scott Murphy former congressman and you know we were having a dinner and I was like I was like guys like you know Bitcoin is um it's something that I'm really passionate about and I was explaining to them and I said we should go buy a bunch of it and they said you're crazy and then the next board meeting happens how's it guys we gotta do something and we decided that we would use the second market platform to raise money for a funds that we would launch and that's what became the Bitcoin investment trust in 2013 so we launched this you know ETF like vehicle but it was a private vehicle set up a Bitcoin trading desk by all the Bitcoin that was coming into the fund we SecondMarket we we bought three million dollars of Bitcoin I think the price is about a hundred bucks at the time so we ended up making a couple hundred million dollars off of that investment well and kind of got to the point in 2013-2014 where you know for me as much as I loved SecondMarket you know my my first my first baby I felt like we had accomplished mostly what I had set out to do and I decided that I wanted to dedicate the rest of my my career towards towards this the space and got to the point where I was ready to step down running SecondMarket we were gonna spin out second market and then we were the plan was we were going to combine all of my angel investments with the Bitcoin investment trust business in the Bitcoin trading business and it was so cool incidental Nasdaq called and said hey you know we'd like to buy a second market so we ended up selling a second market and basically rolled it all up into what became digital currency group in 2015 well yeah that's quite the story I want to ask just out of curiosity because this is like you know what your the time era that you're talking about was quite a different period in the crypto encrypt accessory it's like it's like it feels like it's like 50 years and like right right so I'm just so curious to know back then how did you think the space would develop and how does that compare to what you think now I would say things have happened in some cases in some respects exactly as I thought that they would meaning I knew that we would go through a period of time where we would have you know a bunch of companies getting started bunch of VC money coming in to support those companies that we'd get infrastructure built we would have a group of investors come in that warmer you know more you know risk-taking type investors that would propel the asset class forward and I knew that eventually Wall Street was going to come then I knew eventually Wall Street was gonna see the opportunity to trade it to create products around it what I didn't see what it I didn't appreciate in kind of the 2012-2013 time for him and Frank I don't think most people did was the the potential to utilize I mean the term blockchain wasn't even used right and and so to use the blockchain for something other than recording the value no value or kind of ownership a Bitcoin it wasn't really something I spent a lot of time thinking about it's really more about okay how can we use this digital gold as a way to facilitate cross proper payments how could we use it as a way to you know just an immediate the credit card companies and so I you know when you know the theorem paper came out didn't really embrace it didn't really get it to a certain extent still don't really get it and so I think I think I think from an investing perspective things have played out exactly as I thought that they would but from a from a utility perspective beyond specula Vinh vestment I'm constantly surprised about what's happening and what's being attempted oh and when you say that you also sent me from a utility perspective meaning what you what people are using it for or what people think it could be used for I you know you know if you kind of look at the landscape you know today there's there's really not a lot of traction for any products for any use case beyond speculative investment and there's nothing wrong with that but you know we went through a period of time in you know 2015 2016 where you know blockchain was all the rage enterprise blockchain was all the rage and blockchain was gonna you know just an immediate uber and it wasn't a create new who waste you know track provenance and and supply chain and it was in a trade transform trade finance and it was a turn upside down clearing of settlements on Wall Street and if you kind of look around the landscape today none of this really happened yet and not to suggest that that it won't happen but I didn't I in 2012-2013 I didn't expect that this technology be used for those types of things and where we sit you know today in 2018 I still don't see it being used yet for those types of things but certainly I expect it will and I hope it will especially given that we've made investments and many many companies looking to do that yeah I mean I think there are some they're not like widely used and I don't think they're really revolutionary but like there was the the lettuce announcement with Walmart and then I guess Maersk now as launching this joint venture around trade finance yeah yeah I think a lot of those applications you know one most of them are being built on you know private blockchains most of them could be you could just you know utilize a shared database so a lot of a lot of where those efforts have been successful it's just convening all the right stakeholders to get them to agree on some type of you know kind of standard or information sharing and I think the real true innovation is really going to be it's gonna be done on these you know kind of public permissionless block chains and none of those as far as I've seen are being done on on any of those types of blocks yeah yeah no I agree I agree all the like provenance stuff and whatever is really somewhat boring and not revolutionary um so let's not talk about it more but let's I'm gonna give you the floor what is digital currency group so digital currency group is a company you know I'll reiterate that we're not of funds we're a company that's in the business of investing in companies in incubating and building companies in buying companies and investing in digital assets when I put the whole thing together from the pieces you know from my early Bitcoin investing days in angel vesting days and the second market day is I decided to set it up as a company to give us total flexibility so we can do really anything we want you know which which meaning you know a venture fund does certain things a private equity fund us certain things had fund us certain things is a company we can do anything which is great I set it up as a company so that we would have permanent capital so I don't have to worry about going to raise a new fund every three years I get to make super super long-term bets on people and ideas and and tokens and digital currencies and it also gives us the ability to one day go public and so the companies that that I looked at and look at as businesses that I would like to emulate would be Softbank and Berkshire Hathaway and Naspers and companies like that companies that I think I've done a really good job you know being very long-term focused being patient capital and I think what's unique about DCG is the network and the breadth of what we've created in just one industry you know the ability to connect all the dots I think is super valuable for us and I think it's super valuable for all of the all the pieces of dzg so one of the pieces so we have essentially three parts to our company we have a venture investing piece we invest typically at the seed stage we like to be the the first check into a company we have invested now and a hundred and thirty but a little 130 companies in 30 countries making us the most active investor in the space we invest across the entire spectrum of use cases and so we've invested in 20 exchanges we've invested in half a dozen you know digital rights and identity businesses we've invested in companies doing enterprise blockchain we've invested in businesses that are you know working on stable coins and things like that so that's the first part and you know that that group of companies you know includes you know by and large all the companies that have gone on to I think had had success so far and created a bunch of value it's a really really great group of entrepreneurs great group of companies the second part of our business is we invest directly into digital currencies we are I we are not very excited about icos and don't really invest in tokens by and large we instead of investing a lot of different things we make a few very very large investments and try to be a supportive active investor in these tokens and so instead of just you know running a check and hoping that you know the community grows and the utility increases and awareness grows we try to get involved and be helpful and so today there's there's really only five that we have made a large investment into its Bitcoin a theorem classic Z cash D central land and horizon which used to be called Zen cash so that's the second part of a business and the third part for businesses or companies that we own so we own three companies currently we own Genesis trading which also has Genesis capital which is a trading and a lending business we own grayscale investments which is the the Bitcoin investment trust fund was kind of the flagship fund of the great investment business grace was the largest asset manager in the country world probably for digital currency but one and a half billion in essence of management and then we own coin desk the the media and the events business so so you know scale Y size-wise at the you know kind of last corners and had about half a billion in assets on our balance sheets and you know we'll do probably 100 million dollars of revenue this year operating roughly off of our subsidiaries so I want to ask you about your strategy for how you choose you know the companies you invest in and also the different companies that you have here as subsidies or parts of dcg the industry in general is always like espousing these ideals of decentralisation that your vision for DCG to be like in this model of Berkshire Hathaway and also even just when I listen to the areas that you've invested and it doesn't feel like decentralisation as a big theme is that what are your thoughts on that I would say I think that that's a pretty accurate read I'm not necessarily I'm not much of a believer in the idea that every business model every concept is better off being decentralized and in the early days of aetherium a lot of people running around talking about you know we can now finally disintermediate uber disintermediate Airbnb just to radiate Twitter in one I didn't really then now see why those business models should be just immediated I think why don't they be hard to do but but to just from a trust perspective you know I trust that you know when I order a car from uber it's gonna show up I trust that when I make a payment you know my credit card information is not gonna get stolen and so so I think a lot of a lot of the business models that have been attempted we've not really been very big believers in from an investment perspective because didn't really see the problem that they were trying to solve I do think however that when it comes to when it comes to money when it comes to our financial system when it comes to payments when it comes to cross-border you know remittances and money flows that entire space is ripe for disintermediation and not necessarily decentralization but disintermediation eliminating all the middlemen and all the friction points all the unnecessary costs and all the opacity that exists so I think a lot of our investments have been geared towards okay how do we you know if we're gonna be building a new financial system what are the you know what are the businesses what are the pieces what's the infrastructure we have to invest in to make that possible and so that you know that would be custody solutions and that would be trading software and that would be exchanges and wallis and things like that less so and while we have made a few investments and decentralized exchanges it's less our bow you know disintermediating or do you know decentralizing the entire exchange base and earlier you did say you are very interested in permissionless innovation and so this is like a bit of a nuance but how does that square because a lot of these you know I'm in fact actually you do invest in a lot of enterprise companies so yeah I think the permissionless innovation where I think innovation is gonna happen is gonna be you know in the context and the construct of somebody looking at a process looking outside in without you know having you know with having to worry about incumbents or inertia or anything in creating a new business model and so you know the one the you know I think the whole capital formation space is an area where we're gonna we are seeing obviously some real innovation and while I'm not a big believer in Nico s you know by and large I do think that the ability to create new forms of economic instruments that enable investors to participate in the growth of an idea concept of business I think that's made possible by something like blockchain and I do believe that you know in 20 years the ability for somebody to support and invest in and benefit from the growth of an idea is not necessarily gonna be limited to just buying equity and that type of innovation you know whether it's whether it's innovation around new lending systems whether it's innovation around revenue share concepts whether it's innovation around you know tokenization of you know whatever type of assets I think that's gonna not that's not going to be done by you know Goldman it's gonna be done by somebody who's experimenting and trying and failing and eventually hitting on an idea in frankly it's one of the idea it's one of the reasons why we're you know so excited about decentraland you know which is this um you know if you've read Snow Crash already player1 this idea of a decentralized you know Metaverse because it's it's you know the real estate the the land and essential land is recorded on the blockchain so native currency called mana there's real interesting ideas around how do you you know experiment there's actually rip us would be launching mortgages for for land with an essential land and you know in the real world you know kind of block chain of fiying a mortgage and creating a new way for people to lend and borrow there's a lot of incumbents a lot of you know there's a lot of people that you'd have to just mediate in to central and it doesn't exist and so that's all gonna happen you know central and as an aetherium based platform and so we're gonna see some real interesting experimentation into central land and that's where I think we'll see the innovation happen we're gonna keep discussing investments like to central in but also regulation and grayscales investment trusts but first I'd like to take a quick break for our

group you have mentioned a couple times now that you are not bullish on ICO is why is that I think it's a combination of a lot of scars I still have from running second market a regulated business for ten years and you know trying to trying to understand it appreciates the the viewpoint of regulators the sec in particular and knowing that essentially the way that they view the world is you know you have this 1933 act 1934 act and you have you know a bunch of rules that have been put in place you know between that and now you're either compliant he or not you either or you either fall within the box of okay we're you know we're following the 33 34 act or you don't and there's not really a lot of there are many examples where the SEC said okay we're gonna create new rules for you we were and I was very involved with the JOBS Act I spent a couple years my life I mean something like a hundred trips down to DC to meet with members of Congress and the SEC and policymakers to give the JOBS Act done and one of the pieces was was crowdfunding which would enable anybody to invest in startups and ultimately the final rules that came out you know the actual rulemaking was designated or delegated to the SEC it's just not so it's just not a workable contract to raise money and I think that was you know by and large you know by design of the SEC - you know could look out for investors and and and make sure that the the frauds were not using crowdfunding so having having spent you know 10 years of my life you know running a regular business and know how the SEC kind of thinks of the world the idea that anybody could put up a white paper and put up a website and go raise money from the masses it just it when it goes against everything that that I have come to see or appreciate that the way the rules and work in the US doesn't mean that I'm not philosophically supportive of the idea of barriers and doesn't mean that I don't want to see Kappa formation become easier I just I just know it's just not legal so for us as we started seeing all these these two open projects get launched over the past few years and you know we pretty much saw all of them you know the the analysis for us was okay number one is there even a purpose for this token you know I think a lot of the projects early on were hey we're gonna introduce a token that you're gonna buy to use our product whether it's you know a gaming platform or something like that and and to us it just didn't it just didn't make a lot of sense to add friction to a to a product that didn't need a token so you know for us number one was is a token even necessary to is is the team behind it capable of executing on you know this vision you know having invested in startups now for 15 years you know it takes ten years mostly for the most part for an idea to succeed or fail and that's a really long time and so you know it's the team behind it or they have they demonstrated success anywhere in their lives to lead me to believe that they could be successful this the next is you know is the valuation reasonable and so if you kind of go through those three checks that for us eliminated 99% of the tokens that we saw and then the last check was okay are they gonna do the offering in a legal way and for the first 12 18 months most of them were not complying with you know kind of rules and regulations and so so you know again altum Utley I think the whole ICICI markets gonna go away I think it's going to evolve and the question now is our security tokens gonna be a thing I think there will be some utility tokens but I'm not convinced that utility tokens are a good investment you know they may be something worth trading around you know maybe like a commodity like a natural gas or copper but as a long-term investment I'm not convinced utility tokens will have a lot of appreciation and then you know security tokens the question that I have is just because you record ownership of equity or a special instrument on a blockchain does that make it any better any more liquid any more valuable than one that's recorded you know at a transfer agent or at a law firm and I'm not convinced yet that it does you know having run SecondMarket and run the market for Facebook stock it was it was hard to create a liquid market and Facebook stock and that was a multi-billion dollar company to create a market a liquid market in a security token you know that has a ten million dollar market cap with you know 50 holders or whatever the case may be I'm just I'm just I'm not yet convinced that that's that that's the future of capital formation so here we've got things like your portfolio company crackin being pretty publicly antagonistic toward regulators on the other hand another portfolio company shapeshift seems to have like preemptively made some moves toward compliance they're transitioning toward requiring accounts regulators are indicating they're only just getting started in this piece I even know some of your portfolio companies have issued utility tokens in I cos I don't remember literally every company than restin but I think like maybe brave or did you invest in protocol labs yes you know so in that regard like when you look at kind of what's going on amongst your portfolio companies and you haven't bring this you know history that you have we're dealing with regulators how do you feel like this reckoning between crypto and regulation is going to play out well one a highlight on the investing side our target ownership in companies is two to five percent we don't take board seats we don't take active roles in in the day-to-day or you know management decision-making in these companies it's very much a bet on that renewer and then we get out of their way and we help to be supportive so the one you know of our companies that have conducted token offerings certainly reach out to us to get our input we provided input certainly did our best to connect them with you know the lawyers to do them you know properly and there are a few that we participated in so for example protocol labs we invested in the company initially and then when they did the file coin offering we invested in that and I think that that's you know in the kind of long list of tokens that are you know potentially going to be valuable utility tokens that's that's you know one that we were very excited about but I think from I think from a regulatory perspective it's it's still unclear what the future is going to be from a from a regulatory modernization perspective you know is is the SEC going to update rules to create clarity or are they gonna stick to referencing the 33 act and 34 act and the Dowell report as guidance and then use enforcement actions to essentially get a kind of create policy I don't know I mean in our dialogue with dialogues with the SEC but directly and through our companies they come across as being forward-thinking they come across as trying to do the right thing I think they recognize that there's there's gonna be regular arbitrage that's going to exist where there are going to be countries that are going to say you know bring your icos here bring your tokens here but I think they'll see also recognizes that for the most part most of the come to the developed world was going to follow the SCC's lead and it's a frankly I just I just don't know where things gonna shake out and so for us we're pretty much just sitting on the sidelines and waiting for clarity because there's no reason for us to rush into any of this and this is such a flashpoint but I'm so curious for your opinion on this you were again your portfolio company crack and the CEO Jesse Powell who was previously on my podcast he's been especially critical of the New York bitlicense and a bunch of your portfolio become we just actually did go through the process to obtain one but while others just left New York State what is your take on the bit license so being a new york-based company and I was asked to testify been lost key who was running the DFS was pretty good a bit license you know we had a front row seat to kind of see how that evolved and came about and inverter and frankly Genesis one of our companies you know has a bit license and seeing the the large stack of paper and the many legal bills that they endured to get it but license you know it I think it's fair to say that the the the bit license that was created did not reflect a structure that certainly I advocated for you know which would have been it would have been I'll take a step back and say look I think the the the license itself in New York was it was gonna happen like there was there was no possible outcome that it wasn't gonna happen so all of us New York companies and investors in the space we could have been part of the solution or just what had happened and and so I we definitely did our best to advocate for something that was less less expensive we advocated for something that was easier for smaller companies to get and I think there are some points that we want on there's some points that we lost on I do think that over time any company in a developed country that is touching the banking system is gonna be regulated up and down and it remains to be seen if there is a model out there that exists that enables you to either not touch the banking system or do it in a way that enables you to not become regulated by lots of different regulators and I think it's an unfortunate reality but I do think that it is and it is an important step to bring more capital into the asset class to get more infrastructure built and then I think eventually we'll get to a point where consumers and in businesses and investors can actually bypass many or most of these regulated on ramps and off ramps because they'll be utilizing you know either Bitcoin or something like Z cash or something like her eyes and that you know preserves you know privacy and anonymity and enables you to - you know again kind of operates on the let's call the kind of the Bitcoin superhighway without ever having to get off that make sense yeah why are you in a serial a sick believer but not an ethereal believer legs one I am a believer in the potential of smart contracts as a concept I'm a believer in a theorem as a technology I'm a believer in the incredibly capable and passionate community that exists in both the theory Thurman classic what I have historically not been a believer in and so not is the is the as the investment upside in ETH in the token the reason why I'm excited about their in classic is um I guess she followed number one from from from a potential perspective from a utility perspective a theorem classic provides all the same optionality as a theorem from smart contract platform perspective if smart contracts are going to become my thing if they are going to power business processes if they're gonna powered apps theorem classic is is is is equally capable to deliver on that promise as a theorem number one two is from from a economic or monetary policy perspective early on the theorem classic community looked to Bitcoin and it's cap supply as a way to create clarity for investors around all Tamilian with a number of tokens that would be outstanding so theorem classic is a capped there'll be no more than about two hundred thirty million each each Oak has ever created whereas ethereum is is by design uncapped it'll it'll ETH continue getting created into perpetuity next the therm classic community is is you know holds sacred the idea of immutability and essentially not changing history and you know as you know the creation of theme classic came out of the dow hack and the decision to essentially reverse that that hack and the therm quest community which I'm a big believer in is the ability for a small group or a large group or anybody's kind of changed history I think is something that shouldn't be tampered with and you know on top of that if they're in classic fortunately has not been used for any icos and so as the ICO market dies down as that demand for aetherium goes away as the project start look to liquidate the Bitcoin of the theorem that they that they raised it potentially is some pretty meaningful headwinds for etherium specifically but there's so little developer activity on ethereum classic compared to etherium I would actually argue if you look at all of the different networks that are being you know developed and supported out there through classic is actually one of the most active developer communities certainly nothing could compare to ethereum of course but if they're in classic has three different developer groups that are working on it right now there's 35 full-time people working at theorem classics spread across three different groups and that community is focusing on things like stability and security its scalability and less so focused on you know building and rolling out you know icos and apps and things like that although isn't that aren't the jobs that mean kind of point of these smart contract platforms I don't know we'll see I mean as of right now no daps are being used and this is again why I'm just essential and canvas adapt well it hasn't launched yet so it's it's it's a yeah it is adapt it as it launched so I look at it there in classic which trades at roughly 5% of the value of aetherium and I look at an incredibly passionate community which reminds me of the early days of Bitcoin I look at a passionate developer group which are I think some of the best developers in the world I look at a easy to understand monetary policy that have estrogen get their heads around I look at the fact there are no I SEOs that have been done on et Cie leads me to believe that if things turn out badly for aetherium et Cie may benefit from it certainly the move of from proof of work to proof of stake and aetherium is likely gonna result in many minors of ETH moving over to et Cie and you couple all that with the fact that is trading at one twentieth of the price of aetherium from an investment perspective I I think it's the that has the best risk return profile out of all tokens out there right now interesting yeah I wonder you know when you think that you're sort of waiting for the icing thing to die down I see has brought in 6.5 billion last year and already this year they run in 12 billion and the years not over yet right but if you look at the past few months it's down eighty-nine percent year over year so I think I believe it by the end of this year early next certainly the quality of the projects that we see raising money right now are terrible and so I think we're at the long tail right now and then really the question is is the next evolution of icos is it security tokens you know as the financial assets is a tokenization of fixed assets you know hard assets is it n ft is and if it is can that propel the same level of investor interest as this first wave I don't think so list not in the next couple years but but who knows in a way what decentraland offers aren't those sort of like e n of t knees in this sense it's like real estate and you own it it's actually it's a I think one of the best examples of an N F T so the way the just header line is set up is there's 90,000 parcels of land I think roughly maybe a third a half of them are allocated towards districts so there's a there's a university district there's a Vegas district as a fashion district and so that's each one of those districts is owned by people who staked mana which is the currency and essential land and then I believe but a third of the 90,000 are owned privately meaning decentraland ran an auction at the end of last year where those parcels of land were sold and so each parcel is non fungible it is its own you know has its own coordinate and there's been a lot of excitement around the potential for an essential and and I don't know what the timing is but there are a number of parcels that were not yet sold and the first auction which was sold in the in the next auction so each one of those parcels has its own price its own coordinate and it's an owner and there's if you kind of look at at what the most valuable parcels are they tend to be right around the central the spawn spot the place where you're going to drop into Central and people think that that may be like the 5th Avenue with a broad way of just central land and so that you know it's gonna attract the premium prices and then next to roads that you know those tend to be you know higher priced parcels next to some of the bigger districts to be higher priced parcels and then the ones in the middle of nowhere are priced less right well maybe someone will make a decentraland vision of Marfa or something out there and it become valuable you recently launched a new investment trust in what was previously known as Zen cache and has now changed its name to horizon this privacy coin was little known until it made headlines for becoming the victim of a 51% attack earlier this summer and as of last night it was ranked 79 on coin market cap so how did this crypto asset make that cut to become one of grayscales few investment trusts so it started with one my belief that probably in 2019 I think a big theme is gonna be privacy coins privacy focus tokens and if you look at the list of what's out there you were already very excited about gee cash you know think the team is fantastic the vision is great but I think if you look at the list of other privacy focus tokens out there many of them most of them are really focused on primarily providing private money as the only or the main utility so what was was interesting to to us about Zen cash or horizon was the vision to utilize this network for not just private money but private interactions things whether it's messaging or file sharing or accessing the web and so it's a it's a bigger broader vision than just private money and so for me it was okay privacy focused you know tokens are interesting bigger vision and then when you when you meet the team the people that are behind it I think it's one of the highest quality groups of individuals one of the most passionate communities out there and then you kind of couple that with a market cap of what is it it's probably less than a hundred million dollars right now it doesn't take a lot to go right for that project for that token to create meaningful value for people who who are really supporters so we got excited about at first you know as an organization and when we get excited but one of these things we want to make sure it's accessible to as many investors as possible so grayscale wash day a trust modeled after the Bitcoin investment trust for it and just to draw out for listeners and what are the differences between horizon and Z cash so Z cash is very much focus at least today on private money the horizon has introduced the idea of a staked node network that could be used to secure lots of different again kind of utility around private sharing of again messaging or file sharing or communication so it's it's it's actually it's actually a fork of Z cash I think Z cash fork because maybe Z classic and then this forked off of it so it's it's a it's it's got an ax grandmother with Z cash but it's taking a slightly different approach to creating a broader set of tools and utility for the network beyond just private money and speaking of all your different investment trusts what do you think will happen to the Bitcoin investment trusts if an ETF is approved few things to highlight number one the Bitcoin investment trust was modeled after the spider gold ETF and so when we set that up in 2013 and the expectation all along was at some point in time the sec would approve these ETFs and at that point in time the nuclear investment trusts would go through the process to get approved as an ETF so we fully expect that the Bitcoin admissible trust will be the first or one of the first ETF to get approved when the SEC decides that they're ready to allow requite ETFs to exist on a national exchange so basically at that point then it wouldn't you know you wouldn't need to be an accredited investor to buy it you wouldn't have that one you're in lockup period to trade it stuff like that well today it's traded on the otcqx market under symbol gbtc so our model is one year after launching these funds we look to get them traded on the otcqx market so the theorem classic investment trust is now publicly traded as well and our simple easy CG so the record of us entrust if you wanted to buy shares in the public market anybody who has a brokerage account it can go to that account and type on GBC and buy it however to buy shares directly from greyscale at the nav price you have to be an accredited investor at the point in time when Vikram's trust becomes a sec reporting SEC registered product on a national exchange then it will look any different to what it looks today it won't it won't be any you know more accessible than it is today the difference being is it'll likely trade more at the nav price whereas today it tends to trade at a premium to the nav price recently you launched your digital large cap fund and as you mentioned you also have the ripple investment trust I know some of your portfolio companies particularly the top tier exchanges like coinbase gemini and circle they're all declining to list ribble because it seems like a security so how did you choose ripple and and decide to also include in your large cap fund it starts off with investor demand and there's evidence by the activity and the trading of XRP and the market cap there's clearly investor man for it and so for us it was is an easy decision to you know kind of just go through the list of tokens and you know do our own analysis around ones that you know kind of could be Securities and you know the conclusion obviously before we did this was that XRP was not a security and its inclusion in the large cap funds that that we don't have discretion that that fund is a it's it's a market cap weighted formulaic construct of a fund where it tries to essentially capture the top 70% market cap of the tokens but there's exclusions around tokens that are not traded in US dollar or you know markets there's exclusions around lack of custody solutions as exclusions around ones that may be deemed securities so XRP being included in that and that large cap fund means that it's one of the largest and we don't believe it's a security you've invested in a lot of exchanges but I also saw you invested in radar relay which is a real layer on and decentralized exchange 0ex what are your thoughts around what the future of Dex's will be and how will they affect your centralized exchanges it's a fantastic question I go back and forth on this so one radar relay it's a fantastic team they are really if they've accomplished a lot and they have great traction and and you know the volumes are are certainly growing I wonder if and when institutional investors will utilize these centralized exchanges you know knowing just how hard it is to get trade approval you know from the hedge fund or a bank or any institutional investor to even trade with our you know our you know Genesis trading is a regulated ranking by the SEC regulate my FINRA has a bit license you know it's a process to get approved so what I wonder is when or if these two tional flows will find their way into centralized exchanges and until that happens I think from Liberty perspective it'll be hard for those types of exchanges to compete but I do see the value obviously in the concept of a decentralized exchange and you know if any if any model you know could be disintermediated through the use of you know smart contract technology and tokenization of assets you know it's an exchange it's an exchange business so I would say cautious optimistic but you know as you point out of the many many decentralized exchanges out there I believe that's the only one we've invested in you just mentioned Wall Street and I know that in previous remarks you have said that what Wall Street says publicly about crypto is differently from what they say in private what are those differences well look I think that the you know the Jamie Dimon quotes have been fantastic and there's you know plenty of anecdotes of you know people you know who being in the JPMorgan building meeting people about XYZ you know digital currency related when Jamie makes these comments what we're seeing right now is you know despite the drop in prices that despite the drop in volumes this year the level of engagements in the level of seriousness that we see coming out of the Wall Street institutions and banks is that an all-time high it's not you know there there's you know plenty of commentators that you know you know say that you know bitcoins dead there's plenty of commentators that say that you know the bubbles burst and it's over behind the scenes it's kind of full steam ahead right now and you know what what's pretty clear is nobody wants to be first but everybody wants to be a really fast follower certainly no one wants to be last so I do think whether it's you know what what Goldman has announced they're doing or what ice is doing I think one of one something is gonna is gonna I think kind of you know break open that dam and it's gonna be very very popular and very socially acceptable for a bank to be offering to their clients customers access to this asset class pretty quickly when that happens what happens I don't know but when it does happen it's gonna happen very fast and what impact do you think it will have on the markets because everybody made all this you know hubbub over how the future is we're gonna like bring all this money into Bitcoin and everything and obviously now we've just seen this massive downturn and then now everyone's saying like Oh back just gonna be huge but like what do you think is really gonna be the effect of all these things I would guess I will predict that by the end of 2019 the conversation the commentary on let's call you know CNBC is not gonna be whether this asset class is a tulip bubble or Ponzi scheme it's not going to be about you know blockchain a fiying this and that it's gonna be this asset class is here to stay what is the proper allocation and how do you allocate that money I think we're I think we're 12 18 months away from that and so all of you know again whether it's Goldman or backed or futures or these are all just contributing towards the normalization contributing towards the infrastructure that's required for that to be possible and were you know I gotta say were the pipes they're being laid right now and the decision-makers are all coming to terms with one the idea this is not going away but two is this is gonna create significant opportunity and in some cases significant risk and they're not gonna want to be left out but it's gonna it's gonna take some time you obviously I'm sure recall that about a year and a half ago the Bitcoin community was in impasse actually that lasted for three years but we're how to scale the network what is it everything's great now yeah well you you tell me so at that time a year and a half ago you brokered what became known as the New York agreement this is the sort of compromise that said okay some people want one megabyte blog some people want segue to to scale in at work why don't we do both and a lot of people came to decry this what they called a backroom deal and ultimately I fell apart so what's your take on what happened and the role that you played so I swore that I would never speak about this time period again once we got it behind us and what I'll say is I think my role my involvement at the beginning was trying to take advantage of the relationships that I had built over five years in the space trusted relationships that I had built and convene and you know when a meeting was proposed on a very well-known Silicon Valley Google Group I put my hand up and said look I'm happy to try to get people together and I knew it was important to invite the participation of the key stakeholders the developers the miners the businesses and much to my surprise as I started chatting with folks everybody was it was just so mentally drained at that point from the the fighting and the negativity that people were willing to to kind of to have a conversation and to me look it was I was clear to me early on that this really was not a technology debate it was really more of just a lack of communication or misunderstanding and my goal at the time was to try to get seg what activated and how how that happened I didn't really care but I knew I could convene and I convened and two of the three stakeholder groups showed up meeting the miners and the companies the developers either you know given the decentralized nature or you know lack of you know leader for you know Bitcoin development didn't show up though invited the companies of the miners came to agreement pretty quickly and that's what became the New York agreement and ultimately the first piece of it got done like it was activated the second piece didn't people moved on with their lives well do you feel like you learned any particular lessons from that or I I love the honey badger description of Bitcoin and I'm sure you know that and anybody who doesn't know what I'm talking about just Google you know honey badger video and it just it was further confirmation about to me about just how resilient Bitcoin is and again I didn't care at all what the resolution was to that you know that whole conversation whether it was seg wit or seg wit plus larger block size or nothing and the fact that Bitcoin didn't die after the either the half success or half failure of segment 2 X you just I think I know further reiterated or reconfirmed in my mind that you just can't kill Bitcoin alright well that's a great note to end on thanks well actually
