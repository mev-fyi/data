celebrating here to discuss are Jake turbinsky Chief policy officer at the blockchain association and Kevon sodegi partner at General block and co-chair of the fintech and crypto assets practice welcome Jake and kapon hey Laura hi great to be here thanks in December 2020 the SEC sued Ripple loves and two Executives Chris Larson and Brad garlinghouse with racing over 1.3 billion dollars in an ongoing unregistered Securities offering last Thursday judge anna-lysa Torres in the southern district of New York ruled that sales of xrp to institutional investors qualified as unregistered Securities offerings but that what she called programmatic sales which were happening on crypto exchanges did not qualify what are your top takeaways from the order and why don't we start with you Jake okay um great and I think um the top takeaway is exactly what you said in the introduction Laura we are celebrating this decision and I'm sure in the next hour Kayvon and I will get into the Nuance of the case and maybe we'll throw some cold water on some of the things that folks in the industry are saying but just to start with the high level uh takeaway here this is an extraordinary victory for the industry it's not just a victory for ripple although it is it's also a victory for all of the other defendants in ongoing SEC enforcement actions like coinbase it's a victory for the industry broadly in terms of advancing what we think is the right view of the Securities laws and really showing through a district court order through law made by a judge that the sec's interpretation is incorrect and also frankly I think this is a big win for us in Congress too because right now the house uh the financial services committee and the agriculture committee are talking about passing new legislation to decide whether the SEC or the cftc should have jurisdiction over crypto markets and I think this decision will really influence their thought process in deciding what that legislation should look like so again we might throw a little bit of cold water here and there but I think this is just a massive win for all of us and we are indeed celebrating this today Trayvon what about you what would you say yes it's hard to say it better than Than Jake just did um but I'll just add that you know I think the you know core issue here that has been bandied about the industry for a long time is that the tokens themselves have been held not to be Securities or to embody a security by virtue of the way they were offered so that core issue applies across the board not just to this case but the cases you know involving pretty much any token other than a few categories of clear Securities tokens and I agree with Jake that hopefully what this does is refocus people on efforts in Congress to actually push forward with productive legislation to try to find a path for the industry because you know whether this case ends up being upheld on appeal or other judges agree or not I think we know now that it is not true that the sec's view was clearly right that narrative should be gone the the SEC had been advancing a view that the law was clear they had this Authority and you know anybody who disagreed was just plainly wrong we can we can all agree that's not clear at this point at the very least and hopefully focus our efforts on finding a more productive path forward as you mentioned there are some parts of this that you're going to have to throw cold water on so I'm just going to ask you about those right away I was wondering do you think that the judge got this order right I think most of it is right I think um there are a couple of exceptions some of the exceptions I don't think throw cold water I think that the that the judge decided against Ripple on some issues that I think Ripple had really strong arguments on and that if there is an appeal Ripple actually might win on those issues I think the two that come to mind there are Ripple's Fair notice defense so one of Ripple's arguments was it can't be expected to know what the term investment contract means because there had never been clarity about that term and so even if the SEC later comes up with guidance that explains what it thinks that term means that it has a defense to violating the Securities laws because there wasn't that Clarity at the time that it conducted the transactions that ultimately the the core found were in violation of the Securities laws the the judge ruled against Ripple on that and said it did have Fair notice because there was clarity about what an investment contract meant at least to some degree and and with respect to Ripple's sales to institutional investors I don't agree with that and I think that that that could be overturned on appeal the other issue was Ripple Advanced a somewhat novel theory of the Howie test which was to say there are certain essential ingredients that must be present in order for the court to find the existence of an investment contract it actually sort of sits next to the Howie test as as other ingredients that must be necessary in order to satisfy the statutory requirement that there is an investment contract and the court said no we don't think that those essential ingredients are required and I think that also is is likely incorrect now I will say this is the type of issue that you might not expect a district court to find in Ripple's favor right this is the kind of issue that you might expect only the Supreme Court to make a decision about because the lower courts the district court and even the Circuit Court of Appeals if there is an appeal will be bound by what precedent has already been established the Supreme Court is a little bit different right the Supreme Court does in a meaningful way get to develop new law exactly the same way as it did in the Howie case in 1946 and I think Ripple might ultimately succeed on both of those issues assuming that they get all the way up to the Supreme Court but for the time being it's understandable why the district court found the way it did even though I personally disagree yeah I think there are a lot of nuances in the way the judge decided um the particular factors but I think on the core issues um the judge got it right I think the fact that the tokens are not themselves Securities the fact that this record did not you know provide a basis to find that you know transactions on into the secondary Market the programmatic sales or Securities transactions I think all those broad findings were correct and there there can be argument about exactly you know how some of those things get decided um and I agree with Jake that there there are some issues that um and you could see in appellate court deciding slightly differently in either direction so I think both sides would have some risk on appeal but you know in Broad Strokes I think the Judge got it right okay and yeah we'll dive into even more details in a little moment but I want to ask also just generally about what this order means and the grand scheme of the lawsuit and its progress through the courts like how significant is this particular order especially in terms of You Know How likely it is that judge Taurus's decision will actually stand and have implications Beyond just the Ripple case yeah so I I think um I and Kevin I'm sure you have um have have a take on this too sorry to jump ahead of you but um I think it's it's extremely consequential and I think frankly it's a mistake that everyone immediately is talking about what will happen on an appeal first of all the SEC has not signaled that it intends to appeal at this time it does not as far as any lawyers I've talked to and as as far as I can tell the SEC does not have an appeal as of right which means typically you cannot appeal a decision that a district court issues in the middle of the case you have to wait until the case is over and this case is not over now it is possible that the SEC could seek an interlocutory appeal meaning that it sort of stops the case right here even though the case isn't over yet and it takes specific issues up to the Circuit Court but it's quite rare for that to happen and basically it would require judge Torres to say that there is a controlling issue of law law that there's a substantial ground for difference of opinion between the parties and that allowing an appeal in the middle of the case would materially Advance the ultimate termination of the litigation this is something judge Torres can decide in her discretion when I read this order I don't see judge Torres hinting that this is the type of issue that should go up on appeal the Circuit Court also within its discretion would have to accept the appeal and all of this depends on the SEC actually wanting to appeal but the sec's statement when when the order came out was we are pleased with this decision that's another thing we could talk about I'm not sure why they decided to take that view but that doesn't sound like they are going to appeal so let's imagine there's appeal when this case is finally over that's probably you know months or years from now and then months or years after that that we might get a decision from the second circuit and who knows what any random group of three judges on the second circuit would find so I I don't think we need to think about what might get changed on appeal what we need to focus on is what is the impact of this decision now and for the foreseeable future and the impact is exactly what Kayvon said the courts soundly rejected the sec's theory that digital assets embody investment contracts it said the tokens themselves are not Securities it said we have to focus on transactions not tokens and that clearly robots as Kayvon said the sec's view that chair Gensler frequently espouses that the law is clear and the crypto industry is just obviously non-compliant so there's no need for new legislation because the SEC has this under control that's just not true and that's what we learned from this opinion okay and just so I understand so basically what you're saying is um since Judge Torres said that she um kind of was like granting each side a little piece of what they were uh fighting for but that the rest of it would go to trial that essentially if the SEC decided that it was going to appeal it would only do so at the conclusion of that trial is that what you're saying it could try to appeal right now but first it would have to seek a judgment on the claims that were you know already granted or denied in the motion for summary judgment judge Torres would have to agree to do that then it would have to file a motion basically asking for permission to file the appeal and judge Torres could decide basically with inner discretion meaning if she wants to let them appeal she could but she doesn't have to and then if the Circuit Court wants to take the appeal it can but it doesn't have to and I just see no sign that that's going to happen now so I think if there's going to be an appeal it's many years from now I think that's right and I think there are a couple important um points here one with respect to the institutional sales the programmatic sales the the those core issues vis-a-vis Ripple labs this is a final decision on those issues it granted summary judgment or denied summary judgment on those issues that is not something that's going to continue this is not just a way stop to a later opinion on those issues but there are some things that are left in the case mainly the aiding and abetting claims against the individuals and there's no way to appeal in part you know just the decisions that were made until after that last piece of the case is decided without going through the process that um that Jake just outlined so the normal course would be to wait for these claims against the individuals to be resolved then you have a final judgment on everything in the case and then you could take it up on appeal if you want to try to appeal these parts first you you have to seek the judge's permission and there's been no indication that's going to happen or that the judge would would grant that it passed and then so let's let's just decide it wants to do that after the trial how long do you expect this kind of trial would take uh these these things can take quite a long time most of the facts here are you know have been pretty well established at this point and so I think a trial could be scheduled in you know in relatively short order but I I wouldn't expect a resolution of trial in the next you know in less than the next six months or potentially significantly longer than that um and then appeals beyond that um usually you have to add at least a year or more there there's some factors as far as you know how fast the parties try to move the appeal they have some discretion to try to move it quickly and there are some places where they have to rely on the court but you're you're looking at you know minimum I would say a year and a half to two years before you would have any resolution of this on appeal and and quite possibly longer well and then when they need to understand and hopefully anybody in my audience who also is not familiar with the courts or the legal system will need to know this as well but so obviously the um you know what it was that judge tours issued on Thursday was an order and then I also heard Jake say that if the SEC were to try an appeal it would have to get a judgment so can you just explain the difference between an order and a judgment sure so this is the written decision that um articulates the judge's view of the claims but that has to get reduced to it's just effectively a separate piece of paper but it gets reduced to a final judgment that get that gets entered and then that is what can be appealed so there can be processes in between for example somebody can try to move for reconsideration or there could be other things that happen in between usually a judgment doesn't enter until all the issues in the case have been decided so usually there wouldn't be a judge a final judgment entered on just some of the claims but not others in theory the you know one of the parties could request that a judgment be entered just on the pieces of the case that have been resolved but um that's a discretionary issue and as Jake said that's a high standard to meet and one we haven't seen any indication that people are going to push for here okay so basically an order advances the case and then a judgment is sort of like the final Hammer okay now now I understand so you know something and I know the sort of the institutional sales piece was as far as I understand less surprising to people um but I still want to ask a few things about it so this was the part where the judge essentially said that these definitely constituted unregistered Securities offerings and I you know already heard a number of lawyers saying they weren't surprised by this because of course it was um you know hedge funds and VCS and institutional buyers that were engaging in this and um even the way the sales were conducted you know sort of showed that um there was an understanding that they could be construed as Securities offerings so I wanted to ask do you think that her order on institution on institutional sales here could mean that we'll end up with more projects doing some something similar to what Stacks did where they used a regular plus exemption and raised money and then essentially after that um you know had this token and that you know now is apparently decentralized and and not a security I don't think that's uh I don't think that's likely I don't really read the opinion as supporting a path to registration which is you know reggae plus allows an issuer of a security to register it with the SEC and then they are subject to sort of the full compliance obligations under the Securities laws I I don't think that this opinion suggests that that is a more feasible path than it was before and in fact most people who have looked at reggae Plus have said this is basically a dead end because the idea is you're going to issue the security you're going to do it in compliance with the sec's expectations but then you will decentralize the project and someday those compliance obligations which are sort of inherently incompatible with the nature of a decentralized asset that exists in a disintermediated environment will fall away and the asset will become a non-security commodity and the problem is everyone who did one of these reg a plus type offerings sort of hit a wall with the SEC where there was no clarity about when or if ever the asset would morph from a security into a non-security commodity instead what I think this order is saying is the idea that the asset itself is the security is wrong from the start what you have to do is not look at the asset itself but rather the transaction in which the asset is transferred from the creator of the asset to the purchaser of the asset and what this order is saying is unless you really have this this strong uh connection not necessarily a written contract but certainly an implied contract if not more between the seller and the purchaser where there is an investment of money there's a real common Enterprise there's a real expectation of profits and that expectation of profits is created by promises made by the seller to the purchaser then you do not have a Securities transaction so instead I think what this order does is it tells people there are a lot of ways to get tokens out into the world worlds without tripping the Securities laws and without giving the SEC any Authority or jurisdiction it may just not be as as I think you said well Laura it may not be in a real sort of investment contract of the sort where you have an entrepreneur raising capital from an investor to use that capital in order to build out a network that will support the value of the token and that's why I think many lawyers thought that Ripple's primary sales may be found to be Securities transactions even if later transactions or other non-investment related distributions of xrp would not be viewed as Securities transactions and that's exactly what this order said yeah I'll I'll try and just say I I think one of the I completely agree with what Jake said and I think where the cold water comes in is I think what people should not take from this is so they can just rush directly to the secondary market and come up with some scheme to go to bypass in you know initial investors and go straight to retail and then they're all good according to this opinion that's not what this means and that's not what we would be encouraging and I think you know looking back to the telegram cases instructive there where that Court said looking at the overall you know set of transactions and expectations that there was a scheme to offer to public retail you know by way of you know some intermediary transactions and whether you agree or disagree with the way judge Castell decided the telegram case that is a different Theory than the one that was Advanced here and this judge is not disagreeing with that or you know in any way suggesting that was inappropriate you could still have a finding that somebody's attempt to get to the secondary Market was an overall scheme that was a securities offering so people shouldn't just say oh the institutional sales were a problem but the programmatic sales weren't so we can just run straight to the secondary Market how did you know I was gonna ask you that I was just imagining that we would suddenly see a million airdrops and um ieos or God knows what um so let's now talk about the programmatic sales because obviously this is the part that the community's really focused on and definitely probably has the most implications for um actually so many different things in crypto you know ranging from the tokens themselves to exchanges and Beyond so um let's just make sure we all understand what programmatic sales means here because I have seen people discussing in a certain way but then I also saw um this one Investment Bank saying like oh people are sort of kind of being overbought about what this means so what do you think judge Torres meant by programmatic sales and how this would be applied to the rest of crypto so she defines the programmatic sales I'm just looking to see if I can give you the exact way that she describes it which is where Ripple sold xrp on digital asset exchanges programmatically or through the use of trading algorithms and the key thing here was that the sales were on exchanges that were blind bid ask transactions so so selling into the secondary Market but you know through the typical you know mechanisms of a secondary Market where you don't have identified purchasers and sellers who know who each other are so I think that is what it's what it's referring to here and that does have very broad ramifications for the industry because that description really does capture the vast majority of what we think of as secondary Market transactions so here's what this Investment Bank barenberg said this was in um an article in coindesk it said that people were incorrectly interpreting Thursday's order and that the programmatic sales really referred only to the sales in which Ripple the company was selling xrp on exchanges and that therefore the ruling didn't really say anything about the status of other kinds of secondary sales on exchanges and that people were interpreting the order as having you know as saying something about those so what would you have to say to that well I think that's right and wrong and there is a line in the opinion that says that the court is is explicitly not addressing the question of secondary Market transactions and this is something that you know we the blockchain association focused on in an amicus brief that we filed we actually did not address those primary sales to institutional investors all we said to the court was no matter what you find about those initial sales you should distinguish them from secondary Market transactions between total strangers to that initial transaction right in other words do not hold that because just because Ripple may have sold xrp as part of an investment contract initially that later transactions of xrp are also Securities transactions and that is actually what the what the court ended up doing right they say they're not making a holding as to secondary Market transactions however when you read the details of the opinion you can see that the court is saying xrp itself is not a security right it is transactions in xrp that could be Securities transactions depending on the totality of the facts and circumstances surrounding those transactions and I think you don't have to read too much further into it to understand that if that question was and maybe will at some point be squarely in front of the court there would be a very clear holding that those other transactions that Ripple is not involved in in other words transactions that do not involve a seller of an asset seeking to raise capital on the promise of profit based on its future efforts that you will not have a Securities transaction so I think technically that's true but I think that's that's a little bit short-sighted and reading the decision a little bit too narrowly I agree and I think the the opinion recognizes that the purchasers of these program in these programmatic sales were standing in the shoes of typical secondary Market purchasers and so there is a recognition that the programmatic sales logic applies much more broadly this doesn't cover all secondary Market transactions expressly that's that's carved out as Jake noted but you'd think give any secondary market sales we're going to be considered Securities transactions it would be the ones engaged in by the initial issue if those aren't then anything involving truly third parties is probably farther away from the line so in that sense you know I think this does have broad ramifications of course as we know from Howie and all the other things total third parties can structure a Securities transaction around any asset around whiskey around beavers around whatever it is and they could structure a Securities transaction around xrp tokens as well right so this does not mean that no transactions involving xrp could be an investment contract the transactions involving any asset could be one but it is not inherently one the security the token does not embody any sort of investment contract and the fact that even ripples transactions into the secondary Market were not Securities transactions makes it very hard to see how anyone else's would be absent some you know very different fact matter to drive home that point I'm looking at the decision and at the bottom of page 14 uh the court writes here defendants argue that xrp does not have the character in Commerce of the security and is akin to other ordinary assets like gold silver and sugar this argument misses the point because of ordinary assets like gold silver and sugar may be sold as investment contracts depending on the circumstances of those sales so technically of course that is true but when you look at the crypto markets as they exist today and you look at let's say an exchange like coinbase and you see an order book where there are trades between total strangers and digital assets I do not think you are going to find the circumstances that would be necessary to imply an investment contract in those trades I think it will be insane to make any type of argument otherwise all right and yeah I would say that this question was sort of front and center for the community recently because promethium CEO Aaron Kaplan had gone around saying that any token um that was part of a form D filing would therefore be a security um Rodrigo Seda on my podcast refuted that and explained just as you did that yes and that would be like saying that orange groves are a Security even when you know they're not being part of uh you know a Howie type sale Etc and it doesn't make any sense so um it does look like the judge in this instance agrees with the community and not with Aaron Kaplan or promethium um however one thing that I wanted to ask you about because this to me was a critique that that actually resonated and um I'll explain why in a little moment so I read this in an opinion piece for coindesk and in it crypto lawyer Preston Byrne quoted um this bit from the judge and then I'll explain what his response is um she wrote programmatic buyers purchased xrp with an expectation of profit but they did not derive that expectation from Ripple's efforts as opposed to other factors such as General cryptocurrency market trends particularly because none of the programmatic buyers were aware that they were buying xrp from Ripple so this is what Preston wrote he said and the court here is clearly mistaken for one simple reason the expectation of prophet prong doesn't require an expectation of profit as a result of the efforts of the seller but rather the efforts of another and then here he quotes how we quote the efforts of the promoter or a third party and so um you know I think most people would recognize that xrp's principal promoter um has always been Ripple labs and um oh and sorry this is this is from what president he said as will be obvious to anyone active in the industry xrp's principal promoter is and always has been Rebel Labs whether a purchaser was aware they were purchasing tokens from Ripple Labs or not so I was curious for your response on what Preston said here it's an interesting point that they're being racing this really gets into sort of the Nuance of how you apply the Howie test and particular factors and where this sort of blind bid ask component really fits in I think what the judge was doing here was um trying to look at the objective nature of the way the Howie test is is established to say it's not what any particular purchaser was expecting it you have to look at was there a set of promises or being made by the the seller into this market and say you know this is not you know Ripple's not out there making promises to this to this Marketplace and you don't have that connection there people don't know they're buying from Ripple ripples not making promises to those people and without that you don't have the reasonable expectation on their efforts um as opposed to the institutional sales where there's a direct expectation of their efforts from direct interaction I think one thing that people have raised is that the same you know blind bid ass concept can be raised in the context of the common enterprising requirement which was not addressed here but arguably people investing without knowing who they are purchasing from are not investing in a common Enterprise because they are not handing their assets to some common Enterprise that they expect to use their assets to then go forward and build something so you could take the view that that same issue is appropriately characterized as part of the common Enterprise element also but you know there are different ways to to slice that and I think the in Broad Strokes the the answer is correct you know they're just different ways to approach it I I totally agree with that I think the only two points I would add are first I think Preston is mostly right as As a matter of law in the sense that the Securities laws are meant to apply to the economic reality not just the formalistic structure of a particular transaction and so what you would not want to say is uh company a can issue an asset then immediately move all of its operations over to Company B Company B is technically a separate entity Company B will then do all of the work and carry out all the promises and efforts that relate to increasing the value of the the security that the company a issued but suddenly the Securities laws just don't apply right that would not be an intelligent reading of the Securities laws um and so I think it does make sense for Preston to say it's the efforts of others not necessarily just the efforts of the specific entity that created and initially distributed an asset that is you know pursuant to an investment contract I think the problem is there is a limiting principle there there has to be a limiting principle there that no random third party can just show up and then somehow and in the shoes of the original creator of the asset if that were true then Dogecoin would be a security because Elon Musk showed up to pump the price of Dogecoin right if any person can just stand in the shoes of the original Creator then you would have to constantly be surveying the market to see well is there some third party who's being a little bit too active and making a little bit too many statements about the value of this token well then they have to go be a public reporting company and do an IPO and full Securities compliance with the SEC and that's just not a reasonable conclusion so I think you do have to sort of parse those details I think just the second point to throw in there is I will say the decision is a little bit thin it's it's 34 Pages it's actually not a lot for for a decision of this magnitude and I think there's not as much meat on the bone on this particular issue as you might want especially because in a motion for summary judgment the court really is looking at what the facts are right what the parties have agreed to that is not in dispute and it also could be that the SEC just didn't show enough actual evidence in the course of Discovery and in arguing the motion for summary judgment to show that there were those types of expectations or promises made to satisfy that requirement that doesn't really show up in the decision so I'm speculating a little bit there but you have to to take into account the context of summary judgment I think to understand what the court is saying all right so I would love to dive a little bit more into this but first we'll take a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible arbitrum stands at the Forefront

so interesting to me the way that you described how you could have the initial creator of the token company a and then immediately sort of swap that out for Company B to um you know make sure that that token is success is a success and I actually think that a lot of Bitcoin Maxes would say this is exactly what so many of the decentralized projects have done um you know ethereum is an example that I know quite well where they had an initial company that uh issued the the token um you know did the fundraising and then they later had the non-profit that was developing the network and um has continued to Steward the development of ethereum uh many of the same people involved so you know I was curious of as to whether or not you felt that this very common model that we see is something that is um yeah sort of like a slate of hand or a slight of hand where they're trying to um yeah just sort of skirt the Securities laws by setting it up that way so I I think um to of course to give you the lawyer answer it depends and it really depends on the facts and circumstances right I I think that your description may be true for some projects and without naming any in particular um I you know I know that there there are some out there who have not followed best practices and you know lived up to the industry standard I don't think what you described is the industry standard I think that when you look at the foundation model it really isn't meant to be company a creating the asset and then Company B you know trying to contribute to um pump the price of the asset and promote it as an investment opportunity the idea as you said really is to set up a non-profit that is focused on not pumping the price of the asset but developing the underlying technology and contributing to an ecosystem of other participants who are all working together although in a decentralized fashion to build technology right not to create an investment opportunity and I think when you do follow that type of model you don't have this type of slate of hand instead what you have is in many ways the right way to get an asset out into the world without holders of that asset looking at one particular person as promoting it as an investment opportunity so it really does just come down to the facts and circumstances yeah I would also add that when you start with the company companies have obligations to their shareholders to their owners to to maximize their benefit and I think the advantage of moving assets out of that sort of structure into something like a foundation which can give the community comfort that their those assets will be secured and preserved and used in furtherance of a purpose that just promote the protocol but that the the structure has legal obligations to further that purpose and is not obligated to benefit you know particular beneficiaries like you know the owner of the company something like that is very important so you can give some comfort that there isn't somebody who owns the assets in that respect and there will be a legal structure to ensure that the assets are are devoted to promoting the protocol and not something else well we'll actually feel now now then a lot of this discussion is highlighting how Ripple really is actually quite different from a lot of the other um tokens in the crypto industry you know I saw Adam Cochran tweeted that if xrp isn't dealed to security then pretty much nothing in crypto is and that uh uh you know sort of reflects its history uh for instance when coinbase first came up with its rating system it gave xrp one of the ratings that was closest to a security and things like that and so I was curious you know just what is your thought generally about xrp in particular in The Wider crypto Universe because I'm not gonna lie and this is why I wanted to raise the issue that Prince Preston mentioned in his op-ed I remember the very first time I learned about the highway test I remember thinking you know like I thought you know okay these are the four prongs or sometimes people say three the last third the last uh uh yeah one of them has sort of two components I thought oh it sounds like xrp that's when that was literally what I thought um so I was curious just for your thoughts on um yeah like do you feel that xrp is sort of like kind of the model crypto or would you agree that if there is a spectrum it sort of Lies closer to that side of looking more like a security I I think that's a really good question Laura I think you have to consider that at least to start in the broader context of how we understand the Securities laws and that brings in something called the major questions Doctrine which is something we've all been talking about a whole lot which basically says an agency does not have authority to regulate a particular Market if it is one of a you know large or significant uh economic impact or consequence to the nation unless Congress has given a clear delegation of that Authority and that's where you have to consider that a lot of what Ripple did like you said you know Ripple sort of difference from the rest of the market is Ripple was engaged in this type of conduct many years ago right a lot of the conduct that we see addressed in in this decision was in you know the early 2010s up through the middle uh 2010s and then you have the SEC sort of showing up later to say well now we're going to decide to apply this old term right set in law in 1933 clarify to some degree by the Supreme Court in 1946 investment contract and then we're going to apply it to this asset that certainly no one could ever have imagined at the time that this law was created and I think the question then becomes does the SEC have the authority to unilaterally make the decision that that law applies to this very new type of asset and new type of technology and I I think the answer is no and I think that's really where Ripple is going with this I think once this issue gets up to the Supreme Court it will say the question of how digital assets should be regulated is a major question of Economic and political significance that only Congress can answer but in terms of how we think about xrpv asset in the market now I really think it's not about looking at xrp the asset what this decision is telling us is as far as we understand the Securities laws we have to look at the transactions conducted by the creator of the asset not at the asset itself so it really is important to look at what was Ripple doing and then how does that compare with the modern industry practice which really has changed an extraordinary amount since you know 10 years ago and when this project uh first launched all right and let's now also just talk about the fact that Brad garlinghouse and Chris Larson the current CEO and former CEO were also named in a lawsuit um what is yesterday or what does Thursday's order say about you know their status sure well so the the one piece that's remaining that wasn't decided on summary judgment is whether or not they could be held to have aided and abetted the violations um with respect to the institutional sales but it does say that their their own personal sales were not Securities transactions so that that's taken off the table it's really just now a question of whether they're you know they can be held to have aided embedded the sales that were found to be violations so I think the um you know that's a relatively limited piece that remains and it'll be interesting to see whether you know whether that goes forward to trial or not I can imagine there being circumstances where that you know gets resolved short of trial all right and then now let's also talk about what this order means for crypto exchanges who obviously ever since FTX have really been under Fire by the SEC um you know probably the biggest example is that the SEC is currently suing coinbase and after the order coinbase stock jumped significantly I think it was like 25 ish so I was wondering what you felt especially this part pertaining to programmatic Securities could mean for exchanges like coinbase and potentially how it might even affect the SEC lawsuit against coinbase yeah look I think this makes it very I think this makes the theory for the coinbase lawsuit very difficult uh the theory there really was based on some sort of version of the embodiment Theory the tokens you know embody the scariest transactions and that is really what was squarely rejected here so yeah I think that you know there will be some effort to to sort of recast some of the allegations but I think this is a sort of a direct hit on the theory that was being espoused by the SEC there yeah I I totally agree I mean honestly I think the big winner of of this decision is coinbase I think even more so than Ripple uh coinbase I I will note immediately a few hours after the decision came out decided to re-list xrp and I think that says everything I think that the industry is viewing this decision as just as we've been saying as rejecting the sec's theory that the assets themselves are securities and what that means is even if they may be sold in you know as an invest assessment contractor as part of an investment contract by the Creator at some point those transactions are not happening on exchanges which are running secondary markets and Order books were the people transacting do not know each other and are not making any promises to each other which are characteristic of Securities transactions and I I think there is no way to read this order and then read the sec's complaint in the coinbase case and then come to the conclusion that the SEC could win that case so I think one the only way the SEC can can Prevail there is um one of two ways either as Kayvon said they have to replay the case right they've got to come up with some other theory about why these secondary Market transactions are regulated under the Securities laws or alternatively they have to hope that another judge is going to disagree with this order and I think that that is an important note that I'm not sure we've hit directly and if there's if there's any cold water to throw on this decision this is it this is one opinion from one district judge in one court it's not binding precedent on any other district judge so another district judge in let's say the District of Columbia where the binance case is could decide differently and also another judge literally downed the hall from Judge Torres in the southern district of New York could also say I don't think my colleague is right about this so I this isn't you know the law now but I think that that the industry and clearly coinbase is treating it as a validation that the theories that we've been putting forward in opposition to the SEC are you know indeed true in terms of our interpretation of of the law but this could change and um and it's not you know all said and done just because of this one order and it's just out of curiosity if you were a lawyer at these exchanges would you have advised them to relist it because you know as you mentioned there is this potential that the second circuit court or whatever might might reverse this so yeah I was curious sure yeah no it's look it's tough to say exactly what I would advise but I think there is um there has been a lot of uncertainty on how a lot of different tokens might be characterized for a long time and I think most exchanges and others are you know to try to take a pretty careful view of looking for indications that one token is or is not a security I think there are very few tokens out there that have a federal judge saying this particular token is not in itself the security and so it you know that's a you know on the list of potential indicators that something is or is not a security a federal judge saying this is not in itself a security is a pretty strong indicator so um you know I can see why people are taking that approach but you know this is not a fine this is not a final opinion it could be appealed and there are a lot of reasons to to still exercise some caution yeah Laura you asked you asked two lawyers what advice they would give to non-clients and you get a lot of hemming and hawing um but I guess and of course I we skipped our disclaimers which is you know we're lawyers but we're not uh you know your lawyer anyone who's listening here and none of this is intended um as legal advice if you need legal advice you should sign an engagement letter with General block and fkvon as your Council I guess what I would say though and did say on Twitter which was not legal advice was if I was a U.S crypto exchange I'd be feeling pretty good about relisting xrp and it was a few hours after I tweeted that that coinbase made that decision and I guess the only other color I would add to that is I feel like we are in a position where the SEC has taken the extreme view that all digital assets except for Bitcoin are securities and what that means is there is no token that you can list that the SEC will not say is an unregistered security being traded unlawfully because the exchange has not registered as a national Securities Exchange or an alternative trading system as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. so I feel like you're already in that mess you might as well go all the way and list all those assets and feel good about this argument that I think we're all feeling particularly good about after Thursday um which is the tokens themselves are not the securities and therefore the exchanges creating markets for those tokens are not you know required to register as Securities exchanges and Jake you wrote an opinion saying that you felt that SEC chair Gary Gensler should recuse himself from the different enforcement actions in crypto explained a little bit you know what your position is why you were arguing that and um you know obviously the fact that he basically said I don't agree um yeah and I want to hear your reaction sure so there's two pieces to the argument the first is chair kensler has made very clear that he has prejudged that all digital assets are securities he said this many times and he has not minced words right we all know that he thinks everything about Bitcoin is a security so that's sort of the first piece of this he has made up his mind I think there's very little question about that the second piece of it is is it okay for the chair of the SEC to make up his mind before he is actually confronted with the facts and circumstances of a particular case before he is asked to vote on whether the SEC should turn that case into an enforcement action in federal court and our paper argues that is not acceptable that the wells process at the SEC which is a set of procedures that is supposed to give some due process to the person being accused of potentially violating the Securities laws that the wells process puts the chair of the SEC and the other Commissioners in the position of a neutral Arbiter right essentially like a judge not in the role of a prosecutor who is just going after people who have potentially violated the law and that as a neutral Arbiter since chair Gensler has already made up his mind on this issue he should not be allowed to vote on those types of cases instead he should be required to recuse himself and frankly I was I was in a sense gratified that chair Gensler decided to address that argument you know he had to make a statement saying he fully understands his ethical obligations and he is in compliance with them frankly I think what that means is that he knows there's something to this argument right I don't think he would have felt the need to address it unless he knew that you know our legal argument is is one that holds water My Hope Is that in some enforcement action some defendant who has been targeted by chair gamzler right where chair gensler's vote was the Tipping Point in the SEC deciding to bring in enforcement action my hope is that some defendant will bring that argument we'll read our paper and then you know with the advice of their counsel since of course the paper is not intended as legal advice will turn that argument into a brief arguing that the enforcement action should be dismissed because of this violation of chair Gensler not recusing himself in the enforcement process when there was that Wells proceeding but of course that remains to be seen if anyone will raise that issue and if a court will agree with us that he should be refused yeah it's like one of those things where if you have to say that you're neutral then it probably means it's because people don't view you that way and I have seen him in press interviews uh refer to crypto exchanges as the casinos so you know I just thought that was an interesting um yeah reveal on his part of his opinion of the industry all right so I would say at this point and you tell me I might be missing a few that there are certain cases that we could probably say so far are kind of indicating where the us is going in terms of this question around you know how crypto tokens should be regulated in the U.S so the kick and telegram judgments came up a few times in this order on xrp I've heard people also talking about the library case I was wondering which which cases you feel sort of um you would point to as the ones so far kind of indicating where the US might end up on this issue yeah I think you you pretty much nailed it with with that that list I think this is the big one um yeah I think people will be looking to this case for a long time this was obviously the the largest most high profile you know fight you know really you know went went through quite a lot to get to this summary judgment opinion I I do think people will continue to look at library and at telegram but I think those cases may you know made very clear they weren't deciding certain things they weren't touching some of the secondary Market issues they they were you know pretty narrow to their facts whereas this opinion I think the the logic of it has much broader ramifications and so I think this one will be the key and so if you were to kind of take them all together and sort of summarize what the US's stance is currently on the status of crypto in the US regulatory status then what would you say it is sure I assuming this one stays as as good law which and I agree with Jake that there's you know no no sign of an appeal yet so I think that is a a good assumption I think the law is the eight tokens themselves are not Securities that initial issuances or distributions or sales of tokens Can Be A Securities transaction that can be an investment contract depending on the terms not necessarily but it certainly can be and once you get past that you really have to look on a sort of transaction by transaction basis or at least on you know groups of transactions but you can't just assume that because an initial sale was an investment contract that any subsequent sales would be so for now initial sales may still be investment contracts uh particularly when they are fundraising transactions fundraising transactions are typically investment contracts in a lot of contexts but the assets themselves are not securities all right so now that we have this order I wondered also what you thought it meant for a number of the tokens that recently have been named as Securities by the SEC as some of the bigger ones obviously are soul and Matic and yeah I was curious whether you thought this kind of could help them in any way or if um yeah if people need to still exercise caution around those tokens I think it's a a massive help and I think it's a massive help because again you know not to keep repeating ourselves but right the order stands for the view that the tokens themselves are not Securities and what that means is it is far less likely there would be a whole thing that any of those creators of tokens have Securities compliance obligations as a result of public trading of those assets what it means is the SEC and courts will have to look at the initial distribution of those tokens and this is where I think it is really important to distinguish what you know is it Ripple was um was doing sort of before modern industry standards and best practices were developed and what some of these more recent issuers were doing one really important thing is and came on correct me if I have this wrong but when Ripple did its distributions to institutional investors it did not take ex take advantage of the regulation D exemption for a private placement to accredited investors that really became the industry standard only a few years after you know Ripple uh decided to distribute xrp in the way that it did and what it means is when you look at those initial distributions for many other projects what you're going to find is there was no unregistered public distribution of a security because those distributions were compliant with the Securities laws explicitly because they complied with regulation D and in that case as long as all of those compliance obligations were respected meaning you know the tokens were only sold to accredited investors they were locked up the right way and you know all those other sort of requirements under that regulation it means there's not going to be any violation of the Securities laws so if I'm any other issuer who followed those modern industry standards I'm feeling very good much more comfortable than I was before this decision came out yeah I think I I generally agree with you know pretty much everything uh Jake just said I think in particular the character of the tokens in Commerce you know this provides a lot of comfort that most tokens will not be viewed as Securities as they're being used you know as they're being sold on exchanges but on third parties or used in the network or all those things which led to a lot of concern for a lot of projects I think the institutional sales component of this does you know continue to you know present risk for any project that you know that sold tokens in their their own initial sales as to whether those sales might be construed as Securities offerings and we still have issues as we saw in telegram that and in telegram there was a staff so there were initial sales that everybody agreed the agreement for future tokens was intended to be an exempt Securities offering but that the subsequent distribution of tokens would not be in the court rejected that theory and said this is all one integrated scheme and therefore it enjoined the subsequent distribution of tokens so there are still going to be a lot of wrinkles and how um you conduct initial sales but for all those projects that that you mentioned that are out there that have tokens out in the world they should you know feel much more comfortable I think that the token itself won't be construed as a security all right so while all of this is going down we also have two bills that have recently been introduced in Congress one in the house and one in the Senate and I was wondering what you felt that this order I should call it uh what bearing it will have on this legislation and frankly the ability for it to actually get past because obviously lots of legislation has been introduced over the years none of it has really gone anywhere what are your thoughts on all that I I think this significantly increases the chances that legislation will get done and and really speeds up the timeline that I think legislation will get done addressing Market structure right who regulates these tokens how are they regulated how can they be distribute distributed explicitly in compliance with with federal law and I as Kayvon said there's still a lot of wrinkles here that need to be ironed out I wouldn't say that the Ripple decision gives us absolute clarity about every issue that we would want to understand right this still does come down to a facts and circumstances analysis which is really hard to know in advance um you know what a court is going to say and what we really want as an industry is to have real clarity about how can we issue these tokens and then not have to argue with the SEC which by the way certainly will not change its view of the law just because of this order right the SEC is gonna I think keep um you know going hard after the industry so I think we still need to see legislation happen the way that I think this order of stacked the political calculus is that right now Republicans and Democrats in Congress are negotiating with each other about what Market structure legislation should look like and one of the important narratives that has affected that set of negotiations is what the SEC has been saying what chair Gensler has been saying which is no new legislation is necessary we've got this under control the crypto industry is regulated already by the Securities laws they're just non-compliant don't worry about this we'll clean it all up in the courts and I think what this order says is that is not true we really do need to get something done and to the extent that Democrats in particular were less engaged on this type of legislation thinking it wasn't a high priority I think this should really sharpen their focus on getting something done because the sec's promise of getting this whole thing quote unquote under a control that's just not true I think that's exactly right this should refocus people's efforts on how Congress this should be assigned to everybody that the law is not clear as it is as to how the secondary markets here should be regulated or are regulated and I think a lot of the industry is has been asking for a long time for Clear regulation and for there to be a set of rules that clearly apply and that make sense for this industry this opinion makes clear that the rules that exist do not apply the way that the SEC was trying to apply them and that's not going to be clarified in the courts anytime soon for all the reasons we discussed there's not another opinion that can clarify that um for us you know anytime soon and as a result you know if we want a path for a regulation that makes sense for this industry it's going to have to come from Congress in the short term so it sounds like there are two pieces here at that kind of put that impetus on Congress one is that SEC has said it's clear that Securities laws apply here and you're saying this order because simply by the fact that it refutes that shows that there is not Clarity around which laws apply and then second you know going back to kind of the procedural stuff that we talked about before where you said that the SEC would need to jump through a number of Hoops and get other judges and stuff to do things in order for there to be an appeal that would occur faster in a way it's sort of um prevented them from getting any other decision and so this current decision is going to stand and then for that reason um that's another that's another reason why uh Congress would be sort of compelled to act because it um yeah it almost like you know you have basically this court saying tokens are not Securities you have the SEC saying tokens are securities and since there can be no change in that even for a little while that that would be another reason why Congress would try to push something out faster is that yes I I think that's right the SEC could try to move this faster it could decide to voluntarily dismiss its claims against the individuals that are remaining so that there's really nothing left in the case and then it could seek a final judgment and go more directly to appeal there are ways that it could accelerate things but I don't anticipate that's what they're going to do all right so now let's talk about these two bills I actually have not had a chance to look at them super closely I'm assuming Jake probably is pretty familiar with them simply because of his title um but what's your take on them obviously if you could explain a little bit uh what's uh in these bills and how they differ from each other and also tell us if you could change them in any way what would you want to do um sure well maybe I can give a quick summary of of what they are and um and why I think they're important the first is um in the Senate uh which is a comprehensive bill from senators alamus and Jilla brand an updated version of one that we saw last year and spent a lot of time talking about and it really covers basically every issue that you could imagine in in crypto from stable coins to Consumer Protection to Market structure and everything in between um that one just came out a couple of weeks ago it's really a different bill that the industry has been most focused on and that I think is worth more of our time discussing which is the digital asset Market structure discussion draft issued jointly by the house financial services and agriculture committees and this one has the backing of chairman Patrick McHenry who I think Laura maybe you've had him on your podcast before he's um he's uh you know a real proponent and but also a very uh important figure in Congress and he is very motivated to get this bill done and what the bill does essentially is it splits jurisdiction over different parts of crypto Market structure between the SEC and the cftc what it says basically is almost all tokens when they are initially created and distributed will be treated as restricted digital assets under the purview of the SEC but the way the bill is designed is it doesn't apply the entire scope of the current Securities laws which we've all been you know saying for a very long time don't work for digital assets it has sort of a tailored regulatory regime that addresses some of the real risks of of you know information asymmetry and Market Integrity um that really matter while an asset is treated that way it also says those assets can be traded on SEC regulated alternative trading systems and then it sets forth a process where a network underlying an asset can be certified as decentralized and once that certification is done the asset would then change into a digital commodity and would then move over into the jurisdiction of the cftc and would trade on a cftc regulated digital commodity exchange so basically it provides that Clarity that we were just talking about right there's no wondering about the facts and circumstances of a particular token or you know having to go to court to argue with the SEC about whether Securities laws apply or not it just comes up with a framework that the industry can understand and then comply with and you know the devil is still in the details there's there's a lot of uh changes that I would expect will happen from the draft that was published a while back but the bill is set to be marked up in both of those committees in July meaning the Committees will review the bill and then potentially propose amendments and Report the bill to the Full House of Representatives at which point the house could decide to vote the bill forward and then it would move over to the Senate to potentially be considered there and become law and I think you know everyone in the industry is extremely excited about this effort it really is as Kayvon was explaining before the solution that we need through legislation so that we don't just have to fight these issues out in court for the next 10 years or so and you know again there are some changes that I think we want to see um in terms of making sure that the framework really works for the industry but I'm pretty excited to see that bill move forward yeah this is definitely more uh Jake's baileywick than mine and uh yeah I think he stated that pretty well and yeah I think there is you know going to be some some work looking at both of these bills and figuring out how to reconcile some of the fine points but um but I do think broadly speaking they both are trying to do exactly what Jake was saying clarify this um you know the role of the SEC and the cftc and provide a path forward that you know harmonizes all of that and you know any version of that I think would be helpful um and you know beyond that I would refer to Jake and the blockchain association for any time uh you're trying to understand what's going on in this space in DC and so Jake how close are the two bills and how close do they even need to be for them to get passed well they don't have to be that close necessarily because if either of them were to pass in the chamber that they're proposed they then move over to the other chamber to be considered independently it's not necessarily the case that those two bills have to each move forward and then be reconciled that is possible if the house were to pass the digital asset Market structure bill and the Senate were to pass the lumus Julia brand bill they would end up in a conference between the house and the Senate to sort of come up with one uh coherent version which could then move to the president for him to sign I'm not sure that that's the most likely outcome I think it's more likely just given that the political reality of how much momentum is behind uh the bill that chairman McHenry and then Sherman Thompson on the house agriculture committee um you know the momentum really is there and what I would expect is that bill will be influenced to some degree by the lumus chiller brand bill but that's the bill that everyone is really focused on moving forward and again it's you know set for markup I think everyone Washington is spending all day every day focused on that bill and also on a stable coin Bill separately moving through the house Financial Services committee that's sort of where where the game is right now so I I'm pretty excited to see in the coming weeks whether that bill can get out of the two committees and then uh if it does we'll have a pretty interesting fall I think uh working on that bill on the house floor and if you were to give odds on some form of crypto legislation being passed by Congress in the next I guess yeah within the next calendar year what would you give those odds that is a very dangerous question as always I'm going to be an optimist and I'm gonna say that after the Ripple decision which as I explained I think really lights a fire under everyone I'm gonna say it's more likely than not let's give it a 51 chance I'm sure there are a lot of people out there who will say that I'm crazy to say that but um I think we're all really excited about this and I do think there is a bipartisan consensus that this is necessary and that this framework is is the right one to separate what does the SEC do and what does the CF CC do so I'm feeling pretty optimistic today anyway that we're going to get this bill done this Congress before uh before 2025. all right I would say 51 is a very crypto um number to you so so good call all right well you guys this has been such a fascinating discussion I just so appreciate that we were able to unpack what this really momentous order means for the industry especially on short notice thank you both so much where can people learn more about each of you and your work well thank you so much Laura I would uh tell folks to follow me on Twitter to the extent that Twitter will still exist um I'm at Jay travinsky um or you know look me up on on LinkedIn or on the blockchain association website I am um uh easy to find there sure yeah thank you Laura it was uh really a pleasure and and Jake great to great to see you here as well and uh easy to follow me or find me on General Block's website um or find me on LinkedIn um should be should be not too hard to find great well if well and a pleasure having you both on Unchained thanks thanks so
