[Music] thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap beanstalk lost 182 million dollars to a governance exploit on easter sunday beanstalk a stablecoin project on ethereum suffered an exploit worth 182 million dollars rather than a smart contract bug or theft of private keys this was a governance attack the beanstalk hacker was able to get away with roughly 76 million dollars in assets by taking out a flash loan to purchase 70 percent of bean stock governance tokens publishing and voting for a proposal that sent all treasury funds to the attacker and then paying back the flash loan all in one transaction the attack was rather sophisticated to pull it off the attacker took out one billion dollars worth of assorted tokens on ave in flash loans and exploited beanstalk's emergency commit function allowing them to immediately execute their proposal without going through the typical life cycle of a governance proposal both of these moves required a high level of defined knowledge and skill in the aftermath of the hack bean stocks bean stablecoin which traded at one dollar last week was trading below 10 cents according to its twitter account beanstalk is offering the attacker a 10 white hat bounty for more information and discussion on beanstalk check out this week's episode of the chopping block where tom schmidt tyrone chitra haseeb qarashi and i go in depth on the beanstalk hack and d5 security in general and oh fact first a russian miner sanctioned the us treasury's office of foreign assets control for the first time added a crypto miner to its list of sanctioned entities on wednesday bitrev the russian crypto mining firm along with 10 subsidiaries has now been added to ofac's special designated nationals list ofac also sanctioned the publicly traded trans capital bank and 39 other individuals and entities treasury is also taking action against companies in russia's virtual currency mining industry by operating vast server farms that sell virtual currency mining capacity internationally these companies help russia monetize its natural resources russia has a comparative advantage in crypto mining due to energy resources and a cold climate wrote treasury in its press release however mining companies rely on imported computer equipment and fiat payments which makes them vulnerable to sanctions the united states is committed to ensuring that no asset no matter how complex becomes a mechanism for the putin regime to offset the impact of sanctions treasury concluded in a statement shared with coindesk bit river ceo igor runets pushed back against the sanctions by calling them unfair runets claims that bit river whose parent company is based in switzerland has never provided services to russian government institutions or sanctioned entities the u.s going after russia-based minors could have massive implications russia is the third largest source of mining power in the world accounting for over 11 percent of hash power according to the latest statistics out of cambridge furthermore russia's president vladimir putin expressed interest in russia's crypto mining potential in late january additionally the news comes shortly after the international monetary fund published a paper explaining how russia could avoid sanctions levied in the wake of its invasion of ukraine via crypto mining over time sanctioned to countries could also allocate more resources toward evading sanctions through mining mining for energy-intensive blockchains like bitcoin can allow countries to monetize energy resources some of which cannot be exported due to sanctions the monetization happens directly on blockchains and outside the financial system where the sanctions are implemented ust is now the third largest stablecoin tara's native stablecoin ust is now the 13th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and third largest stablecoin narrowly climbing past finance's busd this week the news coincides with a burst in price from terrace governance token luna which increased 17 between monday and tuesday usc is still much smaller than tether and usdc which command an 82 billion dollar and 49 billion market capitalization respectively compared to only 17 billion dollars for ust however ust is now far and away the largest algorithmic stablecoin meaning instead of being supposedly backed one-to-one with dollar equivalent assets like usdc and usdt ust is designed to keep its peg to the dollar through a mint and burn mechanism that being said one reason that ust has become so popular lately is its transformation from a purely algorithmic stablecoin to a token with some backing as luna foundation guard has purchased over 1 billion dollars in btc to back the ust peg in times of crisis furthermore tara is now one of the largest buyers of cvx governance token that plays a significant role in the liquidity of stable coins on ethereum which should give usd more applications outside of being used on anchor a borrowing lending protocol offering almost 20 interest in the tarot ecosystem for example on thursday the terra and frax-backed four-pole yield farm went live on phantom bringing in over 30 million dollars in total value locked just hours after launching for more information on tara check out two recent episodes of unchained with tara co-founder do quan who discusses lfg's decision to back ust with btc and then galwa capital's kevin zhou who analyzes the risks associated with ust's dependence on anchor in related stablecoin news tron founder justin sun announced plans for a new algorithmic stablecoin usdd for tron which he claims will have a 10 billion dollar backing from assorted assets via tron dao moon birds is mooning data from crypto slam shows that moon birds a new nft collection has accrued more volume in the last seven days than the following 10 collections combined and it's not even close the 10 000 piece collection which launched and sold out on saturday has racked up over 113 000 eth in volume in the past seven days equating to 344 million dollars for context mutant apr club the second largest collection by volume during the same period only did 64 million dollars worth of volume moon birds minted at 2.5 eth and less than a week later the floor price for the entire collection is over 30 eth marking a quick 12x return the hype surrounding moonbirds seems to be derived from its team proof collective founded by kevin rose a partner at trueventures proof's previous 1000 piece nft drop which grants access to an nft investing and collection group currently has a floor price of 97 eath to join according to the moon birds road map holding a moon bird's nft gives access to the proof discord where exclusive moon bird related drops meetups in real life events and most importantly access to upcoming proof projects will be available the project however did not go off without a hitch as reported by coindesk the project faced complaints about its expensive 2.5 east mint price along with claims of raffle manipulation and rarity sniping by developers coinbase nft is here and it's social coinbase's much anticipated nft marketplace was beta launched this week to a select group of customers while only a small percentage of users from the 1.5 million waitlist were granted initial access to create a profile buy and sell nfts and so forth anyone is able to check out the platform for now coinbase's nft marketplace only supports ethereum but has plans to support other blockchains and fiat on-ramps san transsexina vp of product at coinbase told the block interestingly the exchange made the choice to embed its nft marketplace with social media tools however according to ceo brian armstrong these social mechanisms are far from finished products coinbase nft has a social component to it just want to acknowledge that we need to make social more decentralized over time we're stuck in a web 2.5 world still moving toward web3 he tweeted adding assets are decentralized and identity can be decentralized but follower graphs comments and some of the post content are still centralized opportunities about to move more of this on chain over time time for fun bits oops a defy hacker pulled off a self rug zeed a d5 protocol running on bnb chain was exploited on thursday after an attacker successfully triggered a distribution vulnerability that three x'd any rewards earned from the protocol overall it was a smaller hack with the block reporting that the hacker was only able to derive one million dollars in volume from the vulnerability that being said data from bsc scan shows that yied's token price crashed all the way to zero dollars in the aftermath now why is this a fund bits because the hacker ended up rugging themselves according to blocksec a crypto security firm blocksec explained interestingly the attacker did not transfer the obtained tokens out before self-destructing the attack contract probably he or she was too excited robin hood ceo wants bigger doge blocks can doge truly be the future currency of the internet and the people robin hood ceo of vlad tenev wondered aloud on twitter last week as currently constituted according to vlad the answer is no and for a familiar reason for anyone who has been in the blockchain space for a while tenet believes that doge's block size limit in transactions per second metric of 40 is holding doge back from being a global currency tenf is now arguing for dogecoin to move from a one megabyte to a one gigabyte block size and later 10 gigabytes to compete with visa's 65 000 transactions per second even though it would increase hardware requirements for nodes to do so a trade-off that tenant believes is fair ted have also pointed out that dogecoin's inflationary supply comes out as being less than that of the us dollar thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about peter coin center and the sec's proposed rule making check out the show notes for this
