experience get in touch there's a link to the job posting in the show notes crypto comm is waiving the 3.5% credit card fee for all crypto purchases until the end of September download the crypto comm app today the topic for today's show is yield farming here to discuss our Daniel it sir investor at I do coop ventures and will price data scientist at flipside crypto welcome Tannen will in the last few weeks we've seen a lot of people particularly in aetherium and EFI going crazy over this yield firming craze it kind of started with the launch of the comp token on June 15th when people could begin earning comp for borrowing and lending tokens on the platform and before launching this liquidity mining scheme there was about a hundred million dollars locked in compound and now there is about 650 million or I think 600 million as of the time of this recording so let's break down what this trend is there's kind of a few different ways of looking at it and I think you there's one way of looking at it like from the protocols perspective so can you describe that like when a protocol maker sets up a liquidity mining scheme why are they doing that what do they hope to get out of it and why don't we for audio listeners dan why don't we start with you so they recognize your voice sure thing sounds good so I think the important thing to understand with liquidity mining is that there are multiple goals here so one of the goals is just to decentralize governance over the protocol and so one of the reasons why compound is doing this compound labs that created the initial verb of the compound protocol is they want to make it truly decentralized so it remains permissionless and remain censorship resistance and so the best way for them to do that is to actually give ownership over it or at least over a very significant piece of it to the people who are using the protocol so that's one piece the other thing is because they're giving ownership over the protocol and there is perceived value to that that effectively subsidizes both the lending and borrowing rates on compound and so this is going to encourage a lot more activity as we as you noted there's been hundreds of millions of dollars of additional capital that has flowed into compound and a lot more borrowing demand that has resulted and one of the things that we can go into is you know how much of that is real net new usage that's going to stick around as this kind of levels out over time but the goal is to actually pour rocket fuel on what was already one of the most successful protocols in defy and we'll how would you describe it I would echo a lot of dance points and one thing that I would add is that I don't think that anybody anticipated the comp token being as valuable as it is in fact I believe right now it's about 10x the value that the original liquidity pool was launched at and as a result we're seeing all sorts of contrived and inorganic behavior by users who are attempting to maximize their rewards for using the token for using the compound protocol in the form of governance tokens and so I think a lot of other projects are taking notice and are likely to use a similar distribution mechanism in the future for their governance rights yeah I find it really fascinating that Dan actually started his answer with the governance piece because in a way I actually feel like that's sort of and to call it like a front is too strong but I actually feel like you know this idea around bootstrapping liquidity is kind of more of what the at least at least the initial impetus was or and maybe an I don't know about for compound but especially for some of these other ones also that are looking to do this like they just want to have you know a lot of assets you know well in this case because it's a lending protocol they want to have a lot of assets for people to lend and borrow right but then yeah what is ended up happening is like the users as will point it out they have a really different goal out of it and you know as you started to talk about like they're trying to just maximize their earnings so can you just describe for me a little bit more from the user's perspective kind of what this means for them and what they're trying to get out of it well I think in these early days it really is about users getting a bonus for using the protocol right I don't I I don't think that in the long-term future for compounds that most people using compounds will even need to be aware of the existence of the comp token right if compound achieves what I think a lot of the the builders and backers hope it achieves then it's handling tens hundreds of billions of dollars in assets maybe more than that right let's get crazy but in that future the vast majority of people interacting with it are not needing to think about comp as a token so this is something that's on the mind of the early adopters who see an opportunity to have a piece of something that they view as being very valuable in the future it subsidizes their rates right now but I don't think it's really a core part of the long-term roadmap for compound to have every day users needing to interact with the comp token totally and I agree that that is the long-term goal and the analogy from the physical world would be that a holder of an index fund wouldn't necessarily be voting their individual shares in a custodian like Blackrock would be doing voting on behalf of their users and that's likely to be the case for a protocol like compound if it does wind up with tens of billions of dollars in assets under management I would take it a step further and say it in some ways it's more like I can you know buy Nike shoes without owning Nike shares right is ultimately where we're headed but it's saying that this is a product where it is valuable to have this be decentralized and have it spread out and so part of that bootstrapping is distributing that ownership across a wider range of people absolutely but to your point Laura there is a dynamic at play where increasing the the assets being lanten by Road on compound or the assets under management on a protocol like balancer which has a similar scheme helps them reach the network effects required to achieve exit velocity so to speak yeah but yeah I I don't know I still I guess I feel like um you know the way that you're describing it it's almost like a little bit more noble than what's actually happening because I feel like the users are primarily just trying to maximize yield at this moment right and there you know borrowing assets and then re lending them just to earn more comp and so you know it's just I mean that's the pretty much the definition of yield farming and they're doing this sometimes with up to like Forex leverage so I mean wouldn't you say that up front it close when we're just talking about kind of this moment in time that that's actually what's going on and it's not the like high-minded governance stuff sure I I think it's hard to deny if you look at the numbers that the majority of compound usage today is organic I think it was prior to the launch of liquidity mining but it's all as well said a lot of this is you know organic usage purely to receive the cop token but I think that this is a really interesting mechanism if you even go back to Bitcoin with proof of work right essentially I think the reason people use the term liquidity mining is it's kind of like mining Bitcoin you're doing proof of liquidity rather than proof of work and it's also it can be analogized to proof of stake right in all cases you want people to have some costs in this case the opportunity their capital that they are giving up in order to earn the cop token and so that ensures that the people who are receiving the token have really you know put some economic value behind their acquisition of that token now whether just like Bitcoin miners whether they are long-term holders of that token or not isn't necessarily important it's a way of fairly you know doesn't mean equitably but fairly distributing this token out I think this is a very interesting mechanism produce it for doing so and I think there's already been steps taken by the folks who are governing the compound protocol actively today the books who have received delegations or some of the early investors that are trying to tamp down some of the incentives so that it doesn't lead to so much inorganic usage and there are some you know things that I'd like to see happen to get it even to a more sustainable level but yeah I'm not gonna argue that today this is largely organic usage yeah I could add some color to the bet in a second but one thing that I'll highlight is that these governance mechanisms are dynamic and that you'd never know exactly how an incentive scheme is going to work in the wild when these users don't exist in a vacuum right there participants in the broader defy and crypto ecosystems and so so what you see happen is you have unintended effects like for example right after the compound launch massive massive amounts of tether were borrowed and converted to USD see recursively because that was the selling point strategy whereby people were able to earn the most in governance rewards that dynamic pivoted towards basic attention token which to put some data on it has about 300 million dollars in outstanding borrow at the moment 85% of which has been resupplied to the protocol by those same users which is a bit scary from a liquidity perspective and compound has rightly so it taking steps to mitigate that but it's illustrative that incentives can hot cause unintended consequences yeah yeah I mean I feel like if there's any lesson we've learned in crypto it's that when things happen they happen quickly and like kind of flare up in these big ways so yeah I know these kind of very wide pendulum swings I feel like our part and parcel of a technology that moves so quickly and that can be programmed it's it is scary to watch but I actually was so curious so Dan when you talked about the different measures that they're taking to kind of tamp down the incentives so that it isn't this kind of crazy inorganic activity what are some of the proposals there yeah so one of the proposals that that passed last week was to say we're gonna look at these tokens that are not not etherium not either and not stable coins that are on the platform so basic attack on the 0x token and augurs rep token and they all have rate interest rate curves that within the compound protocol that would make them ideal for this type of yield farming and they said okay well if we try to nerve that and make it so that you know that's not the dominant strategy anymore people are just gonna rotate to these other two coins and so just there was a blanket move to say we're gonna increase the protocols reserve factor on the interest paid from believe it was like zero or maybe 10 percent up to 50 percent which means that there is now a much more significant cost not just an opportunity cost for doing this farming but there's also the cost of 50 percent of the interest paid you're not paying back effectively to yourself you're paying to a reserve pool held within the compound protocol and so that's that's one thing to entry is real cost the more recent governance changed was saying rather than calculating comp distribution on the basis of the amount of interest paid per asset it's just going to be calculated on the bay is of total outstanding US dollar amount borrowed her assets so we don't have to worry about the differences in the interest rate curves across different protocols as much it's it's more just where is the demand I do think this is gonna flip the game on its head where rather than going for the highest interest rate assets to borrow and lend people are going to be wanting to borrow the lowest interest rate asset and still lend at the the highest supply rate so I think that's actually a more it a much more healthy dynamic because it should be natural that people want to earn the most when they're lending assets and pay the least when they're supplying it and so that helps to kind of restore that natural balance yeah this reminds me about how like early on you had this tweet where you show that people could earn more from borrowing USD T than they could lending on compound and it like just intuitively this doesn't make sense so like obviously there's something messed up there but yeah actually also when what you described reminds me of like whack-a-mole because it just sort of feels like people are just like the the governance actors are gonna constantly be trying to like tweak based on what's happening is that just how this is going to go or do you ever see this reaching some kind of equilibrium I would say that it's likely to reach an equilibrium when the value distributed is a much smaller percent of the assets under management so people who are participating in the protocol are receiving governance rewards in a much smaller proportion than they currently are I don't think that we're likely to find the stable equilibrium in the short-term well compound is giving away half a million dollars a day in governance rights and and for example the change that Dan alluded to where high interest rates will no longer be rewarded it is likely to have ripple effects elsewhere in the ecosystem particularly with assets like Dai the stable coin which are inherently supply constraint so yeah actually why don't we dive into that because there was this post that Cyrus Yoon se maker dal row where he talked about how he thought a way a change you know and the way compound is paid out could just make do I lose its dollar pegs so can you explain how what his theory was and like whether or not you think that will happen or what will happen there yeah so I think it's a definite possibility what happened actually but explain why he thought it would to loose its peg sure I guess we can start with the theory it all boils down to the shape of the interest rate curves and that essentially means what percent interest our borrowers paying lenders as a function of the total amount of assets being used from zero to a hundred percent and the shape of the dye interest rate curve is very flat up until about ninety percent utilization and so effectively what that means is that borrowers pay a relatively low rate of interest to borrow dye which under this proposed new scheme which is likely to go live tomorrow Thursday July 2nd will incentivize dye more so than any of the other assets on the platform and by the time this comes out so the audience may already know something that we don't know but anyway keep going so I think Cyrus was right to point out that these exogenous factors could have an impact on the monetary policy that maker uses to manage their stable coin peg and it's going to be interesting to watch what happens yeah and to add to will your point about like there's just a massive subsidy happening right prior to the launch of this comp distribution compounds borrowers were paying I think was the neighborhood of like $1,200 a day or so in in interest just like that's that's how much could be earned in total across the system by lending on compound and now we're up to like hundreds of thousands of dollars per day in subsidies so yeah things are massively out of whack and it's it's very likely that that will impact other protocols in the system maker and I specifically seem seem ripe to have impact felt yeah so you know I actually want to continue this line of thinking a little bit more but I actually before we do that just going to ask a little bit more about the sustainability within comp itself because I have a whole series of questions about composability in whatever so let's just kind of finish talking about comp I mean we alluded to this before but like do you expect that these protocols that offer these liquidity mining incentives to maintain their level of activity because the way I see it it's sort of like how in Bitcoin you know people worry about whether or not the security of the network will be affected once they transition from LeBlanc reward to transaction fees and this is something that they're worrying about and it literally won't even happen until we're all dead so come obviously that distribution ends in four years and like is there some kind of contingency plan or do they just think like oh they're only enough liquidity we'll be fine forever after that or you know what do you guys think well I think actually I the the philosophy that I've heard from the tasers community occasionally I think applies here it's like if you've got good governance you can have anything any other feature that you want and I think for compound that's the case right thing the governors of the protocol can change the parameters so what was literally set out when they announced a four year schedule was something like forty to forty three percents of this you know what was the ten million hundred million comp cap was gonna be distributed through the system and that was laid out as a certain number of comp per block I believe and what we found was that blocks were going a little bit faster than was expected and so that actually even push the subsidy up higher and on a daily basis so there was an adjustment it's part of one of these other governance decisions to reduce the issuance rate now there's nothing stopping the governors of this protocol from further reducing that and bringing it down to a sustainable level now you still have the same number of comp Takens in this supply to be distributed through this program and so that would necessarily extend the window past the four year mark that was initially proposed so you know all this is subject to governance and I think it is very very unlikely that we will see a kind of flat line issuance over four years and then seeing it drop to zero because as you said like that seems very problematic so I would expect that the people who have some ownership and it's protocol will use that ownership to have at the very least a smooth landing we might even see something resembling the Bitcoin having yeah yeah whether it's a having or you know a smoother decay or even just spread it out there's essentially tail issue and it's like who knows it's all on the table that's interesting well so to pull in a little bit of history and all this can you describe how this all got started and I think maybe one of the initial kind of like I don't know I don't even know effect then it would have been called liquidity minor or maybe it would have been but when synthetics began offering something similar with its since eath and east pool on eunice Wahb like was that the first instance of this and if so can you kind of describe what happened there but then also maybe describe I think they wound it down so like and that was just like a year ago or what so you know how did that go and is that similar to what you're describing here yeah yeah so I would say that's the first unchain incentive program to see widespread success but I believe the term liquidity mining was coined by a company named humming bot in reference to paying for orders on an order book but in the case of synthetics they had massive success incentivizing their one to one peg of their synthetic assets to real assets by subsidizing people who were willing to put both of those assets into a liquidity pool with their protocols native token and Robert from compound has said as much that it was an inspiration to to compound labs and the rest of the stakeholders in the ecosystem when designing their process and you know Dan this goes back to what you alluded to and your your aquaponic yield farming article but all of these protocols are interconnected and now that many other liquidity pools are incentivizing liquidity there's no need for synthetics to to subsidize that synthetic Ethan viii pull anymore other protocols are doing it for them like balancer oh okay so that's why they wound that down so it like didn't cause them any problems or anything corrected they do have an incentivized pool on an another platform called curve which is optimized for stable pairs but the original incentive has been wound down okay and then just to also now ask a little bit more about governance like do we have any sense of what percentage of these I mean okay we like amongst the people that have comp there's probably two groups there's like the speculators and the people who are actually interested in governance and I'm curious to know like what percentage you know each group makes of the total pool and whether or not there's overlap like whether or not you sense that this speculative mania is actually gonna lead toward people getting interested in governance or is it just like you know you're gonna give away a bunch of comp and then eventually through trading it will find its way to people interested in governance I suspect it's it's more the lavender that like eventually through trading it finds its way to into the hands of people who are interested in governance one of the nice things about the protocol though and I know the compound team but a lot of thought into this is to the delegation function so you know if you want to have your voice heard and you want to you know you feel pride in owning some comp no want to have some piece of it over the long term you don't have to actively be involved in making every decision yourself you can delegate the voting power from your comp tokens to somebody else and so for example I do collab ventures is you know a delegate for comp we don't actually hold any Tom as they fund at this time but we have multiple portfolio companies including insta DAP and pool together that use compound very heavily and so we participate in the governance process through confidence been delegated to us because we want to you know protect their interests and the interests of other startups and protocols that may build on comp in the future and we also think that it's just an incredibly important player in the ecosystem and so we are learning a lot through participating in this governance process and we're learning things that that we are then able to share those lessons with other companies in our portfolio as they look to roll out their own governance platforms oh and just to clarify some facts because I'm not sure I fully understood that so you guys don't personally own comp but people can delegate to you and you guys vote yes okay great a super super interesting and it will looks like you were gonna say something the only thing that I have to add to that is that given how early we are in the lifetime distribution of these assets most of the circulating supply is owned by team members and key stakeholders like venture capitalists and so the small amounts of comp that is circulating beyond those communities is most likely in the hands of speculators at this point in time but as more and more assets get issued people who are interested in the turn future of governance whether those be large users of the protocol or people who see it as systemically important to the ecosystem are likely to control a larger and larger fraction of the supply yeah yeah so maybe maybe this mechanism will work out the way that they hoped and we'll see you know it would be nice if that did happen but now let's talk about something that we also again alluded to earlier it's amazing how quickly the comp token reached like a pretty high market cap on coin market cap when I did the research it was 23 on coin market cap but I actually wasn't able to check it right before we spoke but currently the market cap is around 2 billion however the total value locked in it is 600 million so what do you guys think does that mean that compound is overvalued or like how do we term in a deep evaluation and defy well you're the numbers guy want to give it a shot ok well the interesting thing about this is that we have a positive feedback loop here the more the governance rights are valued the more people are going to put their assets into compound in order to capture a piece of them and the more assets that are in compound the more valuable those goverment's rights are so I think we're in in early days in terms of reaching an equilibrium price but the only rational way that I've seen to value governance rights is to assume that those governance rights are likely to eventually result in fee capture from the protocol and then to do a discounted cash flow analysis we suit just so I understand like meaning that people are rewarded for for good governance so so anytime that people have full control over the protocol you have to assume that there is a nonzero probability that they will vote themselves so revenue share at some point in the future and that those cash flows will have value ok ok but so then based on that when you look at the activity going on like you know just do you feel like it's going to trend in that direction or I would say Dan is probably the expert here Fair Play yeah so I think I think wills analysis the spot-on right that's that's how you would likely construct some sort of valuation model reasonably around this what's the likelihood is the probability is that you assign to their ever being some kind of capture on the the valuable Andrew the protocol is is a big piece of this but you know we'll explain the game that you know as more assets are in there you expect the future dolly to go out so I guess we don't know where it's gonna end up Mille mentioned there's not a lot of kind of float out there in terms of like new newly received comp that you know presumably it's you know short term speculators potentially who are trying to get their hands on this and and there's not a lot to be traded there so this is going to take a little while to get to some kind of stable price discovery whether that will ultimately net out significantly above or below where it's trading today I don't know if I did I would be making a lot of moves right now and make a lot of money I think it's it's interesting to watch I I think there are certainly ways you can put together model that say the current valuation is very reasonable there's ways you can say it's very rich it's all based on your assumption of how much money do you ultimately see flowing through the protocol how much do you think can reasonably be captured by the governance token holders and what probability do you assign to the governance token holder is eventually choosing to capture some of that value alright so the only less question I want to ask that's kind of like really focused just on what's happening here is I was just looking at how you know you there are these other apps like you mentioned insted app where it just makes it much easier for you to basically chase these yields through smart contracts and I just wondered like as more people do things like that that's it's gonna further what we were talking about what that would cause these wild swings and the values of the assets so like it doesn't that make governance like so much harder and do you predict that that will be a consequence of things like that because I just wonder like how how can you control something like that where everything's just programmed to just always go after the highest yield and everybody's glomming onto it I don't know it just you know cuz like I guess right now the in trading and the way you make money is like you're ahead of the curve or whatever and you kind of like you have your own little niche but just if everybody's doing it with these smart contracts I kind of I don't know how that's gonna work so that the yield farmers are going to move their assets from protocol to protocol in search of the highest short-term returns but some liquidity is sticky for example tether was the favorite of the yield farmers and you know there were 300 million dollars worth of tether that were borrowed at one point just a couple of weeks ago but there are still about 50 million dollars of tether borrowed on compound even though that is no longer the optimal strategy which is far far in excess of the less than 1 million that was borrowed before the start of this liquidity mining initiative so liquidity and liquidity will be sticky ok that's impressive yeah I think you know we've talked a little bit about the finding a natural equilibrium within a protocol like compound I think there's also gonna be a process of finding a natural equilibrium across the broader ecosystem because to the extent that that these protocols are composable and as people are looking to farm yield across multiple protocols you know the subsidy being too high compared to natural demand on one protocol or too low on another is gonna have ripple effects across these other protocols and so I think it's gonna take significant time to get there I think having these big numbers I don't I don't think it was actually a mistake to launch comp this comp distribution in the way that it was because I think that the hype that's generated is good right we it's not sustainable but it got a lot of interested should people the power of these incentives and now it actually gave the both people involved in compound and people involved in other protocols real clear incentive to figure out a better way to incentivize their users and get this to a more sustainable state I think what what's interesting if you think about it going back to the model well laid-out is you're you're valuing these things if you're trying to do a valuation on these things then you you should be valuing them looking at discounting back potential future cash flows and in that sense what you're doing is you're just kind of shifting those future cash flows to the present as a way of subsidizing user acquisition and kind of assets liquidity acquisition within the protocol and so that's not dissimilar from PayPal in the early days and many other consumer apps right paying your referral bonus if you bring a friend on board or Paine's new users to sign up the difference is they've got this set that has use in terms of being able to make this a decentralized protocol and people are projecting value on it according to this model and they're just using them saying hey rather than us need to go out to VCS and rate is 10 million dollars 100 million dollars to pay to subsidize growth you know we're just gonna go direct to the users they can see where this is potentially going and they'll value owning a piece of it so I think it's actually really cool to then go directly to the users of the protocol believe in it and they're provided the subsidy directly rather than having to play a game of raising capital through PCs to pay people in u.s. dollars I couldn't agree more it but Laura I think we missed addressing your point about insted apps tools making it easier for people to pursue these inorganics strategies and and I think that what insted app does is provide a better user experience and what people choose to leverage that user experience for is something that was already possible within the protocol and if it demonstrates an issue it's going to come to the surface sooner and the team can iterate quicker in the case of compound so I don't see it as an issue at all and in fact I see it as in that positive okay yeah let's let's talk a little bit more about actually a number of these issues including discounted cash flow and and then we're gonna get into like things like security and composability in a second but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible how much in fees are you paying for your crypto purchases cred Broadcom is waiving the 3.5% credit card fee for all crypto purchases which means you can buy crypto with a 0% fee apart from your crypto purchases you can also get a great deal on food and grocery shopping to get up to 10 percent back on uber eats McDonald's Domino's Pizza Walmart and many more when you pay with your MCO Visa card no card on the crypto dot-com app buy gift cards and get up to 20% back from merchants like Whole Foods Safeway Burger King Papa John's and Domino's download the crypto dicamba today and enjoy these offers till the end of September back to my conversation what's an elixir and will price alright gosh I feel like we could do this forever because there's just so much to discuss but I actually wanted to go back to the discounted cash flow thing that you guys described can you just walk through what that looks like for something like homp yeah so just kind of cash flows generally you need to start with something that's called a hurdle rate or an internal rate of return and that's basically what is the opportunity cost of your capital so a dollar today is worth more than a dollar ten years in the future and then you take that discounted rate and you apply it to the cash flows that you expect to receive over time and then you take what's called the net present value of that and that's the rational current evaluation for the protocol governance but like but so what you're doing is you're kind of projecting what comp should be worth at some point in the future and comparing it to what it's worth now is that what you're doing it's it's less about what comp is worth at some point in the future and more about what cash flows will comp generate for you at all points in the future and then trying to collapse that down to what is that series of cash flows worth to me today oh okay and and that would be generated by what like when you engage in governance and are rewarded in some fashion or yeah I mean any way that the protocol can capture value could be valued in this way and it's really up in the air and these are not trivial assumptions to make oh no wonder yeah yeah cuz yeah just I could totally imagine different people coming up with wildly different valuations and so making it seem good and some making it seem bad because the assumptions are just way too unknown at this point absolutely okay all right well let's let's talk about security because I think that's a huge concern at this point we've with you know everything even just as far back as the Dow but then also you know these recent defy hacks with like synthetics and BZ accent Len F me and when you combine all that with like the interoperability of these protocols I'm just curious for you guys when you think about security like what gives you most cause for concern most cause for concern I would say it's the fact that we are moving so fast in developing new things and there is so much money at stake and so when people see these big numbers you know it's natural to get a little greedy and be like I want to try to get a piece of that and I don't think that most people are able to understand the level of risk that is inherent in some of these protocols one of the reasons why I'm more comfortable with compound being the place where we're running this first experiment in how these types of systems work is the level of diligence that the compound team has applied in building their protocol the number of audits they've done their internal processes they've just really put security front and center and I think that the same cannot be said for a lot of other teams in the space not saying that any of them have any you know bad intentions right but you know from what I've seen of the compound team and what they've written publicly and Roberts talked about publicly in terms of processes they just take this with a very different level of seriousness than a lot of the teams in the ecosystem and and you know they've advantages of Robert being a very experienced founder and being able to raise capital having the resources to to dedicate towards this and it's understandable that if you you know you're an early stage team and you know you've raised nothing or maybe you've raised a few hundred thousand dollars it's really hard to go through all the same stuff because it does mean that your you're moving slower and you're having more expense but when you start layering all of these different systems together and they they haven't all applied that same a little diligence yeah you're gonna find a hedge cases and thing in places where things break and real money can be lost compound has taken the approach of whitelisting assets that have been thoroughly vetted which reduces my level of concern which is you know still reasonable given the amount of money at stake there are protocols like nexus mutual and open which provide insurance in the form of a mutual backing or in the form of options which can give users some peace of mind so I'm excited for those protocols to grow so let's talk about one of the recent attacks which was on balancer which is I guess like an an automated market maker but can you explain what happened there just so people can understand like how you know one way in which people can lose money and and actually also it wasn't even clear to me well just explain what happened with balancer and then I'll ask you my next question will be referring to the deflationary token yes where yeah five hundred thousand dollars got lost and balancer yeah so what happened was there were two assets in particular that had deflationary mechanisms and that that essentially means that the supply of the token could be reduced and that's not a standard ERC 20 token feature yeah it's almost like a recursive call is type thing in the way where they just did a transaction over and over again and it was draining small amounts because one side accounted for the fee and then the other side didn't and so then at the end after he had done it a number of times one side of it was drained but then the other side the contract didn't know it was that asset was drained yeah yeah essentially they used a flash loan to recursively cycle through like you mentioned I think there were something like 600 event logs and that turns out which is insane but they were able to drain the assets from the pool and you know balancer was aware that this sort of mechanism wouldn't play nice with their pool but I don't think they were aware the extent to which it could be exploited via things like flashlights okay yeah go ahead and they they have been alerted to the existence of this type of vulnerability by somebody external from it was a hex capital and they they noted that it was an issue but they hadn't realized as well said that like flash loans could be utilized in this way to like really amp up the danger and you know they they acknowledged their mistake I think you know they didn't handle the initial bug report well in terms of like they'd kind of dismissed it but when when this you know X what happens they fully owned up to their mistake and and said they should have been more diligent around this and they're kind of covering losses for for people in those particular pools based on you know they felt like this kind of you know they'd they took some responsibility for it but as well said this is a permissionless protocol and people can put any assets they want into it and the reason why those assets were there and why there was so much of that was people we're trying to do liquidity mining or yield farming on balancers bowel token and so in some ways I think it's you know play stupid games when stupid prizes don't if you're if you're gonna try to take advantage of in kind of edge cases in the system or or take advantage of some rules that aren't really in the spirit with which these programs have been laid out then it's it's really buyer beware and and so don't use a promotional as protocol with some non-standard token and expect that somebody else is watching out for you all right well yeah so this was actually my question because I just wanted to make sure I understood it so um like when I was reading the articles on this I was saying things like balancer lost five hundred thousand dollars but it was basically all the different providers of liquidity in the various tokens that were drained those were the people that lost money and I'm assuming that they lost money in proportion to their holdings within the pool is that yes that's exactly correct okay yeah was just that right so it wasn't it wasn't people who were had funds and other balance or pools it was limited just to those who chose to provide liquidity into that pool with these weird deflationary assets and then you were saying that balancer was making them whole somehow or what was there yeah so bouncer because that they were aware that this was an issue and because even though their protocol is permissionless they didn't flag or somehow it disabled these pools in their UI balancer labs made the choice to make these liquidity providers whole Wow okay it reminds me of like coinbase did that with the eath flash crash anyway okay so I feel like for a number of these like one of the main vectors of attack really is taking advantage of the composability right it's like in this case with these deflationary tokens that shouldn't have been used on balancer or like with the bzx attacks you know that was using multiple different protocols in different ways the lend of me one was about the ERC 777 token being used where it shouldn't have and I mean it I think one thing that's really fascinating is that all these attacks usually indicate that the hacker has like extremely sophisticated knowledge of multiple defy protocol I I shouldn't like it like it's one of those weird things like when you see it happened like you're almost like impressed you know and obviously they're doing it for bad purposes so however so what I wanted to say was just like if defy grows beyond this small secret a small ecosystem now in which most everyone kind of knows each other and like can basically kind of keep up on developments I mean even at this point where like for instance with Linda Emmy that attack was known about like the year before and the team still didn't do things to prevent that so and that's like I said when when and that was even when the defy of space is even smaller than now so like how do you think teams will be able to keep their protocols secure in the future like you know I was brainstorming Anna is like should there be some like standards body but then I was like that will move so slow compared to defy like that I'll never work so I don't know what are there are people talking about this it's certainly a topic of discussion and I think as will pointed out there's a difference between a protocol like compound that requires assets be white listed for inclusion and they go through a pretty straight vetting process maker does a similar thing and protocols like balance or you know swap where anybody can use any asset in there and so it has a very different risk profile as a result I think you're asking a great question though because as you pointed out with like the London ME issue with the 777s a lot of these attacks are known issues right they were previously reported in that case like even there was like an example like code snippet that could be used this is pretty low hanging fruit right now and so yes we should be scared about what happens when we get past the low-hanging fruit and we have an even more interconnected system and then there are really sophisticated attacks that haven't been reported yet that are you know zero day attacks essentially like what happens then it's it's very it's very concerning we're building what we hope is new global financial infrastructure here and I think we need to as an industry just step up the level of diligence and care that we're applying to the creation and use of these protocols but when you say that what does that mean that like the security teams for each of these protocols has to get bigger or like what does that look like I don't think that in the long term we can rely on the end-user to be a good judge of the technical aptitude and and security rigor engaged in by each team and so I mentioned insurance earlier I really think that a wider adoption of Assurant insurance is likely to be the solution here not in terms of eliminating the risk but in terms of offloading it to people better equipped to assess it yeah that's one thing I think another I know my friend Richard Burton has been talking about going to like kind of like these NASA like formal verification workshops and stuff and like getting some like little rocket scientists into the field and like people who can really formally verify some of this code I know formal verification something that a few teams have pursued to some degree but I think it just needs to be a much more common practice I think you know there there are some fantastic teams that conduct audits on smart contracts but you know as good as they are you can never say like oh it's been audited so it's safe there there's only so much you can do with it go for the audit but there is some elements of these auditors are paid by the teams that are doing the development and they write you know they're I think very honest reports but there's some elements of they can't come out and say this is a flaming pile of garbage when somebody's like pay them to give the report so they need to we could be a very very plain very nano dry technical language and I think that there is a need as investors like like you know myself and others are utilizing these protocols more to have them start to step up and pay for additional secure reviews where it's saying like don't sugar cut it right if I'm gonna put you know millions of dollars in funds that have been entrusted to me into some of these protocols I want to make sure that I'm getting it straight from the experts as to you know would they trust their own money on do they think it's safe yeah I don't know if you listen to the episode I did with Dan from trail if it's I'm just flaking it on his last name and at Taylor Guido Guido yeah and Taylor Monahan of microbes oh but yeah we talked about the hedge ik attack and that was definitely the subtext of that conversation you know I was asking Dan about some of the ways in which the hedge ik the team didn't seem fully professional and you know why they even took them on as clients and he said oh you know we've worked with all these anonymous people before with weird usernames and weird quirks but but yeah he definitely implied that it was truly not you know not work that was ready to go and that people mistook the idea that they'd been on it islets like a rubber stamp of approval but anyway okay so we're kind of running out of time and I want to ask a few other things so in this period that we've seen the yield from Inc raise take off why do you think we haven't really seen the praise of etherium rise that is the question on everybody's mind I think right now people are very interested about the potential of these government's tokens and other defy assets and that people who might otherwise be investing in eath are migrating more of their capital into these areas and viewing eath potentially more as a way to pay for transaction fees and nothing else I actually think that in the long run and that this yield farming meme is going to be very good for theory 'm given that a central tenet of eath 2.0 is staking whereby you lock up your capital and return for yield analogous manner to what's happening right now on compound and balancer yeah that makes sense but it is kind of curious that I don't know Dan what are your thoughts yeah I also think that you know it's a very positive sign for the etherium ecosystem and you know for for either as NASA that said you know if we I believe we're at the beginning of a very you know large kind of run-up and an activity and and like the evaluations and such in the t v space and I'm super excited about may the new protocols that I'm seeing that are getting ready to come into market or just starting to grow if we do see this like Bull Run in defy and ether and Bitcoin also likely don't go along for the ride that's gonna force a lot of people to to check some of their their prior assumptions I my expectation is that at some point we will see these base assets along for the ride and it for various reasons but if we don't I don't I don't think that's necessarily a problem I think if if there is real activity happening in defy if there's real value being created that starts to be more organic then I'm still gonna be hugely excited about the potential in the space but you know yes as someone who holds some of those assets that would be great to see them go home for the Ryan just I'm so curious earlier when you said like what if we see a bull run and defy but Bitcoin and ether don't go along for the ride do you literally mean just like you know all these different governance tokens and defy the the ones that are offered as incentives for a liquidity mining that we would see those take off but that like maybe ether wooden and then maybe Bitcoin because it's sort of like a different ecosystem just would lag because wouldn't don't you wouldn't you see people buying Bitcoin in either to get into the ecosystem or well I think it's it's very different from you know in 2017 with the ICO boom right ether was money that was like the way that you could like kind of pay into these icos and participate and so it created a lot of demand for ether to just use the the killer use case of these ICS if today the the killer use case is yield farming or use of these defy protocols we now have widely adopted stable coins and so people already think of stable coins as money they have the ability to expand and contract the supply based on people just literally depositing dollars and minting more of them so it doesn't necessarily put the same pressure of demand on ether specifically that the ico boom did I do think there is a lot of value in having a kind of neutral platform native permissionless asset right that is not centrally controlled in any way I think that is very valuable I do think that is a real strength for ether and also a real strength for Bitcoin but it's it's not as much of a direct need to force you know millions or billions of dollars in value into that one asset to watch the ecosystem grow in the way that there was in 2017 I will say though that if we do see a defy Bull Run we will stress test and therefore trust many of these nascent financial primitives even more and ask more of them plug into each other and we have a complex ecosystem forming that raises them out for aetherium and creates an almost insert passable Network effect Oh interesting well okay so I was gonna ask you because like gas fees have about kind of roughly maybe quadrupled or quintupled since the beginning of the year and I see people complaining about the the gas fees when they're trying to do they're harming truth so um you know obviously I feel like this is related to scaling issues so I just wondered like you know do you people have concern that aetherium will not scale quickly enough to meet this demand for yield farming or or whatever might whatever else might happen on defy and like to feel like there is a risk that this activity could move to some other blockchain I think there is concern I don't necessarily think that there is a risk in fact a couple of weeks ago miners increased the block gas limit by about 20 percent which basically means there's 20 percent more capacity on aetherium but we didn't really see gas fees drop so to me that says right now there's you know infinite demand for defy and defy wants to be on if there am because that's where the liquidity is yeah I don't think it's a problem to have these at the current level right now for where the ecosystem is I think it for non defy use cases it may be pretty problematic because these defy use cases you can like directly say yes I'm willing to spend five dollars in gas because I'm gonna make $50 on the trade you know for you know crypto kitties type use cases and stuff in my it might be harder right now that said you know where we've we backed a team called optimism which is working on an optimistic rolf solution for scaling there's a number of other very strong teams working on their own layer to scaling solutions you know hopefully we see Eve 2 at some point in the not-too-distant future but there's there's all these different things and I think a lot of these layer 2 solutions are all starting to come to market around the same time and so I think there's gonna be a really interesting evolution to watch out there I think that anybody who spent significant time looking at these blotching networks and understanding some elements of the kind of limitations on their growth in the various ways almost inevitably comes to the conclusion that we're going to see in the end a lot more activity happening through layer 2 systems than directly on layer 1 and and it'll all be anchored back to layer 1 but you can't do everything on chain on layer 1 and so I think it's it's gonna be great timing to see some of these really viable layer 2 solutions coming to market just as we're hitting this inflection point with demand where people want to be having a lot more transact volume and a lot more complex transaction volume weight and just just so I understand like you even think that will be the case that a lot of activity will shift to lay or to even on East to where it's a sharded absolutely absolutely I mean as well separate we pump capacity 20 percent didn't notice difference in gas prices I think and the ecosystem is so it's tiny today right like you know as successful like defy protocol has thousands of users by probably not even tens of thousands of users today if we really want to scale this to billions of people which I hope we all do then yeah there's no way you can do this all on l1 right yeah well so speaking of layer ones I did see that Tom Shaughnessy Oh Delphi digital tweeted that he thought deep I tokens would end up pushing out when he called ghost layer ones out of the top ten like XRP like coin bit coin kashi o's bitcoins satoshis vision tron stellar which disclosure is a sponsor of my shows and so he was saying that he felt like that you know these were just gonna beat overtaken by defy tokens do you think that's what's gonna happen or just from what you were describing it almost sound like you were saying that if syrian will become more like the defy chain and some of the other applications applications will shift to other layer ones so i think it comes back to network effects but one thing that makes me bullish on the theorem in particular is that these layer twos can be optimized for different purposes right now we have a layer two payment solution and loop ring live on chain today we have teams like optimism working on fully fledged EPM execution environments where you can preserve defy composability so i do think that there's going to be a compelling reason for for projects regardless of their domain to remain on a fully interoperable system okay well let's also now just talk about another really important layer 1 which is bitcoin so now there's 11,000 Bitcoin on aetherium and it's about a hundred days worth yeah and some things like wrapped Bitcoin ran BTC I am BTC and I mean that's it's like a pretty significant increase from the end of March when there was maybe like about fifteen hundred BTC so why what do you like think is the significance of that like why do you think we're seeing this like it could it put posed any potential dangers to Bitcoin which is to my mind you know really different cuz it's all about like security and conservatism you know what do you make of this well you know as somebody who has been focused on Bitcoin for a long time and still is very bullish on Bitcoin I I think it's great seeing Bitcoin come over I'm excited by Bitcoin and I'm excited that defy so if I can use my Bitcoin in defy like greats I get the best of both worlds that said I do think that there is an extreme scenario right let's say that defy and a theorem is hugely successful and people want to use their Bitcoin in defy applications if you get the majority of economic activity from Bitcoin happening on top of the theorem that does raise some concerns for Bitcoin security model because there will not be transaction fees or as many transaction fees required to support that I don't think that we're likely to approach a level of concern for that like in in in the next few years who knows it is an interesting table to keep an eye on I'm I'm very you know excited about bitcoins future regardless but yeah it's certainly dynamic that I don't think a lot of people who've been focused on Bitcoin have necessarily like considered how extreme states might play out yeah yeah but on the flip side I would say bringing Bitcoin to defy is like probably gonna be really good for defy cuz there's so much more money in Bitcoin economic bandwidth right yeah comic bandwidth yeah and it will what were you gonna say well I agree that there are a lot of corn holders watching all of the yield farming happening in defy with with a lot of interest but but one thing that's particularly interesting is that his flavors of Bitcoin that we have on aetherium so we have custodial solutions like rat Bitcoin we have synthetics like s BTC and we have not decentralized versions like Ren BTC and users who who might want to unwrap without kyc could could use Ren Bitcoin but they may not be comfortable with the risks of holding Ren Bitcoin so they could then swap for one of these other forms so I think the the plethora of different types is beneficial for the ecosystem as well and it do you have any particular ones that you think are more likely to take off than others that's a good question I think in the short term raft Bitcoin has many more integrations with with the fab projects and so probably has the most short-term potential but in the long run I think it's anybody's guess can you just remind me that's the one I think bit Co custody is that and it's somehow through khyber what what are the details on that again a bit fuzzy on the details but I know that go is the custodian that goes the custodian yeah there's number different kind of merchants who are part of the the consortium there who have the ability to interact with bit go to kind of issue new brockton Qin ok all right well we're over time but because this is just so fascinating I was also just curious to know like where do you guys think that you'll that this yields firming trend will go next well I I think that right now I just brought a piece recently that I called aquaponic yield farming the idea being that aquaponic systems involve the accommodation of growing plants out of water with having fish in that water so your farming fish the waste from the fish is going to fertilize the plants and you know play in the water for the fish so it's a great system and and we're seeing similar things I start to emerge will mentioned the different flavors of Bitcoin there is now this different flavor of Bitcoin pool on curve which is an AMM optimized for stable value assets and so people are yield farming from the upcoming curved token their yields harming for believe balancer and then synthetics and ran have also added like their own rewards on top of this to so people are kind of like mixing these things together and I think it's it's very interesting people are going to try to stack their yield across multiple protocols but I think ultimately where it might get interesting is rather than stacking protocols right now we're in a very you know blue ocean space but as it gets more you know red ocean where or there's not as much you know just fresh opportunity to go for these protocols may start to encroach on each other's territory and we may end up with the developments of what I've called prime brokerage protocols where you're trying to under the roof of a single protocol allow for exchange and you know borrowing and lending and creation of options and futures and other things all under one roof so you know we'll see I think that would be something that will take many years to to lead to that point but stuff moves faster who knows very fast I would certainly be very interesting to example have you know AMM pool Sherry's be more widely accepted as collateral to allow OTC deals with your collateral on a system like compound so the prime brokerage idea is definitely an interesting one in terms of yield stacking I will say that we are building a complex ecosystem complexity is emergent and it is very very hard to predict where things will go are you saying there may be some risk haha I'm saying that we don't know the future yet there may be some risk well yeah I think there is a lot of risk yes as unfortunately some people in balance I found out this week or
