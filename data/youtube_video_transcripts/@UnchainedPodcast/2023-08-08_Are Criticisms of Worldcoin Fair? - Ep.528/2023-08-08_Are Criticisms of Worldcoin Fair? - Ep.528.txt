me world coin developed with the goal of Distributing Universal basic income to all eight billion people on the planet and in order to do that it needed to solve the problem of personhood which is a way of detecting whether some or the entity I guess that is being transacted with is a person versus an AI or some other kind of Bot and I wondered how it was that this was decided that this goal of universal basic income should be a goal for Humanity right so actually Universal based income was uh I think it was a motivation for Sam personally right because I said Sam Altman Sam Altman right Sam Altman because uh he's been interested in universities basic income since many many years and also he believes that AI is going to put us in a position where we can actually do these things at a meaningful scale right so like he actually believes that something will change about the world uh compared to now meaning AI will become increasingly powerful and you will have a couple of entities that produce a lot of value that we can distribute but that was not uh it was one of the potential outcomes of Rocklin it was not one of kind of the main founding purpose of what kind the main funding purpose of what kind was creating a financial Network that is truly inclusive based on proof of personnel with the goal of kind of onboarding actually billions of people with the hope that it will accelerate many of the things that crypto as an industry and as a space has tried to do in kind of a shortened time frame because we think it's important for the world so since your launch which was very recently I'm sure you have been feeling that you've been in the hot seat because you have been so we're going to go through some of the different criticisms that I've seen that have popped up and one of them is pretty recent shortly before we started recording Oriel Ohan of Zengo published a video showing that his colleague was able to make a world coin transaction from Orioles account simply by using Orioles pin code so assuming that Uriel and his colleague don't have the same exact Iris why was that transaction not rejected because the protocol is designed to not reject that transaction so essentially um the protocol has a roadmap as any protocol uh ever ever does right um and one of the things that will have to be implemented for the protocol is re-authentication so essentially making sure that you as a user you're still the same holder of the same road ID as you go forward and that will work with um kind of local on your phone stored face data so it's like face ID essentially but the really valuable thing is not that the valuable thing is that we can distribute proof of unique humanness kind of credentials to everyone and it will be very very valuable to people so I don't think they will actually start trading that that's a that's a concern that is there right now and I understand it but it is that's how the system is designed and we are very publicly about that like I guess I'm not following so yes I thought the whole premise was to prove that you are this unique individual but you guys launched when the technology doesn't require that that you can just bypass that with a pin code is that it sounds like that's what you're saying well that's not what I'm saying uh so what I'm saying is you as a user um you you get a credential when you verify with an orb about your proof of personnel and you can use that online you can verify in different sources with serenology proofs that that you actually are verified with your world ID but yes right now it's not used in World coin like World coin doesn't use it you're saying that you can use that online but but you don't use it no we also use that so like when you when you claim your raw coin tokens you also use a world ID of course so like whenever you do that use your raw Daddy but to to transact in the tokens you don't use that no you don't need to use it there that's right I know but why wouldn't you because then what if somebody then just steals your PIN code and then they take all your money so these are two very different things right like you actually have um let's say use the world app which is non-costary wallet you actually have two things you have your normal ethereum wallet and then you have your world ID credentials which are two different things so uh actually World ID is not connected to your financial transaction data or anything like that for many reasons and most of them are privacy related so these are two different problems essentially right so you can receive a real kind these are erc20 tokens they will arrive in your wallet and it's a normal ethereum wallet and then you have also your world ID that you can use to verify online so in the future so when people receive their world coin it will be based on that proof of personhood and that is what that's used for but transactions with an ethereum wallet although in this case it is the world coin wallet but still any wallet they're they're separate from the proof of personhood they're not meant to be linked and and they'll never be linked is that the case that's correct yeah that's the case so so essentially what do you have it's like what world ID is it is essentially like a separate key a public private key pair that you then use to issue zero knowledge proofs to different services so you remain anonymous to those services and one good example is actually let's say Twitter uh so Elon was very public about the fact that uh botswold Twitter X and the only way to solve that is that you actually every user has to pay a monthly amount he might have different incentives to say that because he just wants to increase his revenue of course but however this will be a real problem and it will be a real problem not only for x or for Twitter but also for meta and many other services and so then you can use your world ID to prove uh that you're an actual like you have your world ID that basically gives rate limiting to the whole system and solves that problem okay so it truly is I guess designed for that Universal basic income it's like you can receive and people will know that you are a human on the receiving end but all the other stuff is okay okay so I think this is like probably a misconception based on uh what it seems like the system should be one other thing I was curious about is I couldn't find any evidence that iPhones use Iris scanners um apparently some Samsung phones do but I didn't see anywhere saying that iPhones use that um Apple's support page just says quote face ID recognizes if your eyes are open and your attention is directed toward the device so does World coins Iris scanning verification does that work on an iPhone no so essentially um that's the whole point that's why we had to build Hardware um from the ground up that's why we had to build the orb is when you use your iPhone when you use face ID what face ID does it just recognizes that you're the same person again using the phone so you're still Laura and you want to use your phone right now and there's some some embedding stored on the phone uh face ID takes a scan of your face says okay this is also Laura those two things matches and then you can use your iPhone and that's other than fraud it's very easy to do because it's very hard for me to look exactly like you however for proof of personhood uh however if a proof of personhood or anyone that actually wants to solve their problem what you have to do is you have to compare one user against everyone else so it's not Laura against Laura but it's Laura against a billion other users let's say and you need much much more information about that comparison otherwise the error rate so like how many mistakes you make in that comparison will be so big that the whole system collapses and that is actually the hardest problem to solve and that's that that's why the orb so you essentially you go to an orb if you verify it takes a picture of your face and also of your eye and takes essentially all the kind of all the information that is in there calculates a unique embedding and hash and Compares it against everyone else and if that is the case on your phone you receive a world ID you will be able to recover a new world ID if you lose access to that phone and you can then use the raw ID to verify yourself online however when you use then your phone and user already on your phone we don't need the IRS anymore you only need the address once to issue that original pair overall ID so that checks uniqueness and afterwards the only thing that you have to check is that's still the same user is holding the account which is what the first question was referred to which right now is not the case so let me let me try to restate all that to make sure that I understood so you do the scan and that verifies that it's Unique in the database it then creates I guess it's a zero knowledge proof correct okay and so the zero knowledge proof is then what is used later on to verify it's not the actual Iris however one thing that's curious to me is so then when I so so then just restate the part about how your phone um verifies that that you because I guess what the the you know as I'm sure you're aware there was this black market that popped up where people were selling World coin credentials so I think that's the missing step it's like you know people expect that when they're using their device that the device is checking that their Iris or or whatever the hash of it matches the one in the database or well I think it's maybe not it yeah so two things um so quickly on that on the black market I think it was like this was just clearly a very juicy headline to use because I think that I was like black black market for biometric data or something that is actually not what is happening here I was like you're not so first stating what exactly happened is you had um users in countries where rolled coin is not active and so they cannot participate which was mostly China and they essentially bought login credentials from other markets where Vulcan is active which was Portugal Nairobi in Kenya uh India and that by the way most of that actually happened before the token was live because the users uh they didn't have a clear value that could attach to the real coin however what that does is you essentially you sell your login so you sell let's say your email address and your your password however what you as the user will be able to do is you will just be able to recover your welcome by showing up uh world edit by showing back up to an orb again and then what that means is that the let's say the person China that acquired the login credentials they just acquired something that is completely useless because the login doesn't work anymore right so that's the that's actually what happened and yes you're right in that sense that um identity space people called it continuity so I own a world ID and without going to an orb again I can still show that I still use the same sample.e similar to face ID which is what you just referred to with Iris scanning or something like that however for that you will not need so this is this is not implemented right now it's on the roadmap it's going to be probably there in in in three to six months you don't need Iris verification for that step anymore but what happens is the orb takes also a picture of your face signs that and sends that locally to your phone so you actually have self-custody of that and then with your local phone camera you you prove that you are still the same person so very similar face ID but that's again the one-to-one comparison problem which is pretty easy to solve um so sorry this is like pretty technical uh but yeah wow so it makes sense but so basically um there's more than one type of verification one more than correct sorry there's more than one biometric type of verification one is the IRS and the other is your face and you do the face because that's how the iPhone works we will do that so that's not that's not implemented right that's actually right and that's the much easier problem so that um what people call that is kind of the uniqueness check and then re-authentication and so your face ID is doing a re-authentication and that's also going to come for welcome at some point and that's what you just refer to yes will that be used to transact or no is it still only to receive okay yes yes so to receive a real coin button also to use your world ID online um so for example if you want to verify to Twitter you will then re-authenticate with your face at some point got it so but something that's confusing to me is that MIT technology review did a critical piece on what world Quinn was up to about a year ago and one of the things they noted was that in some of the fine print you were saying that you were going to collect information like high-res images of users body face and eyes including users irises and that it would also you would also conduct quote contactless Doppler radar detection of your heartbeat breathing and other Vital Signs and then later the the link where you know this this was was I think it was changed because I couldn't find that text on the new version I found it on on the older version so I thought that like basically that you weren't taking the information but now you're saying that you are actually taking that information well I mean this is to be very honest what happened here it wasn't over enthusiastic lawyer that just like added this the section to agbs um and so we removed it because it doesn't have to be there so right now I'd be very favorable coin the default is that we do not store any data you can essentially say you opt and you help us with training the models but you don't have to and actually uh the minority of users actually do that so that's also something that was not there a year ago to be clear because like a year ago we were in early beta so there was actually more data transferred back then uh because the features were just not live but as of today there is no data collected which was always the statement always the statement was like post-launch you don't have like it's going to be privacy preserving you don't have to uh transmit any data okay however it is you are still taking people's face so that later on that can be used via the phone so that is no we are we so for first of all this is not implemented right now right again so this is going to be a future is this going to be a future feature and we will not take the data but rather the orb is going to send it locally to your phone and it's going to be in self-custody with your phone and then you can do that to prove Sim launch proofs again so it's like this is actually like really cool Tech and it's I know it's confusing because most people never interact with these things but it actually is kind of very cool privacy preserving identity Services uh that are going to be built here so is that clear like do you understand what I meant with we actually do not receive or have to receive that face data it's because you're taking it with the orb but then you just generate the hash and you immediately delete the data or something like like that is that correct no the face embedding so that's also correct but that's for the using this check but for the face comparison piece uh the embedding is going to be created and then going to be sent to the user's phone and then use the user you hold it on your phone in self-custody so there's no centralized database of that data essentially right right which is I guess how our phones work correct right like apple doesn't have yeah sure yes correct that's exactly how facility Works yes that would be crazy if Apple had all these um facial scans but anyway yeah correct so it really is like face ID okay and then I wanted to go back to the black market you said that you had cut that off so how did you do that so people can't just sell the credentials I mean they still can it's just that they don't do that anymore that much because now the token is live and so the incentive is is low right because it's it's much more profitable to just be a Vulcan user and actually receive your airdrop than to sell that to someone who doesn't have access to your account so that's I think that's that's the major reason why it happens way less there's of course like a lot of security measures that are alive now that make it harder but then also we are very clear in our white paper that right now that kind of credential trading it can happen there's nothing that fundamentally prevents that from happening the only thing that fundamentally would prevent that is what we just talked about is that face ID feed like feature however um the protocol is already very useful the way it is so it's like yes that's that's a limitation and we're very clear about those limitations there's like even a whole section of white paper that just talks about limitations and there's 10 of them that we're aware of um and that's one of them okay I mean I guess the thing is that it's not really solved if someone is because the countries that are banned from this are countries where either speculation is a really popular activity or that are ones that are kind of wealthy so like the United States and China China's I I think even more speculative than the US the US's wealthy country so I think that if anybody's willing to pay enough for the credentials then they can just compete with whatever the market price is right so right so so two things one is I did not say that that's the fundamental thing preventing and I just said that's why it's happening way less the fundamental thing that is preventing it is two things it is uh recovery so essentially you as a user you sell your credentials to someone in China let's say like for a hundred dollars because it's more than you would receive through Walker let's say then you as a a person in Portugal or in Spain where there's actually orbs you can sell that to the person China for a hundred dollars you receive hundred dollars and then you can just go back to an orb and recover your account and that person in China will hold something that is worthless so essentially you as like you us like us use you can actually fraud the fraudster uh so you have this like that's something that is pretty common in kind of incentive design so I think that's that's that's that's the number one feature and then the second thing is uh the face ID piece because uh then that person in China would also need that face embedding locally certain on their phone which they will not have so there's always there and there will always be ways to throughout the system if you pay enough money for that uh it's just gonna be increasingly hard every identity system has that it's like you can even fraud the European identity system or the US government at any system you can purchase Social Security numbers if you pay a couple thousand dollars so the only thing is recovery needs to every authentication needs to work and that's it will take time it will not be perfect definitely within the next 12 months but the most important problem is solved and the most important problem is uniqueness and that's something where so many others have failed before okay so now let's actually talk a little bit more about that MIT technology review article because something that you know did seem a little bit alarming is I'm sure you're well aware it started with a description of one of these days where um you know the world coin orb was in this one Village and it was getting people's irises and the person that they interviewed had heard about it just as a way to get free money essentially didn't really seem to know anything else about it um and I wondered you know why it was that world coin has focused so much on Distributing and scanning irises in poor countries I mean you know as we saw in the article like sometimes many of these people didn't even have email addresses so they're not like you know crypto natives that you know are already familiar with this kind of thing right so that definitely was a very like I think it was very unbalanced reporting in that sense that actually the the whole like worldcon actually started in Berlin like all the initial signups happened in literally Berlin me walking with an orb and the team walking with orbs through Berlin so this is actually how it started and afterwards came Sweden and Norway and uh all of this was during code by the way so like traveling was like super super hard however it's called royal coin so we wanted to make sure it actually works everywhere so we also uh signed up or kind of actually test the technology in places like Nairobi Indonesia uh and and kind of countries because it's the whole I think it's a big piece of crypto right the whole idea of crypto was to build a decentralized financial system that works for everyone and it should work in the United States and it should work in other places in the world too so that's that's that's the one piece of course back then the company and the project was like super super early and there's many things that should not have happened but to the other point that you just raised which is like okay these people are not crypto native and whatever they might not understand like everything fully I don't think that's a bad thing and I think that's that's like how crypto actually will become mainstream right it's that I think is actually a good thing it's not a bad thing so it's like of course operators and everyone on the field is now trained to explain things much much better and there's like a lot of quality controls and and things like that in place that have not been in place a year ago but even if you do everything perfect the average person will not understand how ethereum works and how like crypto Works in detail or like what's your knowledge proofs are or what decentralized Computing is all of those things are things that by itself are very niche and so yeah that's a short comment on that well I mean it it definitely seems though um that a big percentage of the people in those countries the more developing ones they didn't really understand what they were doing when they were getting their irises scanned and even though you know we we can have this high level discussion around like you guys aren't keeping the data it's using this hash blah blah like I mean there's even risks around the zero knowledge proof hashes like you know apparently Quantum Computing is a risk at some point in the future to that so like do you feel that people really understood what what the trade-offs were or or kind of what risk they were taking when they were getting their irises scanned so so first of all I literally did Quantum Computing before worldcoin and it's again it's one of those things that it's like very easy to say and like sounds very futuristic but we are very far from Quantum Computing being as challenged as your knowledge proves and if they actually are there's ways to react to that so this is not like an actual concern right now second again there's many things back then that probably work did not work the way I would want them to work or like the project would want to have to work it was a very early state of the project and it was during code it's really hard to travel even so that's for sure I definitely want to want to say that I'm definitely sure if you would ask people that use or signed up for worldcoin back then they could not explain you fully with rockliners and they think that's fine that's not going to change like if you actually want to aim for a billion users this is not going to change and I think the same is true for actually there's like a very and people will hate me for this comment uh but I think it's a very valid one is the fact that for example transactions on ethereum are fully transparent like I apply around the world I talk to many many people many people are first-time crypto users most first-time crypto users that actually use a wallet and kind of get ethereum or or even Bitcoin and want to make transactions they just do not understand that and do not understand the trade-off they do with that which is like very major right that's not privacy preserving so the whole Space has a lot of problems like that still so I think it's unfair if you hold me accountable to the fact that like people don't understand how crypto works because I think that's the case for all of us it's the case for a large piece of the of the space I mean I think what you're referring to is all the people who used Silk Road early on and then later realized that actually maybe um they're sort of like illicit purchases could be traced back to them no no I I don't mean that I literally mean you go to Argentina to Buenos Aires you talk to users that are people that just downloaded a crypto wallet many of the famous crypto wallets that we know and use it to to do things with it and you ask them like do you understand what you're doing here do you understand like all the trade-offs they're not able to explain you that because how how would they be able to explain you that it's a very complicated construct all of it like if they're using usdt or something or is that what you're saying or I don't know what you're saying right so you literally you go to Buenos Aires you talk to a first-time crypto user downloaded wallet that's just for example say coinbase the coinbase wallet or or even rainbow like you're more creative one I don't I don't care just like any wallet and a use case there is of course that they use stable coins that's that's a major use case in countries who have high inflation and you ask them do you understand kind of what what actually happens on the back end do you understand all the trade-offs that happen here when you send uh stable coins um usdc or something to your friends or use it to pay that all of that is transparent that they don't that's what I mean okay well so it's similar to The Silk Road thing I was saying the transparency all right so in a moment we're gonna yeah in a moment we'll dive into other aspects of the world coin project but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible join over 10 000 attendees for this year's biggest crypto event at token 2049 Singapore on

compromise Propel your project and Community forward by visiting arbitrim.io today back to my conversation with Alex um one other you know point that I wanted to bring up from that MIT technology review article um you know it really is about that you know aspect that in those countries people are kind of they can be in a really difficult economic situation and really um you know Financial incentive is something that is very strong for them because they don't have a lot of ways to make money or at least certain parts of those populations and you know it looks like um this notion that they could get quote-unquote free money was a big draw and um there were even incidents where like a workshop at a high school in Indonesia was billed as teaching students about cryptocurrency but uh some you know and I guess a reporter who attended saw that it mostly was focused on onboarding them into the world Coin App getting their Biometrics scanned it said even one of the participants was 15 years old so you know what like you said that now you're you would do things differently so what are you doing to prevent situations like these look this is a over one year old article as the company was in series a stage and I will not enjoy dwelling more in the past here like if that's what you want to do I will not enjoy doing that that's for sure um well but but you said that you've you you know aren't doing those things now so how are you not well I mean there there's many so so like okay just to give you a very simple example a year ago or this was actually like longer like one one and a half years ago um the project was very very small very like 20 people it was a series a stage project and we just closed their series a uh there was essentially no one with experience on on the ground operations working in the project right and so all of the decentralized um Workforce products that you use in your daily life like Airbnb or Uber or even kind of scooter project slime they are full of similar challenges all right there's like a lot of things going wrong with Ubers there's a lot of things going wrong with airbnbs every day and so essentially what um these companies do is they have like a very very strong operational team that reacts on spot has like quality controls has protocols to react to certain things and to kind of actually ensure the quality of things and these are all the things that we also went through and we we hired many people of these companies these projects and they built these protocols within the project that does not mean these things will not happen these things will happen for sure as it scales to a billion people there's like no way around that it's just uh that the confidence will increase like does it make sense basically as it becomes more adopted and people become more comfortable with it and you codify your own processes is that what you mean I'm just saying like we as a project we just implemented many many processes to to ensure that these things do not happen I'm saying as we scale up things like that will happen it's almost unavoidable for anything that gets 2 billion people scale the same way as like things happen with Airbnb that should not happen but they still happen just like the the scale of things and the scale of the operation and so that's that's the same here really so at the same time European Regulators are scrutinizing World coin Regulators in France and Germany have announced that they're investigating and I wondered did worldcoin look into how your project could comply with gdpr rules and if so do you believe that it does so well I very strongly believe it does so we're working with the German regulator in Bavaria for quite a long time now this is like a long back and forth as you can imagine but given we actually started the company in in airlock in Germany we are regulated by the Bavarian gdpr which is like one of the strictest agencies I think in the world to do that so we will continue to work with them and answer all open questions again like the Privacy guarantees here are like very very extreme so wait are you do you mean world coin or do you mean gdpr the extreme which is Extreme actually both things are extreme like I think the the Bavarian data protection authority is one of the strictest ones in the world at least that's what people say and that's at least what kind of people that work in that space or in the industry say uh and we are regulated by them and we work with them end up saying the Privacy guarantees by real coin are like much more than all the things you actually usually like when you use Google login you don't have those privacy guarantees right so I think I do understand the initial reaction given its Biometrics and it's Iris and all those things like sound very uh very strong and I understand initial gut reaction I actually had the same when I started working in the project but it is just fundamentally privacy preserving it's open source so it's like you can check those things for yourself and you cannot do that for all the other things that you use okay and while we're just talking about different Regulators Kenya also suspended World coin in its country because as Reuters reported quote the government was concerned with World coins activities and agencies will probe how it intends to use the data it gathers what's your response to Kenya's suspension of worldcoin well there's a lot of things happening in Kenya actually like the the demand surge in Kenya was very very extreme last week so we had like long long lines uh in front of orbs and I think it even it even led to the fact that like traffic could not run probably in in some spaces so like it was very very extreme uh the same as in Japan and Tokyo for example we had similar situations or in Hong Kong or in Singapore so we just like all over last week we had this like huge huge spike in app downloads and people verifying so there's like a lot of attention right now on the project of course as you know that's why we have this conversation in the same history in Kenya so in Canada there's multiple there's like a whole I actually have a briefing about this after this interview um but there is different agencies pursuing different things we actually will hold uh we will hold operation until that is resolved and work with them but there's a lot of users in Kenya that would really want us to resume so let's see I cannot be more specific at this point when you talk about those long lines um due to the launch of the coin I I do think it goes back to that free money issue earlier right it's like people want to do this to get free money why do you think this works in Tokyo why do you think this works on like in the richest area in Tokyo like how how does that fit like I said because people are incentivized by free money right right but like there's airdrops all over crypto like why is that fundamentally a bad thing it's like it's a very low I think because if you ask it it's like a very loaded question I want to understand why it is I I think because the link to biometric data like I guess you know something that I wondered was you to understand there is no link to biometric data like that's another thing we covered in this podcast well they're the the biometric data is being used to generate the hash so it is the basis for something it's not like the raw data but I guess this leads to another question I had which is like why is there a world coin token I don't understand why the the hash can't be used as an nft or a soul-bound token or something like that like I don't understand why why do you have the world coin token um for for a lot of different reasons uh many of them that I think you you cover in many other crypto projects like it's a major step that is actually required for decentralization it will be important for governance also Central coin certainly around incentive alignment so the um It incentivizes signups that's what is happening and that's entirely as it was designed to happen and then also this was one of the initial motivations like actually when we started working in the project or when Sam pitched me the project initially the idea was okay how can we create a network of over a billion people that actually use crypto in their daily life and one of the key forces of that is of course you have to have a token and so I'm very very excited about raw coin The Rock and token becoming the widest distributed token then down the road which I think is also something you have covered many many times before is as a project like this becomes increasingly useful and the utility increases over time you need a way to actually make the network itself so it's self-sustaining so there is not a normal path to revenue here there's no like there's no company that sells anything to a customer uh in that sense right it's like I run a company it's called for Humanity and we are one of the contributors but Royal coin itself has to be a protocol itself that stands on its own the same way as ethereum stands on its own because whenever people use ethereum they have to pay fees for each transaction right and so that's how the whole thing stands on its own and the same will be true for worldcoin as well as people use World ID and as people will use uh World app at some point the governance can decide to engage fees in that and that will sustain the protocol okay it's it's the it's the normal answer so it'll be to decentralize allow for governance and have the community control the protocol correct so if that's the case then I think people also have been wondering about the the distribution of the token Supply because you know currently insiders will be getting 25 of the supply and you know there's there is a short lockup but the way you know this is designed basically it does look like Founders and investors could exit pretty early with not too much risk and I wondered what your response is to those kinds of criticisms so so first of all actually let's be clear about what is in place because I think what is in place is like it's much stronger than pretty much every other crypto project that you know uh in that sense that 25 to investors and kind of to team is actually a very very low number given we had to produce Hydro devices and all those things like most of the other protocols that you you covered here have much much higher pre-allocations so it was actually very very hard to even get to that place because right now Rolf gun is kept a fancy thing and everyone talks about that but three years ago it was not at all obvious and raising money for that was like really really hard and even getting to 25 percent I think almost two times really risked the project so it's like it's it was not an easy thing to do that's the first thing then second what is in place is like it's a one-year lock up and then a two-year linear unlock schedule so like for one year no investor can sell any tokens and then for two years linearly they unlock and that is also uh more strict than most projects do and then to your judgment about like I mean all of your questions are pretty loaded so I will now load them too is to your judgment about risk and and whatever it's like we work on this project now for four years uh investors invested in this project when they knew we have to build a hardware device for more than 50 million dollars uh with a team of 20 people and we need to just root it globally so it really was a high risk uh project invest in for eign Capital funding covered that right right but I'm saying like they took a lot of risk like Venture capitalists took a lot of risk to fund that project much more so than as usual here that's what I'm saying their payoff will be if the if the token succeeds and the token only succeeds if the protocol succeeds so like if the whole thing actually works which is a very like it's a it's a big bet all right and I'm sure you've heard this other criticism which is around the fact that the token was launched as a low float coin which um derogatorily is often called a Sam coin after Sam Pickman freed um because oftentimes tokens he would back would only release a tiny percentage into circulation at launch which led to a lot of speculation it also would create this sort of inflated fully diluted value market cap and that's kind of like a pump and dump-ish design and I understand there's this one year lockup Etc but but why was this the method chosen the you know initial low float there it's it's actually very very simple it's like you launch a token and you want to give ownership in into that to billions of people ideally everyone that's the whole goal of the project so there's one million sign ups or that was 1.5 million times or so at launch so how does it make sense that there should be like more than five percent or something circulating at launch like it just is not what this project is about and it clearly is not a pump a dump because there's nothing for us to dump there's nothing for us to pump like we don't have any incentive to do that so yeah I think it's just that's the mission of the project I understand the initial reaction to that and we actually expected a reaction beforehand but it really is the best way to launch this project I think there's this other big big thing of course that uh the circulating Supply is increasing very very quickly right now and it will so over the next year because each user that signs up gets a decent amount of raw coin right so it is a reasonable concern for a couple of weeks let's say but I think the next time you know we'll talk it's not going to be a concern anymore and then I saw Sam Pinkman fried in three arrows Capital were investors in World coin so are they do they now own some of that 25 or what happened to their shares well I mean yes they do uh as SPF was like a super small check in the series a I think 3ac was actually more more decent in series and series B uh and so the litigators now on these tokens and as I'm sure you're aware that's the case for pretty much every large crypto project at that point because either SPF or 3ac invested in pretty much all of them so this was just not foreseeable back then and when you said the litigators but did you mean Liquidators a liquidator sorry not litigator right okay huge but important difference so earlier in the conversation you mentioned that when Sam Altman first approached you about working on this project that you initially also had kind of in averse reaction so I wanted to hear your Evolution how did you go from being a skeptic to not only being a Believer but now the leader of the project before I joined I was doing I was doing physics so I was I was doing deep learning AI in physics in Caltech in Los Angeles and I just randomly got this email about real coin initially for Max which was the other co-founder so Sam and Max already started working the project like six months prior and in that email there was just hey we're looking for software engineers and here's a quick description of the project and the project it was like it was like a two-pager very very high level description of um what rolecon is trying to do so my initial start was actually as an interview for a software engineer this was I initially got in contact with raw coin and then I had this interview with Sam I had many interviews with Max and kind of everyone surrounding that and then decided to join however convinced them that I should be co-founder given kind of I became friends with both of them quite quite quickly the founding team joined which was a lot of my my friends and very incredibly important and so then we started working on that and what I meant here is two things is like one the idea just sounded crazy because obviously this is like it's very very novel it's it's very very ambitious and it really is uh there there's not much in between outcomes is like it clearly is a moonshot and that's something that you really encounter and all the other options I had were like working on Quantum Computing let's say with uh with Google or stay in research or I don't know work work and Ai and some some companies so like all the other choices I had were like very kind of settled jobs that put probably pay me really well after some time and then making the decision to join Brooklyn felt like really crazy back then but um then the second thing is okay like for the first year or the first eight nine months all we did is really we've researched how to implement proof of personnel and we talked to many many people in the space we talked to many researchers we built many prototypes and essentially we went through this whole cycle of implementing network of trust uh kind of implementations which is sounds very promising it sounds very very cool essentially that there's 20 people and we all know each other and so we can verify each other that we're actually real human beings with some and then they have like some clever math behind it to weight that with some confidence so we implemented all these kind of um all of these major implementations we went to a face we went fingerprint uh we tried to build it on top of kyc so government identities and these were the three big things so Network web of trust biometrics and build it on top of kyc and kyc was a terrible idea for a lot of reasons because it's I think it's the antidote to what crypto actually is trying to do but then also it's not at all inclusive so you really could not do that web of trust things can become promising once you have a large number of verified users with something like World ID that you can build it on top of but it's really really impossible to bootstrap and so we threw it away too and then within Biometrics we came to this like heart inside that we cannot use phones and we cannot use fingerprints or face because of kind of the uniqueness requirement is just not fulfilled if you even go to building users and so we had to go with Iris recognition which is the only thing that actually works on that scale then it's it's proven that it works um and you can implement it privacy preserving of certain launch proofs and of course my first reaction was like holy this is gonna sound like very very scary uh but then also it's the it's the only way to implement a really really important problem uh so we we went ahead and took the hit and I think as we saw in this podcast it's it still hits it's like it obviously it sounds it sounds crazy and it sounds uh like a privacy violation initially so you really need to understand the technology to understand why it's not concerning and I had that same reaction that's that's what I meant yeah and so you know I try to go through all the major criticisms I've seen that people have had um but now you have this opportunity here getting hit from all sides if you just want to leave The Listener with one last message about world coin um or you know what you're working on or what it will be you know rolling out what is it what would you want to say criticism will come and go it is obviously very very important that we take it we take it really really serious of course I think the important note to listener is like please actually read the materials or try to understand it at least before you come to conclusion because I understand that their first reaction might be uh oh this is like crazy or this is like super ambitious or it's it sounds like a privacy nightmare all of those things like before you come to those conclusions like actually try to understand what is happening here that's the first thing and the other thing is I hope and I do believe that it will become increasingly evident that a royal kind will become a very very powerful technology that we will need in a time in which AI is becoming increasingly powerful which is going to happen the next couple years almost definitely at this point and if you only come from the crypto background the growth that we see right now in terms of we're over a million monthly active users now and we did not even try because we were pre-launch but now we will try it's like this will be probably the major onboarding to crypto that is going to happen and it is important to all of us that this goes in the right way and so please engage with us if we try to be incredibly open about everything it's like for example about the token launcher even the market maker agreements were public and so with all the criticism just stick with the positive and let's implement this because I think it's going to be very very important all right well where can people learn more about you and worldcoin follow us on Twitter uh Follow Me Sam real coin on Twitter and otherwise just check out the white paper which is arguably very long it's like 150 pages so
