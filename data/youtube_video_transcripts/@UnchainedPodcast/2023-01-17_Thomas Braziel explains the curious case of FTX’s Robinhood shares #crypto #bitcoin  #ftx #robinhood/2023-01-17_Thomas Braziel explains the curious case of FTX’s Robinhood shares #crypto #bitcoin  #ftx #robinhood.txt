the US government's probably going to want to pound the flesh I mean they're talking about holding them as part of a civil or criminal forfeiture and what that means is that they those assets will be if if he signs the plea agreement they'll be they'll first of all as the criminal trial is going on they're going to sit on those assets so it could be literally I don't know a few years while going through his criminal trial and they're holding on to the assets and only then only after that will he potentially sign a civil civil forfeiture which only then will each estate have to make a claim on the Civil forfeiture so it could be years before those shares have gotten back it was kind of interesting to think about in terms of uh for Robin Hood I mean it's kind of a big risk now because who knows maybe Robin Hood ends up going to zero in five years or who knows maybe four x's and instead of 400 million it's 1600 million and then Sam has he wants the residual they want their loan and then the estate wants their property back so it'll be interesting how the spoils are split
