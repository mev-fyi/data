be here finance seems to have come out of nowhere to become the world's top crypto to crypto exchange but in a way it was actually years in the making describe how you learned about Bitcoin started working in the space and eventually came the launch finance sure so I first came across Bitcoin in 2013 I think around September ish that's when my friend Bobby Lee he used to be the CEO of BTC China he introduced me to Bitcoin and hazing investor runs how both of them a good friend of mine I looked into it and then I went to a conference in Las Vegas at the in December 2013 and that's when I really after that conference I quit my job I'm gonna do this full-time and what were you doing at that time so I was only I was running about I was running my other startup that I've been with at that point for eight years so six partners the company still there but I just said I want to I actually wanted to run a Bitcoin exchange with as part of that startup but the other partners were not interested so I said that's fine and I'm gonna this I know I'm just gonna do blog Channel what we called Bitcoin industry it back then for time so I just said I'm gonna leave that's it and that startup was actually focused on doing trading software is that correct yes what we call ultra-low latency trading at ul ul here and so at that point I know you started working in this space what were you doing and how did you eventually come to lodge finance yeah so the previous startup were doing we're providing ultra-low latency trading software for mostly invest top investment banks all the top global like the names you know like Morgan Stanley JP Morgan Deutsche Bank or use our system but it's a very niche high-frequency trading tool for for those guys I've been working in the financial trading space trade the trading technology space world my entire career so but when I discovered Bitcoin I just knew that was the future so I just said I just gotta be doing something in this space and I left with a left my previous job without having knowing what to do next but I know where I want to be so and so you eventually went to I think you started working at blockchain dot info right yes yes so yes I bumped into Roger very in Tokyo in end of end of December early January 2014 and then we talked and I think at that time blockchain Torian for was just a founder Ben reefs and Nicholas Carey who joined like a couple months earlier so I was the third person to join so yeah so and blocked and out in for head upgrade or build up by one 22 year old at the time and then a lot of users very key feedback very good community reputation so I was very lucky to be able to join that company and then you went to okay coin yes so blockchain taught info is focused on mostly a wallet and a block an explorer so my back one has more add more experiencing trading systems and exchanges so okay coin was I was talking with my now co-founder hurry she was actually joined okay calling a couple months before I did and she said well like all your experiences are in trading systems why don't you join us as an exchange and we talked about it for a little bit I started with a pretty good opportunity and blushing dot info was growing very quickly at that time as well and they were getting venture funding from the US and the team grow to be a larger size I just said well it's probably better ok coin at the time looks like a better fit for me so I so I joined ok coin yeah and what were you doing there and then how did you eventually launch finance so yeah I was the CTO of ok ok coin and I was also helping them with an international side because out of the three co-founders myself I II and the CEO I was the more sort of a international one but then we had a few culture differences my backgrounds more international more west and I would say almost us-centric where there's a lot of like I would say different styles thinking a different style of value systems so that didn't really go well I I just thought that was not a that was not gonna work long term so I left just under a year and then actually after I left ok corner actually started a different technology company with two of my other friends and then we were doing trading says we were doing exchange platforms as a cloud solution for other exchanges there were about 2,000 cultures exchanges in China at the time and we were providing systems for a number of those so we were just a system provider so we built we build us with the other system from scratch from early 2000 2015 yes and then when - started well we took it there was two and a half years of development on the system that's already happened so - as platform was not building one month yeah yeah and just to go back to how you were saying before that your back is more Western as far as I understand I think you moved to Canada when you were a teenager right and then you went to college in Canada and worked in New York and stuff like that yeah yeah so I was born in China and then I moved to Canada when I was a teenager when I was 12 and I spent high school human Kreuger and University in Montreal and I did an internship in Tokyo as a summer job and then when I graduated the same company gave me the offer that I couldn't get a better one so I went back to Tokyo I really liked Tokyo so I worked in Tokyo for four years and then when T New York work also worked in New York for four years and then went back to Shanghai in 2005 and then worked for eight years in the previous startup that I mentioned before and then then the rest of history connects so the story about finance is sort of incredible you heard about icos at a potluck on June 14th 2017 had the white paper written in both English and Chinese within three days after that you began your an IC o---- nine days after that then you wrapped it up a week later and had 15 million dollars in the bank then within five months you turned by Nance into the world's number one crypto exchange I heard that at one point you guys had 240,000 new users in one hour I heard that it took you three months to get to 120,000 uses another three to get to 1 million and then one week after that to reach two million correct any of this if any of that's wrong how did you handle this you know explosive growth in this really fast pace yeah I think endo is the right word I think we were just lucky at the right time doing the right thing so like most of this stuff happened to us not that's something we actually tried or wanted to do so I think basically we were just we was very lucky for us that we had the system ready to be able to handle that growth near last December early January the other stuff was more random chance I learned about ISIL around last April may ish I heard about the word ICO but I never participated in more I never read any white papers I saw again I saw another friend of mine doing a ICO right in front of my eyes early June to like I think it was May 30th June 9th and hey trace 15 million dollars u.s. within ten days and that was at that time that was the largest ICO in China and I know him quite well and I was thinking if we can't do it I probably could duty and given his background given what he what he has done given his experience reputation so I was thinking maybe I have a good chance as well and then I talked to Donna Lee the founder of Neil and now ontology so he was very he was very very encouraging and that potluck dinner on June 14th intern do in China last year everyone's like I didn't I see all you gotta do now I see oh they founder of MC o monarch now they rebranded to crypto calm he was there he was doing his ICO he said look he he only took him 15 days and he's still raising but he's already reached like 13 14 million dollars his target was 20 he's like his preparation was only eight days he said no look he can do it so so you kind of environment I said okay fine and I had a team already it so we I had a team of 30-something people from the from the technologies provider startup so we had a team and it's an international team as well so we had we had what we call native English speakers we had a larger number of them so we just said look let's start a Google Doc write both versions at the same time and we changed the versions which we basically gonna sleep very much during those two or three weeks yeah and and then once you launch how did you handle that massive growth like in five months what were those like what were some of the kind of crazy moments during that period oh man there's so many crazy moments but um initially our growth was okay wasn't too bad so initially do the ico stage the growth was so quick that I was little website couldn't handle it was just buying servers buying servers and buying sir but I was doing the ico stage once we launched the growth actually slowed down a little bit because at that time everybody's chasing ice POS and once we launched we were a small new exchange we didn't have diamond a trading pairs we didn't have that many coins like the the the the growth was actually just average it was just normal and then September came there was a lot of panic there was panic selling and panic buying even when the market goes panic selling goes really way down the wall and picks up right because everyone's trying to sell the trading rolling actually goes up and then the China last September around this time there was a lot of thought or news negative news about China and so we had to move our servers rook so we actually moved our servers from outside China into China first in July because they had a large number of Chinese users and that was a very painful thing and then but in September I told my team look we gotta move we gotta move them back out again and they were like you're crazy now we have a lot more servers they did it they did it overnight and anyway and that was why because of the ban on the crypto exchanges yes so basically there was we have I got increasing a more amount of convincing information that the bank is coming I said okay look that's enough that's basically enough information to make a decision already so I'm gonna make the decision it's a really hard decision but I'm gonna make it I'm gonna ask the team to move it out the team agree the team after some hesitation agreed and we moved it out we move all of our infrastructure out of China a week before the bank came out like the news came out so we actually did it before but I really helped because now we can say look we're no longer in China we move and we were we were moving the team out of out of China as well and we said look that doesn't affect us anymore and and when the China ban happened guess where all the users went or at least all the Chinese users well they they came to buying it but a couple weeks later we got pressure so so so badly we had to restrict the Chinese IPs so we did that and so yeah was just a crazy right there's so many crazy stuff happening and any other crazy moments that you want to mention oh I didn't know how long you want me to go on that but forgive them for Dean during that time the Chinese government asked oh they anybody who issued I CEOs return the coins to the returned it just just do the refund just do the reverse swap and of course our coins okay because the bynars coins now 66x the ico price at that time and so nobody wanted to return it for the original bitcoins so nobody not that many people wanted to return the bynars coin but we facilitated a couple ICS on our platform like five of them and a number of them have dropped below the ICO price and of course for all of those users they all want to get the original BT C's back and we made a very hardcore and the project teams are already spent a little bit of money that can't return the sloman anyway we've made a really tough decision with that okay violence is gonna cover the difference we did a calculation it's gonna cost us about six million u.s. dollars at the time that's a lot of money for us we raised fifteen million dollars we spend a bunch of it already we have a little bit of left in the bank so we got a so you was that was like a large chunk of money for us but we we had a we had a very quick meeting I remember I was I was on I was on a train at outside of China we had a call saying look whatever you need I said let's let's just cover it and so we returned the full amount to all the investors that pass through our platform and that created such huge positive publicity for us in China like every Chinese use like - is the most trusted platform and then when the when the shutdown had when the shutdown or other exchanges happening around September 30th all those users came to us so there was there was a lot of really tough decisions really really really crazy times so we basically made a lot of tough decisions and things worked out okay in the end yeah well yeah we're gonna keep talking about that because I'm really curious about how you do make decisions but one thing I want to ask is so right now how many employees do you have we so I think today or tomorrow we're gonna cross the number three hundred three hundred warriors Oh and how many users do you have I think we just haven't checked for a while but the growth rate have slowed down recently due to the market conditions I think we're a bit north of 10 11 million users okay and there's been a lot of news you know at different points this year about how much you're on track to make in profit this year so right now at the moment what are you protecting I think if we stay at the current rate if nothing goes to too crazy or too low we should target somewhere around 500 to 800 million dollars this year in profit okay all right so yeah then I think that means volumes must be down because earlier some said it could be as high as a billion but maybe you know you've you've seen slower traction on the platform so something else I wanted to ask you about was regulation and this goes back to what I meant about decision-making regulation has been this huge theme in crypto and I was just wondering in general what your philosophy regarding regulation is and you know how you've been approaching it as you've been building the business right right so okay everybody I think well my philosophy on regulation is probably different from many of the what we call the retail investors I think especially the people in the US they seem to be very heavily focused on regulation in the u.s. we are actually really not that focused on the US we're focused on everything else other than the US so in the US that's coinbase and Gemini and a bunch of other exchanges dealing with regulation over there the rest of the world is a bigger market for us so and the regulations differ by different countries and for most countries that we regulate this industry the space that we're in is not very clear yet most of the regulators are admitted they're still learning and adapting and adjusting or creating regulations so it's kind of unchartered territory for most countries and most jurisdictions and we're working very closely with a very large number of them although more it most of the countries we work with are relatively small in terms of population but we what we've found is a smaller countries are much easier to work with in terms of regulations and we can meet with the libraries very senior people and the decision-makers directly and they don't think they are above us or they it's more for cooperative working relationship so but I do you see that the regulations are becoming there's now competitions on who's the who has the most favorable regulations at least in many parts of the world and I think this country's realized that having the more favorable regulation will ensure their long-term success from an economic development point of view so my view is basically we want to work with people who are willing to work with us and it's a very simple simple model where we're not really chasing okay this is the most developed market that's where all the money is we gotta go get those money we're not thinking like that I think if you if you think like that it's gotta be US market China market and wherever else but we're more into okay let's look at this long term let's look at this five 10 20 50 years from now where we're gonna be so let's so that's kind of our view yeah but when you say that you're looking that far in the future then I don't understand how you could imagine that the US and China won't figure in yes No so yes heywhat definitely fit in but those larger countries are harder to navigate from from a regulatory point of view because they they're more complex this to me there's many many different regulatory bodies departments estates or provinces and federal but just they just it's just a very complex environment Lex environment so if you look for so our approach is let somebody else figure it out first so for example in the US let coinbase and Gemini figure it out first they're very strong they got a cultural background they got the connections they got they fully embedded over there so let them figure it out first so long term we will be but we would very much be interested if we can and but I think we're not the most fitted for doing for taking the initiative being the first step in those jurisdictions whereas we are taking the lead in a lot of other jurisdictions such as motifs such as Jersey Bermuda Uganda and other parts of Africa and some parts of Asia so it's it's really more about who takes the lead like now from a regulatory point of view I think the regulations were probably settled within I don't know a year or two to three years so we focus on where we can add more value where we will let other people add value where they can well so I find your philosophy interesting but I guess like to my mind you know some of the things that you're doing are pretty obviously in violation of securities law for instance finances coin B&B is pretty much the definition of a security at least according to US securities law because it's an investment of money and I like that you're laughing in a common enterprise which is finance and the profits of that are dependent on an identifiable party which again is this case is in this case finance so you know you've got that then you've got the fact that finance is probably also likely listing other unregistered securities and so in that regard like do you you know try to have controls to keep us residents from using finance or from buying B&B because I tested this myself and it took me like all of three seconds to create an account on Finance from here in the US right right so I laugh because I think I think that's a very subjective view of what things are and I appreciate that's your view I think that's your view not my view to be honest and probably not shared by most of our most of the community just to clarify multiple sources said to me that they viewed it as a security token combined with you know it because there are other aspects obviously it's a multi-faceted coin but just one is you know it's not only me I discussed us as multiple with multiple people right so the way I view it is basically just because multiple people around the world have a view doesn't mean we all agree but there's no legal definition that is certain coin at least - coins Natalie's not defined legally by anybody as a security many people may think themselves or they may be even a common opinion email may not be okay I think for every person that you find that who thinks that way I can find more people who are not I can find 10 people who thinks otherwise so I think it's a difference in opinion but it's definitely not classified legally or anywhere as far as I know and to be honest even if this classify legally in some countries probably classified differently in other countries and the whole discussion about where their coins are security or not only came some within the last I don't know six months or so before that there wasn't that there wasn't any discussion about whether a crypto coin a ERC 20 coin is or is not a security nobody cared so no no just just for the record I've been discussing this issue with sources since mid 2016 so like people can listen to the podcast I did in September 2016 with coin Center we were we talked about that okay so I mean yeah this is like kind of a known thing but I mean regardless so you know you is it is that why it like I mean do you try to enforce controls to keep US residents from using finance or buying B & B so basically so so far no one has told us that violence coin is a security other than yourself to be honest many people some people may think that but I think the definition of security itself is debated about different parts of the world and I think you are taking a very us centric view and we actually really no no I'm saying it's really the u.s. yeah yes I think yesterday you know after you created your account you probably could not deposit u.s. dollars in all right so you probably not your trade you I would probably guess if you created account yesterday you did not have any finance coins right now am i correct oh yeah no I I didn't go that far it's a it's a very contentious topic but at the end of the day I think the I think you are taking a very us centric view are things where that's a market where we're really not focused on we don't take the US dollars we don't touch US dollars I've never I've purposely avoided doing any promotion attending any events in the US just so that we're not viewed as a US company and we don't activate our target that market yeah well I'm just curious like which would you come to a conference in the US like would you plan to step foot in the u.s. is that something that you're trying to avoid or or do you have no fear I don't think I'm pretty sure I will now get into trouble by going to the US but number one is kind of far number two I don't really want to attract a lot of it I don't really want people to view buying us as a us-centric or focused on the US we really not focus on us we're doing promotions everywhere else other than the US so and to be honest I've actually turned down a lot of interview requests like including Yahoo Finance number of other media outlets in the u.s. were very centric talking about US markets precisely because of this reason because all the questions about us and I'm not an expert I've lived there before I know the market I know the language but I'm that's not that's not where our core focus is and just out of curiosity where do you live do you have a home anywhere uh well I don't have a house no I don't have any I don't have any property I don't have any real estate property I rent everywhere I do spend about a like I spend quite a bit of time in Singapore Tara Mota Switzerland so I so again people have this view like you gotta have a base or you gotta have somewhere in one city right or you gotta have a place I don't I don't have that problem well also if you're a billionaire then you can maintain multiple homes actually yeah actually that's just I think economically I can afford it by timewise I can't it's just such a headache all the time yes okay I actually I agree with that um so one thing that I also want to ask you about that just to go back to the regulatory question I've seen other interviews where you've said things like quote we're okay to do things very creatively to avoid unnecessary regulation or another quote we don't want to be in one place right now because of regulatory uncertainty and obviously you have this history of moving finances offices and servers it partly I think because you don't want countries to be able to easily determine if they have jurisdiction over finance and you know those times when you moved out of China you also moved out of Japan I think you also had regulatory issues in Hong Kong like those three moves I think were due to regulatory issues so some people that I spoke with said that to them it seems like you are flouting the law do you ever worry that you are putting yourself on this path to be to clash with regulators and that you could end up in jail again I think you are making some buddies some random people's opinion to be the holy to be like legal to be a legal enforced I don't know ruling or something a lot of people because I could think about anything I think I think I don't know Donald Trump's validate by didn't violating the law but what I think doesn't really matter so I actually think the reversal I fully respect the loss of every country every jurisdiction and the but most people most people have this mindset that you gotta stay in one place and work with one government but why is that like why can't you go to a place to work with a government that you choose instead of always being stuck in one place and work with a government that may amend us for what you want to do so yeah a new brand new industry where I'm I'm very third so they're there they're at their fundamental laws right laws are different by country and the more fundamental stuff you can't do like hurting people stealing scamming stuff like that so and there are the things like okay how do you classify a cryptocurrency how do you use it as securities and not and this this kind of things different countries do it differently so what's wrong with going to a country and choosing to live in a country where those things are more favorable for you why do you have to be stuck in a country that that are not good for this kind of stuff why this is this is like saying look why don't just what why don't you stay like if you even don't like hot places why don't just start me but why don't you stuck yourself in Florida I mean the Sun all the time and you just don't like it right why don't you go to a different City right so I don't I don't think there's anything wrong or illegal or anything oh you mean article about it I mean that's just it is opportunistic but why don't you choose the good opportunities for you we're living we're living a world where we where we where we seek and and and phrase freedom right so this why don't you use the freedom that you have right so it's a free world you can choose to be in whichever country whichever City whichever place and you can choose to do whatever profession you want to do within reason that I I think basically cryptocurrency is a new thing we're not doing anything strange we're not would not do anything hey Don we're not doing anything that's hurting people right so I think that's I'm not worried about it at all I don't I don't know why people think he's such narrow minded ways well just for the record you know some people that I spoke with did kind of go down that line of thinking and then other people said hey and and by the way I just what I did was I I talked with kind of a bunch of lawyers who are involved in the crypto space because I was kind of curious and you know you're right they didn't all have the same opinion you know one of them was like hey this is a business guy and in fact it frankly it was kind of funny he was a lawyer and he was like don't talk about the regulatory stuff too much it's gonna be boring but anyway he was like oh well I've ucz more it's just like a business person you know sort of in the model of uber which you know obviously you didn't follow all the regulations from its you know in its early days so it's just kind of curious like how do you see yourself or maybe you don't have you know some view of yourself in relationship to regulation but I was just kind of curious like are you trying to make some kind of a point or you know do you have any particular purpose to your regulatory stance so I don't I'm so I don't really have a stance against or with regulatory but our whole point is to increase the freedom of increase the freedom of choice right so we wanna we we believe that the cryptocurrency blockchain is a new technology that helps the world and it has because of the new net new technology has a few uncertainties in terms of regulations or what the regulator's want to do with it but I'm not against or for regulation I just want so we just want to help increase the adoption of crypto around the world where we can there are certain parts of the world which the tax becomes very hard so we we don't do that we we focus on parts parts of the world that's easier we do work very closely with many many regulators and trying to help them if they want advice from us we'll give them if they ask us what was important to us we was said very openly if they tell if they ask us what other parts of the wars are doing in their regulations we will give them what we know so my stance is we want to help the regulations we become healthier become what you call I wouldn't even use the word right I just want to use the word appropriate for more growth for healthy growth so we want to help we don't view regulations as we also told you as regulations as against us I think some regulation is good probably and over regulating what will kill the industry at least in those jurisdictions where those things apply and that will be bad for them long term so it's actually bad for them not bad for us we will go elsewhere if that happens so I'm not I'm not against it I just think the okay it's it's a brand new game and we we already started playing the game and now we're trying to figure out the basic rules of the game which is that basically like a bunch of kids playing games right so you first start playing and then you try to figure out some rule so I think that's okay that's just how the world works so I'm not against or for it I just want to help people make better regulations if we could focus on regulations but our real focus is actually just help people get access to crypto we're gonna discuss trans mining and finances up coming to centralized exchange but first I'd like to take a quick break for our fabulous sponsors a startup that completed an ICO and

listeners reach out to raylene at Laura Shin podcast at gmail.com to find out about sponsorship opportunities on Unchained and unconfirmed again that's Laura Shin podcast at gmail.com la you are a Shi n podcast at gmail.com I'm speaking with cz founder and CEO of Finance what do you think of shape-shifts recent decision to implement AML kyc they like you were you know or i mean and still are at least at this moment a cryptid a crypto exchanged and didn't have accounts um I don't really have any actually I didn't really know that until you told me just this second last week oh yeah actually I did hear vaguely but I got distracted I didn't read into it but it's a business it's a business decision eric worre he and his team probably paid for it's very hard it's a very difficult to judge a business decision from the outside without knowing all the internal factors that went into consideration so I think basically if they did it that probably has some business reason to do it I know Eric is a very smart guy so I yeah I can't really comment on that and for listeners who are interested in more information on that I did do an episode of unconformity on rule of Masari so there's more information there I also wanted to ask you know just going back to this question about whether or not coins or securities I heard on the epicentre BTC podcast with an interview that you did with them that you said that your process of legal review for listing coins is that you asked that token teams to get a lawyer to provide a statement asserting that their token is not a security isn't that kind of like asking the Fox to guard the henhouse I don't agree with that but what else can we do like if there's other better solutions I'm all up for it oh and just why like you you don't feel like you would have a legal team that could do that kind of review what then still sent you still a bunch of lawyers who are doing that right so but they're not being paid by the team that wants to try to get their token listed do you know what I'm saying well what we would do from a business perspective is we were charged that we were just listening teams to Pope to pay to cover those costs anyway so I don't think I don't think those are gonna be hugely different I mean basically right now I nobody knows how to determine if the coin is a security or not there's no clear guideline anywhere I think there's a highway test which but the high test fails for most cryptos even in the u.s. because most kryptos can be transferred very very easily whereas most securities can't so yeah I'm not an expert in that area and we rely on experts and whether we hire them and charge that feedback to the coin the coin teams or they defy somebody so right now we're just doing what we think are the most logical thing to do and I know in general like a lot of people are concerned about these exchanges you know not just issues about regulation but also you know concerns about things like market manipulation and other things like that so just curious does Finance have its own internal policies and procedures regarding things like insider trading or auditing or any other kinds of self-regulation yes we do have we do have some rules and guidelines so yeah I mean our employees can hold crypto but when they buy they gotta at least hope for 30 days before they sell so this is very this is a like a policy we learn from the bank's back in the way back in banking days that's kind of our internal policy we don't and we don't we don't let our employees day trade and it's not a productive thing to do anyway for most of them and we discourage other kinds of market manipulation we have some AI learning tools that with risk with risk management now if a coin price fluctuates too heavily and we have now intervention processes but they're relatively soft we don't have circuit breakers because the crypto is traded on multiple markets so yeah we have some but they're there and we're still we're slowly evolving them as well so hopefully with time they'll get more and more mature and some people were saying that they think that there's washe trading and market manipulation happening on finance they mentioned that there's often fairly high volume of trading in pretty obscure coins during short time periods that don't seem to really be tied to news do you try to prevent that in any way yes so I think if you look at the market research done by independent like community members bionis is probably the only one based that they could not find any science of a washed renewal or pumping volumes or fake volumes so that's why as an exchange we're actually very very careful about that but on the topic of wash training and manipulation so it's a really tricky one because basically what it how do you define manipulation how do you define wash training so let's say a big coin is like I don't know six sixty three hundred US dollars on my exchanges some guy just want to buy it all the way on buying us all the way all the way up to seven thousand US dollars the guy just has lots of money just wants to buy if that manipulation or use are not it's kind of really hard to define and what quantity if it just does one trade and comes back down so it's really it's really hard to tell at what time it was at what stage does that become manipulation and what is it a warning is it just a price percentage difference from other exchanges but like what about a coin that only trades on warm market so there's a lot of when you actually like conceptually yes if Bitcoin 6,300 in our exchanges right now and is traded 7,000 in some other exchange then most likely is some type of manipulation but how do you define that how do you prevent it and like and also and what training is the same thing right less like two accounts are just trading against each other in a very high percentage base at what point do you define that as much trading like did if they do like four orders back and forth that's what's trading or because they will be trading with other people as well even if they only want to trade against each other they will have to trade with other people in the market so at what point do you can say we lock those accounts and while we freeze those accounts and let's say we say okay if you trade if you trade over 100k within five minutes against chart that we defined that as watch trading guess what's gonna happen are they gonna trade night 99k every five minutes and and they're gonna have and they're gonna have four accounts trade or three accounts or forecast trading against each other so at what point and then we can lower it again but it's a mouse and cat game right so the problem is it's very hard to define scientific like quantitatively what exactly it is without them able to going around the so we do try I think we probably want the one of the players one of the exchanges that tried the hardest in this regard that we actually don't advertise but people know so the the smart traders know and the the the hi out the the the serious traders come to us and the rest follow so that's why we are we're able to maintain such a lead such a lead on the on the if you look at page views or unique views we have such a lead right now so people know if you look at volume a lot of the volume out there is fake or at least have some fakeness to it a fake is not a black eye my work as I just explained before so it's kind of really hard to define what exactly is fake volume but we are definitely one of the most honest ones out there so which what we try it is a problem in this industry and I think everybody should try I think it's exchange operators we should definitely all try to be ethical to be fair about it and to address the issue square and upfront and but also as traders as users we should even really just abandon those exchanges that have suspicious behavior and for the legit was can you go into more detail on B&B for me as far as I understand people and use it to trade for to pay for trading fees and they'll get a discount they can also participate in I cos on the finance Launchpad some vendors I guess accepted as payment and you're gonna use it in the future decentralized exchange that you're creating but it was just curious like what rights do holders of the B&B token have in terms of information or voting or financial rights alright so B&B token is not a security is not shares of Finance so those questions about rights are assuming that there are certain thing which they're not so the BMV token as we defined I have a few advantages number why you get discounts if you use that to pay for fees so it's more like a discount card mechanism and the discounts disappear after five years so every year did the discount rate drops about half and disappears in year five and that the second thing about bonus points every quarter by network use 20 percent of our profits and to buy back and burn them destroy them so basically taking more coins out of circulation financially there's a very similar effect to giving a district dividend distribution but mechanically we're not sending any money money out we're just destroying money we have which is just destroying coins we have and again there's a limit to that we will only destroy up to half of all the total issued amount which is a hundred million the total total total issued amount is 200 million and we're gonna destroy 100 million eventually looks like this is going to take a number of years based on the current rate because now the price of Bitcoin went up so much now we can the destroying rate is low but people are happy because the price went up and the third the third thing is a biased coin will be used as the to pay for fees on the bonus chain which is going to be on its own blockchain a a decentralized exchange so in that regard is very similar to Bitcoin and the etherium it's just you can use that to pay for fees if you choose to use our essentially if you do choose to use our approach and later so that should come out soon as well so we're very actively working on that and so those are the things we promised as our part of our white paper and in addition to that now we're pushing very aggressively to get BMB adoption into other people's ecosystems so you should be able to use be able to pay for coffee if you be able to use B&B to to buy airplane tickets to travel to Australia to do all of these other things so we're fully forced so PMB is not PAB does not equal to - shares that they have no they don't have voting rights in the company they are in our team so it's not it's not it's not securities in my mind there are people who may want to define it as is but I don't think any any official place has defined it as is so that's kind of interesting to me what you said about how you want to eventually have B&B used to pay for other things because you know typically at least so far in the crypto space the tokens that have been used for money are decentralized like Bitcoin ethers e-cash Manero and here you're creating this quarter of like company coin that you want other vendors to use and for people in general to use as as money is that the vision there no it's actually not a company coin so the bynars coin itself lives on the blockchain right now you live some like if you're in blocks you very soon you are habits I will have our own blockchain which is also a decentralized platform so in that regards we're we're the same as all the coin we just mentioned and it's not a coin from by the company it's still a community we are the issuers we have issued it and people have bought it and it's been spread out and we do hold quite a large number of it but we're not gonna be able to issue anymore so we no longer have we no longer have a lot of control on the coin what we could control is basically we can as we are still two very large shareholders of the coin we are instant we're financially incentivize to make the coin worth more and we're wearing a sin device to work really hard to add more utility to add more use cases the more use cases the coin has the more utility value you will have and hence the price so we're we are very encouraged to do that but other than that no longer so see it's statements like that that make me think oh that sounds like a security it's like XRP it's it's so similar to me but anyway keep going I think I think working very hard to want to try to increase the value of something that you hold it's not it's not wrong that doesn't make it a security like for example I evangelize for Bitcoin and because I do hold it that doesn't make Bitcoin of security so and we do not promise returns we do not we do not promise any returns we do not promise you will go up in value we're just saying that we're working very hard team we're just saying what we do we're working very hard to try to increase the value of buying a coin and a number of other cryptic wants to be honest at the same time including including Bitcoin so that yourself does not make it a security yeah I want to ask about their tokens that you live also I know that there's no one set price to have a you know if I you know if I want to have my token list on Finance but what is the range of fees that I might pay for that like you know low end and high end it's usually it's usually around a couple hundred thousand dollars to be honest it's usually around a range and know what are those fees cover why is it that expensive well number one we there is a lot of work in gold that goes on and that and the works ongoing whenever they have uploaded upgrade we got upgrade whenever whenever there's a security issue there's a blocking fork we have to do a lot of work but I will be honest that it's not a fee for work we for us the our I for doing that type of work is like we basically don't have to do it at all I think generating profits from a platform while generating revenue from a platform is a it's a high return for us number two we provide such value for those coins I mean the battery should be like it's basically zero we like we provide such value for coins we've given their liquidity giving them like our our large user base giving them the credibility because now they pass by let's review it's worth way more but you know we are profitable already we don't we don't want to destroy the market we want a whole ecosystem to be healthy so many people have actually wrong perceptions about us yeah but if you understand that you like basically if you understand the industry if you understand how much value we providing to those projects we let this is why none of the projects I listed I was complaining about it at all like nobody said after the list they've had too much in listing fees and you have a lot more coins available than the vast majority of exchanges and we're kind of at this point in the development of the crypto space where probably only you know a handful maybe at most a dozen of these are really gonna succeed so how do you feel about making so much money off of at least some portion of your customers who might be speculating on bad investments in losing money well I think that's the that's a very negative way to word that a question and sorry it's a little bit of a deceiving way to do it so most of the ICU projects are startup projects and I think everyone should know that startup projects do you have a very higher failure rate is the same thing as if you you know we in the traditional investment world so a number of it's the same things as the internet right so how many Internet companies survive here today but the internet itself did not disappear that industry did not go away and they're very they're very profitable profitable Internet companies so it's girly stages in the industry if there's nothing that we are doing or not doing that it's not like we it's not like we're we're it's not like we're scamming users for their money we're just you could be lifting fewer coins like you know only the highest quality or something so you could say the same thing about Nasdaq right or so like is every company that listed making money for their users I don't think so so why did that list so many companies not sure so the so you're blaming the marketplace provider for for for bad shops or for bad fares we're just a platform provider right so a lot of people lost money investing Internet companies but is the Internet bad or is not that bad probably not right so there are risks investing and we're doing our best to educate user to to to provide them with that we're by far the best platform now out there in in both selection of coins selection of projects our internal process our external process our ethical values etc so we're by far the best and but I think you like in terms of the Nasdaq comparison the only differences that of course because those are public offerings without with those come with disclosures but in the crypto space obviously you know there there isn't that kind of thing going on so it you know the quality of the information is probably quite variable right but you pay us but you're assuming that I'm not I'm not even sure if I agree with that to be honest there's but you're assuming that's one one situation is better than the other which I don't agree with but I also don't agree with the the various fundamental statement that there's more information disclosure than there is in ic OS for those companies because I always say there's more structured information disclosure they they're that they're very structured because they they were they were very said structure in place but how many how many listed companies have fudged their financial reports moved moved income from the next quarter on to this quarter or the scored on to the next how many like there's a lot of stuff that goes on which are not which are questionable to be honest because people people CV once you make the rules of the game people figure out how to get around the rules where's in the ICO space isn't right now there's not a lot of rules but it's really dependent it's a very crowd reven how many telegrams groups this I discuss about scams and other question or behavior if you look on Twitter there's a lot more information about those things that happening in the community in the crowd well I personally believe like 5,000 people discuss or plain discussing these closings disclosing things about a project probably more useful than a couple analysts just sitting there getting paid very highly and providing a report the report is more structured yes but I not sure if the information quality is higher or lower I don't know yeah a lot of people are you spoke with also we're so curious about your decentralized exchange how it always that going to look and why does it need its own blockchain so basically yeah so it's coming along quite well actually and it's going to be a specialized blockchain just for trading tokens so we want speed so speed is a we want speed over features so feature wise is can be very simple and and but that's also why we can achieve higher speed so and I think most people don't realize that most people think of features when they talk about something but they don't realize in order to achieve scale you need speed you actually don't need a lot of features so even if you look at balance calm the number of order types or the features are quite simple but we handle large amounts of stuff so that's also the same thing with our decentralized blockhead so that's basically what it is and that's why the blockchain has to be and that's why you need your own bar chain for speed yeah so we you basically if you see any if you adapt any existing blog channel or use a general-purpose blockchain that can handle it I can do a lot of stuff it's very hard to optimize for speed we took a lot of stuff out we're making a more specialized blockchain a more special-purpose blockchain that's more focused more focused on speed and I know you're probably tired of these questions but I am so curious will your decks require kyc AML procedures I don't think so I'm not sure I'm not I'm not I'm not aware of any text that that does that right I mean you can't do that right now I'm Bitcoin or theorem I think like some of them probably have real ayres that couldn't do that but yeah you're right like well actually that leads me to another question are you guys doing your in on chain order book kind of like okay yes so we the current plan is a on chant order book that's still very fast and that yeah the KIC when you decentralize who's doing it that's the problem I see solutions are centralized where you gotta have some you gotta have some centralized party it was doing the KYC who's actually doing looking at the passports that's uploaded running criminal checks against the centralized databases who and those are very costly those are we use those those are very expensive so this decentralized blockchain who's gonna do that who's gonna pay for it you recently acquired a crypto wallet trust wallet why was this your first acquisition you did admit that it doesn't even have a lot of users so I was curious what you're trying to accomplish with this purchase it's a great product it's that's a great so trust wallet is a great find it's one of those things where is that knowledge 18 and they're very focused on building a product but they they have not that done zero marketing only a small niche number of people know them as full confidence they will have a large number of users very very quickly the product is awesome it's by far the best wallet out there the best mobile wallet out there so and that I met with Victor the the founder of that team he shares exactly the same visions as we did we talked about four we had a call with him for for like 10 minutes and then I had another I met with them for another four for another couple hours we got the deal done so I'm very very bullish on trust wallet and I think it's a great product they lack the lack of few marketing skills or ability right now which we can which we can fully compliment so I think that's just a no-brainer and I think by working together both sides will benefit a lot more than working separately and we both are great so I'm gonna actually collapse my next few questions into one because you've been making me these these other moves like you are working on creating a crypto bank that will be user owned you have this 1 billion dollar by Nancy ecosystem fund so you just kind of want to hear I mean you have other initiatives as well but I just kind of want to hear you know what your vision is of what Finance will become and what products and services users will be able to enjoy from bye Nance and also really what it means for them to be user owners sure so basically our goal is just to again increase the adoption of critical so by to do that we want to provide the core infrastructure services in this industry we want to make the industry bigger so I think I will go right now it's not to take more market share in this current space we're already the biggest exchange in most by most measurements by just taking market share of other people right now doesn't make any sense what we should do is make them make them make the industry ten a hundred a thousand or even a one million times bigger so will you feed do that then if you if you if this provide if we're all provide a few infrastructure key services in this industry and we will will be pretty well off so that's our go so in order to grow this industry we gotta making investments into other into other areas which we're now experts in so if we're not experts which just invest me others who are experts and let them do the let them do the do their job so this includes wallets faster blog chance payment services even gaming infrastructures other like there's a lot of other infrastructure stuff going on so that's kind of our investment arm and also right now banks are not banks are a bottleneck for money flow and we want to increase the freedom there as well so we want to we want to work closely with banks to increase the flow between to increase the bandwidth of to or at least increase the freedom of exchange between Fiat and crypto and we can work with banks we can require banks and we can instead try a few things ourselves so all of those are different experiments we're doing trying to make the industry bigger the goal yeah is to make the industry bigger and just our curiosity for this crypto bank how is that different from a wallet exactly I don't know if I really know what the difference is that crypto bank holds Fiat that's a Fiat bank so that's a traditional paper money bank whereas trust wallet it holds only crypto that's a wallet for holding your coins those two are very different things the bank is still gonna be regulated by the banking regulators etc so it's a more for crypto friendly or bank but it's still a bank okay yeah and so earlier I mentioned that I wanted to chat about trans mining and this is kind of a really interesting phenomenon can you explain what that is for listeners and also why you're critical of it sure trans money is a very innovative way for a distribution of their initial coins which is basically a more complex or more convoluted ico mechanism basically you pay for Commission fees get the coins which is the same as you pay Bitcoin by a coin which is just a slightly different mechanism but the whole fundamentals it was very in you know very innovative in concept but in reality the economics don't work and it's basically everybody who did it turn out to be intentionally or unintentionally turn out to be a scam basically anybody who participated most of them lost money so it doesn't work and all the exchange about doing it I have stopped I've been saying that since like three or four months ago when they started but some people believe me some people did it but the results are pretty clear now so I think that's the thing of the past and just stay off trance mining it's a short-answer of it right it's like the exchange would kind of basically reimburse you your trading fee in their coin and you were saying it was like kind of another way of doing an IC o---- right yes but they do they do they do things very so there's a few different variations of it but the most basic model is okay so you pay for let's say one Bitcoin in Commission fees they give you one Bitcoin equivalent in the platform coin but at the same time they also unlock 100% you call you value they team's portion and they give you 20% extra for the guy who will refer to you so now there's two hundred twenty percent being releasing to market of the platform coin but only one only one hundred percent of the Bitcoin going in over time the coin price is gonna drop give me in that demand supply that that's just very basic and there's a bunch of other things they they they they they paint like the temporary rosy pictures around it like dividend or Commission fees etc etc but at the end of the day the motor didn't work it's it's won its innovative but financially just a network last question for you you know this kind of goes back to the beginning of the interview when you were talking about how you have spent time both in the West and in Asia and I know you continue to do that obviously when you were saying that you keep rentals in Malta and Switzerland and I forget the Singapore I forget the other places but I'm so curious to know how would you compare and contrast Asia's cryptocurrency scene with the American scene or the Western scene the does see any different in different countries the continents are very interesting actually so I think in America this hola is all about anti-air AML so it's all it's like the regulations are really more about terrorists so how do we control and stop those terrorists and so doing exchanges in the u.s. is very very difficult because of the money anti-money laundering laws but u.s. is very technology savvy so there's a very strong startup scene so anything that involves technology innovation is is highly encouraged and it's quite easy so there's a lot of new use cases in the u.s. different different things other than exchanges there's only there's only a very small handful exchanges in the US Europe is quite interesting where the user adoption is probably the highest you can pay for food you can pay for hotels you can you can register company pay lawyer fees all in crypto so Europe given that is the European Union and they kind of they don't view their own currency as a very strong thing so that and they also know cross-border transactions etc so there's a very high adoption on on usability there and in Asia is kind of divided in China that's up there are a lot of exchanges even though exchanges supposed to be banned but there are a lot of but there I mean basically what does that mean right so you register company offshore and your team still in China and you have like a thousand people team in China everybody knows where they are everybody knows who were there working on but they claim to be a subcontractor of the company of the offshore company which they're different of course so then they're okay in the Chinese the Chinese mentality is very different from the rest of Asia where there have a horde mentality of following other people who makes quick money they the the making quick money mentality is very very strong in China I guess because of the less the less stability economically and politically potentially so people are more things change too quickly and people are very if you have a 10 year plan 3 months later it's gonna be shuttered because the new regulation comes out so people just focus on three months so China's a very different market and where's China completely banned payments and also the domestic traditional payments for which I pay and Ali pay are very strong like nobody-nobody carries cash in China so it's all electronic money it's for so that's also very convenient which kind of dorsally payment needs for a Bitcoin for crypto as well outside of China is very interesting Japan is very interesting Japan's very pro crypto but their regulations our exchanges are too dense there's just too many rules and it's very hard for those guys to compete so and Korea's very interesting Korea has a hundred percent adoption on Krypton everybody has crypto as of some kind so so in any pot and also Korea has one of those democratic and and less powerful governments any politician that's against crypto gets voted down very quickly Singapore's interests so Singapore is interesting Singapore's like kind of wait and see they're very strict are financial controls and they kind of it's a smaller economy or smaller it's a smaller country in terms of population so but it's very open in terms of looking at new things so the world is very interesting Africa's just getting started yeah so it's a very interesting world I think what's gonna happen in the future it's gonna be more exciting than what happened in the past you know I actually ain't even if we take one minute and I just want to ask you one last question so you were on the cover of Forbes last winter for the issue covering the Forbes crypto Rich List and at that time it estimates your net worth was between one and two billion and obviously this happened what was it it was um I guess seven months after you launched finance how did it feel to amass so much wealth so quickly to be honest I actually don't feel that much different I don't spend any money that's the best of problem so the I actually don't spend a lot more I don't spin it I don't have a car I don't I don't have a yacht I don't have a private jet I have none of those things i buy just electronics and I fly like business class so that's the only difference it makes for me but what's more interesting is I it does getting on the cover of Forbes did make men a mentorship for me which is I know I should no longer care about money which is what that in taught me so I actually don't think about money anymore and the most expensive resource I have now is time which is the same for everybody it's very fair 24 hours a day for everybody so time is the most limited resource and there's no way to expand it so that changed my thinking a little bit but you didn't change me financially or my spending habits none of those things and actually you cut it happen so quickly kind of destroyed my interesting money or all those other expensive hobbies are getting our yards getting like I don't know expensive food that kind of destroyed it for me actually because or a Lambo because I when I see guys driving a Lambo I'm thinking yeah I can buy one if I want to but do I wanted nah I've never seen I'm never setting a Lambo in my life and I've never taken private I'm never taking a private jet in my life so far but I know that if I wanted I could that's all we matter yeah I totally agree with you about time being the most precious resource yeah all right well thank you for accommodating that last additional questions because because of how precious our time is this has been an incredibly fascinating discussion I've really really enjoyed it where can people learn more about you and bye Nance I think most most of most of us starts pretty public just Google us it's pretty simple yeah okay great well
