welcome jerry hi thanks for having me this week the crypto world was abuzz with the news that the treasury department prohibited all americans from using the privacy service tornado cash which is a crypto mixer can you explain what this means and why it is that the office of foreign assets control levied these sanctions against tornado cash as you say tornado cash is a mixing service but um embedded in that i think is a bit of confusion so let's take a step back and first talk if you don't mind about blender.io so blender.io is also a mixing service that was designated and added to the sdn list just like tornado cache a few months ago in may and when that was done there was an area peep from anybody in the crypto community and why was that it's because yeah blender dot io is a centralized mixing service meaning that um it is a company whether it's incorporated or not is essentially a company group of persons um who provide a service where you send them your bitcoin and lots of people do they mix the bitcoins together and then they send them back to you but in so doing they take custody of the bitcoin they have control over the service they can choose to provide the service or not they can choose to provide a service to some people and not others they can choose to register with vincent as a money transmitter you know etc um and so when you add a service a company and related bitcoin addresses to the sdn list um the way that ofac did you know that's just the typical sanctions action that's taken because in the case of blunder.io north korean hackers and other ransomware operators have been using blended io so far so good when you move forward to tornado cache ofac essentially the way that it has talked about this in the press and it's press release and in the way that it's done is designation in its sdn list update notice it's identical to the blender.io designation but the thing at issue here tornado cache is completely different so it's true that tornado cache is you know there is a tornado cache entity that is a group of persons um because for example one of the things that is um added to the sdn list is the website tornado.cash and so clearly there is a person or group of persons who own that website and can control it and run it and decide whatever goes on it etc and there you know there is a dow that controls um aspects of some of the smart contracts in particular um how they relate to the interface of uh the web interface of tornado cache so those that's there certainly is a tornado cache entity but in addition to that there is a tornado cache application that is a series of smart contracts that are deployed on the ethereum network that are not owned by anybody that are not controlled by anybody because um david you know you can verifiably see that there is no way for anybody to update those smart contracts or change them in any way what ofac has done here is conflict these two things the tornado cache entity and tornado cache application all into one designation and as a result of that the obligation on all americans is to do to have no interaction with any of the listed addresses and with that with anything related to the tornado cache entity that's what it means unfortunately you know i think uh ofac might have a receptive authority uh in doing that okay so essentially it sounds like before it wasn't even thought possible that the government could sanction a smart contract but that's effectively what happened here and it's unclear whether or not the government maybe even realized what it did because initially the secretary of state anthony blinken tweeted that tornado cash was sponsored by north korea that's inaccurate so that even sort of calls into question maybe what the understanding of the facts were i mean the tweet was deleted and an accurate one was issued an hour later so maybe not but it's not totally clear just to understand a little bit more about tornado cash though so the proceeds of many recent hacks have flowed through there from ronin from crypto.com from harmony nomad but in general what percentage of activity on tornado cash do you think is illicit so from what i've seen reported from chain analysis and other chain analytic now that doesn't mean that the other 70 is all completely legal we're not we don't know but it seems like the vast majority seems to be people using it either just to protect your own personal privacy or as part of a defy application where it's just part of good operational security etc yeah yeah and i think a lot of everyday people myself included can relate to wanting to have privacy for certain financial transactions if not most of them so coin center published a blog post that differentiated this sanction from the other sanctions as you just described and you were kind of implicitly criticizing ofac if i was sort of reading between the lines here can you explain more um about your position on that yeah so and this is something that you know just to note we will be um putting out a more detailed legal analysis shortly if not tomorrow then monday and so you know our understanding has been evolving but essentially i think ofac made a mistake here for several reasons right so one reason i think is that they may have overstepped their authority as i was just saying so number one ofac is authorized by statute and executive order in its own regular regulations it's authorized to designate persons and entities and add them to the sdn list and what an entity is is defined in their regulations and then once you've designated a certain person or entity their property is blocked or frozen without going into too much detail because we'll do that in our in our extensive analysis it may be the case and i think it's a very good case that these um immutable smart contracts that make up the tornado cache application are not an entity right so they're not subject they can't be added properly to the sdn list um and uh and to the extent you say well um they're not an entity but they're the property of the tornado cache entity because there are people who make up a tornado cache entity i'm not sure that makes any sense either because they these smart contracts are you know written such a way where nobody can control them or transfer them so in no way really are they anybody's property so number one it may be that treasure that the ofac oversteps its authority when it designated those smart contracts so that's one critique the other critique i would say is goes to the process what is the decision process like to add somebody to the sd list well it's kind of unclear this is not a public process this is not a public process where there is public input that's taken and that's understandable because if there was you know if there wasn't notice posted that we're considering adding alpha bank to the sdn list well the alpha bank would immediately remove all his funds out of the u.s before it would uh become finals so it's just it's you know they just do it the problem here is that when you do that um you want to make sure that you're not adding americans to the sdn list you're not allowed to add americans you're only allowed to add non-us persons to the sdn ones in this case i'm not sure they're adding an american because again i don't think they're adding a person uh to the list but certainly a lot of americans are affected by this right and they're affected in two ways one a lot of americans i think have funds that are now trapped in the tornado cash application and smart contract where now to retrieve those funds would be a violation of sanctions law so they're affected in that way and number two all americans are affected because essentially their liberty has been curtailed right as an american i can no longer use this privacy tool and that is a curtailment of my liberty that has happened without any due process without any you know public process at all without any way for me to to appeal and when ofac i think has encountered those kind of situations in the past so say for example they want to designate a rogue bank of some kind in panama or russia where many americans might have accounts that that bank innocent americans have accounts at those banks but ofac wants to say that the bank is sanctioned and you can't do business with the bank well all innocent americans who have accounts at that bank are essentially going to have their money frozen when that happens ofac i think in the past has done and certainly should do a collateral damage impact analysis right before they announce the sanction they should realize how many innocent individuals american and non-american are going to be affected by this and how are we going to deal with that fact was that done here was there collateral damage impact analysis done here what steps did they take because it seems they've taken none because number one we really need some answer from them about what are people who today have funds trapped there how are they supposed to get them out and number two a completely foreseeable event with this sanctioning with as soon as i heard that this had happened it occurred to me and i should occur to hundreds of people who know anything about crypto is okay they've sanctioned these smart contracts so that so that it is now a you know a crime potentially to send funds to the smart contractor to receive funds from the smart contract so so of course what's going to happen is well the smart connector doesn't continue to run so somebody is going to use it to send funds to americans and then by virtue of having received funds and this is not a check this is a etherium transaction you can't reject it you can't decide to not cache it are you now technically into this completely foreseeable thing which happened right so jimmy fallon shaquille o'neal lots of prominent people whose addresses are known had this dusting uh happen where they were sent funds well what do they do now right so these are kind of the foreseeable the consequences for completely innocent americans you think of should have preemptively tried to address before they did this so in a moment we're going to talk a little bit more about a number of these issues that you just raised but first a quick word from the sponsors who make the show possible to swap crypto a user has to choose among hundreds of dexes on multiple networks all offering different rates and fees do you want to avoid that hassle swap on one inch a top decks aggregator built to get you better rates than any single decks enjoy unlimited liquidity across multiple networks and top level security get one inch on your phone now or swap on one inch dot io back to my conversation with jerry so as you pointed out for a number of reasons it may be that either this action was not constitutional or it wasn't done in a way that's even either practicable or you know or is also overreach um so in the past uh actually not that long ago i think was like two or three months ago you announced that you were going to sue the government over another similar statute that you felt i think was unconstitutional the 6050i provision in the and it was in the infrastructure about last year if at this point you determined something similar for this act then you know what could happen would that also be in the plate or what are some of the other options yeah so i think we're still very much at the preliminary stage of trying to understand what exactly are the legal implications of this action was there actually you know overreach of their authority are there constitutional questions here and if so who the right parties would be to bring a claim so we're still at that stage but i wouldn't rule out that coin center or somebody with coin center's help could litigate this and indeed that might be what happens i think the first thing that has to happen is we have to try to exhaust all of our administrative options for relief so number one you know individuals who have funds trapped at the tornado cash smart contract can apply for a license from kofak to remove those funds and you can also potentially get what's called a general license from ovac that is basically a uh a license for any american who has funds um trapped there to to remove them so yeah those are things we have we and many other people who uh um are affected by this have to explore and and so in the case for people with usdc then they would just show that to us to circle and then get their funds unblacklisted via or unfrozen or whatever it's called in circle yeah so that's interesting because there's a there's an extra layer here right because some people just have eth that they deposited there and they just want to get their eats back but if they they could do that today they've got the keys they could just go get it but if they did that they'd be breaking the law so they need to get this license from ofac in order to do it legally but then there are people who have usdc there and the thing there is even if they got this license from bofak they really couldn't get the usdc back because circle has blocked those usdc from moving so you're right they would have to go to circle and say this is who i am that was mine here's a license circle might want to get a license for itself or be part of a general license so it's very complicated and it needs to be sorted out so that's one aspect of it the other kind of administrative relief that we would want to exhaust is there is a process by which you can have a listed entity delisted so you know for example let's say that you were listed by mistake because somebody with a similar name was intended to be on a list and you were put on or maybe you've changed your behavior so that you know what you're no longer doing as a company you're no longer doing the bad thing they got you on the list you want to get out there is a process by which one can petition so it's a formal petition process to have something delisted unfortunately the regulations that provide for the petitioning process only provide for the listed person to be the one who can petition to be delisted but our argument here is that the listed entity is not a person so so how can we do that so have we already exhausted our our administrative relief avenues or not so we have to navigate that you know and then once we've done that ultimately you know we might want to go to court and then the question there is well who goes to court is it you know can coin center just go to court as somebody who wants to use tornado cash in the future and feels that they are um uh unlawfully being denied access to it because this thing should not be on the sdn list or you know coin center in the past has received donations through tornado cash is it you know does that give us standing but also you know we could have co-plaintives or plans that we help who have funds there our developers et cetera et cetera and then you know what are the claims is it limited only to both overreaching as authority or do we also think about well are there constitutional issues here does this government action have chilling effects on speech that are sort of separate it's a bit of a stretched claim but it's it's possible so as you mentioned there are those celebs um or or really uh even anyone with a dot east name yeah who were sent uh you know some fraction of 8.1 i think that's what i saw on twitter for those people what do you recommend they do so i am not a sanctions lawyer and i'm certainly not your lawyer or anybody's lawyer so don't take this legal advice i would say number one go if you're worried about this you might want to contact a lawyer but i think what the lawyer might tell you is that you should notify ofac about this fact right and i think if you go look up the ofec regs i think it's the case that um it's spelled out as an obligation of americans who discover that they have and typically typically this so the way of act works really we're talking here about is ofac applies to all americans every individual but really most you know everyday americans going about their business don't have to think about who's on the stl and listen who's not it's going to be big banks and corporations who have a lot of dealings internationally we have to worry about this and so what will often happen is that you have a bank that does hundreds of thousands of transactions a day and then they discover that oh my god yesterday we let the transaction through with somebody on the sdn list and it was totally a mistake we've caught it but you know but there's strict liability here right there's no there's no compliance here and so what the ofac regs i believe say is you've got 10 days after since when you discovered this thing to notify ofac and at that point ofac will work with you to say you know this is what you have to do to mitigate it or do nothing or it's okay don't worry about it or whatever so if you want to be extra careful you might want to do that you might want to seek legal help to do that but that seems kind of crazy anybody with a with a um dot eat with a known dot east you know address or just just a regular ethereum address that's known is now hostage to anybody who could just you know do this to them yeah i was thinking that this person who trolled the celebs and the dot eve people this way um they just created a bunch of paperwork for them yeah but it's interesting you know one way things to look at this is to say this person was trolling and that might be their motivation but this person might be just trying to and i get it this is not very polite to the people who who they're doing this to this person i'm guessing might also be just be trying to highlight put a spotlight on the absurdity of what evac has done here so what do you think would happen if someone forked the code and just deployed a copycat version of these smart contracts to a new address it's a very good question so it's interesting you would think that if you did this this would be something completely different and so it wouldn't be subject to the sanctions and people could use that until ofac added that thing data address to the list and indeed i was looking at a statement that a treasury official gave to the financial times yesterday where they said that the purpose of doing this was to basically stamp out the use of this technology by going after tornado cash in any reconstituted version of it so it's interesting they're not going after a particular entity they're going after a class of technology at least the way this statement uh put it so you know i think there's a good argument to be made that this thing is separate but you can imagine treasury saying well look we are sanctioning tornado cash that's a broad thing and if you're just you know redeploying the exact same code we consider that part of the designation now i think that designation is overbroad because they're designating things that aren't people but they're doing it and so if they think that's proper they could consider any redeployment of the same code to be part of the designation not you know so we don't know i guess this is the ultimate that's our goal and do you find that this action maybe signals the beginning of some kind of war on privacy in blockchain technology like should privacy coin builders and users be on the lookout for for things like that to happen in the future so um [Music] potentially but i don't think but i'm not sure this signals the beginning of a war on crypto in the sense that i don't think this is part of a master plan uh for which this is the first step and there are many pla many other steps already in in the works that will be dulled out i don't think that's the case i think this is bofak and treasury dealing with a specific thing which is north korea's sanctions and they're they wanted to send a message about that at the same time however i think what's increasingly happening now that crypto is over 10 years old we're finally getting to the stage where regulators and law enforcement have for over a decade been it's been easy for them to go to intermediaries block transactions to you know carry out you know their purposes and increasingly as this technology has matured and the vision uh decentralized all the things is becoming more and more real they're um coming to the conclusion that when they go to say okay well normally we would go here's a mixer let's block it they realize oh wait a minute there's nothing here there is a automated process here and i think at that point they're applying the same thing they're applying the same traditional rules that they would apply to a centralized entity to decentralized entities and that's giving us these crazy results right the same you see the same thing with the sec their recent rulemaking that's ongoing about redefining uh or reinterpreting the definition of what an exchange is under the securities act where basically they're saying that potentially smart contracts on the ethereum network are an exchange that makes no sense but they're they're applying those rules okay all right well we will have to see what happens because in general i feel covering this space that yeah there's a lot of uncertainty in how these old rules apply in this new world so thank you for keeping us posted on the latest and i'll probably have somebody back from coin center in the future to tell us all about the next development but yes thank you so much for coming on the show thanks for having me don't forget next up is the weekly news recap stick around for this weekend crypto after this short break join over 10

coinbase reports a major net loss the largest us crypto exchange coinbase released its second quarter earnings report and revealed a net loss of 1.1 billion dollars even though the loss was higher than expected analysts had estimated it would be 546 million dollars cfo alicia haas explained that much of it was caused by non-cash impairments meaning the crypto on coinbase's balance sheet due to accounting rules its value was measured at the lowest point reached in the quarter excluding those non-cash impairments our net loss would have been 647 million dollars she said in the earnings call coinbase named three reasons for the 30 decline in trading volume against the last quarter first u.s retail customers were less active second a large amount of volume took place at offshore exchanges lastly coinbase had no exposure to the trading volumes related to the collapses or bankruptcies of luna three arrows capital celsius and voyager despite being in the red the coinbase team seems confident that the situation will be reversed down markets are not as bad as they seem down markets are builders markets if we continue to focus on building the right products and services we will emerge stronger than before the company said in the shareholder letter coinbase highlighting its strong financial position believes it has ample liquidity to fund its business through a prolonged stressed market environment shares of coinbase dropped five percent after the release of the report however only a day after that the consumer price index report came out to save the day the market reaction to the inflation numbers spurred coin to rise as much as 7.37 on wednesday ethereum is closer to the merge than ever ethereum testnet gourley was successfully integrated with the beacon chain this means that it switched from a proof of work to proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and it marks another huge milestone for the merge ethereum has essentially passed the final test before the merge as gourley was the last testnet that needed to switch to proof of stake over the past few months ethereum developers had also successfully integrated other test nets like sepolia and robsten into the beacon chain with the girly merged test done ethereum should perform the full merge on mainnet next month likely on september 15th or 16th according to a call among ethereum developers after the favorable outcome of the girly merge lido and ethereum sticking platform saw its token ldo jump 18 ldo is trading at around 2.70 and has a market cap of 800 million dollars when and if the merge occurs some analysts such as kevin zhou of galwa capital are weighing the possibility of an ethereum proof of work fork some exchanges including poloniex bitmex and mex c have confirmed they would list an ethereum proof of work token however circle the company behind stable coin usdc announced it will solely support the ethereum proof of stake chain post merge in addition binance claimed it would be supporting the merge but did not rule out supporting an eth proof of work coin in case of newly forked tokens we will evaluate and consider support for distribution and withdrawal the exchange said inflation goes under and markets soar july's cpi came in lower than expected causing crypto prices to rocket analysts were estimating 8.7 percent inflation year over year and 0.2 monthly inflation but the national bureau of statistics reported 8.5 percent and 0 respectively the reaction of the market was positive for all assets including cryptocurrencies btc and eth the two largest cryptos by market cap increased more than seven percent and 12 respectively in addition the total crypto market capitalization expanded by 100 billion dollars going from 1.1 trillion to 1.2 trillion this was positive for the markets because it signals to the federal reserve that the economy is cooling down making it unnecessary to raise interest rates when interest rates are lower money is cheaper and there is more capital to allocate into risk on assets like cryptocurrencies however there is no consensus among investors on whether inflation has peaked or whether the fed will slow down quantitative tightening bloomberg columnist mohamed el-erian said the fed has had a couple of really good data reports which suggests to them that they can continue doing what they're doing because the underlying strength of the economy is still significant still there are others who are more positive with cpi confirmed to have peaked fed pivot is next additionally for eth girly merge is later tonight and main net date will be set tomorrow the stage is set for a move to roughly 2k region by end of week wrote hal press founder of northrock digital blackrock offers direct bitcoin exposure investment manager blackrock launched a private trust that will be focused solely on bitcoin the trust will be offered to institutional clients in the united states and is the first product provided by blackrock that gives direct exposure to bitcoin despite the steep downturn in the digital asset market we are still seeing substantial interest from some institutional clients and how to efficiently and cost effectively access these assets using our technology and product capabilities wrote the company on its website last week coinbase announced a partnership with blackrock to offer crypto investments to its institutional clients through coinbase prime blackrock is the world's largest asset manager with 10 trillion dollars in adsense under management these two moves show the company's interest in the sector and also hint that institutions may finally be coming could maker dow dump its usdc maker co-founder roon christensen proposed that maker dow sell its usdc reserves which would cause the stablecoin die to dpeg from the us dollar he floated this idea on the dao's discord channel due to the sanctions imposed by the us treasury on tornado cache the sanctions prompted circle to freeze usdc in the blacklisted wallets the sanctions are a lot more serious than i first thought he said at the moment dai is backed 60 percent by usdc according to dye stats.com if the dow decided to abandon ustc it is most likely that dai will lose its peg with the dollar the idea received harsh criticisms from industry leaders ethereum creator vitalik buterin considers it a risky and terrible idea as he worries about the systemic risks that a major drawdown in eath prices could cause robert luschner founder of compound finance was not keen on the proposition either converting dye into a price elastic asset will ruin it full stop he tweeted progressive senators ask occ to rescind rules allowing banks to engage with crypto a group of democratic senators including elizabeth warren and bernie sanders wrote an open letter to the office of the controller of the currency requesting more restrictions on banks engaging with crypto in light of recent turmoil in the crypto market we are concerned that the occ's actions on crypto may have exposed the banking system to unnecessary risk and ask that you withdraw existing interpretive letters that have permitted banks to engage in certain crypto related activities the senators pointed out that in light of the terra luna collapse and the bankruptcies of celsius and voyager it is clear that stronger protections are necessary to mitigate cryptos risks to the financial system and consumers in other regulation news the securities and exchange commission and commodities futures trading commission made a joint proposal to require hedge funds to disclose cryptocurrency exposure this will help protect investors and maintain fair orderly and efficient markets said sec chairman gary gensler on a related note the united nations development arm also warned developing countries against crypto it recommended introducing regulations on crypto usage due to the risks of tax collection monetary policy and financial stability d5 protocol curve gets hacked curve a decentralized exchange for stable coins suffered an attack worth more than five hundred thousand dollars the exploit was quite simple the domain name service dns which basically translate a domain like unchainedpodcast.com to an ip address got hijacked the hacker's strategy was to modify the ip address translated by the dns for curve.phi within an hour curve announced that it had been able to revert the issue and recommended users revoke all contracts approved on curve in the previous hours after establishing that no one is safe from front-end attacks the curve team suggested that moving to ethereum name service the crypto equivalent of dns might be a good solution to this problem time for fun bits it's been a while since we've heard from dave portnoy who might be known to the world as the founder of bar stool sports but is known to the crypto community as paper hands portnoy for buying one million dollars worth of bitcoin at a price of eleven thousand five hundred dollars but then selling just weeks later he's back in the news now because he's being sued over safe moon also someone came to his door announcing that he was suing him and that part isn't necessarily funny portnoy bought forty thousand dollars of safe moon last year calling it his favorite coin but now it's down almost 90 and he's getting sued by people who accuse him of pumping the coin he tweeted i'm only guy who loses all his money in safe moon and gets sued for it he added all right well thanks for tuning in to this episode
