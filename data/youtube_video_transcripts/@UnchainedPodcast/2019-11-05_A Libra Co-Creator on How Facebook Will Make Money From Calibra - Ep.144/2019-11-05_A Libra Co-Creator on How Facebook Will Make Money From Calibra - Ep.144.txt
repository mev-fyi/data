welcome Christian it's a pleasure to be here Laura Libra has been one of the biggest crypto stories of the year though we will talk about whether or not this is being usurped from that status but first let's dive into your background what were you doing before you got involved with Libra and how did you become its co-creator so I started getting interested in cryptocurrencies and blockchain around 2013 when we could design the research study around the MIT Bitcoin experiment and after that a lot of my research really developed closer and closer to different applications of blockchain its potential for you know democratizing access to financial services and to really trigger a new wave of innovation across a variety of different industry verticals from there at some point I was in touch with Morgan Bell who at the time was exploring you know a number of different ideas around our Facebook could be active in the blockchain space and we were discussing actually a research project you know how can we use crypto currency or a blockchain application to really build on financial inclusion potentially as a small-scale experiment in a region you know from there conversation became much more serious and at some point I decided Menlo Park and David there was still at messenger we're starting to think about building a team around this effort and that's when it really became clear that you know if I if I wanted to kind of help shape this I would have to go and leave and take this on as a full-time effort now the idea being that we had a blank slate we had a you know fairly aligned mission on on really building a blockchain and cryptocurrency to deliver financial inclusion and from there there were just you know a very long series of hard technical problems on the economic side on the engineering computer science side that we would have to solve over over the next months to come up with an initial prototype and design for what this new type of network could look like and just for reference going forward when you said David you were talking about David Marcus who is the former president of PayPal used to be a board member at coin base and is now head of Calibra I'm sure his name will come up again so it didn't during this time before you guys went public with your plans with Libre when you were brainstorming at this and designing the system what did that process look like like how did you define the problem and then how did you come up with leaper as the solution and you know what were the different design choices you considered and like decided against or you know what why did you decide on the design choices you made yes you know what was interesting is that and this was something where the initial team was really aligned on well as we wanted to start from the problem we were trying to solve having been following you know the cryptocurrency space for multiple years I was kind of frustrated by the fact that I saw so much potential into technology but on the other hand when you looked at its potential to actual deliver on the potential there were big gaps in many different aspects so if you think about you know last mile issues in in delivering a service around remittances or all sort of use cases that I thought we're really exciting and at the potential 12 a large segment of the population that is excluded or or underserved by the current system that's that's where you know we started from we started from this idea that it was clear to us that the technology was ideal for for expanding access for providing new types of services at a lower cost and on a global scale at the same time there were you know massive challenges in terms of scaling in terms of different trade-offs that you have to make when you're trying to take that that idea and that vision into something that can actually be built and so the the initial months were you know intensive are in Demon's and I think what what I you know when I looked back at those months what was most exciting was really that we had talent from different domains of expertise people with deep experience in building you know large scale products people with deep expertise in scaling engineering systems and you know data centers people with a background in cryptography and and also people with you know a lot of admiration for what was happening in the cryptocurrency space so we we looked at you know very much every possible permutation of either technological solution building on an existing new rails and it became very clear that for what we were trying to do we would have to take a slightly different approach and I'm sure that you know if you look at the choices we've made different people will have different opinions if those are good choices or not but they all really boil it down to this idea of like how do we create an extremely efficient cheap fast medium of exchange that can help you know all sort of cross-border activity starting of course with remittances which we saw as a major use case where people were charged exorbitant fees you know if you look at the World Bank data I think the average is about 7% but that really is a wide dispersion around that 7% so in some regions intra-regional exchanges enough I can charge as much as twenty thirty percent and that's simply you know unacceptable so starting from those challenges it became you know clear that for example we needed to prioritize the asset the coin having intrinsic value and and of course that comes with some drawbacks from from architectural standpoint because now you have a reserve which you really want to make sure it's not kind of a central point of failure but it was really important to us to have an asset that wouldn't be speculative and that wouldn't provide wide swings in in volatility because we realize if that were the case and yet you know a large number of people accessing this network it could also be extremely harmful so that's where we started around this first concept of stability and bringing in kind of intrinsic value behind the coin the the outer next you know design decision that was you know of course debated in every possible direction was like the permission setup so the idea that we had to start with asset permission nodes and and that really boils down from two things the first one is that you know when you look at a lot of the really talented engineering and R&D happening in the cryptocurrency space there's no solution at scale at the moment at least that either through proof of work or proof of stake can support the network at the scale that we really breckenridge and so working backwards we realized we needed to kind of bootstrap the entire system from from trust that's already established you know offline and that's where the trusted brands and initial institutions come into play they're kind of seeding this new network securing it defending it and trying to scale it together now of course you know as an economist when I looked at at a permission setup you know the first thing that comes to mind is a taxi medallion system and so it's you know you get an immediate aversion to that and that's why you know the Libra set up Auto permission as some important tweaks that often are not talked about but I think are really important from an economics perspective so you know you start with a set of 100 founding members and nodes but really what you introduce over time is competition so you know what when I look at permissionless I think permissionless is one of this words that that really imbeds many different things to many different people as an economy is what matters to me the most about permissionless is the idea that anybody can compete anybody can build on top of the system anybody can can have the same degree of access so if I'm a startup I should be able to be fully interoperable and and you know play on the same level playing field either with a large financial incumbent or a tech incumbent well if we if we can use the same rail if we have the same degree of access to the network that that dimension of permission is to me is really important now that that applies both to the network level right if you have a number of nodes operating the network you want competition for being a node so that over time the best node operators the people that know how to secure and scale the network are the ones in charge of the infrastructure but you also want and this is actually more subtle and it's you know we have a paper on market design with some researchers at Harvard where we're looking at market market equilibrium level implications of different consensus models something that was really important to at least the economics team in the early days and and again I want to preface that a lot of what I'm discussing were the ideas as originally incubated within Facebook but as you know now a lot of this is transitioning over to the Association so going forward this won't be just Facebook effort in terms of refining the design by going back to kind of the you know the aspects of permission is that really mattered to us was like if we want this network to be through shared infrastructure that everybody can build and compete on then we also need to make sure that there's not new vectors of concentration so if you take something like proof of work which I think it's extremely effective to solve certain types of problems it also leads to extreme concentration on other dimensions think about you know for example mining mining fairly concentrated just not just from an operational perspective but also from a hardware and infrastructure perspective right so anyone that can get a big leap in R&D our mining can control indirectly a big part of the ecosystem similarly you know I think we've seen us in proof award chains concentration in custody and so once you start thinking about all these problems it really doesn't become clear what the best model should be for a network that can start potentially with set founding members but really expand and become more open and competitive so that's where you know we started tweaking a number of different dimensions and and again the design is far from complete and that's why when we when we announced the idea was to gather a lot of feedback and ideas and a really crowd-sourced part of the iterations both around the open source code base but also around some of the economic principle of of Libre Wow so we're gonna unpack so much of what you described there thank you so much for your really full and considered answer I actually wanted to ask a little bit more about this period when you guys were planning so as you have probably seen after you released the white paper you know there was a pretty strong reaction from regulators but I do know that before you guys did publish the white paper that you also actually did spend some time talking with regulators so were you aware that they would have such serious concerns and that there would be kind of such big blowback around you know your history with things like the Cambridge analytic a data breach or how you know Russia used Facebook to try to influence the 2016 election like was that part of your strategy you know as well but before you release the white paper like did you have an awareness that would happen so first of all again we realized that this is a regulated space and that we would need to engage with regulators even before announcement and so that's what we did we had extensive meetings both in the US and abroad of course you know there's a broader constituency that is interested in this and so after announcement I think things killed up substantially you know on your point about Facebook kind of being the initial messenger of this I think it's important to to remind ourselves that we were able to make a number of choices that are pretty innovative and new in this space at least for for tech it's very rare for for a tech company to make some of the choices that we were able to make on the protocol exactly because I think there was an understanding within Facebook that a new model for trust in digital platforms a new model for you know you know exploring different business models was really important to be developed and so you know when you look at the design of Libra it's not meant to be kind of a wallet garden or kind of a silent solution I think there's been very successful payment solutions that are kind of flirty fairly centralized and have digitized cash in other regions of the globe this is not what Libra is really about it's kind of the opposite and and so although it was incubated at Facebook now passing over governance and control Facebook is now only one of 21 members as October 14th of 2019 at the association with this new distributed governance structure I think there's a real commitment to interoperability to ensuring that this is a network where you can have low switching cost and were ultimately you know consumers across the globe and merchants and other service providers will have will have more choice that that was really the core of you know the original economic principles around the network and and again I think we were aware that we would face a high degree of scrutiny when you tried to innovate in any regulated industry by design I think you know what you're designing what you're pushing out will not fit exactly into the existing regulatory frameworks because because it's new and you know it would have been hard for regulators riding laws 30 40 50 years ago to predict that technology like blockchain could come around and you could build marketplaces in this new way and so this is the phase we're in I think there's a number of very constructive feedback coming from many of the regulators and the technical staff from central banks to institutions like the SEC and others and it's been extremely helpful in a sense you know we want to be aware of what the challenges are of what the questions are and we want to make sure that the network really can fulfill its promise and its mission so you know if we launch something that didn't fit into into the regulatory framework or didn't address some of the concerns of central banks or other stakeholders we would have failed anyways and so this phase although it's difficult of course because you know you see a lot of pressure in many different directions is one of very intense design and fine-tuning of that initial concept and you know what's exciting to me is that you know now it's not just us incubating internally within the Calibra team but it's the other the other twenty founding members many of which have deep expertise in other verticals you know there's NGOs and nonprofits for example that that really understand what it means to operate in regions of the globe where people don't have any access to financial services and we're even issues like kyc and identity are extremely problematic you have universities that can bring a lot of expertise on some of these topics and then you have players that I think really believe that a network of this type could streamline their operations and so there's a fairly selfish business objective there of reducing costs and reducing frictions within their own operations and those are the kind of players that I think are needed in this space because as you know a lot of pressure a lot of regulatory pools and pushes in different directions but if you can get the design right I think you'd be a very constructive phase yeah and to dive into that a little bit more I noticed that your criteria for lever Association members are that they should have a market value of more than a billion dollars or more than five hundred million dollars in customer balances and must reach more than twenty million people a year multi annually and you have slightly different standards for like crypto investing companies or blockchain infrastructure companies but I was curious because you know it seems like you guys were being so strategic in the ways you thought about who you brought on and obviously when you initially not announced you had a number of payments companies but now Visa MasterCard PayPal booking companies and all those had to leave or or they decided to leave stripe others so what what goals were you trying to accomplish by having so many payment companies as members and what does that mean now for the project that almost all the payment companies have left yes so you know and this is part of really that idea of an open technology standards so bootstrapping a platform that can have real utility from the early days you know any network like Libre as a massive 2 sided network affects problem you need users and you need applications right so for the coin to be useful and for the coin to be a good vehicle for something like a remittance or a cross-border payment well there need to be on and off ramps and people need to be able to come in and out very effectively especially at the beginning right is what I can expect decision yeah for conversion so the idea of bringing around founding members was twofold so first of all these are institutions that have a brand they have a reputation at stake and so when you think about for example many of the permutations that we're seeing in the space are on proof of stake models one of the challenges is that as you all know that nothing at stake issue and so you can think of the seating group as a way to work around the nothing at stake bottom of a proof of stake model by bringing in these distrusted brands we were trying to bootstrap the network and ensure that essentially you know if you're running a node you have a lot more to lose by not operating it correctly because your brand is online you know to your more specific question about changes in the composition this is a difficult journey and you know as you know there's been all sort of different pressure much of which was public and so many of this payment company of course are regulated institutions and they were under additional pressure especially in this phase of uncertainty but it's really important to remember that the platform is open so you you can be you don't need to be a founding member to build a product on this platform and so I think there's also reasons for many of these players and other players to kind of wait and see get the founding member to kind of Shepherd this through through this difficult phase where you know there's additional pressure and then and then come and build one once that is resolved so again of course it's a setback because when you think about on and off-ramps payment companies play a major role pay you is still a member of the Association and they're very active in many of the important markets especially from a financial inclusion perspective but more broadly I think my sense is that you know over time the association will be able to expand is its founding member set and so the goal is still to launch bit you know maybe is it 6800 founding members at launch and and that set will actually be much more global in nature will represent many different verticals the idea is really to seed the network with the best possible players to ensure that this thing is used and Seoul's people's problems it was reported that Libra will be made up of 50% US dollars in US bonds 18% euro assets 14% Japanese yen 11 percent British pound 7% Singaporean dollars and I know obviously you had this goal to create the most stable currency but so you know I'm not a Forex person I was trying to do some research on this as far as I can understand you know currencies basically just have real value in relation to each other and when I was literally googling things like what is the most stable currency like that none of the sites were giving the same answer so then I started to wonder whether there was any kind of objective measurement of this and so basically I was just wondering how did you define stability for the globe because I think that will basically impact different populations differently and so you know from there how did you end up deciding on this on these assets and this mix yeah so there's a lot to unpack there first of all again the percentages are just a proposal and right now you know there would be a work stream at the Association and so all the founding members will work together on that final composition and in evolving the concept of the basket from our perspective the objective has always been thinking about value preservation right so if you're using the network if you're trusting this network with some of your savings that maybe you're trying to send abroad as a remittance how can we ensure that that promise is kept and so you know we wanted an effort to be global in nature otherwise you could have imagined you know pegging it just to the US dollar now the advantages of the basket and again there's a history here that traces back to some of the concept that the IMF for example has been working on with the SDR is that when you think about the perspective of many different foreign countries if you're back to only one asset now you you're really successful to the volatility and in variation that's coming from that one single one now for some regions of the globe it may not matter because they're already fairly dollarized but from a more global angle and a more global perspective one of the key advantages of the basket is that first you have a diversified set of assets but also that you know it's kind of a more global representation of a set of central banks that have a history of stability low inflation and really strong independence and so that was the inspiration on the basket something that I want to demystify is you know often this is considered as a basket stable coin you can't really build a global stable coin right it's an oxymoron prices and basket of goods and services that people consume in different regions of the globe even within the same country if you think about you know rural versus urban parts of different countries are fundamentally different and so that's that's also behind the idea that libros should not have any role in monetary policy simply because you know it's it's not the role of an association of this type 212 people smooth consumption around that basket what what something like the reserve can do though is ensure that in aggregate you're kind of backing the coin with assets that provide stability low inflation and and guarantee you know lower spread relative to your local currency now of course you know if you live in a country that's going through eiper inflation or that as wide swings in in volatility in their own region Libre will be volatile like against that there's no there's no way to buffer that and and this is where you know I think when you think about what what Libre is useful for it's really useful for cross-border payments remittances things where people are already incurring a lot of effects fees and conversion fees a lot of additional fees added through the value chain and if you do have this global medium of exchange you can not only cut a bunch of middleman's out of the picture but you can also streamline at that operation and offer something that you know we believe would be a valuable additional toolkit and in somebody's digital wallet so I'm glad that you brought up the IMF Special Drawing rights basket because as you probably know in 2016 they did add the Chinese renminbi at 2:00 to that and so I wondered if you ever thought it would make sense for the leaper Association to use Chinese currency to back Libra so again this is a decision that the Association would have to make in the future we started mostly from you know historical conditions of stability low volatility and low inflation and so the the five sets that are in the proposed basket where we're selected that way so that's why you know the the basket was defined and so so basically you know you're saying it's out of my hands but do you think it could ever make sense again that's a decision for the Libra Association to make in the future and so let's say that at some point they decided that the renminbi would be part of Libra if after that the Chinese government came to the Liebherr Association or even to calibra and said hey we want you to block access to Libra tokens for these specific Hong Kongers or for these specific Chinese dissidents with the fact that Libra holds renminbi in the reserve give any weight to their request or like would they be able to harm the Libra in any way if you didn't if they didn't comply or like you know how do you think the Libra Association would respond to that yeah I think you know taking taking a step back first I think if the Association were to in the future expand the basket they would have to consider all the possible ramifications of that decision anyways it's important to remind that you know the basket is not meant to be actively managed so the idea is to set it and keep it stable that way for a long period of time to your more specific question about you know conditions and censorship within a certain country or a certain region something that's important to realize is that all the wallets and custodians operating in a region will have to comply being kind of financially regulated entities with the rules and regulation of that country so if a wallet is operating in China or any other region they would have to follow you know whatever the restrictions are of that specific region so this is already true in the network as it's currently designed so I don't think it would be any different in the scenario described okay actually from Mark from Mark Zuckerburg testimony it wasn't totally clear to me if it was impossible but just for the way he answered his questions that seemed like it might be possible well to create anonymous wallets but you're saying that every single wallet will be K by seed so there will be you know noncustodial wallets on the public chain and you know what's important to consider though is that many of the essentially all of the on and off ramps the authorized resellers and exchanges that are authorized will essentially apply kyc AML and there's a new framework that the association is working on to really kind of describe all of this different aspects okay so then I'm sure you've heard this question before but so if if that's the case then how how will that affect your goal of thanking the unbanked who maybe in many cases don't have really strong their identity verification yeah and you know that this is where it's really great that there are founding members that are really active from an NGO perspective in regions where that's exactly the problem you described I think over time the opiez really to lift up kyc and identity standards maybe even in collaboration with international organizations that can help you let's say you're working in a refugee camp or in a condition where you do need a trusted intermediary that could be a global NGO to certify that this person actually should be allowed on the network you know going back to the broader problem of last-mile issues this is not something that we can solve in one single swoop it will take time and especially on the unbanked i think the promise is in regions were you already have wide smartphone penetration and people may be using you know the the classic $30 Android device it may have access to data that's where you can start you do need often that in combination with strong identity you know some regions I've made good progress on this if you think about India others are lagging behind but it will be you know it will be a long term effort and I think there's among the founding members many of them feel this problem of identity because they're operating many different countries often they have to deal with cash and so I think you will see the the Financial Inclusion piece advance together with with broader broader infrastructure on identity and kyc again what went up and overnight but I think the NGOs can play a major role in in really identifying solutions that that feel both the void from you know people that come without strong identification but also without excluding them completely from the network and this is where you know did the public chain allowing for small cash like transactions could be quite quite meaningful we're gonna discuss more about how Libre can help Bank the unbanked but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible today's episode is brought to

AML reports quarterly WWC fruit-trees comm /keep crypto clean back to my conversation with christian kattiline ii so actually before we talk a little bit more about this unbanked issue i was curious to hear how calibra and facebook will make money from your efforts here yeah so there's a number of dimensions where something like Calibra is a complement to facebook existing business model so what's interesting is that when you think about you know our remittances are happening today people may be going to a kiosk or you know a store and essentially pay for a remittance take a picture of the receipt and send it over a messaging app somewhere across the globe so ironically those transactions are kind of already happening facilitated through the platform the additional challenge being that people pay very heavy fees on that leg on that little trip of data across the globe and so you know you can see facilitating that as being one more way that users can be engaged on the platform and can be actively using the platform for the different needs there's a large number of small businesses I believe it's about you know 90 million at least that are active on on Facebook's different properties and you know for them payments and the ability to really move move value it could be quite important especially because many of these even if they're if they're trying to pay for ads or if they're trying to sell some goods you know payments are a friction and payments may be costly in in their current framework so again that's another that's another important dimension and more broadly I think this relates also to I think some of the pushback on privacy with Calibra there's really a strong effort in showing that the company can innovate around different types of business models and with a different type of long term view about you know other product to shape over time one of the things that was near and dear to my heart when when I was probing David in that initial meeting about okay if we want to design this right for example what about privacy and I think from the very beginning there was an understanding that people you know at least in the u.s. in many other Western countries do not want their social and financial data to be commingled that's something that many feel strongly about and so if you look at some of the commitments that have been made for calibra the idea is really to explore new types of business models in the long run and new types of innovation and applications that do not involve that link and so that that was something that was really important to me and to many other people on the team and and so I think you know when you're part of a platform in an ecosystem like Libre first of all you're pushing the company to beyond the frontier of a really important wave of innovation but second there's there's strong complementarities with with things that are already happening on the platform and you know going back to the cash example there's there's people in in different regions and this is a small relatively smaller use case but they're trying to buy ads and and can't because they don't really have a payment solution so there's also very practical reasons for why this could be good for for the ecosystem okay so it sounds like from Facebook's perspective it's a way to diversify revenue to bring in a stream that isn't necessarily dependent on advertising or selling data but that may be then within the app itself the way you guys are making money is by charging fees I wasn't clear on that actually because I I've seen like for instance in the white paper it said low - no cause and then I saw Kevin say in an article in the verge that there might be a small fee just to cover fraud and charge backs but not a fee to use the payment itself so can you just define you know or maybe you haven't figured it out yet I don't know do you know what the fee structure will look like to use Calibra yeah so on calibra again a lot of this is still working progress but the the goal is certainly to go as closely to zero as possible right because again going back to the 7% charge for remittances on average globally the word bank sustainable development goals as a goal of 3% and so I think this is an effort that can push much lower than 3% and you know again close to zero as possible I think where fees may may be more more reasonable is actually the merchant side so and this reflects I think some of the current business models where consumers don't pay for some of these fees and then there's small fees for merchant services merchants need all the additional feature and functionality around charge bags fraud and everything else but again this is this is an area that we will have to see and it may also vary by region depending on what the integrations look like the objective is you know over over the short-term and medium-term to really bring this available at almost zero cost but then again once you start thinking about AML kyc there are additional structural cost that of course you can subsidize for a long term and so I think it'd be important for a wallet like a Libra to understand what is the best way to to cover those fees and ensure that the platform is both secure but also responds to the kind of functionality people have come to expect from a digital payment service you know if you're locked out of a your wallet or if you your wallet gets taken over those are all additional features that I think protect consumers and so those are all features that that calibre would support and and of course that will come at a cost okay and so yeah that was my other question about the chargebacks so it's not literally that you're like reversing the lever transaction it sounds like that's not possible you're just charging the fees so that way you can make the whole if anything goes wrong is that correct yes and and again if a transaction is between a merchant that's using Calibra or a user that's using calibra in that case it's even simpler because it could be reconciled within the system if it's between two wallets that have in a business relationship we did within each other because maybe they transact often with each other there could also be an operational part there if it's on the public chain yes you know that couldn't be reversed but of course you know the agreement with the end-user would cover that oh oh now I got it okay okay so basically you're sort of like a coin base where if the payment is happening all within the calibra ecosystem then you guys can just update your records but if it's you know between acally per user and somebody not in the clipper system but it's still using the libra currency then that obviously probably can't be reversed but you can make them whole is that okay I think you would really depend on on you know what triggered the reversal so but my sense is that it will reflect a lot of what people have come to expect from existing platform so it won't be different than that okay so now let's talk about the regulator's again I am trying to figure out you know what what signals are you looking for from US regulators to decide whether or not you should go forward or not go forward can you break it down maybe by the particular agencies like do you need some sign from the SEC that this isn't a security or are you waiting for something from Congress or like obviously then here we've got the g7 saying you guys should not go ahead until you've proven that it's safe and secure so just you have kind of like a checklist of the things that you need before you can say like we're okay so you know I think a lot of these regulators are I've already given us some homework in terms of like what are the kind of questions that they want more detailed answers on and so I would look for you know further announcement by the Association in the coming months about many different dimensions that people care about I already mentioned for example AML and kyc that's the dimension that many regulators for example Treasury and others are focused on but again I think like we like we said before we want to launch this once we have kind of a green light and we feel like that all the stakeholders are kind of happy with the design and so you know in the u.s. of course in in Switzerland the relevant one is fin ma and I think what's been great about Switzerland as a home for this is that FEMA and the regulatory framework as you know in Switzerland has been fairly advanced when it comes to cryptocurrencies blockchain stable coins and some of these issues so you know you may have seen the filmic guidelines on payment networks those are things that we're looking really closely at to really ensure that this network can not only integrate but also operate across different regions and that's really the challenge here there's no global framework for anything like this and so what kind of the first ones to explore that and that requires additional work and obviously I'm sure you're aware that the scenario that potentially the Libra association could go forward without Facebook has come up a few different times what would need to happen for Facebook to say okay you know what this is the way that this will go forward is Facebook will leave and will no longer be a part of the Libra association again I think you know we've seen Facebook's commitment to this over a long period of time all the same phase of very high pressure it's not a project that has gained Facebook I think any any favors or friends but you know if you roll back to the mission I think Facebook is in a good position to really delivering on that goal of financial inclusion having platforms like whatsapp and messenger reach and connect people and allow them to move value again I think you'll see tremendous pressure on all of the members as we go through and and that's that's really important for the project to I think the ultimate test is that the Association and this goes back to the economic design and my blockchain is so important you don't in the moment you have like one single entity that is a single point of failure for the Association then the project is is not really designed right or hasn't reached a stage where it's designed right so I think in the future it shouldn't matter whatever entity leaves or joins that the project should be self-standing and be able to support itself and evolve so that you can think of that as an important test of the Association itself and one thing I was curious about was that in one of the initial white papers you stated that one of the goals of the Association would be to minimize the associations role as a manager of the Libre Reserve and instead fully automate reserve management I didn't know what fully-automated mean does that mean like using some kind of algorithm to we're to manage it or like obviously here in blockchain world we've got you know things like dows and where people can vote with their tokens so I didn't know what what does that mean like do you have a vision for that or yeah and again you know many of these are hypotheticals and are projecting us into the future but I you know when we looked at all the designs and there's many designs in the crypto space which I think are really clever but you know from an economics perspective my main my main concern about many of them is that at their core they're always based on expectations and so if you look at some of the things that have been experimented with if you have a changing expectations of any type whether about the technology the market the regulatory uncertainty all of those assets or many of those assets can really collapse to zero and so here we wanted something that didn't have that property and so taking a step back and this is something that I think it's it's misunderstood about Libra but Libra is really designed to be a complement to good monetary policy to good central banking not a substitute and so the future were the reserve could be automated or could even fade away is actually one where you know maybe central banks have worked hard to develop central bank digital currencies and those can be just integrated maybe it's a you know a cross chain link between two different block chains you don't need to manage your reserve and and do all these additional operations to digitize assets because already digital and and again in in that scenario you can think of central banks of course keeping their domain over monetary policy over building stable assets that people can trust and rely on and the Libra network on top enabling a sort of functionality across borders in program ability to move and so on and so there's really like this concept of a public-private partnership where the public sector of course is in charge of the public good which is retaining the value of those assets and managing issuing them and doing everything else they do today and you have layered on top a very efficient payment network that can really activate all sort of new use cases that build on those assets and so you know when the word automation I think you know it's kind of inappropriate in a sense I would be like a scenario where the CBD sees are present and you can kind of integrate from the bottom up these assets on the network and then the association doesn't even need to manage a basket doesn't need to need to manage the assets because the assets are just created and maintained by somebody else and they're linked on on the libre blockchain when they're need to be used it's fascinating all right so let's talk about something else that has been a huge theme especially this last week so whoever controls the dominant global stable coin whatever it is that they will be hugely powerful and and obviously whichever existing currencies that that global stable coin is tied to will also benefit and that appeared to be the basis of Facebook's argument during the recent congressional hearing featuring mark zuckerberg so libras ability to thwart the threat from china was you know i guess a big part of the thinking for why maybe the u.s. at least should support Libra now and I thought that kind of the argument from Facebook seemed like a pretty big contrast from a few years ago when mark did the smog jog in Beijing and was learning Mandarin you know all in his effort to have Facebook enter the Chinese market so how did Facebook's attempt to operate in China and form this current thinking that Libra is the best counterweight to China's digital currency plans so you know a lot of those conversations and discussions are before me even joining the Facebook team so I can't really comment to that but I can speak towards the the broader I think context so I mean if right now and this is not actually specific to blockchain and if you look at some of the conversations around five g's some of the conversations around quantum computing there's a number of different technological sectors where there's different approaches to innovation and you know financial services and digital digital money of course it's one of them I think we we have a current infrastructure and a current way for example were you know the u.s. Canon can enforce sanctions and and other toolkits in the in the current system I think what what's important to realize here first of all is that inhibition will come in different flavors and forms and as you all know blockchain is just an encrypted currency in general it's just a tool and so the way you apply that tool really defines the emergent properties of that system so with Libra what was important to us was that the emergent properties were close to some of the Western values that you know you can think about dimensions like privacy dimensions like free market competition on top of the network ability to startups to enter and compete all these different elements that have been seeded into the economic design stability monetary policy and that's why you know the basket the proposed basket as as those currencies in it set all these different dimensions were we're there to really build a network that that can offer a lot of choice and can port over some of those values but of course you know I think we'll see innovation from many different entities and many different countries there will be different approaches and I think what would be interesting to see is which one of these networks can actually ultimately deliver the most value to to users across the globe but it is important to keep in mind that I think there's a tension between different approaches right so more controlled versus more distributed ones and and that's a fascinating part of the entire block chain space issues of free speech and financial power have come up a lot in the last month both around Facebook especially with political ads and around the nba's and Blizzard Entertainment's sort of like voluntary censorship or punishment of free speech to please the Chinese Communist Party is there some sense within Facebook now that financial freedom and free speech are related in some fashion or that financial freedom is an extension of free speech and if so is that kind of part of your mission now with Libre as well or in general how do you think about those two themes I mean those are really complex issues that you know trust and money and the flow of value but I think it's really important to realize that if you if you're able to build a network that allows for competition and allows for different types of players to come in and build different solutions eventually consumers will have a choice and so through that choice they have an indirect way to vote with their wallet no pun there and and express their preferences so you know this this relates to everything from issues like privacy to would you rather have a subscription model or pay-as-you-go when consumers have choice there's a mechanism on a platform like Libre to express their values and to have a low-friction way to participate in governance and so that's that's I think what's really important in a network like Deborah is that you allow for all those different approaches to come in and coexist and then the market can sort out you know which ones work in certain regions are not in others and that's I think it's an important property combined with the fact that again in Libra at scale no single entity can unilaterally shape the evolution of the network I think that's an important guarantee to really reflect a democratic representation of different stakeholders and and and users on that system so that's that's where I think it will also matter for issues like free speech and other values that people deeply care about the countries whose citizens could benefit most from Libre I guess leaving China aside although I guess they have plenty of other options now those are basically they all say the countries that have an incentive to either block or at least put up hurdles to the adoption of Libra and I mean you can already see I think like India this is even before Libra came on the scene was really you know has been really opposed to cryptocurrencies and I'm wondering does the Calibra or the does calibra or the leaper association have any ideas on how to overcome this fact that the countries that could benefit from Libre the most are also the ones that have an incentive to kind of block it so you know those are real challenges and relates to our conversation that we were having before about last mile frictions I think more broadly you know if the network provides value take the example of remittances in some regions of the globe remittances are larger than FDI so foreign direct investment they're a meaningful economic flow that can have really positive impact on the ability for an economic region to develop you know my when when I was at MIT my colleagues have needs jewelry did a lot of work on mobile money and what's interesting about mobile money for example in Kenya is that when this flows of remittances reach directly women in the household the way more effective in being converted into for example school tuition fees and things that that really help that that family entity to to grow and and kind of withstand economic hardship so you know I I think the the reaction by some countries in some countries are already banning cryptocurrencies more broadly and so Calibra won't be able to operate in those regions some others may try initially to just block this because they see it as as a threat in different shapes or forms but going back to that conversation with different regulators I think you know and and things like the g7 stable coin report I think it's really important to take the concerns of different types of countries seriously and and work through you know what is the scenario in which Libra can still fulfill its mission within the specific needs of a certain locality it would be a working process I think you know some regions have been extremely successful at digitizing cash making about China or even in India first starting with the identity system and then the unified payment solution but all these systems are not really interoperable with each other and so you land with a system of you know very national payment infrastructure that doesn't talk to each other and there are global needs and so I think more broadly if Libra can become this efficient medium of exchange across different regions over time I think you'll be in the interest of many of these regions to come online and and be connected to the rest of the globe but again I think it'd be it'd be a process that takes a number of years to unfold well one other thing I was wondering was so if Libra does become widely adopted and weaker economies and soon we see a majority of citizens and let's just say you know one of those economies it starts holding their savings in Libra then couldn't that weaken that central bank and then would Li would Libra in effect play a similar role to that of an actual central bank and you know what what kind of effect do you think that would have on the stability of that country yeah so first of all it's important to remember that you know Libra is really optimized for cross-border transactions it's elected that you'll be using Libra to pay for coffee domestically because now you're kind of taking on foreign exchange exposure and so it is a medium that's really optimized for that country to country payment now in some regions of course the local currency may be I leave ala tile and so people may look at Libra as a store of value of sorts but here the challenge again is one where the walnuts and the entities operating in that region will have to comply with the region's rules and so if there are capital controls they'll be applicable to Libra in a very similar way that they're applicable today to to banking and financial institutions and so the idea is that you know that that really kind of changes that the relationship with we look at monetary policy the idea is again for Libra to integrate and and and not be a tread to monetary policy whether it's you know a large nation or a smaller one and I think you know it would take it would take a number of years for really developing a framework that allows for example for cross-border payments to come in especially regions that are way more worried about capital outflows or people running away from their home currency you know as you were talking about there is gonna be friction for people when they're converting in and out of Libra so then I just want to talk about this tension of like how much it is that Libra really will help the unbanked like let's say that I'm in India and I'm having to convert from rupees to buy Libra I pay a little fees I pay some fees I lose a little meeting but then later when I want to use that money then again I'm gonna pay some fees and lose something change weight to convert back to rupees so in what scenarios would it make sense for somebody to buy Libre would it literally be just if they're sending money somewhere abroad so of course it starts with the receiving and sending of money so think about the remittance use case but then over time I think this is where the founding members and the broader set of initial participants in the Association is really important you could imagine all sort of new use cases so maybe you receive the remittance through your telco operator and that telco operator is part of the Libre Association and so now you can use it to buy airtime to spend it as mobile money or maybe you know the the partner of the Association that you're relying on is a merchant a merchant that is active in that region and now you can take your remittance and spend it and exchange it for goods and services removing those last mile frictions I think it's something that again will take a long period of time but it's really important for ensuring that not only you're cutting and reducing fees on the sending the the you know value from A to B but also in what can you do once you've received it how much friction are you now incurring in a specific region an important feature here of the design is that there's an incentive for different private entities and exchanges and other intermediaries to come in and fill that gap so when you look at the reserve the reserve will interface with a group of authorized resellers that will make a market for Libra and essentially these will be the entities that will capture and transmit market demand do you need more coins you need less coins essentially do we need to mint and burn at the reserve level they will be able to charge a small spread and similarly they will be interfacing with exchanges including some of the crypto ones for example and these exchanges will also be able to charge a small fee now the good thing about the spread is that if I see someone in my region charging to I have a spread maybe that's a big opportunity for me to come in and compete with them and so over time the the competitive forces on on and off ramps hopefully will drive people to be very creative and entrepreneurial and allow all sort of on and off ramps to develop I think there's an opportunity here and you know other startups in the crypto space I've tried this before but there's massive friction building different types of on and off ramps where if you do have kyc you can really example convenience or some other end point to become a way where consumers can come in and out of the network this is really interesting and now I really see what the potential would have been if you had had Visa and MasterCard as part of the Association but I guess from what you said earlier it sounds like they can still build something on the Libre Network maybe you know just not as part of the Association itself but obviously then if that were the case they would have a ton of different merchants in countries all over the world obviously that you know where users who receive payments and Libra could then just also make payments in that Libra so okay so why don't we move on just unconscious at the time one other thing obviously here in the US that's been hugely important to the regulators and obviously to everyday people just like if I you know think about discussions I've had with people outside the crypto world you know the number one thing they say when they hear that Facebook is building a cryptocurrency usually has something to do with data and privacy and I noticed in the congressional hearing that Mark Zuckerberg said that Facebook is building a privacy program for people's data that's equivalent to sarbanes-oxley and he said that it you know will apply to your handling of people's financial data includes things like quarterly audits can you tell us more about this program like what data covers how does it work against things like you know law enforcement requests you know what level of detail you'll have about particular users or transactions stuff like that yeah so I can speak more about you know Calibra of course the idea here is that you know how do you ensure that those two data sets are not connected you have a number of solutions and an essentially over time the goal is really to to push this to to encryption and all these mechanisms access control there's a number of different technical and of course organizational solutions that really allow you to prove at any point in time that it's actually the case and so from the early design and this actually required a massive you know engineering effort I read to think through you know how do you keep these two systems completely separate how do you you know essentially ensure that while you're promising is actually always always true and so that that that work is I think it's really important because at the end of the story you know I wanted like a Libra will have turn users trust otherwise there'll be other alternatives on the network and so it's really important that those controls and those different data data checkboxes are always maintained okay and so then I actually just want to ask a little bit more about this Bank secrecy action AML which is on the ground like can you walk me through what it will be like as a user when I try to open a calibra wallet what steps will walk me through what information will it want from me and I want to think about this in the context also of you know your target audience which is the unbanked you know what kinds of data do they normally have or data ID verification do they normally have and how are you thinking about kind of both the requirements of these regulations as well as just sort of how things operate in the real world for this unbanked population yeah I think you know from caliber perspective it's really important that the network is safe and secure and cannot be abused and so there would be a very strong AML and kyc program which of course you know will be a friction on onboarding so sometimes people think about you know Facebook has more than 2 billion users and so this network around the wallet could grow really rapidly but they do forget that there'll be substantial friction in in joining calibra you will have to upload you know your national document and I think here to a combination of new technological solutions the goal is really to not only but really exceed the current standards around AML and kyc I think you know we tend to forget how ineffective the current system is at blocking different types of financial crime and so yeah the user experience again will require a full kyc process and you know the the other expectations of systems like this will all be fulfilled you know from from your point of view of the unbanked that that's gonna be a challenge and so this is where I think the Association working collectively on standards like an Open identity protocol and also solving on the ground through NGOs some of these issues in regions were you don't have a reliable identity system will take time it's I agree it's not optimal in the sense that it excludes some segments that are probably the ones I would benefit the most on day one but you know this last mile issues are real and they will need a lot of work by different stakeholders not just calibra to be resolved and so do that have the NGOs given you ideas on how to resolve that tension I think there's been small-scale experiments and in different regions you know take for example refugee camps and and and there's many international organizations including the UN and others that have done work around this so again I think from the NGO perspective they realized this is this is a massive challenge that not even a network like Libre on its own can solve and I think my personal oh is that an open identity protocol that you know the Association may develop over time could really help also because it could lower friction for different governments and different entities across the globe to coordinate around shared infrastructure and also ensure at the same time that all of this is developed with privacy by design in mind so the Association I think in its early work stream has been thinking really seriously about how do we ensure privacy by design and how do we scale this up over time on different elements like identity kyc and and everything else okay you know what I want to ask you more about the site open identity standard but I wanted to make one comment - which is that I think of one idea for the NGOs is also to train people and using non-custodial wallets right because if those are going to exist on the network then that would be a way of like them kind of becoming quote-unquote banks without having to use a bank arisu but i wanted to ask about this open identity standards so you know i read that in one of your white papers and i wondered if you guys were still gonna work on that based on the reaction as you could see from the wider public about the idea of facebook having more data on users but it sounds like you're saying this could be something like a protocol that the Libre Association creates is that is that the idea and if so you know what would that look like what it would it be based on your Facebook identity or how would that work yeah so and again a lot of this is is early stage work at the Association level and so I I can only really speak on behalf of calibra on this but the intention is definitely not to make it a Facebook standard but to make it something that it's fully interoperable that gives users control over their data and you know ultimately that avoids fragmentation it's actually a very similar problem to the one that we face on on cross-border payments we have all these silent solutions that don't speak to each other I think you know David was joking that after he guided the acquisition of venmo at PayPal you can still not send a payment between those two different platforms identity I think is in a similar spot you need something that is an open open standard so that people feel comfortable building on something where they know that they'll be on a leveling playing field with their competitors I think it's it's it's from an economics perspective what is interesting about all of these problems is that their massive coordination challenges would real benefit from in a cross-border network that allows for cheap fast and secure payments I think the answer is yes how do we get to coordinate on that is the big challenge similarly on identity I think there's been a number of projects around more open structures for ident and some of these I think are getting traction and I'm sure that Libre Association will be interested in in partnering and opening up to to what's happening already organically but more broadly identity is a massive challenge for many of the initial founding members they operate in many different countries they may have you know they may be interact with users or suppliers are or different workers and in different regions and so lifting up standards on identity I think is the best way to eventually deliver on that mission of financial inclusion and and also going back to your previous point non-custodial wallets can play an important role in ceding some of these early use cases and even if they if they are mostly focused on small balances and small cash like transactions that could be very meaningful for some of these segments that are severely under banked and it's so going forward do you still think that the association will be able to launch the network in the first half of 2020 again you know the timeline is is in the hands I think on many dimensions of different regulators and regulatory bodies the goal is is of course to meet that deadline but also to get things right so you know be useless if we launched early and we didn't have kind of the blessing of the core institution so I think it will really depend how much we can improve the design and really show concrete proposals I think again what's been exciting for me is that now we're working together with a number of founding members that have really clever ideas around issues like ml and kyc or are really thinking about privacy and other dimensions of the all ecosystem and so now there's there's a lot more talent that is thinking about the same problems and so hopefully we'll be able to show that not only we've taken a lot of the feedback at art and very seriously and but we're also really iterating on that and trying to find a solution to often being pulled in many different directions but one that can satisfy again everybody that that that really matters for making this network a
