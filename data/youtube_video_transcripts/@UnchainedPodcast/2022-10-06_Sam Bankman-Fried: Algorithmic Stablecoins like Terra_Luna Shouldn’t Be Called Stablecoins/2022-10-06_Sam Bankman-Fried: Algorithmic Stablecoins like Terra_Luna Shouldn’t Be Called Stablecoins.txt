do you think that type of algorithmic stablecoin could ever work or do you think that pretty much they're always going to end up with this downward spiral effect well it depends on could work I mean it was kind of a cool thing right it's like a cool concept but it's super risky and I think it's always going to be super risky right you're not going to escape that part of it and so I think she's like I just wouldn't even think of it as a stable coin like I don't know whether it's the kind of thing that like like if you wanted it to exist you'd have to exist in such a way there was not really being granted as a stable point it's being branded as an algorithmic weird kind of thing in  you know that was like not not all that stable and like you know it should be thought of as an investment not as a store of wealth that is you know kind of safe
