Bitcoin which is flooding with its biggest Weekly game in almost two years we've been in the bear market for almost 18 months now name a date don't name a price name a price don't name a date science of a bull market or bull trap Bitcoin serving 34 since last Friday for its best week since January 2021. all right where do you think the crypto markets will go for the rest of the year what I'm really hopeful on the crypto markets is that first of all they're going to break the correlation with the trademy market the year started off with an upper Trend in crypto prices however the collapses of silvergate Bank Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in the last couple weeks plus the continued concern about the banking system have really supercharged the markets does all this mean the end of crypto winter I think like if the macro markets do not uh like you know go crazy or you know something catastrophic doesn't happen like Fred increasing rates again which looks highly unlikely I think it will be like stabilized and we will have like slow so you know kind of uh movement upwards itself that's what I feel not Financial advice of course what can we expect in 2023 so I'm gonna go ahead and say I think we end the year somewhere between 20 to 40K um up for Bitcoin so I think we're gonna stay fairly flat don't see any huge new inflows coming into the crypto space this year in the next few months um we'll probably retest the base with rates looking to go higher um and things looking a bit edgy with events like silvergate but otherwise I remain bullish and think we'll recover in the second half of the year I have always been very uncomfortable with the idea that major coins like Bitcoin and ethereum trade up and down with the NASDAQ or with the S P 500 that if they are an alternative system they should be an alternative system and guess what that's exactly what we're starting to finally see in the last couple of weeks as people are starting to see crypto go up why the traffic markets struggle that's good I think retail we've seen some Akon the recent um and the D Bank talking in the United States but we haven't seen any major institutional flows materialized and I don't see any new on-ramp materializing that are going to drive large-scale multi-billion dollar institutional posts I think Q4 when the next happening is going to come in and all that all those things those conversations start happening then I think uh you know we can probably probably start going back to normal we're also coming off 2022 which was one of the most tumultuous years for crypto still 89 of American crypto users have not lost their trust in intermediaries to hold their digital assets this includes Banks exchanges and Mobile payment apps according to a survey conducted by paxos in early 2023. um I think you can see there's been a lot of washout of negativity over the last year and a lot of the large positionings out and the Market's really set for a lot of consolidation and that consolidation phase means like um yeah this is somewhat encouraging what I've been seeing out of crypto that it is starting to show that it is something more than just you know a 3X triple cues ETF which is unfortunately what it looked a lot like in 21 and 22. and when you see going back to normal what do you mean normal means like you know good projects doing good work they uh you know like their their price Discovery and their communities are more happier instead of like everything going to you know imploding almost what do you think is going to happen in the crypto markets over the next several months let us know in the comments thank you
