co-founders of solana labs welcome anatoly and raj awesome to be here thanks for having us so you and solana have had quite the year seoul started the year at less than two dollars and it's currently trading at over 200 the market cap went from 86 million dollars at the beginning of the year to 68 billion dollars so how do you guys feel about solana's trajectory so far in 2021 pretty good right this is better yeah i mean yeah it's good it's good to to see you know the thesis play out i think it's the the original one was that if crypto took off and if it's value prepositions found product market fit and if any of the the dreams of what you know uh a world computer a global permissionless distributed ledger you know if any of those dreams could come true then the demand would be you know a thousand or ten thousand x what we had seen before and it would happen really fast and i think that's what's been happening over the last couple years and anatoly's design for solana the network is is pretty well suited to that demand and all the use cases and i think the best part is just seeing people have that like i i think there's like the iphone moment that moment where you see the transaction propagate you see you know um an account balance change from one browser window to another or from your browser to your phone and it's just instant and there were effectively no fees and i think we're gonna have more and more of those experiences that just feel really magical and that's i think that's the most exciting part to me and anatoly do you want to add anything yeah i'm you know i'm an engineer so what like it's just really cool to see people use your work and like the last hackathon having almost 600 teams form just blew my mind because that was more than all the other hackathons combined during our conference like so many developers just wanted to talk to me and shake my hand and like it's just like i love those vibes you know i'm a nerd [Laughter] yeah i get you i'm a nerd i'm not an engineer but i'm a nerd um so anatoly you were in the show before and you kind of gave your background then but maybe for listeners who didn't hear in the episode why don't you kind of give a brief recap of it and then obviously raj you have not been on the show before so we can also have you give yours and you guys can kind of talk about how you came together yeah i'm uh the briefest background is i'm a qualcomm engineer that wanted to build a high performance blockchain and here we are okay okay um how can i be brief too uh well yeah i mean you haven't been on the show before so you can flush it out a little bit more of you i met raj along the way and here we are yeah my background originally was in in finance and venture capital so i started at general catalyst partners in boston that was you know entrepreneurs investing in entrepreneurs people that had built you know a lot of big internet companies and lotus notes and you know i'd seen like every cycle in in the tech business before and then i started a company in health tech called sano which is a glucose sensor company that's going to be hitting the market soon it got acquired later and then i was at omada health which was an a16z backed company and sold into health insurance companies with uh behavioral health intervention connected scale and pedometer and and health coach so i think really like before crypto my journey was building products in the heavily regulated um you know slow really untouched by by technology like healthcare industry and you know seeking the wedge to rebuild that industry from the ground up the way that we had seen you know entertainment and media and you know in newspapers and um and you know message boards and just everything get rebuilt so many times i think i wanted to see healthcare get rebuilt and then you know i left omada thinking about building another health tech company and and met anatoly and i think totally gave me the confidence that all those weird engineers that i had talked to and all those experiments i had seen in in crypto over the the prior you know five or six years had a chance at you know really finding their moment and and reaching a billion people and that the world would look a lot better that way so uh my you know my journey in crypto jumping in was just basically trying to get everything out of venatuli's way and help him build a team and get the funding that you know they could get this project off the ground okay so at this moment just in terms of crypto history i'm sure you you're all very well aware that the ecosystem is just kind of diversifying in a lot of different ways in terms of the way this technology is being applied you know obviously we started with kind of like basic transactions and payments and then it sort of went to trading and defy nft art nft gaming dows dows in the last week suddenly everybody's talking about dads again um obviously now social with uh your announcement about alexis ohanian wanting to invest or investing 100 million dollars into building social media and solana so i'm just curious that like you know in general do you see solana is focusing in any of these particular niches or do you just see solana's being sort of a go-to platform for all kinds of crypto use cases and people will just do with it whatever they like i think it's general and uh we always i always have this dream of a billion people with self-custody signing stuff doesn't matter what it is doesn't matter what they're doing i just want them to like have possession of those keys and kind of have that mental model these are my magic words i'm signing with them it's doing stuff in this one shared global experience that's cryptographically controlled you know that that's like the overall kind of like vision and it's not a super well formed because i kind of feel it's the same vision as like 1995 web people had about the internet it's going to be a billion people on the web they're all going to be publishing stuff and clicking links what does that mean nobody knows right like but we got to build it we got to build it as fast as we can and i think all the experiments like taos nfts all those things that get people to try this stuff these are all like worthwhile to do like it doesn't matter really right now what the use cases are as long as you're engaging people getting them to do this and like getting them to self-custody and like start participating in these networks and raj what about you um yeah i mean i think it's still so early and even just the idea of people participating with you know art and collectibles and having a direct relationship to artists and then building communities around you know those art collections and that being the onboarding path for most users to participate in d5 for the first time or collect their money towards things like buying the constitution it's just it's too unpredictable to act like there is one vertical that's gonna dominate you know all crypto usage and adoption um and if anatoly's vision of unpredictable but beautiful things happening when a billion people understand their ability to sign transactions directly is the goal then whatever path to get there i think is is is what you know we're focused on on helping get off the ground and at this point it's not even i think solana labs or um or any one actor in the ecosystem that's fostering these different use cases they're just emerging as fast as we can think of them and as fast as you know one team can find product market fit for anything like a new you know gaming economic design or you know a new format for collectibles and bringing ip on on chain as soon as any of them finds value i think what we're finding is that that original thesis of performance mattering for every use case is just continually playing out right it's always better if it's cheaper and faster and higher throughput and i think the part that we're just starting to see is how composability between vastly different use cases um creates more opportunity for serendipity and emergent use cases that may not have existed before okay so so you're not like trying to position yourself as the platform that is better for one of these use cases over another because i feel like early on it kind of was maybe a little bit more about like high frequency type of things or or just more about that throughput but but now now you're you're sort of like well whatever people want to do with it is so the the high frequency finance this idea of like a price discovery engine blockchain and nasdaq speed that was always like that's the obvious that's gotta work like if that if that if that doesn't work then we're totally wrong and that was the tip of the spear but like we kind of realized as we were building this that what like you're not gonna you know like there's this idea of the web being run by the ad exchange that's a centralized market steal your data right then they try to keep you on a platform and feed you data you don't want that loop is driven by that ad market solana runs markets right if we can replace that market with other markets let's say for people trading nfts then that's also finance right that's also high frequency finance because for that for that even to be a possibility the decentralized market that's for nfts needs to be as cheap as the ad exchange it needs to be at that like micro cent you know level of of transaction costs for eve for that even to be a remote possibility so it's not that i think we're gonna see nasdaq shut down and all the stock started trading on solana is that the rest of the world that's going to start using permissionless decentralized marketplaces for coordination for content creation for monetizing artists directly that's going to grow so much faster than you'll forget about the other stuff it's just going to be like the most boring place nasdaq is going to be the most boring place in the world well the way that i think about it is i guess what i've learned i think totally and i have learned together and like the whole crypto industry is learning is that everything is finance and everything is a marketplace and every marketplace can be disintermediated and made more efficient with blockchain and when you do that it's better if it's faster and cheaper so i mean i think in a way like it's still d5 it's just we're learning that everything is defy huh okay i like that that's interesting and and it makes sense um to a certain extent which i'll ask you about in a little bit but i did want to ask you know if you're saying that you know you don't you're not trying to target specific niches for the uh 314 million dollar fund that you guys raised this past summer uh you know are you focusing that in any particular area like i'm sure there must be a way that you're allocating it you know so i was curious about maybe the percentages or yeah it's not a it's not thesis it's really people driven it's like you find that founder that's like has that look in their eyes i'm gonna get 100 million people to do this thing on blockchain and those are the people that like we we those are the people we're looking for those are people try to back and all we try to do is just get stuff out of the way is the tack then we get the attack out of the way do they need funding either you know we invest or usually we don't even get a chance to invest because there's so many hungry vcs now making the same bets and like our goal is to just like find those people and help them okay all right well so i'm sure you know and this goes back to what we were saying about you know fast and cheap is really good however obviously solana did go offline in september for 18 hours when you had these bots that were spamming the network to try to get in on this initial decentralized exchange offering what were your takeaways from what happened then uh that people know who we are the amount of the amount of uh tweets that i got from uh people that are enjoying other blockchains what was it saying i i got a lot of opinions about about that what was interesting to me as an engineer was how quickly the validators because we stressed us them all the time on this like the whole point of beta was that once the network runs that they should be able to recover it no matter what happens like arbitrary failure something goes wrong all the data centers are set on fire these state level attacks that people talk about there's always some way to recover it and we test the validators on this at least once a month on a test not but never like it never got tested live and this was them doing it on their own and it worked that was like cool we can actually like it's done like we can walk away and he'll keep running forever as long as people wanted to wanted to keep running so that that to me was was really cool to see the other takeaway uh obviously was that like we we did a pretty good job i think like with how fast people are able to respond and start debugging and like seeing the issues i feel like i don't know what what other lesson did i learn do we need to move slower or do we need to move faster probably should be moving faster the opportunity to like on board the next billion users is just so huge that like the stuff physics kind of might happen it sucks you know there are people that know how to fix it and uh you know we gotta keep our eye on the most important target which is get people to use blockchains and so the fix that you put in at the time was something like um just making sure that the messages regarding consensus were always prioritized if and please feel free to correct me there's like uh there was so much spam that some of the validators were starting to see like physical link line failures basically they were overwhelmed with spam before a block producer can create a block so a previous attack called the shanghai attack on ethereum was actually an attack at the block level but a block producer was making blocks that were so big that they were overwhelming the network this was prior to that before block producer could even make a block somebody was spamming the networks with so many transactions that things were starting to run out of memory it was taking so long to catch up and effectively as soon as more than a third of the nodes kind of ran out of memory and crashed and couldn't catch back up to the network while the network was still trying to propose forks the validators recognize okay this is maybe unattendable without us clearing out all the all of the dead forks and just kind of like letting the network continue from the last confirm point that makes sense so the fix was just better prioritization prior to creating these blogs and being able to drop messages when there's a flood without uh losing consensus so yeah in fact effectively what you described i don't i don't want to get into the details because you got to go dig through the code for the exact actual changes but was that fix sufficient for the long term or was it just kind of like a temporary patch or like you know like is there more that you could do now or are doing now to kind of prevent that in the future or was that patch like pretty much it for that as an engineer i can tell you that there's no there's no generic fix that could fix all attack vectors there's specific fixes for specific attack vectors and this one was actually tested um there's been a bunch of other floods and an attack similar to that since that so far seems like we did we did the right changes and so far things are working but it's unknown whether there's some corner case it could also do another resource exhaustion and cause the network to solve okay and and i i actually don't know because i you know you mentioned the shanghai attacks on ethereum and obviously what saved the blockchain at that time was that it had multiple clients and i'm not sure in solana um you know what is the situation with that do you have multiple clients or is there just a single one uh there's a single client and eventually multiple clients will be a thing that's just you know early days so the block reported that at solana breakpoint which was your recent conference that when asked about solana going offline during that time that you said it doesn't matter if the next block takes 72 hours to process it that's but only it only matters for people who need transactions to happen in milliseconds can you elaborate a little bit more on your thoughts yeah so there's like two issues right like are my fonts safe am i am i safe right as a bit as a bitcoin holder somebody from that use case folks that care about like just keeping their funds safe those outages are pain in the ass but they're not like they never risk the person's funds if you have a bunch of usdc right you self-custody your keys there's a network outage it doesn't really matter because circle has custody of their ledger that copy of the ledger is not affected and the network can continue from arbitrary failures as long as there's at least one node like circle some dapps or pc node anybody in the world that has a valid copy that can repopulate the network and let it continue so no matter what right state level attack whatever people imagine there's always an escape hatch the issue is that that works for like i'm holding i'm just sitting on my funds and not doing anything with them and i don't care if i get to transact today or tomorrow but reality is that all applications that are real world applications need to send their messages now they need them to be cheap and fast and arrive right within short amount of time and this is why they even want to use blockchain in the first place the reality is that like for real world use cases liveness is the most important thing that's the thing that needs to be you know extremely high confidence with you know nine nines of update okay so i'm sure you probably saw this tweet but at that time neha narula of the mit digital currency initiative tweeted if your validator community can easily coordinate for a network restart what's to prevent them from coordinating to block transactions or contracts when compelled to by the sec what's your response to that question feels like people are saying [Music] disorganization is a requirement for decentralization i think that's a little strange um the thing is is that like they are the way that they operate isn't a way to compel them to do anything they don't have a choice to to like process one set of transactions or another they approve blocks if there's a block proposal with a set of transactions it's opaque to them what they are right at the end of the day the folks that interpret those bits in the validator and display to the human that these are dollars or these are coins or these are securities or not securities right at that point of the interface this is where somebody says this thing you're trading or this thing you're signing that thing has value that's where regulation should occur not at like the att network switch level right so because the validators are basically running a switch they're on a box the box run autonomously they they make sure that it stays up and that's it like what what other like actions do they take and yeah raj do you want to add anything to that no i think the question has been answered like a hundred times on on podcasts and interviews and twitter the most annoying thing about the the outage is just the reception from people that aren't actually using the network and the way that they have chosen to conflate that issue with one that is you know catastrophic to the network or um or that would result in a loss of funds or one that would you know cause an exodus of users or uh or developers and we've seen none of that right it's it just hasn't happened i i think of it in terms of the consequence to the you know the network and the reputation of the network i think it's as significant as the twitter fail whale was when twitter was seeing its first big waves of explosive user growth yeah there were days where it was you know all you saw was a fail whale it was an icon that said you know we we couldn't handle this much load this moment at this stage of growth of the network but you know the moment it was back everyone comes back they're using it um they're prepared to deal with those farewell moments and over time you know the uh the platform stabilizes and you know the uh the end state of growth and adoption is is not 100 times uh you know what it was two days before or four days before at some point you know you you've grown past those growing pains i think we're just you know seeing growing pains in the network and when we talk to people that actually use the network and that um you know that have built for it and have built you know some of the largest and most well-adopted applications these are not catastrophic or existential issues for them it's it's more the perception and you know how repetitive the narrative around it is that that starts to become an issue but you know there are worse things to deal with in life yeah i did see chris dixon tweet that there will always be more demand for block space than there is block space i think he actually tweeted this in reference to some tweets about ethereum this weekend which we will discuss later but um i think it also applies in this case and frankly you know i think in a way though i you know one thing that is interesting to me is that i do think the reason that solana fell victim to this attack by bots is because the blockchain is so cheap so i don't know if you have any response to that that was the the attack vector was prior before you could even check if the transactions that were being proposed by these bots could pay for the for the usage so it's really before a block producer could even like make a make a decision are these things valid it didn't really actually impact the the block level like level of constraints that you see in ethereum or other evm chains so even prior before we could even execute things there was just kind of a flood of messages across the network that started to grow in size because the number of pending transactions to evaluate was just queued up you can think of it as a mempool so when the all the all these cues blew up validators ran out of memory and crashed that was the bug the thing wasn't like capped and it wasn't doing just some simple quality of service and i can only get blame myself but but then but what about that point about how it was so cheap are you saying that now because there is a check on how much funds they have that then that kind of attack wouldn't be possible or i mean it wasn't a purposeful attack it was so so if if uh the block producer had resources to to evaluate all those transactions nearly all of them would be dropped because they were invalid oh i see okay so basically it was just basically pre-blocked not like invalid transaction spam effectively okay so that's why at this point then this would is no longer an issue okay um so i also saw that coindesk reported that at solana break point a lot of attendees saw it saw solana as a chance to make money and don't really care about decentralization and the author called these people trading mercenaries and or sorry i think it was the attendee and said they found other people like them that were there and so i'm assuming you probably don't agree with that characterization of the community but i was wondering you know assuming that's at least some part of that is true how do you make this momentum that you currently have for solana sustainable just go hang out at the hacker house or at the dev developer side of the conference that was that was that was where i was getting all my energy just like talking to armani to bartosz daffy all the folks building like these awesome apps that are growing in users that was that was really really cool and like during that just during the hackathon there were i like walked into the the house for the first time it was packed with people just coding and like on this whiteboard somebody scribbled like a prize for uh like 50k prize to go build something so it's that energy of people that i just want to build is there and all the other kind of folks that come in and out of the the coin enjoyers um it's fine it's just part of life i don't know the event organizers maybe did to too good a job of uh of keeping you know all the speculators away from the hackers you know i i think most folks who had that perception of breakpoint didn't even know that there was a hacker house or that there were two other venues where teams were forming and building and you know had it was just like sweat and tears and monitors and whiteboards you know a lot of those teams aren't looking for funding so they weren't exactly trying to you know go shake hands and introduce themselves to a bunch of investors but you know i mean speculation is absolutely a powerful force in the existence and the progress that that crypto has made to date right i mean none of this exists without people um speculating about the value that's going to get created and the speculators now have seen enough cycles to know that the place they should be spending their time is where developers are spending their time and the reason there are a lot of speculators invest you know investing and interested in the salon ecosystem is because the developer ecosystem is is exploding if if if it wasn't they wouldn't be here they wouldn't have shown up to break point i i also i think i think being i would like to see the industry have a little more you know respect for people that are capital allocators um you know there have been years where it was difficult to do it and difficult to stick through and i know the salon ecosystem has had a lot of capital allocators that have been very patient capital very thesis driven capital um and you know if they're still showing up um and you know flying to lisbon and and um and spending time with all these hackers and and trying to you know be helpful i think is not something that should be ashamed and when you talk to developers what in particular attracts them to solana over other uh smart contract platforms that is a good question because usually our motto is you're gonna have to eat some glass to build an application uh i i don't you know i think a lot of it has to do with with the fact that it is a from scratch re rebuilt of a high performance blockchain that there wasn't it's all new tech and that means it's rough around the edges and to some people that's a um that's a hurdle but to folks that are like this is cool this is cool technology i can see why you made these choices i can see like you were principled about what you were doing and they like get it they actually want to build on top and it's an opportunity to like build awesome things like anchor right we didn't build an sdk because we didn't have time or resources to do so and we just built a really really fast blockchain and when people saw that one of those people was this awesome dev armani that like moved mountains basically single-handedly built like probably like the you know i think the one of the most popular developing tools in all of kryptonaut just for for solano so things like that i think are you know engineers like you can't like really sell to them it's gotta tickle their curiosity you gotta show them that there's a something interesting there that they can use this as a tool to build thing that they're imagining that kind of like they can barely reach and get there that makes sense yeah that's um i i totally understand that um so in a moment we're going to talk more about kind of where solana fits in compared to some other similar blockchains

at brave.com unchained back to my conversation with anatoly and raj so as i'm sure you're very well aware solana is often seen as competitive with ethereum how do you see the two block chains in the future do you just see them as coexisting do you see them as taking different niches do you see them as kind of like competing head to head and one of them coming out on top like you know what what does that feature look like to you probably all of the above but some some of these scenarios don't are uh mutually exclusive not not all at the same time but there's you know like settlement is just a feature right like all all byzantine fault tolerance systems that have smart contracts also do settlement so when this idea that we will talk about settlement layer for ethereum well every blockchain does that's just the feature right so what does that mean for ethereum those are like questions in terms of like where are people going to go what changes are they going to use where the benefits and compounding effects start to accrue it's hard to know where that stuff plays out you can kind of see multiple features where there is a global settlement layer called ethereum there is a global execution layer called solana and those are symbiotic right but you can also see a feature where well settlement's just a feature i'm going to deploy my coin at the cheapest possible settlement layer because i don't want to extract any value from my users right like so you as a somebody that's building these decentralized organizations where do you want to where do you want it to work right where do you want to collaborate where do you want to coordinate your community that place you want it to be minimally extractive like do you want it to be the cheapest fastest place or something else so those decisions people are going to make and we'll see how it plays out those are unknown unknowns i know what we're building is a really really fast high performance execution layer but settlement is a feature of that thing too and raj do you have an opinion on this hard to know how how the world ends up playing out yeah i mean i think ethereum has like four times as much lindy effect as as solana and that lindy effect has incredible value so you know right now most of the assets are on ethereum and i think you know one of the one of the biggest reasons for that is that you know there's a first mover advantage um there's uh you know an amount of trust that um continues to build up over time as as the network persists without any catastrophic failures or loss of funds or you know major consensus failures and that's you know only time can make up for that and solana will always have you know will always be younger than ethereum um you know at least the proof-of-work version of ethereum so i mean i think the biggest difference between the two right now is that one is proof of work and one is proof of stake and one came you know several years before the other um and as long as that has value um and those two you know designs have uh different purposes and functions that they'll they'll both continue to be valuable and i know that you tweeted before ethereum cannot be killed it's impossible and it's already a beautiful force of good in the world empowering millions and creating billions in wealth bitcoin is quite obviously this the same and this tweet was in response to someone who i guess had been framing um kind of the competition between the blockchain said well you basically after you finish this tweet as stop framing it as a fight so how do you prefer to frame what's happening here where we do have you know these multiple smart contract layer ones kind of trying to all gain market share at the same time it's like solana polka dot avalanche alcor and near i mean which by the way is a former sponsor of my show and then ethereum so what's your take on they're all they're all growing right every single one of those platforms is growing right now and we all still feel like we're just at the beginning right i think we all feel like there's possibility for a 1000x of the space in the next like year or two so you know each of those uh platforms has a thousand x opportunity and i don't think any of them is going to capture all 1000 x of it right so i think the thing we should be focused on is how do we make sure that 1000x happens what are all the forces that keep that thousand x from happening um and let's make it happen as f as fast as possible and you know the same way that we trained you know billions of people to use qwerty keyboards and mouse and you know usernames and passwords and subject lines and email addresses right it's all complicated stuff like that's the focus is let's get everyone learning this new complicated piece of technology that generally looks and works the same no matter what platform you're on let's get a billion people or four billion people using it as fast as we can and the market will decide the you know the mark the division of uh of value and uh and market share for different platforms based on their you know performance characteristics or usability or cultural you know focus um but i think we should just be focused on you know making at least some of these blockchain dreams come true as fast as possible and whatever technology you know helps people get there faster and get over that um i think um you know we should all be getting behind including ethereum bitcoin solana all everything else i'm a competitive person i like i like the competition not not in the sense that i ever want to kill my opponent right i want to i want to have a good battle and i want to learn from it so i i think like the really cool thing about crypto is is so widely different than working at a big tech firm is that everyone is really open all the almost all of the at least all the top chains you know the folks you mentioned they're all open source open source first they publish their ideas they want people to kind of get behind what they're building their technical vision they're effectively giving away their secrets right there's no trade secrets here they're not hiding their attack and all of these things are now available to everyone else right there's no reason why solana couldn't borrow the tech that the ethereum folks is researching right now and implement sharding not that not that i'm saying that will ever happen because i i have my own vision but there's also no reason why the ethereum folks can look at what we're doing what we accomplish through and shift and be like okay this is actually a really good way to scale the execution layer right that it's all open that and that competition is really accelerating how quickly things get built how quickly products ship how quickly adoption happens um it's awesome so neon labs is building an ethereum virtual machine on solana and there's already a number of apps that are dapps that plan to deploy on the neon evm once that once that's in place what do you think will happen to the theory market share when it comes to d5 um what what do you mean like do you think ethereum as it's do you think folks are gonna just jump ship and leave ethereum and go to neon i mean i hope that happens but for d for d5 on ethereum i do wonder that right because if we're just looking at throughput and block time like all these things like those are what i would imagine would be the features that would attract you know d5 even more so than things like nfts um although sorry nft art nfc gaming is a different story um but you know i it's just i'm sure you can see where i'm going with this it just sort of looks a little bit more purpose-built for that use right i think that people like leaving ethereum is is just never going to happen like those folks that built ethereum like kane likes donnie they're going to stay there and that's fine those applications may be multi-chain but those are true ethereum devs and neon can help them accelerate like there's some people that are like hey i want to run away on mia and that's going to happen and those folks will participate in those things in those protocols but i think reality is that what should happen is that the benefits of evm and solana is that you can start building new applications and solidity running any vm that cannot take leverage and participate in the broader solana ecosystem right they can call out to serum and that's a new set of applications that are going to grow on solana you it's it's just really rare that you see somebody like abandon and move right like what you see or what real success looks like is with the new thing just outgrows the old um and that's far more likely you you know does that make sense yeah i mean so i i didn't necessarily mean because you said like if you know you didn't expect stani would leave ethereum so this refers to stony kuleshov who founded ave and ave is going to deploy on neon uh evm but i didn't necessarily mean that he would stop building on ethereum but more that for whatever tv total value locked is in ave that we might see quite a big flow oh i don't know you yeah you tell me game theory optimal for anybody you know who um now has a path to not have to fork their development team and and spread its focus over two different languages to be able to franchise their brand to any new chain where users are being acquired because if they don't then somebody else will do it right they'll fork it um they'll launch it on that chain they'll have a name that probably rhymes you know and and they'll try and eat that new segment of users and market because you know the the original team wasn't going after it so i think it's it's not a a cultural question or a values question it's just game theory it's it's optimal for them to do that but then i think you know you're you you are onto something because if you look at brave um you know and and what brennan nike has decided to do is um even if there is a franchise of an ethereum based um application on solana that's deployed on neon and it's on you know multiple evm chains they've chosen to default to the solana version in all you know in the brave wallet and the brave you know swap interface because they see value in you know the user accounts and balances all being simple and unified for the end user so there's pretty clear value to an end user um and i think if you see more you know platforms taking that stance on neon deployed versions of you know originally ethereum based applications you could you know you could see some some meaningful movement but we don't know yet right yeah actually what when do you expect that that will be finished 2022 sometime you're talking about brave or neon no sorry yeah neon neon should be going live within a few weeks i think they're in the final stretch of i don't know i hope i didn't leave anything but like they're in the final strat for what i could tell as an engineer they're basically just in the final stretch of getting stuff done okay so we might we might see it like by the end of the year that would be good it'd be a good christmas present okay so maybe i'll get an answer to my question sooner than i thought um so in contrast uh when it comes to nfts i don't know if you were aware nfts on ethereum are well you probably are aware are seen as higher value uh than those on solana and there was an nft artist who um i interviewed for a panel that i did where he said he got a grant to create nfts on solana but his collectors were like oh we we wouldn't want to buy in solana we prefer to buy an ethereum and i was curious what your take is on that so this is partly why i think this idea of like mass exodus from ethereum is just never going to happen because you have core ethereum users that hold e to them honestly the gas prices are in eve they're not that expensive because they have a bunch of e they don't look at it as dollars spent right because they're not speculators they're eat users they have a bunch of eat and they're spending a small fraction of their eat to acquire nfts for much larger you know much larger amounts of eat and that that user base is there what you need to actually grow is a native solana based user base that is here because they they like solana they like phantom they want to participate in this community and do stuff here so that that's the this is why like i think like it's hard to know where where things flip right like who's growing new users faster is probably the most important metric then who is able to get you know liquidity mining rewards and pull tvl from bobby on you know one dvm chain to another and so do you know who's i mean how would you measure who's getting more users faster that's really hard we see our metrics you know the stuff that uh phantom report phantom folks report um it's over a million monthly active users and it's about what 1.4 now so it's it's it's bumping by like 100 or 150 000 a week and those are not meta mask users so there's like some of them i'm sure are but for what we can tell oh really some are but like you know it's hard to tell but that's anecdotally what we see is new people coming into the space that are trying crypto for the first time through phantom and that's their first experience wow wait how do you know that they don't also have ethereum wallets this is based on just like feedback that i'm getting from folks on on twitter so i don't know right this is like anecdotally like hey this but this is my first this is my first time trying like doing self-custody doing d5 the first time i tried it was on solana and i tried metamask and oh my god this is not what i want oh wow wait like they find metamask more difficult to use correct yeah because the experiences yeah i i've never seen negative feedback on on phantom almost 100 positive feedback and every every time i've seen a review of it you know what i hear is that it's the best wallet in the industry and that's never changed and then i think at some point like anecdotal or i guess like survey data both on developers and users um started to cross past the 50 threshold of like you know more than 50 of the developers building on solana had never written a smart contract before um and same with with end users wow that's great and so then how are they finding out about because like i i guess i would have just imagined that a lot of people come to crypto through you know bitcoin and ethereum which are the two main things that you know everybody kind of kind of knows about and then they kind of branch out so then how are they coming kind of more directly to i feel like the whole industry knew this was going to happen for like a year and a half that nfts were going to be something that people would learn about and before they even care that it's on blockchain before they know it's on ethereum or solana or anything all they know is that there's some you know dank memes and pictures and collectibles and um you know and and uh you know an ounce of culture um and something important that they can own and as they build that understanding and start to engage with those things i mean from what i've heard uh a lot of people are interacting with phantom buying nfts that their friends turn them on to using solana and they don't even know what solana is they haven't heard of solana the network um so yeah i mean i thought they know phantom because phantom's the the extension they open up and soon they'll know you know that it's the the app that they open up that's what people care about that is great i love that yeah because actually what i was going to ask you was um i don't know if you saw this tweet but that collector g-money tweeted that buying a solana punk was like buying a fake chanel bag and um yeah okay i'm glad you guys are laughing um but you know i think i mean it kind of it kind of is yeah like a soul punk but i think the solana monkey business and the djinn ape academy is it's different it's not it's not copying like there's originality there the communities are doing original things and to someone coming in as a newcomer they're experiencing what a dao can do and how you know a collective organizing force of a similar profile photo can permeate through all of their social networks and they can feel like they belong to something even if they're moving between twitter and reddit and you know xbox live like that's that's the powerful thing and those communities are doing you know i mean they they're not sitting around just asking what did crypto punks do and let's just copy that right i mean it's inspired for sure but it's a whole new product line it's a whole new set of experiments and it's diverging very quickly so eth oh geez are you know they're not paying attention to this stuff it's like it's cra it's kind of crazy to me sometimes talking to people who obviously are loving their time you know experimenting and continuing to be part of the culture of ethereum but they literally have no idea that these things even exist on solana right like they don't know that you know there are celebrities that are joining these communities the the communities are huge the discords are giant um a lot of these people are experiencing crypto for the first time i don't blame them because there's a lot going on in ethereum it's hard to keep track even of just what's happening in ethereum um but like comparing it to you know the third nft project that ever came up on solana that was just a straight copy of something on ethereum is like not focusing on the right thing there's been 2 500 new nft like 10 000 nft collections launched on solana since that right so the world changes very quickly yeah and i saw people pleaser did one on solana which was really cool i thought uh it's sort of like a gamified uh version and yeah you could kind of like get better um nfts if you bought all of them and it was very fair the way that everything was priced like it was it was very cool i thought the way it was structured all right so at this point we're going to turn to a few questions that i got off twitter when i told twitter that i was going to be interviewing you guys and some of these were kind of fun one was if the dow happened today on solana meaning 14 of all seoul were stored in a contract and hacked would you decide to rescue the funds meaning to do a hard fork to do that and what for your answer why or why not it's a good question i think after similar i would say solana validators would make have to make that decision the way the process would work works is that there's like a you know proposal process to push prs and then the future activation in which the super majority of the validators have to vote and it's their decision to make the to make those choices me personally i would probably make the same decision as vitalik in this like early ecosystem that i see this like tiny tiny baby just about to walk and like get in the head like i gotta save her right i got i gotta save this baby uh but like uh we don't have the power to do so and it's gonna be at the end of the day up to the validators and the folks that could shut it down are um you know circle exchanges a bunch of different participants could just say no we don't want to accept this fork and uh you know the community will figure it out and then there will be solana classic maybe who knows right well that's that's what happened when the exchanges yeah i i tend to agree with vitalik that the ultimate power is in the hands of the people that are running these things and the whole point of crypto is really to empower people the way we can do that is with cryptography giving them self-custody giving them the ability to run notes and then those tools allow them to make these complex decisions and move stuff forward but it's ultimately them they get to do it you know it's like i i don't worship the machine and raj do you have an opinion on this i say let it ride you know i mean the legend is the ledger and yeah the validators get to decide whatever they want if if they if they wanted to um roll back the ledger then you know that's up to them but i wouldn't i wouldn't be be fighting i think to um to make that happen and create a fork and um uh yeah so i don't know maybe maybe this is where we split totally yeah well i wouldn't be fighting to make to let that happen either i think that's that's maybe i think the there's like i don't actually don't know how things went down in with ethereum but there's this like legend that vitalik wrote the code and it happened and pushed the change and then like all this stuff spread no no that's not what happened yeah exactly so the the fact is that like something catastrophic state failure is going to be up to the validators and all the different like people parts of the community the best that we can do is just kind of guide him and say like you know based on my engineering analysis if you made made this pull request i think it'll do the thing that you want but i'm not going to be the one to uh to push for it okay and raj uh just wanted to clarify since you know like i said it would be 14 of all soul and there is a proof of stake element in solana so despite that that still wouldn't kind of i would want to see what happens the the percentage of the soul that gets destroyed or gets locked up or frozen or whatever isn't that it it doesn't matter with regards to quorum selection or voting because whatever whatever amount of sole use for the quorum it's a percentage of that is what matters how the weight is distributed so that that actually doesn't have that much impact on the on the network itself okay all right well we'll have to see if anything happens in that regard and and then uh who knows maybe afterward it'll be raj in charge of solana classic and yeah and they're smalling in charge of slot they're not in charge but you know kind of the figurehead for solana so we'll see another ethereum classic is there one wait wait is there a figurehead for ethereum classic um no because it was kind of more at the exchanges that drove uh the rise of that so yeah there was it wasn't like there was an ethereum one of the honchos that was uh driving that so um but yeah if if the two co-founders on solana split on this issue then we could see see that happen do it if it means i get to stop working with totally i'm in let's do it by the way for people listening on the podcast hilariously they each kind of like raised their fist at each other when they were doing it was funny but anyway okay so another question was about scaling someone tweeted at me if the sole single use case is that it has a higher throughput than eth and soul will kill eve what about soul competitors like cadena and avex that could that claim a higher throughput than seoul will kadena and avex kill seoul is this a race to the bottom on throughput not unless they implement solano so the way that we're scaling right now and the usage that you see right now by sheer load of just the applications that are using the network it's somewhere like 70 million transactions per day and that's roughly around 700 tps that's more than all the other evm chains combined so and that's that's just current load that's not the capacity so for for the network to like hit capacity limits uh for actual any congestion control to kick in we have to have blocks that have more than half of the remaining capacity or fees to double that's kind of like how our congestion control works there's not a dynamic option for who gets to go first there's a governor that looks at are you using 50 of the remaining capacity then double the fees so some of the you know the spam bots go away right so at 25 000 tps that's running for i think six blocks or whatever fees are going to double then at you know what is it 37 and a half fees are going to double again and you know every time the remaining capacity drops by half these double so for that to happen we still have a lot of ways to go um in terms of like usage adoption you know because it's expensive to generate that much valid that many valid transactions okay all right next twitter question was from tegan klein of the graph she asked what happens if sam bankmanfree leaves the solana ecosystem and i was curious about this just because i'm not sure what his current involvement is so why don't you illuminate us what is his involvement what is his current involvement [Laughter] uh so we have a like an awesome relationship with those folks but it's not like a it's because they move fast this is what i'm trying to tell people is that like of all the people in crypto that we worked with the people that tend to end up in solana are the ones that just like no frills want to get stuff done and that's the foundation of that relationship and like it's really rare to find them sam is one of those people he's like okay we want to build the stacks let's just move mountains to get it out and us and them and everybody in the ecosystem moved those mountains and now serum it has like a bajillion bajillion startups are building on top of serum now so that happens because people just want to get stuff done what does it mean for sam to leave he's not like a mercenary trader he's a builder is that is he going to build solana himself he doesn't want to do that it already exists right he wants to build products and get users to use stuff and like have fdx grow and those are like you know the only reason he would leave and to go somewhere else is because we screwed something up and we stopped being hungry and we stopped building things you know at that same pace but likewise if he's like gets lazy there's plenty of other there's plenty of other hungry people out there there's plenty of other crypto billionaires to to uh it's not the money's never the problem right like there's always an infinite amount of capital like right now especially it's do you have like the drive to go build a product to grind through all the pain points get it to market grow the user base those people are extremely rare and the amount of capital when it grows the the number of those people stays constant right and this is why c level valuations jump away for factors of five like in a matter of like six months this is why it's so hard to find those founders and like they're like why growth is hard for the for the entire ecosystem right you think there's like three you know two trillion dollars worth of capital floating around on crypto why can't we get people to use it like money doesn't solve all those problems you actually need to find really really good people that build stuff so like so far like sam is sam wants to get a billion people into crypto we want to get a billion people into crypto if you're listening and this is your dream like just go start building and you know we will end up in the same ecosystem because this is how hungry we are i think the world hasn't like caught up to exactly how many people are building on solana and how big and uh and fast growing the ecosystem is like the value that sam brought by being ostensibly the the highest profile um most visible and most deep pocketed person that was able to you know um stand up as a leader um inspiring others to build on the network and that was maniacally focused on user experience and building something with crypto that normal people could access that value can't be put back in the bottle like it's it's you know it already catalyzed hundreds of other teams and builders and now i have more of those maniacal builders than i can keep count of you know and like i don't they're not all just sitting around saying oh let's say i'm going to do and where you know what happens if you leave they're they're acquiring users they're building products they have millions of users right like they're thinking about how to get to 10 million users and 100 million users like it's you know it's living in the past to ask that kind of question all right so just to wrap up where do you hope to see solana go in the next year one year man that's the hardest prediction to make i can i can predict six weeks and five years all right well give me the five years i'm curious like what's your vision for what solano will be at that time i think there's a hundred million percent dao that's organizing capital like very large capital allegation decisions governance decisions that have real world impacts all on salon i think there will be many of those many not just one 100 people there's going to be at least one 100 million person doubt wow within five years easy when that happens right like that shift it's a hockey stick shift right as soon as people get it it starts growing like wildfire and it's a nonlinear thing you're not going to see it happen like oh my god we're going to add a million people a month it's going to be like hard work lots of other tiers right like optimizations and ux and not like use cases and all these things and all of a sudden boom so that i think that boom is gonna happen within five years yeah yeah it's fascinating i i will say uh yeah dows definitely have captured my imagination and i'm sure for a lot of people um but i think that is kind of what i'm most excited about coming up all right well where can people learn more about each of you and solana labs and solana twitter twitter.com yeah yeah zlatan.com for like especially if you're a dab there's some there's links documentation there's going to be another hackathon so just like stay tuned if you want to know what i'm thinking every 30 seconds follow me on twitter yakovenko is his and raj gokul is my handle okay awesome thank you both so much for coming on unchained thank you thanks laura thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about anatoly raj and solana check out the show notes for this episode unchained is produced by me laura shin with help from anthony yoon daniel ness and mark murdock thanks for listening [Music] you
