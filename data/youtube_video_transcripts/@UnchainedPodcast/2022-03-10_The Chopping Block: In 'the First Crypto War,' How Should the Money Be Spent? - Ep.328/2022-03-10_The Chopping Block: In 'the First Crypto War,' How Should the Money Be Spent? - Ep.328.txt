hello everybody welcome to the shopping blog every couple of weeks the four of us get together and give an industry insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day so quick intros uh first we've got tom the d5 maven and master of memes next up we have robert uh krypto connoisseur and captain of compound uh third we've got tarun the giga brain and grand pub gauntlet and then we have myself i'm a sieve a head hype man at dragonfly and today we have joining us a special guest from her uh from her airbnb in a nondescript location uh we've got laura shin so um the the four of us not including laura are early stage investors in crypto but i want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice or legal advice or even life advice so laura first of all congratulations on your book i think last time we were able to say it here but you weren't able to join us at that time congratulations i know it's been a huge effort in the undertaking and you're now on the road show like going around giving talks or something yeah i went to london right after the book came out um like literally the day after and i went to a chain alice's conference and then after that i went to a conference at oxford um and that was actually really meaningful because i had done study abroad at oxford and all i can say is like when you go to a place that that's so close to your heart and that was so formative for you like after a major milestone in your life like i was very emotional just walking around oxford i'm sure people were like why does this lady keep crying everywhere um but anyway so yeah i um like and obviously just going to the chain house this conference was really wonderful because you know they helped me um with so much in the book but obviously they had done that d mixing portion for the dow investigation which was great and actually uh i i will step away at a certain point and get you a really cool thing that somebody gave me which was this fbi challenge coin and it's like a coin that i guess these fbi special agents have and it like says nice things on it um yeah and then i had my book signing in in new york last week and it was totally sold out which is awesome because apparently that's not a common thing um so it was great and so many people came up and said hello and then yeah now i'm in san francisco i have a reading tonight at the commonwealth club and then i'll be in seattle tomorrow and there's more events coming up um but yeah it's it's a very like fun time for me how does it feel oh my god like amazing honestly i mean i just can't even begin to tell you first of all you know announcing the news about the dow attacker on the day my book came out that was just incredible and obviously it was a huge boost for the book and you know just kind of i think really got people talking about the book and um and was just great because you know i poured so much of myself into this book over the last few years and so to be able to launch it in that way and um and frankly also i had spent so much time trying to figure out who had done it um that was that was really nice um and then yeah i mean you know just like people have been saying such tonight that nice things like uh the day that i revealed that news people were tweeting at me that i was the goat um which is just great you know um people obviously aren't usually very complimentary toward oh yes thank you that's that's the book i i do have a copy somewhere oh here i've got one here yes i i have friends uh who are visiting men so this is one of their copies got my copy i would say it is a very long book i have not made a lot of progress in the book so far this has been a busy week in crypto land as we're going to talk about today but um i am i am incredibly proud of you this is so awesome your book has been your book has been killing it it's been like the number one crypto book on amazon which is crazy given how popular crypto is so it seems like surprisingly it seems like kind of nothing has gone wrong which is also very surprising for launching something that you've been working on for multiple years i know i know i mean between that and then the funny thing is so you're in the middle of it so you know i won't like reveal too much but but in my personal opinion there's just like so many bombshells um in the book like just there's just so much new stuff that i uncovered and like whole story lines that weren't even known before and so it's just funny because this weekend charles hoskinson like tweeted something about my book how it was like a work of fiction which is kind of rich considering that if you read the book you will find out that you know he has a tenuous relationship to the truth so i was a little bit at least that's what the people who lived and worked with him said and you know all their stories are very similar to each other and so i was like okay well i also found out that you know what you claim about your education does not match what the school's records show so i tweeted about that and like that has also blown things up and i noticed i think it like even boosted sales of the book um because people have been tweeting at me like oh since you found this out i'm gonna buy the book now and i'm like oh well if you think that that's interesting wait till you read the book because there's like a lot more in there so but yeah like i was a little bit like that's the criticism you're gonna give me like if that's the criticism then maybe you should look at your own history i have one question for you actually from the perspective of you know being an author and a journalist how does it differ in terms of your process when it's like you're the secret bearer for many years and you have all these breaking stories that you have to collect until you hit some you know you're like foraging for mush for truffles and you have to hit a certain number of truffles before you're allowed to kind of let them debut at you know some fancy restaurant interesting analogy term that was one thing because you know i found out this thing about charles's education years ago but i couldn't reveal it obviously until the book came out and there were so many things like that but it wasn't like i was holding off on publishing until i had some number of things you know it was just like i was trying to get the story basically that was kind of the main thing i was just after like like you know what happened at that time like you know i want to talk to all these different people i want to like make sure i kind of get all the perspectives so i'm like getting the fullest version and the the most accurate version so really yeah part of it i kind of it was a little bit hard kind of knowing like all this stuff and then not being able to talk about it and also worrying like am i going to get scooped like are other people going to get this story and just get it out in an article before my book you know so that was like a little bit of a stress like and then just weird things around you know when we you know felt like we had an identity for the dow attacker you know that all happened at the very last minute like the book was like basically nearly done and it was at the point in time where i was not allowed to make anything but the most minimal changes and then yeah then it was like okay we're gonna have to make a very big change you know um so we had to like push the publication date and then yeah there's just like certain things like you'll see that in the book that section is like much briefer than what we put in the forbes article because since most of the book was finished the publisher was like you know you have to stick to a certain word count it was basically like we're going to remove what you previously wrote about the dow and then insert this new thing um so i so the form circle just has a lot more because like i had more room because they were even saying things like oh the more you change it even changes things like the size of the book jacket and like it's too late in the process so it's just like there were so many downstream effects that they were the original book jacket is an nft now yeah well we did we didn't change it because i i did stick to the word count but you know there were just like issues like that so um yeah it was great and then of course i was like nervous that somebody was to break the news and they were going to like find out the identity and then they were going to just reveal it before my book came out and like that was a whole thing that we were worried about and like so whatever happened to the 10x founder after the revelations i'm sure robert is a big 10x whale so i'm sure he's very interested to know oh gee oh gee will no i'm kidding i mean he sent me his denial uh i haven't seen you know anything else i don't think he's released any additional statements i did see that memo capital where he's like a co-founder initially in their telegram group they like closed the chat down and they were just like you know uh we we're looking into these allegations whatever but then it revived a few days later and they were just like he doesn't have daily involvement anyway like you know he's like long long you know not been involved with the project stuff like that and so sounds like crypto yeah but the one good thing is um you know i haven't seen a lot of people being like you're wrong like this you know this clearly is you're off your rock or whatever um i think a lot of people recognize like okay the evidence is very strong and then even like beyond just the things about like you know what happened to that money whatever when you go back and fill in the story and you're like oh this was someone who was like very into the dow they were looking at the code they identified flaws they had reached out to the creators about it they you know had written blog posts about the flaws like i mean just all the things and like even the the exact problems they were talking about were the ones that eventually had to force ethereum to hard fork because otherwise they would have been in dao wars forever he identified all that at that time and so like it just even made sense when you went back you know so i think people realize like okay it makes sense like from both sides like so yeah i think that's why there hasn't been any pushback at least not yet so oh have any of you finished the book or guys if any of you finished the book i will admit and i'm being radically honest and transparent that i've yet to start the book but i will start the book well you have a good you have a good excuse which is i know you have a newborn on your hands so i imagine you're probably not sleeping very much yeah tyrone you've got tarun you have no excuse to ruin you got no you're just sitting there drinking beer yeah he's he's just hanging out in his apartment he's doing nothing a diet coke i'm the one drinking beer i have robot beer this for robot ventures oh wow that's very cool you know there's just too many math papers ahead of me i'm sorry i'm sorry that's the truth i'm giving you a radical transparency radical that's what we're all about here on the chopping block is and why do i totally 100 believe that reason it's just you know i have a stack of things it's like it's on there it's going in my suitcase when i'm traveling so that as soon as i finish this queue then i i move into the book but well is it a stack or is it a queue yeah yeah that's right well that's a great joke that's a very bad but hilarious yes joke no it's it's a cue it's not a stack it was a stack that would be bad for for book reading time i actually think it's more like a mempool and some of these compete with each other and it's not a step forward transaction fees are going up for the mempool you're about to get ejected unfortunately i mean 400 pages is a long is a large bundle of transactions after all yeah that's true now we're getting super super nerdy yeah all right tom your turn for the confessional of why you haven't read i've been moving you know i'm in i'm in new york i've been i've been traveling around so you know i haven't had been able to sit in a place and prop my feet up and read it but it is sitting on my kindle so i'm looking forward to reading it cool okay okay so by next time we'll have to submit our reviews uh yeah yeah uh yeah club shopping blog book club first first stop is well i do think i do think it would be interesting to see what each of us thinks is the most shocking revelation you know like like buzzfeed article style like this this breaking news yeah by next meeting it'll all be in the first 20 pages the most shocking thing i read in the first 20 pages that vitalik could speak when he was eight years old no you have to skip whatever it was 200 and then start reading that that way you get you know unique insights i have a feeling i know what you guys will be most shocked about um but and i'm surprised you haven't heard i have tried to ask people not to do too many spoilers so laura have been real bond enjoy your book reading bask in the sunlight of all the love that you're receiving oh thank you thank you all right so you guys have fun okay so um the big news of the week uh or the last two weeks has been of course the uh the russian invasion of ukraine so um this is this is a topic that so i was actually in ukraine last year because a number of the companies that we've invested into uh were based in ukraine so last year i was in kiev and levi in last summer so i know ukraine quite well so it's been really terrible and our sympathy goes out to all the the the victims in ukraine who are fighting back against the russian invaders um but it's been a story that not only has uh gripped the world but it's also one that has a lot to say about what's going on in crypto and in fact it has had massive effects on the on the crypto market so you know i won't belabor a lot of the news about the details of the invasion itself but the there are a number of different elements of the aftermath of both the invasion and the sanctions that uh ensued from the invasion of ukraine that had a lot of effects on crypto so just to go through a very brief summary of the news so first was that um so ukraine has obviously been very active in social media through the official ukraine twitter account and one of the things that they've been calling for is the the blocking of russian accounts within crypto exchanges and actually there's been equivalent calls within the u.s from some um u.s lawmakers to also do the same thing uh now the majority of exchanges have denied these requests to not freeze russian accounts and to be clear these are not accounts of russia the nation state but rather of russian individuals so binance announced that they wouldn't be freezing uh russian accounts there was actually a large announcement by coinbase that there are 25 000 wallets ringed to russian at least illicit activity that they were going to be blocking uh that were that were belonged by russian users but it was unclear what exactly this had to do with sanctions or this is just an unrelated you know some kind of illegal fraud ring or something like that that they were shutting down accounts for we saw massive spikes in volume in rubles so unsurprisingly there was a lot of demand within russia for getting access to crypto especially as the sanctions were starting to close in enormous amount of financial organizations are now cut off within russia um so we saw a lot of demand for crypto and bitcoin within uh within russia we saw uh not only the withdrawal of an enormous amount of banks that were that basically left operations in in russia we also saw vsan mastercard shut off any access to cardholders in russia we saw sanctions from multiple countries uh pretty much everything in nato and the eu even in singapore was was sanctioning russia and you also saw some interesting things happening on the ukrainian side so for one there was an announcement that ukraine was going to give a an airdrop to crypto users and in ukraine actually posted their crypto wallets on chain which were verified by some of the you know prominent members of the crypto community to to solicit donations and we saw over 40 million dollars in crypto donations go to these uh addresses associated with ukraine uh we also saw a um there was an nft a number of nft fundraisers one of which raised i think like five million dollars for a nft of the ukrainian flag that was donated entirely to ukraine uh you can see here we've got dune analytics up showing about 40 million in internal donations between ethdai usgc and a few other assets ukraine even announced that they were going to do an air drop it was unclear what the airdrop was or what who was going to get the airdrop if it was you know donated or something they later announced they were cancelling the airdrop but they were going to be selling nfts and i think i believe right now it's it's not yet public the details of all this so it's been basically the first crypto war that we've seen you know the first armed conflict and obviously the most major armed conflict in in europe since world war ii and and crypto has had a very strange role to play on both sides both within russia and uh in ukraine so curious to get your guys thoughts on on what's been happening over the last couple weeks tom why don't you start giving thank you for the list i do have it on good authority that the the nft sale is happening so that should be interesting to see oh good what how that actually looks but yeah i i think you just went through so many different phases where people thought the crypto addresses that ukraine posted weren't real to um criticizing you know crypto donations saying hey they actually need you know money this isn't real money how are they gonna off ramp it to um now i think there's a stat that came out was like like 70 of the arm suppliers to ukraine are like are accepting crypto directly they're not off ramping into fiat they're just accepting crypto payments directly which is kind of insane to think about i know it just feels like you know generally speaking there isn't a whole lot of of clarity it feels like just sort of a people have money and they want to sling it at something and this kind of feels like the next thing that people are apping into is it's your constitution dow like in many ways where it's like this is something that i think is i believe in and i want to donate to and i want to i want to back i think the the weird thing though is that the donations are not necessarily going to like humanitarian causes it's not like hey this is going to ukrainian refugees a lot of the donations are going to like purchase arms for the ukrainian military which i think is a very kind of strange and scary precedent certainly they need the money to defend themselves but i don't know how many people who are donating or thinking about the fact that you know the money that they're using is going to be used to to kill people and it's kind of insane you have global fundraising um for this army uh which is like never really been done before in human history that is actually not true wasn't there wasn't there some army that like launched a fundraiser i can't remember this um what do you guys know what i'm talking about there was like some uh armed conflict that they said there was one go find me or something one during uh peak pandemic between armenia and azerbaijan which was settled by turkey sending in drones and bombing the out of armenia and that was like i'm surprised no one called that as crazy as kind of the stuff we're seeing now because that was like there are two countries fighting over this disputed region and then this third-party country just sends in a bunch of drones and like picks the winner and then like we moved on and like the world just kind of forgot it's about this conflict region called nagorno-karabakh uh in in that area um but they did the armenian side if i remember correctly did have a gofundme oh go find me i think it was a gofundme and i think they had we were thinking about doing nft something there was like it was like right i completely remember this it was like 2020 early 2021 but it was like a little too early like i feel like the open c boom had just not quite taken off around the time like it was the nifty gateway days i'm surprised that happened because there was actually a gofundme for crypto this is of course the other classic criticism of crypto well you can just do this with fiat yo you can just wire in your money you just send vemmo um and so there was a gofundme to send money to the ukrainian military and they shut it down um because they have a policy against fundraising for weapon sales and so you know it's like actually a great example of where like yeah there really is no other possible thing you could do here other than you know use cryptocurrencies i mean what's wrong with i mean the reality is like almost every western government is already using tax dollars to basically fund you know a donation of arms to ukraine so at the margin it's not making a huge amount of difference you know 40 million is a pretty small drop in the bucket relative to the total amount of aid that's gone to the ukrainian military sure it's just very direct and that's never really been been done before and i don't think most people who are donating are considering that like i don't really think this sort of you know direct contribution to like a armed conflict has really been done and it's sort of maybe it's scary to think about hey you know maybe in this scenario these are the good guys this is our side um but you can imagine you know this is sort of you know not too uh far removed from the whole assassination market meme from 2016 you know you can imagine that that uh this is sort of a step in that direction i mean i think the thing about this war and one of the reasons why it's been so galvanizing in the west is that it's like probably one of the few examples of a just war that we've seen in the last you know called 40 years where it's very easy to identify the aggressor there was there was very little provocation certainly you know putin invading the donbass is one thing but him going and trying to basically attack kiev the capital which is in western ukraine which is which is not even ethnically russian you know it's like they speak ukrainian they don't speak russian there they're they're more european like i was there they're much it's like a european city you know him basically going in and ransacking the entire country which is very clearly unprovoked there was no there was no first strike by ukraine and to have a conflict that's that clean and also that public and also where you know the the of course you know zolensky the president of ukraine has been incredibly charismatic and has also very effectively used social media and um and and uh the press to galvanize the world toward uh you know wanting to to come to ukraine's help so i think that i think it's one of the reasons why this war feels so different relative to other conflicts in the past where you know i i suspect you know i if i were to donate money to ukraine i would not be surprised that they would use it to to buy arms but i think most people are okay with that for this war relative to most other wars i mean especially the people donating i think probably believe that right it's not donating to an extremely morally nebulous recipient right i mean the problem is you don't know the recipient theoretically right but but if we if we if we assume that like it it's it's technically who it who it's going to be i mean historically there have been tons of wars funded in kind of indirect manners over the lot like you know whenever people like the us funded the contras via selling weapons and doing like all this weird it's no different than this if we squint enough oh yeah though that's a state actor right it's a state actor funding a war but it's a state actor they're doing it via these like kind of this like the tentacles of like hey we're like technically funding it by these weird organizations and there's many of them and they all have to somehow collude and like this removes the coordination pressure of needing the state actor but it kind of gets the same outcome yeah but it's individual to nation as opposed to like nation to nation yeah that's true although it's like a little bit weird because like if i think about the argentina stuff right where like um they took the argentinian like warship as collateral for not paying back the bond that's like the inverse version of this right in some ways so like we've seen the other side happen so it's like i kind of feel like you could argue that the like elliott management heist of argentina is like not is like the inverse of this and like you could probably rig the bond market to kind of like let you do this the war bonds are selling i don't understand so one thing i don't get the difference of is the difference between the war bonds the raw war bonds and the cryptocurrency rates so like i if we because like i've seen these things are like ukraine raising 230 million dollar war bond type headlines presumably that's just like western governments buying those bonds or can individuals and entities like that that's that's one thing where i've been kind of confused about like where this is going like how do the corporate finances of a a nation look like when they like have debt issuance plus like cryptocurrency donation and like they have to like manage that treasury yeah it is a good question of like how good is the ukrainian crypto opsec like are they do they even have a multisig is it just like one dude's address i think that's probably likely but yeah i it does seem like look i mean the the crypto donations are obviously coming from retail and just random people around the world who are who feel passionate about the cause it is a much easier way to donate than most other forms of donation at this point and certainly it's more direct right so you know if i if i'm looking at one of these like tv fundraisers for ukraine i have very little confidence that it's actually going to ukraine or that it's not going to get you know chopped up into tiny little pieces and taxed along the way whereas if i donate to the ukrainian crypto address on twitter actually pretty high confidence they're going to go turn around and you know buy ak-47s with that which is which is in a way it's a great endorsement for crypto for use cases like this it's a great endorsement for crypto but there's also the risk on the other side which is you know the story that i'm most concerned about and aware of is that you know with the imposition of sanctions on russia the story that's coming out in crypto right now is concern from politicians that crypto will be used to invade those sanctions and it's serving as a catalyst or a justification to impose draconian restrictions on crypto crypto exchanges et cetera and i i think it's probably the most important sort of you know reaction to what's happening with crypto is that yes crypto is being used in new and exciting ways and that's creating a lot of fear at least within the us to offset it i think net net there's some extremely positive things happening in the crypto but it's creating more of a pushback than i expected very rapidly i i yeah so i tweeted about this in that um i basically said that like i don't think the language of using crypto to evade sanctions i think is like a total non-sequitur because the reality is that the sanctions were very well defined right there were certain things that are sanctioned in certain things that are not included in the in the package of sanctions you can't include crypto in sanctions there's nothing this says you can't uh but they're not included but in fact some of the some of these sanctions were offac restrictions on you know basically transacting with certain parties and whether you are sending dollar bills or whether you're sending uh crypto ofac restrictions are universal it doesn't matter what you're transacting with so there are parties that are now on the offec list that you cannot transact with that are i think they're all russian banks right so you cannot transact with these russian banks and russian state enterprises whether you're using crypto or not but transacting with private russian citizens or with other companies in russia that are not on the sanctions list it is fine whether using dollars or whether you're using uh crypto like the idea that it is evading sanctions quote unquote for you for russia to transaction crypto well okay is it evading sanctions for russia to transact in r b no obviously not right that's that's a total non-sequitur so crypto is just not in the category of things that we can use as sanctions or that we have chosen to use the sanctions but we could if we so chose if the u.s said look coinbase you are not allowed to send transactions to anybody who is verified to be russian then done we have sanctions on on russian citizens but we didn't do that you know it also ties back a little bit to the whole canadian trucker you know bitcoin thing in some way where it like yeah they also got de-platformed and um actually joe weisenthal from bloomberg had a good piece today talking about how you know all these opportunities not that i think also there's a i think the treasury pattern saying like it's not even like really technically feasible for russia to like meaningfully you know conduct business using crypto as it is today but certainly something like this you know these these crowd funds it's like the more crypto sort of plays to its strengths by busy creating this independent you know uh financial system and sort of do the thing that it's supposed to do it also is somewhat bearish in that it sort of creates this bigger target on its back for regulators and so it's like the strengths of it in some ways are also sort of its downside um and so these are making this case for for bitcoin but maybe true across crypto more broadly yeah i mean beyond the obviously enormous humanitarian costs that we're now seeing as um you know we have north of a million i think a million and a half refugees now across europe as a result of the invasion of ukraine we're also seeing of course as a result of these sanctions and just a result of the the instability that we're now seeing in eastern europe enormous effects on commodity prices and so you're seeing especially oil and natural gas being the most obvious we're probably going to see a significant spike in inflation uh globally because of because of what's going on in russia and that's going to magnify the effects that we've already seen the beginning of this year of the inflation in the u.s it doesn't spell a great year for crypto um and for broader financial markets and you're already seeing that both in equities and in crypto prices over the last week it's a little bit um cool to sort of look at a humanitarian crisis like this in terms of uh the the the financial consequences of it and i'm always reminded that you know we have some of the entrepreneurs that we that we backed are actually in ukraine right now and um right now every able-bodied man i think between 18 and 60 has been effectively conscripted into the ukrainian army and they have to they have to fight uh and so some of our entrepreneurs are right now fighting in ukraine um to protect the the country from from from putin so um it's a really terrible situation and we hope that it resolves peacefully soon but it seems less and less likely that that's going to happen i also want to point out that um you know in the history of this industry actually really started quite heavily in places that i i'm not sure newer members of of of this space might not remember but georgia and ukraine so like bit fury if you remember them i mean they still exist but i don't think they're anywhere near their prior stage they kind of got beat out by bit name but they were at one point the largest mining miner in the world there's founder in ukraine and they basically used to they spurred on a huge sort of like industry of like eastern european people like there's like the bit fury mafia which sort of like led to a lot of the developers that are in this space from like 2015 to 1819 you know i'm sure a lot of them are dealing with things that are kind of not great so uh kind of my thoughts out to them as well i feel like they're not people kind of forget that like the early days of crypto were actually really really romania ukraine and russia were like where every single developer was that's right it's still a very important um area of a lot of builders in crypto um i just wanted to um close out this segment by talking about what prediction markets are saying and actually get a little bit out of style i'm actually not looking at any crypto prediction markets because they don't have a lot of liquidity but if you look at mintaculous which is one of the non-crypto prediction markets right now they uh they believe that the likelihood that kiev falls for russia by the uh by april uh so basically by the end of this month is currently about 25 it was much higher at the start of the invasion it was about 90 when the invasion started so it seems like the the tide has really turned um on the likelihood of of russian success in this invasion the likelihood that russia controls kiev by june is currently at 46 meaning that um people believe that it's about 50 50 that kiev will fall to russia within two months so obviously i'm hoping that kiev is able to hold strong but it's a tough conflict ahead of them anyway let's move away from some of the more sober topics and talk a little bit more into crypto land so one of the things that's been going on this week is there's been a huge spat of fundraising announcements there are a lot of new funds that are launched recently first we have electric they announced a one billion dollar fund um this is split between two vehicles uh supposedly one is a liquid crypto vehicle that's 600 million and then a early stage fund that's 400 million so supposedly it's a billion dollars between the two of them yeah a vigil uh amazing timing um to have you know 600 million to drive powder right now when when it seems like prices are uh have come down quite a bit um you can see him there laughing at how cheap everything looks and after after everything that's gone on in the last few weeks so electric's got a billion uh next up we've got um to actually this was announced today a very interesting um kind of social media bonanza so bain capital announced that they were launching a 560 million dollar fund and they announced it slightly unwittingly on um international women's day which is today they basically got piled on on on twitter because of the um the the particulars around uh how they actually made the announcement i think if you can uh tom if you wanna if you wanna show one of the uh what are the tweets so we had uh no less than mark andreessen jumping on them on twitter as well as uh half of crypto twitter basically this is uh dunking on them yeah this is this is this is a pretty good one uh just a little um little on the nose the way they uh tried to position themselves very proudly i think in the in the announcement it was like it is my great privilege to announce that we raised a lot of money to invest in crypto and we were like yeah you got that right you know all that all that being said um obviously it's uh still a lot of money coming into crypto from top of funnel even if it's not people buying bitcoin and ether on the public markets we've got you know vcs for the rescue to come in and bid up private deals so i don't know how are you guys uh seeing the the huge influx of capital uh coming in you forgot about golden tree which is another song that's right that's right that's right uh avi avi from block tower is is going to run golden tree 600 million dollar fund uh of course we've got uh andreessen's 4.5 billion dollar fund that's in the works my understanding is that that's being fundraised right now i believe katie hans fund which is a billion dollars between an early stage and a growth stage fund is also closing so there's a lot of activity going on right now in uh crypto fundraising there's no shortage of capital coming into the space the i mean the weird thing of course is that most of this is earmarked for private deals and there's not that much except i guess maybe some of anderson's fund is going into publix but it feels like there's going to be a big mismatch between the dollars earmarked for privates and for publix for the next while i agree i mean if huge amounts of capital go into privates you know there's really two paths for any organization the equity path in the token path and obviously some of it's going to go into the equity path but i think it's going to go into a lot of companies foundations organizations that create tokens as well and i think that's where the mismatch is so you know companies with you know investors staying on the equity path forever you know eventually the ipo and you know they stay you know equity businesses but when there's a token if there's going to be a hundred new projects essentially creating publicly traded assets you know in one way or another you know you run the risk of there being a a mismatch or being off equilibrium where there's too many projects and not enough demand in the later stages of its lifecycle and so obviously some of this is going into equity deals you know but a lot of it's going into projects you know all of those firms mentioned that are creating tradable tokens and digital assets and you know i feel like the biggest risk is that there's too much supply and not enough demand two years from now i i actually think the the the question is like are these funds structured in a way that they can like hedge fund style like i guess like the the original paradigm fund kind of be able to do venture deals plus tote liquid tokens and like and like move between them seamlessly i suspect that that's not true because a lot of them are raised as venture funds as far as i can tell from filings and stuff but it does beg the question of like will there suddenly be also this like a difference in like liquidity terms where people want like token warrants that like go liquid faster or stuff like that like i think that's going to be the interesting thing to look at is like will teams that make tokens have to deliver tokens to investors way faster than right now because these investors have these like kind of vehicles that have a certain amount of time that they have to return by and then if they do that then like they just need the liquidity as fast as possible and then that might be like bad for the market to robert's point supply-wise or you see the opposite right so if you have 10-year vehicles they don't need liquidity for 10 years right and it goes the other way where the pendulum swings towards there's no liquidity up front for the founders for the investors whatever where the market demands or the market expects that you know it becomes liquid over a much longer and slower period of time i think you know taurine you mentioned uh paradigm fund and you know i think the difference between like now and four years ago is you can't you know fill up a big chunk of the fund with like bitcoin or ether and you expect to take you know 2 120 on that now people can just go out and buy that directly and so if anything it's like you can't just compare like the numbers that we're seeing apples to oranges uh compared to four years ago if anything these are like larger because they're explicitly bookmarked for like early private venture um and so it's just like a lot of money going into the market yeah although you see things like andreessen buying a ton of lido and putting a ton of ether into lido last week and i feel like that suggests to me that the structure of these things is does allow for some liquid purchases and it's not like this is maybe they're raised adventure funds but the docks probably have some some kind of caveat that like allows people to do some form of trading that's like low frequency enough well there's nothing about a venture fund that disallows you from from trading it's not it's not the most ideal vehicle for it but um you know and recent i think all of their funds have actually been able to buy uh tokens yeah yeah yeah it's more annoying yeah yes i mean it's not that your team is generally not built for that but like yeah you totally can but i think what you're also seeing is that there's just the the disconnect and pricing between publics and privates like i i was just chatting with the investor earlier today about notional finance because actually tom you were talking about this earlier notional finance right now so they're basically um what is it like a fixed rate protocol their market cap they're circulating market right now is 6.5 million and they have 500 million tvl 75 million fully diluted market cap right you know just like a hot a hot seed round is getting done at 75 fully diluted whereas this is like a protocol that has 500 million tdl so now that being said it's not it's positive to just point out one protocol that that doesn't have a high valuation but it goes to show that uh there's just a massive massive disconnect in supply and demand right now for what you see in privates and what you see in publix yeah agreed i think you know it's not just supply and demand i think investors are also thinking about ev and they have you know many years to deploy and i think if the ev of doing these private deals can usually go down as public markets draw down private markets are going to shrink you as a result or we're not going to see as many deals getting done like things aren't going to clear i mean the only the only real answer is that like prices have to go down and ownership has to go up right like these things have to become more and more sort of vc coins where vcs own a large and large chunk otherwise they just can't put the money to work other than that i don't really see a way that this capital can get absorbed given where given where prices are and how many how few private deals there are that can really absorb large amounts of capital and stay fully decentralized last time uh in 2018 this led to the equity bonanza boom of funding equity not token related crypto companies right and i suspect we'll probably start seeing kind of a switch in that i i kind of remember sort of electric kind of claiming that something was actually wrote something in their blog post announcing the fun to be like hey we're going to start doing more companies less tokens or not exactly that but like it had that sort of intonation and i wouldn't be surprised if that's what they told lps that like hey we're like entering the new phase of like companies need capital for being in crypto not just tokens i mean i think you're already seeing it i'm not picking on companies like alchemy but like you have companies that have absolutely bonkers valuations you know for their traction and revenue like alchemy because they can absorb and soak up a lot of capital you know from investors and it's a you know palatable politically correct company right where it's like there's no token risk it's like yeah you can shove hundreds of millions of dollars into it increasing valuations and the valuation can get really in front of the traction and i think you're already seeing that who's the last buyer that's the hard part yeah eventually it has to be an ipo like yeah well silver like who's very famous for looks at watch buying skype they've done some great deals though they've done a great deal they've made a killing off airbnb yeah yeah yeah i'm just pointing out that like you know right right sure yeah right but like when private companies with like modest revenue or trading for like five billion dollars like you should be worried yeah yeah to be fair though the ml boom was no different like i remember seeing price to revenue on some of these self-driving car not even just filtering car companies just like perception ai revenue well they all they all would like sign an loi and claim that that was revenue but yeah let's let's just ignore it let's ignore all those like growth hacking tricks i mean alchemy is very different because it's just like a very easy to underwrite business right you get customers you get you advertise you like get them in you have sas pricing i mean for all of these staking service providers right like at the like one to ten billion dollar range right like block damage like three something figments like 1.6 whatever let's just pretend that they like dominate and aws has to buy someone would they actually buy them at that price like that's like that that thought experiment's the one that like kind of confuses no they'd build they would build because they have the technology is able to be built right also they all of those people use aws so they just can easily snoop on their traffic like that would be what i would do if i was in aws right like i i actually i doubt that aws would build but they don't need to buy the leader right like i mean that's the problem with all these taking providers that they're they're basically all they basically have the same product right it's like very fungible it's very replaceable it's just a matter of the overall security and like the the kind of balance sheet that's backing them in case they get slashed or they mess up so if aws needs to buy somebody they don't need to buy the biggest player um like i don't know why you would you don't you don't really need to yeah amazon should buy lido tokens on the open market that's the answer that's probably disclosure disclosure lied to investors yeah we are we are actually i think all of us are light investors so it's a tricky situation and i think for us um you know i think probably the way that we want to be playing at dragonfly the investing over the next year given the mismatch and supply and demand of capital is just one staying out of the u.s you know where you're seeing these things getting done at like north of 100x revenue um you just go outside the us even whether it's emerging markets or latam or asia things are much much much lower than 100x revenue or even 70x revenue where i'm seeing a lot of deals getting done in the us even now at those at those multiples so i think that's a large part of the answer for us and then also to stay early stage because if you're early stage enough then do seed always works no matter where you are in the market cycle see it always works doesn't necessarily matter all the big gorillas are coming down to seat they can't you know how are they gonna you know that's what they're proclaiming let's put that yes that is what they're proclaiming that is what they're proclaiming but like you you know listen to the economics right if you're if a seed bet is like a basis point of your fund it doesn't like your doesn't make sense like you're not gonna be spending well then you spray and pray at a thousand of those right the question is simply can your brand withstand that right like are you going to keep winning those deals when people know that you're just praying and praying it eventually catches up to you right it takes some time for the market signal to propagate but eventually it gets there right like you don't give your seed round a silver lake it just doesn't it's not how it works and eventually that signal catches up that's my view that's my anyway let's let's move on um so another big news item of the week is andre cronier andre once again ragequit supposedly this time for the final time uh he announced a sunset for all the projects that he's been responsible for great illustration i gotta love the coin telegraph gotta love yeah always on it always on it just the great great graphics so uh yeah so obviously associated with yearn although he hasn't been active on urine for quite a while supposedly according to banteg um also uh involved in phantom um also involved in solidly uh a lot of the projects in the andreosphere have uh have tanked in price since the announcement of his uh uh of his defection how do people feel about the andre drug poll as it's been called i view it as a rug poll i mean the dude has according to people on twitter amassed like a billion dollars of wealth for himself and is leaving with no sense of responsibility towards i don't know how if you're gonna be able to sell that much mim and abracadabra well just just as a heads up i i don't don't mark the market on that one yeah well even if you're not marketing to market i mean i i think it's you know probably one of the most legendary figures in all of d5 not crypto right but defy history like the most legendary marketer of new projects he's started so many projects he's a genius in so many ways right like and i have a lot of respect for him in so many ways but i feel like this was almost an inevitable end state which is you know after project eight you know you just call it quits and right off into the sunset with a billion dollars and that's it you know i don't know i mean obviously i have immense respect for andre i think urine is is you know great and i think you know the whole wi-fi distribution and giving way was you know incredible and there's very few people who think have you know this kind of character in building chops frankly leaders in terms of like shipping ability but i i will say you know maybe i'm not in the in the andre fan club and that like you know the tough part in building products is not shipping something right it's not i mean that is that is tough alone but it's like finding product market fit and and iterating and building something that's sticky i would say very very few things basically nothing frankly outside of urine has had that that andre has produced and it's like and you gotta give banteg all the credit and yeah and others of our speaking foreign our russian and ukrainian projects like urine is like all of these people and it's like 50 people in in russia and ukraine for the most part urine is not andre urine is a huge team of incredibly skilled people it's people who should get over from andre right andre sort of basically orphaned urine anyway i'll just say like that's really where i think the true entrepreneurs are made is in like grinding it out and you know sticking it out through many different iterations of the product until you find something that that works and it's pretty easy to just launch a bunch of stuff and then bail when you don't get the product market fit um i think that is like uh not as impressive yeah look i i i wouldn't say i'm an andre fan or an android detractor i i feel for the guy i can imagine how difficult it must be to be in that position where you're constantly getting pulled in so many different directions and you've got the internet yelling at you no matter what you do and he's been he's been very public about his emotional experience being a builder and define and i feel for the guy but i also feel like this this is not the most responsible way to go i get it and i can't fault a man for you know following his heart and his conviction but it does suck to see someone leave that way i may be more sympathetic than everyone else here but i do think phantom was kind of a very ill-fated experiment to actually follow through on the promises that were made there i think was way about exactly one of the promises for phantom i i'm not super clear what avax is here here's my conspiracy theory okay and this is the extremely bearish take on the situation phantom presented itself as an opportunity where there's basically an unused blockchain and andre saw this as an opportunity to as a magnet bring users and bring activity to phantom when phantom was unloved unused and extremely cheap right so it's like his ex die yeah and he basically was able to create the entire phantom ecosystem himself essentially so like phantom should be extremely grateful to him for that you know i saw one incredible chart this week that during the mania of andre quitting transaction volume on phantom exceeded that on ethereum for a brief moment in time that was the guy's launch yeah like if you asked me a year ago if phantom activity would exceed ethereum activity ever i would have laughed at you right but that was that was made of reality and he single-handedly created that now selfishly did he probably profit from that massively yes absolutely right he basically probably owned a large portion of phantom before being the sole magnet to bring users and activity and transactions to it right and the sole champion to be honest he was like basically the loudest champion and developer that the entire chain had like by two orders of magnitude right and that succeeded in phantom today is like what top 20 i mean it's crazy i don't think it's top 20 anymore right maybe not anymore maybe it's yeah it's 39 it's already not top 20 anymore now it's 39. but like it's still a four billion dollar blockchain it was a like 100 million dollar blockchain not long ago look like preamble we all can agree that that andre is like i mean he's amazing he's a genius activist investing phantom was like probably one of the greatest active investing coups that we've seen in crypto period agreed it shows the danger of having your reliance on a single person especially when that person is not you know kind of tied to you the way that a founder might be right because andre sort of adopted phantom and if you adopt you know blockchain you can just assume drop it so i mean the one big difference between phantom and avax is that you know avax has you know uh goon who's the you know one of the co-founders of avax goon is not going to rage quit right goon is not going anywhere he's he's tied to the hip to that thing whereas andre can leave whenever he wants and when you have that that enormous level of dependence on a single person you know you're like germany and russia however eos is the counter example where all the folks around here was bailed and it was their blockchain right that's true that's true i guess that's yeah that's the importance of uh not letting yeah that was a regular pull not a rug reg reg oh hahaha i think my joke was better but whatever it's fine you guys tied for best workout yeah all right tom gets runner up for uh for best joke of that segment so last up um i wanted to i wanted to also drop this because it's a little bit of a self plug but you know screw it we're running the show so um this week we announced uh we had this blog post we've worked on for a very very long time called the amm test a no look at l1 performance and in this test basically what we did is we benchmarked all of the major evm based layer ones alongside solana so to see uh you know they make large claims for themselves uh about how much performance they can actually do and the question is okay if you take a fair benchmark the fair benchmark we came up with was being uniswap style universal v2 style trades um what is the actual trades per second that you can get both at equilibrium and at max throughput on each of these chains and the answer was you know maybe lower than what you'd expect uh so i think ethereum was like 10 solana was about 270. avalanche was about uh 37 i think or something at equilibrium but then max was like 170. buying a smart chain by far the largest of the evms at i think like 190. so uh that gives you a good sense of what kind of throughput blockchains can actually do today and we thought that this was really important because we saw especially among entrepreneurs so much misunderstanding about how much throughput these projects can actually do and when of course when they release their own numbers and this is true even of companies that we've invested in uh when they release their own numbers their their benchmarks that they that they use are very misleading because they're usually all transfers and they're almost always done on test nets which are completely unrepresentative of what real smart contract engineers are going to be doing on these chains and so we end up publishing this and getting some love and then the solana crowd got really mad at us and uh i think uh i mean to be fair you did go after you know they were the you know you did kind of go after them no i mean look we we kind of have to right they're the king you gotta you gotta go out and i i i i think the interesting thing that this brought up in general is just this idea that a blockchains are pretty cool because you can actually go test this so that's that's first of all that's like an improvement right um you can test this without you committing a ton of resources versus like if i want to measure some like sas startups claim on aws it's like a lot more nuanced to actually be able to do that and in fact they're companies that do that for you and then it's it's a it's interesting there's gonna be a bureau of weights and measures for blockchains in like 20 years yeah yeah yeah well it's going to be uh it's going to be all the funds here who are like invested in one block chance without doing it but uh like kind of like this this this seems like to be the the way i would expect it to play out but the interesting thing i thought from the twitter commentary was this fact of like people caring about message types of like how many messages do we consider consensus messages how many messages do we consider non-consensus messages and like if you consider consensus messages in your transactions and like in your tps rate that's kind of like juicing it a bit right because you're like hey those had to happen anyway and this those aren't necessarily messages that are economic transactions so i think the interesting thing we're going to see is that the is that we're going to have non-fungibility of accounting over time in all these metrics and it's only going to increase because like no one's incentivized to like make a homogenous thing instead you're going to have the cat and mouse game of like people like you guys going and doing i mean that's the role of benchmarking right the whole point of a benchmark is to have a third party that is you know doesn't have uh that isn't any of the parties involved that's a go in and run a neutral test yeah exactly that that's reproducible and so we have we put all the code on github so people can go run the tests themselves and post their numbers now the question of methodology is a fair one right because when we when we when we benchmark solana you know one of the things that makes solana not ideal for this particular test is that this test really only measures a single threaded execution of a single uniswap pool and solana has this um there's this concept that actually you know nobody we talked to actually understood how solana worked so we had to go in and like go through a bunch of ourselves that like nobody we'd like none of the validators none of the people even on the solana team could explain it to us um so we had to go you know go to the source material and go into the code ourselves and uh understand how solana has this notion of compute units which is kind of like gas but like not exactly like gas and there's a there's a limit of 12 million compute units per block per account and there's 48 million that you can totally be in a block so which means that if you wanted to max out new swap trades you could do four different uniform pools uh so provided that there's no that they're completely segregated in state you could do four uniform pools simultaneously within a single block but of course we did not include the consensus overhead because as you mentioned to roon uh every block on solana the consensus messages are part of the on-chain transactions which fill up a block which is weird because no other blockchain does that so in order to get a real apple staples about what can you actually do at this sort of user level right like the real metrics you care about is like what can a user do or what what actual throughput can applications get on top of solana to really get the apple samples is complex but of course none of these other blockchains are multi-threaded in that way you can't parallelize uniswap trades on any other blockchain so the it truly fair benchmark would involve multiple things not just okay how many trades can you get on a single uniform pool um but of course when solana goes down it's because there's a single pool or a single ideo or a single thing that everyone's sniping at and this is the reason why it goes down is because it gets overloaded on a kind of single piece of state that's in high contention well i think the other thing that's interesting about their compute model that probably also makes this even more annoying is that technically the user is supposed to provide dependencies to some extent to state and like obviously i'm sure like literally zero wallets do that and they just try to like run everything serially and so then you get this weird thing where like there was some extra parallelism but like the user can't figure out how to send the right transactions to take advantage of it um which i think it is like way less common in other sort of chains because like basically evm even though it's annoying assumes the user's an idiot which is you know kind of the goal there i mean i mean we the evm is trying to move to stateless clients as well right that's on the right roadmap well trust me everything's on youtube they're gonna have celestia now soon right dank sharding i mean it's like what isn't on the e2 road map that's a better question my takeaway and this was the important one to me was that all of the blockchains almost equally suck well if you look at the graph they don't all equally suck but they all suck relative to claim relative to claims yeah i think relative to claims the spread between blockchains is much smaller than advertised i think that's the big thing the way and the other thing is like it's not to say that none of these blockchains will get there right like we're i'm i'm bullish that solana will figure out a lot of these things and the reality is a lot of these blockchains are just not very optimized like they haven't been around that long and the workloads that they're going to be under are you know surprising to the to the founders involved and so there's a lot of work that can be done both at the smart contract layer but also at the infrastructure layer to just optimize the hell out of these things so i'm gonna guess there's at least like a four or five x you can get just out of optimizing the current workloads we we didn't talk about the failure of the week actually speaking of this now now you're running it which is esmos epic fail i feel like it's unfair to talk about like a blockchain stumbling in its first week of launch i feel like i a lot of people beforehand we're talking about how like the code base was not super well thoroughly tested like if you want to before you get there so quick background so evmos is an evm compatible cosmos chain that was very hyped up there was sort of there was no pre-mine uh there was gonna be this like wrecked wrecks drop uh there was like everybody in the kazoo system was very excited about the launch of evmos and um after the first after the initial launch uh there was a protocol upgrade and the protocol upgrade failed and the chain halted and it's still in a halted state as of right now is my understanding while the validators try to figure out how to how to get the system back up and running yeah that's a pretty good summary i think the main the main thing that is has been its issue is that d gens are still trying to like they're having this problem where like the validators are trying to restart the chain and within two seconds there's five million transactions trying it's like kind of like the solana restart problem except that genesis like that's it's a lot harder to have that happen like right at birth and it's sort of a little bit weird i mean there is a kind of interesting thing if you compare like validator communities and like say swanna to like or avex to like cosmos there's a lot more diy validators um and a lot more sort of like it's a just more diverse set of validators if we're gonna to be honest and like the cat hurting to get this is get this kind of off the grounds a little bit crazy and i feel like they really rushed the launch because they hyped up the drop and they didn't do a lot of testing like they their test net was like live for like three weeks two weeks it was a very short test testing period because they like hyped up this drop where like anyone who'd ever been sandwich attacked on ethereum would automatically get a ton of esmos you know my real question is is there going to be a wrecked square drop like if i got wrecked on direct drop do i get another that's solid that's all you should you should launch a fork where that that has it right now no no no i mean i wish them all i feel like i feel like if they just didn't hype it so much it would have like not it would have been easier to like launch this thing and now they're instead like there's like this bot army ready to try to collect their all the drops uh and so it's gonna be it's gonna it'll be a little bit dicey i think for yeah ironically their attempts to uh reward people for being victims mvp has now made them a massive victim to me they should have tried to do it on the test net like test the wreck drop out first on the test net before going straight to prod with it i think that's the thing that because it's like a new it's a novel mechanism and it's worth kind of like making sure it works first how do you actually prove um that you were sandwich attacked on ethereum do they just have a snapshot all the addresses they did a snapshot but the problem is it's like part of their consensus that you can claim it so like it's a little it's like a consensus rule that that's like built in so it's like very tightly coupled in a way that is not great so got it but i i think it'll it'll be interesting like the cosmos ecosystem is interesting because it's like grown so much organically without any bridges like it's it's basically impossible to get from eath to cosmos without going through luna and you know going going from eath to luna to cosmos is like a nightmare any bridges you say it is a little strange that like gaza's been so successful without bridges i thought the whole idea was supposed to be the interoperability network well no no sorry without bridges to eat to get people's capital over i i i mean more like hey you you know when you grow these ecosystems you need to be able to like let people onboard their capital from other places that they have it right no no i know i'm being prestigious yeah we were early investors in cosmos and you know i love the cosmos vision i think they've done very well but i'm still a little bit mystified at what's really going on in the ecosystem because it does feel like a lot of face planting that's been going on in the last couple months but it seems the momentum behind cosmos is really really strong yeah i and and i i do think the ibc user experience is a hundred million times better than the bridges like it is just coherent i think the real problem is the luna luna actually has made its own little territory that like you know makes tries to make the ux difficult for some of the cosmos wallets yeah but ultimately when most the value is outside of cosmos that that that is where ibc really struggles is uh when you're outside of the kind of cosmos wealth garden anyway we're over time so we should we should we should call it here thank you everybody for tuning in again this week and we'll be back in a fortnight from now thanks everyone you
