your third round congratulations it's a 125 million dollar new venture fund but before we get into that since we've actually never had you on the show for a long interview just about you why don't you tell us about your background and one confirmation sure so my background i kind of fell down the rabbit hole back in 2013 and um i was just a random person on the internet in portland maine and a lot of people talk about you know why they fell down the rabbit hole whether it's for technology or economics and for me what initially drew me was kind of the social movement that i saw happening online back then i like a lot of people read this wired article about this magic internet money that was being used to buy guns and drugs on silk road you know that was the early media narrative as you well know and i think wasn't it a gawker article or maybe maybe it was a different one there are a few i think i think you know different publications were writing about at that time to get clicks and i've always been an online community person so dating back to like middle school and i was interested in comic books high school and i was interested in sneakers i've always wanted to dive online to online forms to see kind of who was talking about things that i was interested in so when i first read this article i was intrigued um i jumped onto bitcoin talk which is the first online forum that satoshi actually created and r slash bitcoin and what i saw was kind of underneath the surface of the media headlines there was this really passionate community of people from around the world who weren't aligned by physical location meaning they were you know they weren't in any one particular location um but they were aligned by a shared belief system meaning they all kind of believed in the values of bitcoin and economic incentives meaning they all owned bitcoin and to me what got me so excited was what i saw these uh people forming based on you know values and economics and um i saw a social movement happening and that's when i kind of decided i want to do something in crypto talked to you know every different founder in the space at this time you know i was uh meeting with uh you know the bit instant team in new york city and skyping with uh mount gox you know these are some of the early leaders uh at the time and i connected with brian and fred of coinbase and um actually i was one of the first a couple hundred users of coinbase product uh which kind of led me there reached out to brian and then joined shortly after that so that was kind of how i you know long-winded way of telling you how i got in the crypto space and kind of what drew me and uh yeah i had a great experience at coinbase and back in 2017 started one confirmation and here we are and so far across your two previous funds you had raised 70 million dollars what has your investment thesis been over time and how have your bets played out so our thesis is very simple uh back kind of authentic founders that have deep historical context on crypto that are building products that we understand as users i think like there's a ton of different ways to make money in crypto for for us we've kind of stuck to what we understand and what we get excited about as users and that has uh has treated us well and that's kind of what we're going to continue to do i think there's you know a lot of investors in the space that are trading based on memes or uh you know fundamentals or uh you know there's a whole bunch of ways to to make money but for us it's products that we get excited about as users and again that's kind of what led me to coinbase uh back in 2013 you know like back then i was buying uh bitcoin by uh taking out cash from an atm wiring it to muk cox via western union and that was you know the the best way to buy bitcoin at that time right and then companies came along was just this product that made it dead simple and you know that that's kind of what drew me and so we kind of let the products guide our investment thinking and um and yeah that's it's gone you know pretty well i mean it's kind of allowed us to invest in d5 before d5 was a category nfts before nfts was a category and um yeah now these categories are of course very hot but we're kind of thinking about you know what's next i think by focusing on product it allows you to kind of ignore a lot of the noise in the space that's really interesting yeah i i have plenty of questions for you about nfts and d5 because obviously i did see you were so early on those trends as for this latest fund of 125 million dollars what do you plan to do with that money uh we're going to continue you know the strategy that we we have been executing which is you know invest in companies cryptocurrencies and uh nfts as well we tend to focus on uh bleeding edge technologies right so we like to be early money in at the kind of precede or seed stage and write checks you know anywhere between a million and three million um and we also take kind of core cryptocurrency positions so um that's kind of the strategy that that we've been executing and yeah the new fund um it's really just a continuation of what we've been doing um and it you know it's a slightly bigger fund so um you know some of the the sizes of investments and things like that may increase a little but you know we really just want to kind of continue what we're doing um i think focus has has treated us well all right so let's talk about nfts as we mentioned you were very early on the nft bandwagon and i have been noticing um you've you know invested in kind of a diversity of different nft plays there's open c which is a bigger platform super where which is pretty focused um fort or forte i'm not sure how to say that um so first of all let's just you know talk nfts generally why do you think they've taken off so much in the last several months well i think they're bringing new people into the space uh in a way that nothing else in cryptocurrency has right like i've been waiting for uh you know my brother for example who's like outside of crypto and uh you know isn't that interested in finance to uh you know to get excited about crypto and that's happened with you know something like top shots right so kind of nfts uh are bringing in people who are interested in sports or music or art uh you know culture outside of crypto in a way that nothing else has up until nfts it was very kind of finance money and certainly kind of finance money is part of nfts as well um you know it is for a lot of people still about uh you know making money but it's kind of combining uh you know finance and culture in a really exciting way and i think it's just getting started like nfts right now are mostly just kind of static files um that you can't do much with right you can show them off in your home on a digital frame or you could show them off on your open c profile but you can't use them in you know virtual worlds or in games and things like that and and i think that stuff's all coming but yeah i think what really catalyzed it in the past six months was just so much culture coming in and and making money and um so yeah to be clear it's still you know mostly about making money now but it's it's kind of combining culture and money in a fun way yeah it's interesting that you say that because this also is the first time i got my sister interested in a crypto and she's an entrepreneur in fashion and yeah uh nfts are also what finally drew her because otherwise my whole family was like why are you always talking about this stuff yeah yeah in particular i would add what i what i really love about it is it enables a new business model for creatives right and like i've always thought that you know the first couple hundred million people that get into crypto it would be uh they would buy it and invest in it um but like the you know the billions of people that come in i think their first way is going to be earning it and so how easy it is for you know a creator to go on uh you know open c and use their create tool to sell an nft um or you know a really talented artist to go on super air and and sell kind of a you know a premium piece of crypto art like that that is really powerful and it's bringing in new people uh you know to earn rather than to uh to invest or to speculate and that's that's super exciting to me so it's interesting that we're talking about this because i did see that you did tell the new york times that we're in an nft bubble and also um i saw you told cheddar that there will be a secondary market but you also said quote well some of the stuff that's getting bought now at millions of dollars go down in value i would say so so kind of where do you see this vision with nfts going do you expect a lot of these buyers will make money or is it just mostly the creators that will or how will this kind of market end up you know looking a few years down the line i think it's you know the bubble is better for creators than retail speculators right what i like about this nft bubble is it's like you know it's artists and and creatives and it's not like opportunistic business people for the most part that are like you know launching a 100 million dollar ico right so it's but i but i think there are a lot of parallels to the you know 2017 ico boom in that you know there's kind of an explosion of people creating and there's an explosion of kind of retail demand to invest in these things and you know just like in uh 2017 we saw you know floyd mayweather you know endorsing icos now we're seeing uh a different iteration of you know celebrities that are launching nfts and i think it's not to write them all off um i think there are some that kind of understand what's happening and are doing it in an authentic way that i think could create long-term value for the retail investors that are investing in these things but i think there's also a lot of you know cash grabs just like there were in in 2017. so yeah i would say there's probably a small percentage of the nfts being created right now that that i would say will have you know long-term value that said just like in 2017 where a lot of these you know what would seem like scams you know they're still here and that could the same could happen for for nfts right because value is just about belief and if you have people believing that these things have value um then they're going to continue to have value well so i know that as an investor this may not be your area exactly but i'm sure you've thought about this and i just wondered you know at this moment as you mentioned nfts tend to be pretty static there isn't a lot people can do with them um and so that kind of leads us to this moment where the main use case is speculation but i was just wondering over time what do you think will eventually make a good nft or what sort of creative things do you see coming down the pike that you expect will become bigger trends uh well one thing i'm super excited about is you know nfts within uh virtual worlds right the metaverse which you know a lot of people are are excited about you know a recent example uh is me bits which you know you probably saw a project launched by the larva labs team uh you know the same team behind crypto punks and i think you know i'm not sure that me bits is going to be kind of you know the winner here but the idea of like a 3d avatar that you can use as your avatar within a virtual world uh as opposed to a static uh image that you could use maybe as a you know your avi on twitter for example uh i think that's a step in the right direction so i think kind of uh nfts that you can use within virtual worlds either as your identity or maybe you know to compete you know to play games and things like that that's uh super exciting i mean a lot you know a lot of the nft ogs remember the you know when crypto kitties uh launched and there was an ecosystem that a small ecosystem that emerged on top where you could uh race your cryptokitty right um i forget what the name of that project was but uh that was pretty cool and i think we're going to start we're already seeing that with things like zed run i'm not sure if you've looked at that or covered that in the past but that's gotten a lot of excitement it's basically uh virtual horses that you can collect compete in horse races so this type of thing i think is still incredibly early and i think when you can you know we see the attachment people have to have to their nfts now when it's just a static file but imagine when you can actually use these to compete and to make more money and things like that that's super exciting and so as we mentioned earlier you have invested in these different types of platforms you know for instance openc is kind of like a catch-all platform and then there are others like super ware that are focused on a specific niche how do you think competition between these types of platforms will shake out um well i think i get asked this question a lot because there's a lot of new nft marketplaces popping up and i think really just like any other type of marketplace the the long-term differentiation is kind of brand uh and product i think that's how they're all competing right now so opencv for example you know has a really strong brand as kind of the leading secondary marketplace for nfts and they have a really good product and they've kind of innovated uh on product you know at a really fast clip and added features that users want and really and stayed focused on that so there's definitely you know an opportunity for other marketplaces focused on kind of other niches to build their brand around that niche maybe focus on primary rather than secondary and build a really good product and that's kind of uh that's happening right we're starting to see marketplaces for uh you know music nfts or different types of sports nfts and i think that's just going to continue but yeah at the end of the day i think it's like to win as an nft marketplace you really you know you need to focus on building a really strong brand and there's a lot of ways to differentiate your brand and build a great product so in a way maybe what you're describing is that some of the specialized ones will be kind of like more primary sales and then uh something like an open c will be more focused on secondary sales is that kind of where you were going with that well that is the case right so so openc is like why they've really uh succeeded is they've been a general purpose platform for all nfts right and they've devin and alex are really tapped into what's happening in nfts and they've been really quick to add new nft projects right so for example you know a couple weeks ago me launched and me bits very quickly was added to the openc platform and very quickly tens of millions of dollars worth of secondary trading was happening on openc the whole openc business you know the reason why they launched in the first place is cryptokitties popped up and uh cryptokitties was charging something like five percent to buy uh you know on the crypto kitty's marketplace and what makes an nft right at the end of the day it's true ownership so the idea of like a marketplace controlling the buying and selling of that nft doesn't make a ton of sense opencv saw that they launched it you know a secondary marketplace and um they decided to charge 2.5 instead of five you know percent right so that's kind of the open seat business but there is room for primary marketplaces um i tend to think openc for a secondary marketplace openc uh is likely the winner i'm i think open c is going to be a multi-billion dollar company you know if you look at their uh gmv gross merchandise value over the past three months it's been over a hundred million um they're gonna have their biggest month ever this month that's openc but i think you know like we just invested in a marketplace for uh music nfts i think music nfts are gonna start uh exploding so far it's really been uh visual creators that are really capitalizing on this but imagine when uh audio creators and there are some that are doing like you know blau he's created some awesome kind of uh audio plus visual stuff but i i'm pretty excited about just purely audio nfts really exploding in activity and you know we just invested in a platform that's doing primary audio uh nfts uh and building a strong brand around that because they understand the music space really well they're to curate to get really high-end you know emerging artists on the platform and things like that and so what does that look like because i in a way i it's funny because the logical side of my brain still feels like it doesn't get nfts and yet when the kings of leon nft was announced i was like i have to have that and so on yeah yeah i even by the way i paid 90 in gas fees for a 65 nft but anyway i um so i you know obviously i seem to get it on an emotional level um but so i was wondering for these music nfts are they going to be based on scarcity or is it still going to be something you know like the kings of leon nfc i could get that on my apple music so like yeah like and yet at the same time i felt the need to buy the not so um so you know just for these music nfts that you're talking about are they ones that you know people will be able to get through their subscription music service or will it be something that is scarce so i think collecting in fts is all about authentic ownership right it's not about owning like a piece of music that no one else can listen to but it's owning the true creation that was created by the artist that you love that is the case with digital art right like this uh robbie barat i own this um anyone could show that off in a digital frame but only i own the authentic version of that right and i think if robbie brock grows in importance in the world then there will be demand in the future for uh authentic ownership and so that it's the same is true with with music like what i like about a catalog is the name of this marketplace that we uh recently invested in catalog.works and what i like about this marketplace is the team behind it is really plugged into indie music right and like indie music is not uh well suited for like the existing platforms like if you're someone brand new um spotify it's really hard to get distribution on spotify and soundcloud like five years ago used to be really good for this but soundcloud also changed their algorithm and so for like brand new artists it's hard uh to break through and and connect with your fans and and i think there's an opportunity for a new kind of indie music discovery platform and so what catalog is doing is kind of trying to bootstrap this new you know discovery platform with a business model that can get these artists who have maybe 10 fans but that really love them that are willing to pay a thousand dollars for their their authentic piece so the hope is when like i've i've started collecting stuff on catalog for some you know new artists that i love and for me it's not because i like want to be the only one to listen to this or it's the music is scarce it's because the authentic ownership is scarce and i hope that the artists that i buy on catalog end up blowing up getting huge on spotify and then i think there's going to be more demand for like that authentic you know first work that they dropped on catalog you know what i mean uh okay right right yeah it's like having a signed version of the book or something yep right yep okay obviously i've been talking about this on my show for months now and i still have heard of me as like wait why do these have value well one thing i've written a blog post about this and i think this is uh this can be a helpful mental model it's like humans fundamentally desire what others desire and they desire what's scarce and like you think about you know if you own a house right i mean part of owning a house is you know you want to show it off to your friends and your neighbors or whatever when you own a house you you show it off to a very limited number of people owning an nft it's kind of it's this global thing that you can show it off to the world and so i think that explains why like people are willing to pay millions of dollars i know people that have paid millions of dollars for crypto punks that you know that don't own their house and i think that's part of it it's this like kind of belief that more and more people in the future will desire this thing and it's at like a global scale uh in a way that even like homeownership isn't so i'm kind of very bullish on the long-term value of of kind of very uh blue chip or high-end nfts i think you talk about a bubble i think just like uh you know in 2017 that like the high quality you know assets were good buys even at that time i think kind of the same is likely to be true about nfts because again it's just like why do and why does any cryptocurrency have value it's belief it's the fact that people other people desire these things once the desire uh you know gets going it kind of it can especially with like internet-based products get really big yeah i mean obviously the difference with uh these cryptocurrencies is that they have utility like bitcoin has utility ether has utility and yet at the same time i while you were talking i just had this vision of instagram feeds right it's like people kind of show off their experiences but now with nfts they'll sort of show off their possessions and i think it's like a different way of showing status which i i you know i now that i think about it i i did see some commentary saying nfts are basically a way to show status and i think maybe the more i think about it maybe that's what it is but anyway i like it it's a hugely um fascinating thing to me because obviously this just has taken off it's gotten a bunch of non-crypto friends of mine interested um and yeah like i said the logical side of my brain is like why i don't get it but just to challenge you on that i mean there certainly are some cryptocurrencies now that have utility and that a lot of people are using but uh you know cardano has a 75 billion dollar market cap right now right is that is that because cardinal has utility ada or whatever their cryptocurrency is you know this is a good question because every time well not i don't know if every time but often when i tweet now i get spammed by these cardano supporters who want me to do an interview on uh yeah and so it i mean it's fascinating you know another good example is dogecoin exactly yeah i mean these cryptocurrency it's belief right the r why why is everyone spamming you uh about cardano it's not because these cardano is useful to these people it's because they own it and they believe it's valuable and they believe it's going to increase in value and they want you to talk about it right so i think uh nfts are a good parallel it's like it's the meme but i think it's even more uh interesting because there's actually like a human creator behind it uh as opposed to these cryptocurrencies so i actually think people could feel more attachment to a lot of these nfts than they do uh you know these cryptocurrencies yeah i i could see that that makes sense um so i want to ask you a question about two people that i think you'd know well who were recently on my show mark cuban who is an investor in one confirmation and devin fincher the co-founder and ceo of openc and so mark told me that his light bulb moment around nfts was when he realized that creators could get royalties in perpetuity off the secondary sales and then later when i interviewed devin he said he thought people would try to get around paying those royalties and that basically like that's not going to be a thing kind of i don't know if he went that far but you know he kind of said like the likelihood you're going to get the royalties as a creator is you know you you may not get them so it's just curious to hear your take how do you think that's going to play out do you expect that buyers will try to pay that cut to the creators or that they'll try to circumvent that um i think there's definitely i mean the data has already shown that there are there are collectors that want to honor that right and so super air for example has paid out millions of dollars in in royalties to crypto artists on super rare so i think that's an important thing um it's hard to enforce right because again and nft is about uh true ownership and you know people being able to do whatever they want with it and so there may always be a marketplace that allows you to to buy and sell it without giving that artist the royalty and there's probably a segment of people that will always want uh to do that uh on the buyers side but look particularly on super air i can just say like there's a collector community that really values what the artists are doing and appreciates artists work and and wants to support artists and it is uh really powerful that you know an artist you know if we ever sell this robbie barat you know robbie will get a you know a significant cut of that and and robbie himself has already made uh you know tens of thousands of dollars in in royalties from secondary sales on you know on super air so i would say it's definitely happening i think it's going to continue to be kind of a thing um how big it is and how how much people actually honor that i'm not exactly sure so just for the people listening on audio nick when he references this he keeps pointing to a framed painting behind you but i realize now it must be digital because i see a cord hanging from it so is that an nft and then that was a physical version that you got as for buying the nft this is a digital frame so this is called a mural canvas 2 which you could buy um for you know 400 bucks and you put it on your wall and show off your you know your nft collection so you know you download an app and yeah i basically have an app that i can change it and uh it's fun right i can show off my there's a coldy vitalik which is one of my favorites wait a white type of vitalik coldy is one of kind of the og crypto artists he's a he's an awesome uh artist he's one and one of the first creators on superhero as well so this is one of uh his his best works in my opinion oh wow yeah people if you're listening on audio you should come check out the video to see this version of italic it looks like yeah like a a video game version of italic or something yeah right so in a moment we're gonna have one more question about nfts that i am curious about but

more at ey.com global blockchain summit or blockchain.ey.com back to my conversation with nick tomato so one other thing that has been happening now that nfts are taking off and normies are entering crypto is that we've seen a lot of pushback against proof-of-work mining increase and i wondered how do you see these environmental concerns affecting mainstream adoption and what do you think is the best way to address that all cryptocurrencies are narrative based and i think this is a narrative that is certainly uh picking up steam and it's particularly picked up steam within the uh the art community it kind of you know with elon's tweet uh you know last week it's it's gone even crazier but a couple of months ago there was a lot uh within the crypto art community actually uh you know talking about this and artists tend to i think be socially minded and um and they actually you know we're talking about this first and you know there was a segment of ethereum artists who left to uh you know to go to a platform on tezos for example because you know ethereum is still proof of work and tesla's proof of stakes so i'm tbd on like how big of a impact this has in the long term wait because ethereum's moving to proof of stake or why well i i just mean like people caring about this environmental proof-of-work narrative generally like really i feel like it's just getting worse well it seems to be right now but i don't know i'm it seems to be particularly from people that don't like bitcoin that um you know or don't see uh value in bitcoin and i i listened to actually part of your podcast uh last week i think you had some really good guys uh i forget who oh alex and alex gladstein and james mcginnis talking about uh proof of work in the environmental impact yes yeah yeah yeah great show yeah if you missed that they should listen to that and again i don't like i i've spent all my time on uh like new products in cryptocurrency so i don't understand much of what's going on or have to much time to devote to environmental stuff but from my perspective it's a narrative um that people seem to care about at this current moment but the main reason they care about it is because they don't see utility in bitcoin and so i think as more people care about bitcoin and more people around the world recognize you know the utility of bitcoin i think that you know that the narrative could die i mean one thing i was thinking about is like if you think about tesla right tesla obviously you know electric cars better for the environment but why do people buy teslas i'm sure there are some people that buy it for that but like you know i have a tesla i have a lot of friends that have teslas and all the people i know they didn't buy it because you know it's great for the environment they bought it because it's a great product uh and it's great that it's great for the environment but it's a very i mean compared to any other car it it's just the best product i think you know i think in the long run the best products will win and the uh you know the environmental stuff will will prove to be a bit overblown um that's my kind of view i i also recognize that environmental issues are are becoming increasingly important and this could be kind of a blind spot for me but that's yeah yeah i i will have to disagree with you so we'll have to check back in a few years because from my perspective i think that people are viewing climate change as becoming a worse problem that should have been addressed longer ago and so the more time that elapses with it not being addressed the worse the problem gets and the harder it is to fix it so i feel like kind of the desperation of people who care about that issue is getting even stronger moment by moment i mean now with this new administration being more friendly to environmental initiatives um that might lessen but yeah um so we'll have to see how this plays out but i don't disagree with that though but but i think what i'm saying is that like you know a lot of people that are saying this about bitcoin don't understand the facts of what actually is better for the environment like you know the traditional fiat system and payment infrastructure or bitcoin like there's no doubt that people are going to increasingly care about the environment but i just think the the narrative the reality is different than the narrative and and as the product of bitcoin proves to be more and more useful the mainstream perception of that will uh adjust for that that's kind of yeah yeah and actually um this goes back to that episode that you referred to because in that episode alex gladstein of the human rights foundation gives a really detailed description of how the us dollar is essentially something called a petro dollar and how um it's basically fossil fuel money so um so it is uh interesting that bitcoin is taking the brunt of this criticism when actually the us dollar um really is heavily tied to fossil fuels so um all right so let's switch tax um we we kind of keep going off on tangents so i have a whole host of other topics i wanted to touch on so ethereum is facing issues with scaling to layer to quickly enough to meet demand and i don't know if you saw this tweets from that kane warwick of synthetics had in it he talked about how this this problem has given a foothold to competitors like binance smart chain and solana and i wondered you know for you as an investor like how are you and your portfolio companies thinking about how to scale like there's this period now where kind of d5 is a bit fragmented in layer two so are you advising portfolio companies to all try to go on the same layer too are you having them check out building on other protocols entirely or you know what how do you think this period is going to play out well i would say um it reminds me a lot of kind of the 2015 era of kind of of crypto where there was bitcoin that was working really well they had a really passionate community of people um and then something else came along like ethereum that uh you know the tribal bitcoiners didn't like and thought everything was going to happen on bitcoin and you know people are still i think there's still people out there that are waiting for rootstock or some of these side chains initiatives right there's still people that think uh defy is going to happen on on bitcoin and it it just shows you how uh biased people are and and how tribal people in crypto are right so um i use that example to say like look i think we're incredibly bullish on ethereum and the ethereum ecosystem pretty much everything we've invested in as a fund to date all the applications have been on ethereum um and and it's working really well um but i'm not someone who thinks everything is gonna happen on ethereum right that view uh gets you a lot of likes on twitter it's kind of playing the the card of the tribe right but um but i think what one thing i've always liked about ethereum is kind of a more open ethos and while there are some of these tribal people uh you know within i mean like vitalik is not himself tribal at all and and the culture of ethereum is more open and inclusive and it and it's always been and so i hope the ethereum community can uh kind of follow uh vitalik's lead on that and be open-minded to you know the idea of not everything happening on ethereum i think just like in 20 you know 16 like there are a lot of you know some promising initiatives at the layer two um that are bringing scalability ethereum and some of that stuff may happen it's probably gonna take a lot longer than you know we think and i think if you're a uh you know a crypto heart marketplace that where people are buying a piece of crypto art for thousands of dollars then paying 50 or 90 for a transaction is okay right um but you know for a hundred dollar uh you know asset within a game or something it's just not viable i don't want to dismiss layer 2 because matt we have a few portfolio companies in particular that are using matic right now and um well oh my polygon yeah every everyone still says matic but right um it's a it's a more unique name but anyway yeah yeah um but um but yeah we're very excited about uh other layer one chains like polkadot and cosmos that are bringing in new developers enabling enabling new use cases that ethereum simply can't uh support right now right and those use cases the naysayers will say well where are those new use cases you know these platforms have been around for many years now but um but it feels to me like we're still kind of we're in like the 2017 period for ethereum where back in 2017 it was all speculation there wasn't uh billions of dollars uh tied up uh you know in in uh in ethereum smart contracts i think we're kind of in that period for other layer ones um and i think it's still uh i'm open-minded like i i don't have a strong view on you know which of those are going to to win how i think about it is that it's likely going to be a platform that offers something kind of new and different so i don't love when i hear like a a platform just talking about scalability benefits and just like kind of executing the ethereum idea better what i'm most excited about is like kind of new ideas that are pushing the space forward in different ways so what i mean by this i mean one example is uh is governance right like polka dot has a his radical approach to on-chain governance and uh you know ethereum is all about governance minimization right and kind of vitalik has has never uh been in favor of of kind of on-chain governance and i think something like polka dot and their radical approach to long-chain governance is this kind of fundamentally new idea to crypto that is pushing the space forward whereas something like finance smart chain or solana they're really copying ethereum and just trying to do it better and i don't think that's uh likely to to really uh you know push the space forward and win in the long term although i could be wrong oh this is this is so fascinating everything that you just said so a couple of different questions so first of all um earlier when you said that some of your portfolio companies were on polygon or matic um is that because you kind of tried to get a bunch of them onto the same layer too like do you feel that this period where the um you know different uh smart contracts can be fragmented on different way or twos as a problem no um no like we don't really push i mean we'll give our feedback but like we we let uh you know our portfolio companies kind of do their own thing right so we're not necessarily uh directing uh them to any one you know layer two what i would say is i'm pretty excited about bridges that it kind of make layer twos interoperable actually one of our portfolio companies started as a ethereum which was a smart contract wallet and they've kind of pivoted to creating a hop exchange which is kind of a bridge uh that connects that makes it you know easy to go from one layer two to another and i think that's something that you know that that is interesting and they could play out and hob's not the only one there's another one i think called uh so there are teams that are working on like making this seamless and i think i think the truth is there's not there's not one layer two solution that has uh enough uh kind of momentum that there's one clear one to go to right they all have different trade-offs um you know like dydx is uh in in our fund one um you know i know you've had antonio on before yeah one of the one of the most underrated products in d5 i think and they're they're building on starkwear right and sharkware has its own set of uh pros and cons that um that you know antonio really liked so i think it's it's still kind of wide open and i'm all for kind of different experimentation and i think that in the long run it's possible that they are connected but it may be clunky it may uh you know make sense to be on another chain as well like i'm not i'm not someone that thinks everything needs to be on on ethereum although i do think ethereum has the best as good a chance of any as being the long-term winner okay yeah that was my other question for you is just it sort of seems like what you're saying is that you feel like for for a smart contract platform that ethereum kind of has the lead and that it's going to be hard for anybody else to take that mantle and so that's why for anything else like you wouldn't you know if you're going to invest in something that even seems slightly competitive it has to have us a different feature like what you were saying about polka dot and its governance is that yes okay yes yeah let's let's talk a little bit more about polka dot um because i mean you you have really invested in a lot of polka dot ventures polka dot itself kusama akala edward um and so i wanted to hear a little bit more about how you don't view it as competitive because i'm sure you're well aware there are many people in ethereum who do view it as competitive i don't know is it competitive or is it kind of cooperative right i view like bitcoin you know you could i guess it depends how you look at it right but like i think how we should look at it is that projects that are pushing the space forward are only good for you know the existing uh you know incumbents right which i would say bitcoin and ethereum are so you know like ethereum while it it's cut into the market share of bitcoin i would argue it's been very positive for bitcoin and bitcoin wouldn't have the market cap that it has now if ethereum wasn't around because ethereum all the innovation stuff define nfts that we've talked about um that's bringing new people to the space it's really it's ethereum so i think we we should be open-minded about the fact in the ethereum community that like there there could be something else that comes along could it cut into if you're looking at the total pie of uh you know smart contract platforms could it cut into the pie yes but i think it would grow the pie immensely and and potentially um you know thinking about it as kind of a cooperative rather than competitive i think is a more healthy way you know to look at this but um but yeah i would say what what i like about um polka dot and and particularly like the the radical approach launch in governance is this idea of uh of like a 12-member council right that is making decisions and you know there are great things about governance minimization it makes it tough to change um if you have a have like a product that just exists it's a good approach and so it's good for something like a store of value like bitcoin maybe it's good for like a a dex that just works like uniswap um but if you're any type of product that like needs to rapidly evolve that i think the uh you know the 100 billion dollar question is how do you create some type of decentralized governance that can actually evolve no one's really done that right ethereum effectively has the same uh governance as bitcoin it's been really slow to evolve it's been able to evolve better than bitcoin because vitalik's the benevolent dictator who's still around and kind of rally you know the whole group right but um i i'm very excited about this idea of like a decentralized governance that um you know gives power to token holders but can evolve faster than uh you know the the governance minimization approach that we're kind of seeing as commonplace in crypto today and that's kind of the the promise of something like polka dot and i think the i think the polka dot governance is wildly like unappreciated and unexplored and i'm not saying it's like fully fleshed out and it's necessarily working great yet but i think this idea of like you know voting in a council the council can make decisions quick but if the majority of token holders disagree with the decisions they can vote against those decisions so that the council doesn't have unilateral power i think that is a really powerful idea that's going to exist in some kind of way shape or form in the future and that's why i like that polka dots really bring something new to the table that that no one else in crypto is really doing yeah i'm also hugely fascinated by these governance issues and that's something i'm really keeping my eye on but let's switch tax for a moment i wanted to ask about coinbase because obviously as we discussed you were an early employee there and i'm sure you're aware oftentimes in crypto there's this comparison made between investments made at the protocol level and investments made in applications and i was curious as somebody who probably just experienced a nice little windfall from the coinbase direct listing but who also has probably made a lot of money via tokens themselves what's your take on that fat protocols thesis can the earnings from applications still compete with earnings from protocols i think the upside is just greater uh if you're if you're a cryptocurrency based project i think kind of what we've seen over the past uh you know three months with even coinbase's valuation right the fact that uh you know cardano again not to bring it up again but is uh is valued more like i think you know that's like a 50 higher evaluation than coinbase right now shows that for whatever reason this like new paradigm of crypto people think about value differently well i not for whatever reason i think a big reason is that anyone can participate you so you have a just a bigger pie of potential investors right and that's a big piece of it and yeah i mean the coinbase uh ipo was was great um in the sense that for the people that pay attention to wall street and read the new york times and care about that world it was more validation for crypto um but i i think it wasn't that big of a deal uh to crypto people and i'm a crypto person right so um like a token as a way to capture value is is kind of definitely the model that i believe in more so i mean i i haven't sold any of my coinbase stock um you know i'm kind of believer in coinbase has this utility for the ecosystem but in terms of where i see upside um it's very much in the cryptocurrencies rather than you know the the the companies that are trading on wall street okay so maybe the fat protocols thesis is still in place um so as we discussed earlier you've invested a lot in these various d5 protocols what sort of threat do you think dexa's and other decentralized applications or dfi in general could pose to coinbase eventually um i think it's definitely um a threat i i don't think it's a huge threat i mean it's a threat to coinbase's crypto to crypto business but the moat that coinbase has is the regulatory mode right and the bridge to fiat currencies and so defy is not going to be able to play there uh i don't think i mean there's been uh initiatives um i remember there was like an omisego one many years ago but um i think there's still more money that's outside of crypto than in crypto and being a on-ramp to crypto is uh is a good business so um i don't know i like people on crypto it's again it's just like tribal nature that like uniswap uh you know winning and coinbase losing or something like that um but i think um that's because people are are tribal and and competitive but like it's more cooperative and collaborative and um and i think dex is growing i actually see is good for coinbase because um you know more people are getting utility out of cryptocurrency that's going to bring more people in that's good for the core coinbase business model so i don't know um i've never viewed coinbase as like a super innovative company that's like doing new products to push the space forward in a big way it's just like this utility for the ecosystem that i think works really well it's really valuable and it's you know good at executing and i think there's certainly room for that to exist and you know dexes to to exist and thrive all right so um let's kind of pull this all together just for the rest of the year obviously this bull cycle has been super interesting because uh at least to my eyes it has been driven by a few different things obviously there's this um trend with bitcoin being taken up by institutions in a big way um as we've discussed to nfts taking off amongst normies and then d5 kind of had its moment but you know the gas fees kind of limit you know who can participate in that and you know for whatever other trend you want to pull together where do you see the rest of this year going which i think most people would say they're expecting you know this bull cycle to last kind of through that period yeah i'm not sure about the cycle and uh you know i i always say like i'm not a trader i'm not good at timing markets but i could tell you the types of new products that i'm most excited about that i think we could see an explosion in or what i call defy and nfts for the masses right i think as you alluded to we talked about the fees on ethereum right now uh for vast majority of uh ethereum applications price out the masses right it's like it's still mostly rich people and crypto rich and um and i think that uh needs to change i think and and i think that's going to change once we see applications on new chains and we see layer twos really thriving and so i'm really excited about uh you know people being able to make a unisop trade for a hundred dollars right and and buy a hundred dollars worth of ethereum really easily um you know people buying it a hundred dollar and or a fifty dollar nft on openc within a game things like that i think is likely to be the next leg up for crypto whether that happens in the next six months or you know it takes a couple years uh i'm not sure but for for us that's what we're kind of going to be uh investing in over the next several years and i think it's it's a good uh long-term bet and then earlier when you were talking about polka dot and the governance i was curious also for your take on certain things that a lot of people are interested in but haven't really taken off yet but you think you know will in the future and i wondered if daoz was one of them and if there's anything else that you see on the horizon that you want to mention i'd like to hear what you're seeing there and where you think it'll go yeah i think dow's um dales are already happening right and i think there's a lot of people that have like uh kind of anointed taos as the next thing after uh d5 and nfts right i don't know i mean i'm not super bullish on that um as dow's being like a thing that really brings in new people um i think dao's like uh you know on train treasuries you know are happening and voting on how to allocate funds on an untrained treasury that's happening for many ethereum projects in polkadot projects now i think an open question is like will there be a product or a tool that makes it easy for anyone to spin up their own dow you know for anything and that's something that i've been excited about but it there's there's challenges with it so yeah i don't know i i'm bullish on death right anyone who's in cryptocurrency is like bitcoin was the first dow any truly decentralized cryptocurrency is is in effect at dao um i'd love to see an explosion of daos i haven't seen any product that uh you know is enabling that i guess another category that i'm very excited about that i think we will see in the next five years i don't know it's going to be one year or five years is the centralized media right and nfts itself is kind of a version of centralized media you know we all see the the issues with uh the the centralized uh social media companies for example can someone kind of crack the code if you will and create a product that people really want to use because of the product not just because of the uh you know investment opportunity right and you know we've seen things like steam in the past and you know big clout now which is trying to like bootstrap this thing by uh getting people excited from speculation and um i'm not super bullish on that i'm more bullish on like something crypto native that the crypto community really uh you know gets behind from a product perspective and that's something new and different that that ultimately uh you know the whole world uses i think that will happen like in the next five years i don't think we've seen i don't think it's been built yet all right okay well this has been
