futures trading Kraken is the place for you today's guests are Carolyn Chan chief strategy officer at Cohen market cap and Gerald Chi head of research there welcome Carolyn and Gerald hey Laura thanks for having us hey Laura nice BQ so there's probably no need for a huge introduction but why don't we start with the most basic question which is what is coin market cap yes so a coin record cap is basically the place you go to when you want to find information about cryptocurrencies and crypto exchanges so last year we had about 125 million users and 3.6 billion page views ending the year was that with those numbers so I think like it's been a really interesting right from when climber calf started in 2013 up until today in the last six years and how did you each come to work at coin market cap and what do each of you do there sure I will start in Jarek and go so I before coin market cab I founded and sold accompanying the artificial intelligence base so I really like emerging technologies someone told me to read more about blockchain tech at that point so I heard about Bitcoin before in 2013 and game 2015 so I was very interested that's how I got into it and I somehow managed to meet the founder of coin market cap so I believed in a vision that he wanted to bring forth and that was to showcase the crypto revolution to the world and so I decided to join the team so right now and quite market have I started doing marketing and now I'm the chief strategy officer then basically helping to shape that vision to something that we can execute and also to bring quite market cap to more people around the world and at caralyn before we moved to Gerald I just need to know he said somehow you just happen to meet prices the founder of coin marking up which doesn't happen to pretty much anybody so how did that how did that happen it is interesting to me because it happened to seven degrees of connection so it was like someone put on an email chain and someone wanted to look for someone who could help someone and so forth and then it somehow ended up in my inbox so I when I went to New York for an offense I just decided to ask Brandon if you would like to meet and he agreed so it was interesting for me at that point to meet him oh and just wait and was it that you were looking for a job or that he was looking to hire no I think he was actually looking to expand to Asia and I happened to be in Beijing at that time so I wanted to have a conversation with him about that like how I could help him there or whether there was anything that we could collaborate on so that was why we met in York okay all right well we're gonna talk about we're gonna talk more about this mysterious Brendon shows in a little bit but Gerald why don't you tell us what it is that you do at coin market cap and how you came to work there sure sure right so before coin lucky cap I started my career as a trader I was trading borne futures derivatives creating market neutral strategies at a prop trading firm so what I did was arbitrage between bonds in the u.s. versus bonds in Australia bonds in Germany stuff like that right so that was how I started off as a trader I entered this the liquid currency space about one a half years ago sometime in late 2018 when I was looking at Bitcoin futures as a trading product right so that's how I saw it founded capital with four or three other people we started trading Bitcoin futures as our main as I mean we are generally generating income and one of our LPS was Brennen chess himself so we were doing a pretty good job and he was having some problems with his site in terms of pricing algorithms as well as the the volumes that we are seeing are inflated volumes so he kind of asked us hey you guys are doing a pretty good job in his trading trading space could you also help me in this in this in this way because we also had with our with all with all all infrastructure in place we had algorithms and pricing methodologies that took all this into account to get better pricing for our trading strategies so here quite us hashtag capital the four of us went on bought the Kalima key kept team five months ago sometime in late sometime in late july 2019 and we have been there since so what I do at Comerica is basically try to fix the problems that surface on the site in terms of pricing and it turns off inflated volumes yeah okay yeah we're gonna talk a lot about those issues later on but first let's talk a little bit more about the history of coin market cap which Caroline alluded to a little bit you mentioned that the site got started in 2013 how did it get started and what was the initial mission yes so I think it really started as a site project for Brandon so he wanted a way to value all kinds of cryptocurrencies so he saw they were quite a few of them coming up and he wanted to compare them versus Bitcoin compare them versus each other and so he built the projects on the site and so I think he really grew out of that in the last couple of years from 2013 when he what really wanted to just solve his own problem till today where I think that mission has grown bigger where we really want to help to bring more discoverability and more efficiency to the consumer markets and what had Brandon been doing before he was a developer but not in the trading space right not not a fine he didn't have a financial background yeah yeah okay yeah well can you also explain how Brandon decided to focus on market cap and and how he defined that as circulating supply yeah so I think that when we started Brandon really wanted a quick way for people to understand what they were comparing and so he borrowed the market cap term from traditional finance and he also borrowed volumes he also borrowed public float but in the context of crypto he actually popularized the term circulating supply so I think with those in mind I think the rationale was that people understand already what market cap volume and public float were they would be able to quickly get a sense of what he was trying to present on the site and I think that made it really intuitive for people to understand the numbers that they were looking at and even from the start I feel like the phrase circulating supply was a little bit difficult in the sense that it wasn't always a clean definition for each of the coins can you talk about why it was difficult to use that term for the calculations yeah I think when we look at supply right now today they are they have been changes over time right so for example with supply how we define you right now is anything that is freely tradable by users basically if you are able to buy it off the open market you would be able to count that into supply whereas if it was being locked up or it was primarily allocated things that were not possible for anyone to get their hands on it would be not circulating therefore they would not be part of the circulating hi so I think over the years some things have changed for example how do you account for state tokens for example those tend to be challenges that the team faces so I think something that we're also working on other than the current definition which is our team looking at the blog explorers ensuring that we check with the team multiple times what they are being used for what where the tokens are which ones they're held Rich List and so forth going forward we will also be doing more research to verify that more quantitatively so Jarrell I think if you want to also add on yeah sure so from our studies of liquidity and whatnot in terms of the new liquidy metric we also see correlations between how it could apply to certainly supply because you know in our minds everything that circulate that should be on the open market and using our new liquidy metric we can actually see what's available in the open market and use it to kind of like discern whether the the numbers reported by the talk of projects I could or not so that's something that we are looking into in terms of data data metrics and that's something that we'll be excited to kind of launch in an in a near future if there is something there yeah yeah I'm actually I had a question for this that we'll probably get to a bit later because it gets a little bit in the weeds but why don't we just talk about at least one example now because when I started thinking about this metric the focus of using this metric for this website you know it felt like it definitely made sense for Bitcoin where the circulating supply really was just determined by the monetary policy of Bitcoin where you have this kind of like rapid inflation at the beginning but then it tapers off you know pretty quickly and it's all just determined by the software but then it sort of felt like you know once we hit the ico era it definitely became apparent how that the focus of you know circulating supplied didn't make as much sense and here's just one example which is that is so for instance right after the gnosis crowd sale I wrote about the token and they did what was called like a Dutch reverse auction where they were intending to sell they just wanted to sell or sorry they just wanted to raise 12.5 million dollars but then due to FOMO they ended up selling only 4% of their tokens at $29 apiece and so that gate you know that little chunk was the 12.5 million but then when it hit exchanges the price jumped from $29 to more than 300 so then suddenly the market cap for this like brand-new project was a hundred and forty million dollars but then the thing is that was just based on the 4.2 percent that they'd sold right so if you looked at the total amount then suddenly like nosis would have been worth four billion dollars when it like had barely even done anything and so it just felt like at that point like anybody coming to coin market cab would have made a bad decision based on you know this concept of what what the market cap was there which was based on this circulating supply so in general like you know do you feel like it was during that time that you know during the ico craze when this became apparent that there were downsides to using this metric and at that time did you guys consider changing the emphasis on circulating supply yes so I think at that point in time we did notice that there were things that could be improved and I think it's true for many of the things on the site and I'm sure we'll talk more about the other things that we will continue to improve but specifically for supply I think that there were many instances like the one that you mentioned for enosis and the supply methodology has actually evolved over time but has kept the same understanding which is basically the best approximation for the number of assets are circulating a market in the general public's hands so instead of using metrics like total supply or things like that I think what we're trying to do is basically to show that best approximation and I think with what Jo was saying using more of that data-driven metric maybe using a combination of liquidity and other metrics we would be able to better solve for this problem in the future in a way that's fairer and also more parent to the end-user alright yeah I mean yeah I feel like maybe that's more of a trading emphasis or something rather than this issue about what the coin is worth overall but so we'll talk a little bit more about that later on but one other thing I wanted to ask about during this like kind of historical just to cover the history of coin market cap I feel like one of the moments when coin market cap became most infamous was in January 2018 when Brandon just without warning decided to remove the activity of Korean exchanges from the prices on the site and that basically slashed or app it ostensibly slashed a hundred billion dollars off the total market cap for cryptocurrencies at that time that was that just like a unilateral decision by him or you know did he do that in consultation with anybody and like what was behind the decision and how did you know that decision-making process happen yes so I think in January last year we noticed that some of the South Korean exchanges were skewing the site's average figures so there was something that what people call kimchi premium so we actually excluded the exchanges in our price calculations due to the divergence in prices for the rest of the world but when you say skewing like why did you use that verb rather than because like like what why why is it skewing rather than just part of what the price should be yes so how it is that so the main reason why it was doing was because it was not reflective of free market prices in the sense that unless you have access to a South Korean kyc verified account you would not be able to arbitrage on the difference so it was not actually something that you could act on even if you knew that this was part of the global average so that was the reason why those numbers were excluded from the numbers that we were sharing on the site and I think in hindsight we definitely should have communicated better we should definitely have given notice and I think we actually learn from that lesson to give a lot of advance notice after that four changes that were made to the methodology or any changes to exclusions in the data and so at this point since there is not much of a chemistry premium if any I presume that karena exchanges are they factored back into the coin market cap data or not they are and they have always still been listed on the site oh but I mean are they factored into the total market cap or not insist on market cap I think that is not a factor of the of the price of recurring exchanges because we factored sickening supply into the price as a factor of Bitcoin there itself so whether we include the correct reduce or not it's not a factor but I do know that we do have those prices in now in our rates as well right now okay so if the kimchi premium emerges again then what will you do so I think we are trying to devise a way how to best aggregate prices across different jurisdictions so for example we have the u.s. exchanges we have the European exchanges we have the current exchanges and maybe even Chinese exchanges right so in terms of how we agree prices what we plan to do in the future is to devise a way how we can use every jurisdiction for itself let me let me give you an example so for the u.s. exchanges we are not looking at for the regular exchanges we have crackin coinbase gemini and so on right so in terms of value of Bitcoin in USD terms these exchanges will probably be the most relevant to kind of discern the value of Bitcoin in terms of USD however if you now look at the current exchanges you're now looking at mid term you're not looking an update and these are the exchanges that would be relevant for any current user that want to use they want to find the price of courier of Bitcoin in Korean Won the same could be applied for the the Japanese exchanges if there is we find that there are capital controls and maybe even a Chinese exchanges if the OTC des appears to have better info for debt pricing piece of video the roaming be so given that solve data that we have because we are actually listing all the exchanges around the wall we think that we can have a best price index for single jurisdiction and hopefully that could materialize in the near future okay so let me make sure that I understood this so essentially you're go if something like the kimchi premium happens again then you won't erase the data but it will be primarily in Korean Won or something and so in that way it's compartmentalized from the other currencies is that what you were saying correct so all aim is to be able to discern where all where capital controls exist where different currencies are differently reflected in terms of pricing and kind of like give the users in the country the best salt price index for day for the use case because if a Korean citizen a Korean citizen wants to trade in Korean Won and doesn't want to know that the price of Bitcoin in coinbase for example then we would try our best to cater to debt use case and try to personalize that use in the future okay and then just to compare it to what you were doing before where when he removed the Korean trading from the website and it slashed a huge amount off the total market cap for cryptocurrencies that's because that was being averaged into the total value of Bitcoin and US dollars is that what the difference was yes that's correct so essentially what happened was because people in Korea wants you to buy Bitcoin more than the people in the u in the States and globally so what happened was there was cream cheap remember and that caused prices to go a lot higher in in the Korean exchanges and that difference was you could not take action on that because in order to arbitrage the difference between both exchanges you will need a Korean bank account and a US bank account right so to execute the arbitrage so we felt that because the Acne arbitrage was could not be executed by most users we decide to remove that kimchi cream altogether from our price aggregation compilation okay okay this is super super super super interesting how all of this can affect you know this very influential data website alright so just a little bit more in the history one thing I was curious about was you guys had this conference recently and Brandon did do an interview on stage but he did it where he was mad and in shadow and his voice was anonymized by a microphone but why go through all the effort when like his name is out there it's not like you know it's not like Brandon as a student admits his real name yes this is his real name I say so it's like he's like trying to be anonymous but he's not anonymous yeah I think he's not necessarily trying to be anonymous more than he's trying to be private so we respect that philosophically if people want to retain their privacy that we would let them do that and Brandon has always been pretty adamant that he would not like to be exposed personally so especially with the conference recently that happened in November 20 19 this is the first time that we had our conference so he appeared on stage to host a fireside chat with Sonny King who is actually anonymous and who is the inventor of food of steak so both of them were in masks and they have their voice modulated but you know in this at the same time they managed to get their points across I think that they still managed to remain influential and we managed to still share their ideas on stage and I think that's how they prefer it so like we believed that if he would like to be private just as Sonny would like to be private or any other anonymous creator would like to be private it's probably best for them to to do that because then they can do their best work without having to worry about the fact that they might be discovered or people might stalk them or anything like that all right so now we're talking a little bit more about kind of how coin market cap has changed over time you know I feel like for a long time it was just Brandon alone and now you have what is it like somewhere in the ballpark of 50 employees we have about 30 employees now both locally okay yes okay and so for a long time coin market cap also kind of was pretty limited in its scope to you know price or marque cap data exchange volume and now you know just if I look back at all that announcements of all the new things you guys are doing you know you're branching out until like metrics you're organizing an industry alliance you're doing blockchain explorers you had this new conference so how what was the mission originally how and how has it changed over time and you know to what it is now yeah I think was started Brandon really wanted to solve the problem of how do you compare crypto against each other and I think as the site became more popular over time what happened was quite market cap became bigger than that right now it's in a position to feed with its influence of his voice so that's actually led to us to realize that we need to do more and that's why we have the industry Alliance that's why we're doing more in terms of putting out accurate data making sure that everything can be displayed in a way that crypto markets are more discoverable more efficient so example of that for example is recently we launched a product called interest bicoid market cap which is a way for you to figure out where to earn or borrow crypto and as a result of that we've I shoulda seen providers that are listed on this page the same page starting to look at how they can make their yields better so that they can continue to be more efficient and more competitive against the others now that they are all being put on the same page so things like that as we aggregate more information as we add more content to site I think the mission for us to make things more discoverable more efficient globally will become way more important because we will keep growing our distribution channels will keep growing our amount of content that we have and hopefully you know what she drives their industry forward and historically how has the site made money and how has that changed over time yeah this site has always made money from advertising so that we have the banner that you see at the top of the page in banners around the site and right now we are also experimenting with native advertising as well so for example you have the blue buttons that you see on the crypts of Parsi detail pages we also have a mobile app now so that's also another Avenue and our second revenue stream is actually the data so we have a crypto API that we provide as a software subscription service so we see exchanges we see wallets we see products that are using the data from us as product of their own products or offerings and dry now we also had the conference which is our third revenue stream and do you have any demographics on your users or site visitors whether it's you know geography or age yeah so I think that data is actually quite interesting for us when I look at the data most of our users are in like the 25 to 34 age range and about 60 to 70 percent of them are male so that's kind of the demographics of the site instead of geographical numbers the top for us last year was the u.s. followed by some European countries for example Germany Netherlands UK and then fifth place was Vietnam and I think the other interesting numbers were was turkey was tense and we see a country like Venezuela was 33 things like that and we actually had about 100 North Korean users last year on the side - oh really yeah hmm I wonder if all 100 of them are Kim Jong Il interesting interesting although I guess you're counting unique users so um now I'm less I'm stuck on that confessing the Vietnam thing was super interesting too I don't feel like I've heard that much about trading there but I did know you know obviously Turkey and Venezuela and then what it what are like the behaviors that visitors exhibit on the site like you know can you buy their behavior segment them out into like the people who are just kind of like compulsively checking the price versus people who are doing like you know more sophisticated research versus you know that kind of thing yes so for the most part most people do compulsively check the site so I think the average is something like like two to five times a day depending on who the user is sometimes even more so I think though the curve is around the two to five times to jmark so that we can tell is still the most popular way of interacting with the site so about thirty percent of all the page views or from the main page but seventy percent are the longtail pages basically people clicking in so from about two years before to now we actually see the number of pages that people look at increase over time so I think it used to be something like 1.7 pages now we're up to you about 3.2 2.7 or so so depending on which period so I think like that it's actually been quite encouraging because we can see that people actually drilling down to see more and also people are interacting with the tabs on the detail pages more looking at analysis that we have added looking at just News social and so forth on the site that we've added within the tabs so I think it's actually a good thing and it has informed a bit of our thinking around adding more content within those tabs and allowing users to have a deeper experience because then you know for the other people who are really trying to go deeper and understand more about the space we should be the one place that they should be able to get that information without having to leave a page for that huh yeah I'm definitely in the longtail group because you know I'm writing this book right now and I'm doing a lot of research so one of your I'm in one of your categories and I heard you mentioned in another interview that coin market caps web traffic is 90% correlated to the Bitcoin price I usually I'm not sure how old that interview is so is that still true and if so like has that changed over time like is that more common in like a bull market versus a bear market or is that consistent between the two like do you think that's a problem I think so I remember running these numbers so we run it once a year at the end of the year so early on 2013-2014 15 15 they were all consistently 99% so when I ran the numbers at the end of 2018 last year it was 90% which means it's gone down a little bit so I'm sure we will do another one and upstair so I find said it would actually be well generally it's something yeah sure I can't answer that like because based on my recent studies as well on my site there's a statistical analysis it's actually quite interesting right because from from what I'm seeing I think our traffic is correlated to the Valle TT or Bitcoin not so much the the absolute returns of Bitcoin and that's interesting because we realize that when there's a big bear market oh and it's a big bull move in the minute on the same day we will see a lot of traffic coming in to check the price of Bitcoin because that's what people are interested in the movement of price in terms of how the absolute mover price where is up and down when price moves we get traffic and that's something that we have observed interesting all right so I know everybody's wondering about this fake volume issue so we are gonna talk about that after a quick word from the sponsors who make this show

receive authoritative crypto AML reports quarterly WWC fruit-trees comm / keep crypto clean back to my conversation with Carolyn Chan and Gerald Shi of : market cap so actually before we get to the vague folium I do want to ask one other question which is you know just to understand how coin market cap works what is the typical process for a coin or token to get listed both in terms of like what the submitter has to do and then what coin market cap has to do to get it listed sure I think there are actually two different tracks one is if you're a project one is if you are in exchange so for the project's what you have to do is basically submit through a form that we on the site which is Comerica Capcom / requests the same thing for exchanges but you go to different tracks so for most of the projects and exchanges that lives in our site we actually encourage everyone to look at the methodology page because it tells you specifically what the listings team was looking for so what happens is after you need something in this forum it asks like s or something good for this forum it asks you things like what this project is about ask you for uniqueness attraction your community things like that so these are all things that the team is looking for on top of the requirements which is you must have a functional site it is a crypto it is traded publicly and it has a representative from the exchange set from the project that we can actually speak to if we need to clarify so that's the requirements for your project so I find it's pretty straightforward some people who have said it takes a long time it turns out usually that they have not provided all the information that the team is looking for and so I would say for all listing requests you should try to put as much information as possible in that forum so that there's less back-and-forth because every time you reply it goes back to the end of the queue so that's for projects and therefore exchanges there are some other requirements that are needed for example they must submit a summary and point for the for their API they must be in operation for at least 60 days they must have order book data that they can submit to us now and also like a system Status page that shows all the coin listings or details and so anyone that is actually submitting on the behalf of the exchange if they have the exchange email will be prioritized so I think we have all of these the idea is that we are trying our best to list everything that comes on the site as long as they pass these requirements and so we want to make sure that we can get everybody on on the page so recently we actually had an update to the methodology to include something called on treks listings so even if you don't have markets that we are currently tracking whether you're a project or exchange we can still make sure that we put you up as a listing on this site so that you have a page that you represent on claim rank account and later on we'll add your markets as well and he wrote this blog post where you mentioned the most common customer complaints and it was kind of funny frankly um first was remove exchange X because it is faking volumes we will talk about this I know everybody wants us to talk about this sorry there's just a lot of exposition first second Project X is a scam please D list it otherwise you are aiding and abetting these crooks 3 please remove our pairs on exchange X because we do not want our project to be associated with wash trading and then complaint for exchange X has stolen my funds please issue an alert so when you receive these complaints do you like try to verify them like especially for you know Project X is a scam I did notice that for instance Center Tech which the SEC called fraudulent is not even listed anymore in the site and then I just wondered like you know would there have been any point in preserving the history of the trades like it because it looks to me like you just took it down yeah so we definitely try not censor any information I think that's quite key to the philosophy so you so for all of the requests that come in the team actually goes through them one by one and tries to verify every single one that that happens so for example you talked about the scam so I think scam is one that is really difficult because we're not trying to please any of the projects or exchanges but we know that we should definitely look into it or issue alerts where necessary so things like that the team actually goes through has gone to talk to local police they have talked to local authorities to help to verify some of these information that has been submitted for those that have been called scam but for the team as well they have all seen many projects which are not scams that people have caught scams and at the start people even caught Bitcoin a scam so the team is pretty cautious about not making those assumptions so where there are regulatory alerts or warnings that have been issued what they do is to put up an alert saying it's been put on this watchlist and please be careful with your funds and same thing for many of the others like we have received complaints that is really hard to have draw funds from this exchange so be careful putting your money your funds into this exchange things like that so I think instead also for the center of tech one did you just decide to remove it because it was called fraudulent by the SEC Center Tech I I don't know specifically for that but there are usually two ways one is they no longer had any volume so the team had to do ask them based on our devasting policy or the other would be I think that's probably the most that's probably what happened and then because we usually don't even we don't take projects down because people do want to see them for posterity they want to see the history of the project so our delisting criteria does have that and also unless it was verified as a scam in which case we would take them down as well so that nobody would be exposed to that yeah okay all right so let's talk about this bitwise report this report came out in April and it said that 95% of Bitcoin trading was fake and most of the real trading was just on ten exchanges and they even launched this website Bitcoin trade volume com that shows trading volume only on those ten exchanges so before the report came out was coin market the coin market have aware that's such a huge percentage of trading could potentially be faked I think we started to notice the volume inflation problem last year so we definitely were already looking at solutions to this even before the report came out and what we really wanted to avoid doing in the solution or in our brainstorming off the solution was to not do something similar to that which is to label something as a good or bad exchange because I think that's binary like they like bitwise for example has also noted that those that have inflated volumes might also have real liquidity on them so that's one thing that we avoided and the second thing we wanted to avoid was to use an unscientific kind of correlation for example web traffic and volumes because you could treat by an API key or to also avoid things like simplistic ways of looking at volumes like fixing order book depth percentage instead of going kind of down to the root cause of the problem so we noticed that and we were actively trying to solve it by looking at the root cause of the problem but the main point is we wanted a solution that could be really objective and would be applicable to thousands of assets because I don't I don't think we're in a position to say we can only focus on ten exchanges or ten of the most so-called important projects in the space so for us everything that we think about has to be applicable to the thousands of office projects that we have to decide and the hundreds of exchanges that we have on this site so that's why I took on quite a long time because we had to back cast a lot of data to get to a solution that we currently have yeah okay again something that right so I think when bitwise launched the report as well as their matrix they kind of had the focus of trying to convince the SEC that volumes in Bitcoin markets was only limited to the top ten and the way they did that was to use data points from the market from the from the exchanges from the other books to distill the difference between a legitimate exchange and the illegitimate exchange and to do that they focus very heavily on the Bitcoin market pair Bitcoin USD market pair and they used that as the baseline to decide whether exchange was washed or not so the problems with that methodology was that they had to kind of distill the methodology and show the report in terms of the orders being placed on the market the trade sizing the the times where orders got X they did a pretty good job in trying to steal all these different market data points but the moment they released a report all the people the people responsible for the was trading could see what they were doing and essentially counted game they're metric and that kind of make the report irrelevant for the next run they try to do it so there's something that we also read in depth and we consider that sort of methodology but we felt that if you could do something so so in-depth and yet when you release the report people could read it and say hey this is what they're doing let us try to counter commit by doing something totally different and that creates a problem that the the dewatering would still be there because the way they excluded exchanges and and a market pass was very systematic and people could read that that methodology and cannot game it so that's something that we also bear in mind when we design our liquid matrix to try to not let something as easy as that became yeah right and it also sounds like maybe because their report really was focused on trying to persuade the SEC about a Bitcoin ETF that in a way it's sort of their purpose was just like different from yours because theirs was more targeted to this one regulator and you're serving this kind of global audience so one you know thing that came out of it of course it and and like I actually you know just not knowing that you had been working on it before the report it looked to me like your new liquidity metric was maybe in response to their report but I mean it just sounds like it was in response to the fact that you know that this was a problem this fake volume was a problem so for you when you were working on this fake volume problem like how did you define the problem did you see it the same way that bit wise did where we you know the wash trading and all that or and if so or can you just describe how you you know saw that problem and then now also talk about your new liquidity metric and how it addresses that issue sure let me try run through the top process behind the whole liquidity and volumes matrix so I think the first starting point of any discussion on in this whole problem is the reason why we use volumes for for for ranking market pairs and exchanges for a because volumes has been the de facto matrix that has been using changed on financial markets and it's for good reason right because interracial fashion markets there is heavy red clear oversight and it's very difficult for any trader or any anybody for the matter to wall straight because that is illegal and they will be arrested for it and fine for that so that is not the same for the cryptocurrency space because we have a dichotomy of either you have your regulator in the US for example or you're not in say choose and alter and the amount of regulatory oversight for these two exchanges are completely different and a you have very strict anti-war shredding measures be you don't right so but the fact that matter is all these exchanges in the cryptocurrency space matter because they are what makes the Bitcoin markets it's decentralized and it's something that we have to live with so if that's something that we have to accept that volumes could potentially be faked because there is a lack of regular site from exchanges that are located elsewhere of the US we then need to think about hey is volumes the right metric to use right so for for kind of like to go down to the basics what is the use of volumes if sub volumes mainly used to determine whether there's trading interest so you see the top ten eight active stocks on it on the stock markets you see the top ten active bonds in the space so that that is one use case for volumes the second use case for volumes will be essentially to determine liqui tea because for most parts most traders one of trade on markets that are liquid and the best way without looking at the actual or the book would be to look at volumes if everything was all regulated so that's what I did last time when I was trading if I don't find a market that was active and goodly pretty or look at the volumes reported however the same cannot be said once you have this regulatory this directly tree environment and that's why we taught about this whole problem at large right so the reason why we use volumes on our site is to distill the liquidity that exists on exchanges and market pairs so if we wanted to really define what liquidy man we then needed to design a matrix that magic liquidity and not volumes so that is what we cannot sort and the problems behind showing the creepy acid matrix is that a it's always changing because all the orders its we're trying to track transactional data that is not done yet so on one hand you have volume status that tracks transactional data between two traders on the other hand you have the order book that with these orders that are not yet executed in the markets so that others can always be cancelled can always replace but the truth of the matter is in every single market what really matters is not liquid it's not volumes per se but it's all liquid markets are so the more liquid a market is the more traders you could assume to be trading on there and the less slippage you get for trading there so that creates the kind of environment that we want to encourage right liquidity is something that we want to encourage people to to to kind of promote to cannot promote their exchanges and that's how we decided that liquidy asymmetry is best used to serve the interests of both traders and retail users and everyone in the space at large all right yeah one other thing that you guys also announced kind of roughly in the same period was the data accountability and transparency Alliance which has a convenient M which is data what does that group do and you know what kinds of problems are you trying to solve with that yeah so in May of this year we launched the data Alliance so what we really wanted to do with data is to talk about these issues that we were facing so part of it obviously was the volume problem so what we did with the partners that came on was we asked them for their thoughts on the problem and when we did our first round table with the data Alliance we actually presented the first version of a liquidity metric there so we talked about the components that would go in there and we actually got some really good feedback that made it into the final version of the liquidity metric that we see today so I think that you know like one thing would be to provide feedback on things that would impact all of us but also at the same time with the data Alliance it goes beyond that because we realized that people like the fact that people were trying to inflate or change the numbers on their end means that we just need more transparency or more accountability as a whole in terms of the industry for our data so taking responsibility for that I think we wanted to just rally people around this cause that we cared about which is transparency and I hope that with more and more people joining us we would be able to get a mass of people who cared about this problem and could solve this problem with us so one thing would be to do these roundtables but also we're working on a number of other initiatives for example something that we could do to unify tickers so you know like the famous example that everyone cites is there are three or four different projects as scripts or assets that actually have the same ticker h.o.t so with that in mind we're trying to see whether there's a way for us to unify things like that so that people can not take advantage of the fact that some assets have the same tickers and try to pass them off as something else for example so that's another transparency issue that we've noticed so in the future we're also looking at whether the Alliance can do things like fund projects that are focused on transparency or front other initiatives that are aligned with our philosophy around transparency and accountability and data well I couldn't help but notice that some of the exchanges who partnered with you on this data Alliance are some of the same exchanges that the bitwise report showed where some of the most egregious when it came to fit when it came to fake volumes and then on the other hand some of the exchanges that they cited as having real volume such as coinbase or kraken which i should disclose as a sponsor of the show and bitstamp are actually not a part of of the data liens so how did you go about choosing those members yep so I think for us when we wanted to start with the digital Alliance the idea was to work with any exchange that really has shown us that they want to fix this problem so part of it was you have to work with people who might be accused or are doing it because you kind of wanted to know what they're thinking and how that affects them so we actually took that into account that they submitted a very thoughtful response and they gave us several solutions for how they would actually change it up as part of the the process of working together on the Alliance so we were not filtering out specifically for what they were doing but rather the intent behind it and I think it has worked out because we see some of the that actually just on there have provided really good feedback to us and it has affected it into the way that we were thinking about the way that we thought about the velum problem at that point in time yeah and I'll just name some of the ones that you know the bitwise report named as being the most egregious which were hit BTC okay axon Toby and and you know those are the ones that are part of your alliance but one thing that then I noticed was for your new liquidity metric you know I guess you're rolling it out in phases but at least you can see it now for exchanges and hit BTC is ranked first in liquidity which like I said just a few months ago it apparently had some of the highest fake volumes Hobie was third and okay X was fourth so then this made me question you know are they gaming the new liquidity metric like do you think they actually have that much liquidity and somehow bitwise was wrong or is it I mean it could be that you know since the report came out they've no significantly cleaned up the trading and and also attracted real volume but you know Jay I just have to admit like given the backstory it looked suspicious especially since hit BTC at least at this moment is number one but with like just a bit more liquidity than finance like like I don't know it just looks very like oh like how convenient where we're ahead of Finance which people should know it you know is one of the ones with real volume that one said had real volume so anywhere okay yeah I think a few points the question I think the first point is hit BC wise BBC number one I did look at the other books and for the most part they did have legitimately Crete II however I can't say the same for volumes because that is always the question on Iran's minds right so in in launching this whole liquidy matrix we wanted to shift the focus on the minds of traders and and people in the space to kind of really distill what really matters and that's what and this is what we believe is liquidity so the reason why they are above finance because mainly because they have a lot more market pairs I think if you see on our site they're listing 840 different market pairs whereas finance only has about 400 different market paths so the more market pairs you have the more liquidity you're providing to the space the higher you will be ranked on that simple metric so that's something that hopefully yeah it's for what it's worth it's they they do provide liquid to the space where it do they wash straight I'm not too sure I need a different song matrix altogether but I mean we could take bitwise this word for that and say hey they do wash it but the the flipside is is what reading reader important or is liquidity for the space more important and I would argue the latter not the former all right yeah I also want to talk about one other way in which another data provider has tried to respond to this issue crypto compare took a pretty different tack from coin market cap and granted I mean that the site's you know have been different for quite a while but this number they began releasing this exchange benchmark report where they not only place less emphasis on volume but they actually see that they don't even directly include it when they do the ranking and they focus primarily on legal / regulatory security and data provision and that means they include factors like insurance the experience of the team geography and by geography they mean like where the exchange is domiciled to take into account kind of like whether or not it's in a jurisdiction with lower regulatory standards so has coin market cap ever considered including those kinds of factors when it ranks exchanges yeah so when we thought about a metric that makes sense for us I think what we were trying to optimize for was to make sure that we can first address the problem head-on at the root and I think many of the other solutions or ideas that came out as a result of the falling inflation tried to skirt around the problem by either focusing on a specific set of exchanges or some attribute that they deemed more important like regulation or and so forth so I don't think we are ruling out that I think it depends on who the market is targeted and because for example for cup to compare like they might be using these benchmarks more because they're pursuing the institutional market where you know historically institutional markets will look for things like specific venues that you could try to add like Nasdaq or whatever so those specific ones you would try to get a sense off whereas I think for us we are trying to go for it the global retail audience and so they need to know specifically if I'm trying to treat an asset where can I trade it for the best price if the least slippage and that would help them to determine where they would get the best outcome whereas you know if we include other factors that were less data-driven based on every single but the the tens of thousands of market pairs that we have then that would probably be a separate product or a packaging of a different product that we would target differently than the current audience that we have on the site all right so I actually want to also circle back to something that we touched upon briefly more toward the beginning when Gerald talked about how he came to work at Ko a market cap you know obviously that was through the acquisition that you mentioned of your company hashtag capital and you talked about how you were focused on trying to offer a true price so I just wondered like can you describe you know what are the problems that come up when you try to create a true price I mean we talked about this a little bit when we talked about the chemistry premium but I didn't know if there were other issues but I also was curious too like how you even define true price sure I think that's a very interesting question right so for the most part in terms of hull pricing works in crypto and in space it's very unique because this is the very first time we have an asset class that is truly decentralized in terms of its trading venues for most equities in the u.s. it's located in the New York Stock Exchange and the futures is on CM e you have very centralized exchanges that kind of an enhanced rate all the degree T of their asset class on that on exchange so for the very first time we have multiple venues hundreds of venues for a Bitcoin for the matter and how do you then discern the true price of Bitcoin visa vie all these different exchanges so in terms of how people have done it so let me give you a few examples of how people have done it the derivatives exchanges for example need a very robust price index because the the perpetual starts for example will be priced using the few exchanges that it select so for the most part most people select the user suspects such as bit uh coinbase Kraken Gemini bit stem right because this action is a the most regulates at once and they could kind of say like hey these are the most directly the ones we trust the traits they're on there let us use this prices as the baseline for index the problem is you you kind of forget the entire universe of crypto currency exchanges the finances the whole piece the okay axis well they may like you already pointed out they may have questionable volumes but the truth of the matter is they have very legitimately tweety very large pools of liquid e that we need to take into account in terms of getting the true price of volume so one problem in this whole in this whole equation is the exchanges on in the u.s. price their Bitcoin in USD terms and that's USD that you can transact from bank to bank right because it's the same ecosystem however the most of the the the unregulated run out of the exchanges they priced a Bitcoin in USD T and that's a problem because USD T does not quit most for most part to USD but that that the point is USD T Bitcoin USD TPS should also matter because they are the most liked one most likely pest finance for example coop II for example they all have very liquid market pests in terms of Bitcoin USD P so the real question is how do you then factor that part in in terms of how bitcoins price we surveyed this entire ecosystem and that's why we are trying to solve because we believe that only if you include all these different exchanges and different market pairs for Bitcoin can you truly discern the true value of Bitcoin and that's why we're trying to look to it well wow that sounds super fascinating super super interesting and so like what does your technology do to get that true or price sure so in terms of how we kind of use it how we use our true price algorithm imagine every single every single market pair as equation so for example you're a Bitcoin USD on coinbase as one equation Bitcoin USD on crack and sni equation Bitcoin USD T on by Ness sni equation so you have essentially a over B over B B over C and all these equations have an answer and that is the last time price of the market so with this kind of with all the different market pairs in a space you have many many equations multiple multiple equations and the true matter is there is a mathematical formula to solve the the do you see these the solutions to all these equations to arrive at an answer that best fits the all the different assets that comprise the unknowns so that is what we it's amazing complicated but it's matter of solving many multiple simultaneous equations to arrive at the best answer for all these different assets and we believe that's the best way to find the true value of Bitcoin visa V any other asset that you want to price it with all right so before we end here I actually wanted to circle back to the circulating supply issue because I did refer to this controversy or I hinted at it in the beginning but Carolyn you wrote a little history of coin where he kept and you talked about how even from the pink inning one ripple was added it started a controversy right away and for a while to satisfy the different groups who are protesting you guys even had two versions of the site so what was that controversy about I think at that point in time people wanted to look at the different group dos and XRP at that point there were some contests over total supply circulating supply and things like that so I think that that battle still continues today but for the most part if you look at XRP on the site they have what is currently in the hands of people and what is not and we actually take that number instead of the total supply so at that point because there was so much contest encoder like XRP really a crypto like what is XR peace true supply branded make a decision to actually spin off a different site but later on you realized that obviously it was unsustainable to keep two versions of the same site one just because of one asset so he put XR feedback on her main site and it has continued it the way that it is today yeah so let's dive into the issues there because so earlier this year Ryan sulcus of Masari did a report on ripple where he stated that due to lock ups and other selling restrictions ripples circulating supply was quite a bit lower than what was shown on coin market cap and later ripple did state that his report was based on an incorrect calculation of market cap but also said that even some of the assumptions he made around lock ups were inaccurate although I will say that I know through my own reporting that at least one of them was completely accurate so you know I'm not sure which one of the points what ripple was you know contesting but anyway you know at this point in time does coin market cap for instant let's just start with the first point that Ryan made which was about Jed McCaleb allotment of X RP which he is so restricted from selling that it's basically kind of like totally locked up so does coin market cap include the amount that Jed has in the circulating supply or or not like like what do you do with these kind of irregular type of situations so I think we had something similar where people ask to Satoshi's wallets count in the circulating supply of Bitcoin so I think the team does deal with situations like that for the most part and but do you know how if they've decided it yes so I think as long as it is possible to sell it they would included so that was the decision that was made so that's easy but then they said we're like legally he's he's restricted then with those we counted or not so as they as they unlock or as he is able to sell them they would become circulating and they would be part of the numbers that they can the team can verify on the Explorer in which case they would be counted in circulating okay so essentially coin market cap excludes them at the moment because the amount that he can sell is like it's just it's like a you know zero point whatever or point zero point zero you know that kind of thing yeah and I think in fact when we talk about the origin like the origin story of x RP on CMC i think it was less about supply and it was more about concentration of power rather like centralization so people were processing SRP because they said it was centralized as opposed to the fact that the supply numbers were not as expected I think that was something that actually took some time to develop necessary oh oh oh I see okay so they weren't they actually weren't taking issue with the sofa it's yeah that was more like a thing Ryan - okay I see well all right so you know we talked a little bit about the kind of traffic you see on your site based on the trends you're seeing in the site traffic or the way the activity is changing on the site where do you think the space is headed in the near term yeah I think we have some theories there about what would happen and obviously none of them we can verify this moment but for example we do see a over time it's possible that there will be more concentration of assets so maybe we will concentrate to the top few hundred and start with the top few thousands is possible so I think that this is part of the natural evolution of success something that we'd notice I think the second is people are interested also in crypto or even slightly non-encrypted things like Libra so like the moment that we put labour up on the site we got lots of hits it was like the top crypto that was a top asset I was research on that date so I think as more and more of these types of assets come on a site we do see more mainstream interest in them beyond just the more kind of traditionally crypto acid structures that we that we are used to and the third would be around institutional and also pricing so we talked a lot about liquidity we talked a lot about how to price different assets and I think that because of the fact it's so critical for someone to be able to provide that kind of accurate pricing algorithm and things like that sterday institutional space we do see people coming to us and actually asking us how we might be able to help with some of these solutions and so kind of in totality we see a greater maturing of the space as compared to even just two years ago where it was more of a craze and now people are actually really looking at Europe is really looking at us really looking at ways that they can price markets better looking for more professional wastes basically off of charting and also interacting and buying and selling
