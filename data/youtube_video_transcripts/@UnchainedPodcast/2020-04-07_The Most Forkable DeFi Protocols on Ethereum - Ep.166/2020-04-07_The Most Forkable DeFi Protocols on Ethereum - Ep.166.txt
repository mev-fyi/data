hi everyone this week I have another essay for you this one by Kyle Somani of multi coin capital titled the most for Keable defy protocols on aetherium he looks at how easy it would be from an effort and capital standpoint to fork each of the major defy protocols he makes a strong case for how and why he thinks protocols like maker are quite defensible and why he believes certain Dex's are less so he also looks at the implications these defy protocols have on Assyrians defensibility it's a thought-provoking essay especially considering everything defy has been through in recent weeks also it'll be interesting to see how new developments like TVP see the new trustless version of Bitcoin coming to defy will play out by the metrics Kyle is weighing I'd love to hear your thoughts on what he says and now here's the most for Keable defy protocols on aetherium enjoy the show Kraken is the best exchange in the world for buying and selling digital assets it has the tightest security deep liquidity

gonna be talking about the defense ability of aetherium d5 protocols as a suite of new layer one block trains are launching I've been thinking about it theorems network effects and the defense ability of the d5 protocols built on top of the theorem a couple of years ago I wrote about the network effects of non-sovereign layer 1 money's like Bitcoin in aetherium since then the defy ecosystem on top of aetherium has blossomed utilizing a couple dozen d5 protocols users have withdrawn a few hundred million dollars of debt that's fully collateralized against an even larger pool of capital now that these protocols are collectively facilitating a few hundred million dollars of economic activity it's possible to begin to reason about defensibility one way to do this is to quantify and compare Network effects however it's very difficult to quantify Network effects with precision since the underlying dynamics of each protocol are unique therefore making it challenging to compare each protocol on an apples-to-apples basis in this essay I'll consider the one effort and to capital required to fork each of the major v5 protocols then I'll rank the relative strengths of these network effects and conclude with a discussion of a theorems ecosystem level defensibility this essay assumes working knowledge of each protocol first let's start with a synthetic stable coin such as maker about a year ago I wrote about how layer 2 assets such as MK r which is the equity of the maker now system can capture value in a permissionless and open setting in that essay I specifically identified the presence of unfor Keable state as the key to value capture the best example of unfor Keable state is the collateral that backs alone in the context of maker the obvious unforgeable state is the collateral which is primarily eath backing the die loans however it's now clear that this framing is incomplete to understand why let's assume that the only source of network effects for maker is the collateral a wealthy third party could fork all of makers contracts and create an alt maker ecosystem they could deposit tens of millions of dollars of collateral to bootstrap liquidity in that alternative ecosystem but what then the ultime carico system is useless if no one wants to buy or interact with all die makers most potent source of Defense ability is not MKR or the collateral backing the die loans but the liquidity and the usability of die die must be liquid in order for maker to be usable if someone withdraws died debt against eath collateral the die is useless if there's no liquidity for the die but use abilities is a superset of liquidity dies usability is clear and it's accepted by merchants it's used in other protocols like honor and it's used as collateral in lending protocols like compound and lendeth me the eyes plugged into all kinds of third-party apps services and infrastructure and that makes it more useful and usable the combination of the eyes liquidity and usability is a powerful moats a well capitalized alt maker team could try and offer a higher die savings rates and they could try and pay third parties to integrate all the AI but it's unclear if this would gain meaningful traction next let's turn to Fiat cloud or live stable coins such as tether while tether is not a pure defy protocol with an outstanding market cap of over five billion I included it because it's such an integral part of the crypto ecosystem the source of Defense ability for tether is clear it's the most liquid asset in the crypto ecosystem alongside BTC is available on all major non-us exchanges serves as collateral for many derivatives exchanges and is used to settle a huge percentage of OTC trades despite fierce competition from US DC PACs true USD gemini dollar die and others USD t still commands more than 80 percent of the stable coin market when measured using market cap this is the ultimate testament to the defense ability of USD T there are a few teams that are working on stable coin clearing houses including defy protocols such as stable coin swap and shell and centralized clearing houses such a stable house if these are successful and therefore reduce the friction associated with trading stable coins tether may be negatively impacted for example if these protocols and companies provide strong guarantees that large quantities of stable coins can be swapped with minimal slippage derivatives exchanges may begin to accept other stable coins as collateral today cryptocurrency derivatives exchange FTX offers this service natively however the presence of liquid stable and clearing houses may accelerate this trend for other exchanges which is likely bad for tedder next let's turn to collateralize money markets such as compound and lend a thought meet the unfor Keable state in the crypto lending protocol a compound is the collateral in the system therefore the defense ability of compound can be understood as follows as the value of the collateral pool increases borrowers can borrow more capital at lower rates which then draws in more lenders that's as virtuous so how difficult is it for someone to fork compound and therefore bootstrap liquidity into an alt compound well there are a few ways to do this an alt compound team can one support assets that compound itself is not support for example tether two they could introduce more favorable collateralization ratios and liquidation penalties 3 they could lend their own assets in the alt compound pool at a competitive or even discounted rate and 4 they could subsidize third-party lenders to undercut compounds rates today compound is less than a hundred million dollars of collateral back in the system if the creators of an alt compound undercut compounds rates by subsidizing users for example on the order of 100 basis points per year the annualized opportunity cost of bootstrapping liquidity would be less than 1 million dollars this level of scale is easily Venter fundable however in addition to compound internal liquidity in the form of lending and borrowing rates compound is also subject to a couple of unique forms of external liquidity that may provide additional defense ability first there are third-party aggregators such as instant app 0 on Ray Idol finance Ave and others these systems route deposits to compound which in turn lowers borrowing rates which then attracts more borrowers well organic capital flow is certainly good it's not clear that it matters on the margin because an alt compound scheme can subsidize rates to bootstrap liquidity anyways interestingly the presence of aggregators could actually backfire because the aggregators are incentivized to send user assets to the highest yielding lending pools assuming similarly trusted contracts governance and Oracle mechanics aggregators may not be loyal to compound at the expense of their users and so an alt compound team can actually win over aggregators with subsidies moreover a sufficiently large aggregator can siphon liquidity away from compound into its own pool or an alt compound form while this hasn't happened yet I expect it will in the coming years so overall it's unclear if third-party aggregators will act as a substantial source of defense ability for compound second let's consider C tokens which represent your balance in compounds and accrue interest over time see tokens are somewhat analogous today if third-party apps integrate see tokens for example for use as collateral and other lending protocols that makes SI tokens more usable outside of the court compound protocol that makes it difficult for lenders in this case the see token holders to move from compound to an alts compound while the maker slash die and compound /g token analogy is good it's not perfect the only reason to create the AI is to sell it for something else for example Maurice therefore Alt maker is useless unless there's a market for alt die however this is not true for compound compound is still useful even if third-party apps do not utilize C tokens empirically this is all playing out as the theory would predict the china-based d-force community forked the compound codebase and launched a collateralized money-market protocol called lend F thought I mean they've already bootstrap more than about 20 million dollars of collateral into the system in just a few months they accomplished this by one offering protocols the compound does not support notably tether I am BTC and HB TC and two localizing the service with third-party integrations for Chinese users it does not appear that the d-force community had to subsidize rates on lend me to accomplish this this was able to happen all organically it's clear then that maker is more defensible than compound with a subsidy budget anyone can fork compound in bootstrap liquidity internal to its lending and borrowing market but successfully forking maker requires more than a subsidy budget it requires liquidity and usability for dai external to the protocol itself next let's consider a generalized synthetic Asset protocols such as synthetics synthetics is a specific type of exchange focused on trading synthetic assets the defense ability of an exchange is generally understood to be a function of liquidity however synthetics is not a traditional exchange because it does not offer a central limit order book like virtually all other major exchanges across both traditional markets and crypto all I've seen is such as the New York Stock Exchange Chicago Mercantile Exchange coinbase and Finance offer central limit order books one of the defining features of synthetics is the takers do not any slippage when trading synth synthetic assets against the collateral pool however liquidity is limited in this model based on the amount of collateral in the system this means that liquidity and therefore defensibility is primarily a function of available collateral interestingly the growth of the synthetics exchange is actually hampered by the need for takers to on board into the synthetics ecosystem by trading real assets such as eath for synthetic assets such as SES today most users on board into the synthetics ecosystem via the decentralized exchange called yuna swap the largest liquidity pool on yuna swap is actually s keith to eath so while the need for a liquidity bridge is a constraint to growth it's also conversely a moat if someone Forks the synthetics ecosystem to create alt synthetics she will need to bootstrap an analogous liquidity bridge so how did the network effects of synthetics compared to that of maker and compound first let's consider the collateral in the protocol like in the cases of Alt maker and alt compounds anyone who fork synthetics can capitalize the collateral pool themselves or subsidize others for doing so therefore the collateral base is unlikely to provide meaningful defensibility next let's consider exhaustion SAS 'its die in the case of maker C tokens in the case of compounds and synthetic assets in the case of synthetics unlike makers die synthetic assets do not require liquidity external the protocol by design instead sins are more comparable to compound C tokens like C tokens synthetic assets can be used as collateral in third-party apps but they don't need to in order for the protocol to function while this could become a source of Defense ability in the future it has not yet and the last major forward defense ability for synthetics is the real asset synthetic asset bridge while synthetics leverages VB swap for this today an alt synthetic steam could easily provide their own real asset alternative synthetic asset bridge using mini swap fiber or other freely

let's consider automated market makers such as uni swap Stila coin swap shell BAM core future swap and Tiber compound is an automated market maker I'll bait for borrowing and lending instead of for trading as such the defense ability of most of these trading focused automated market makers can be understood to be comparable to that of compounds excluding in the notion of C tokens empirically this seems to be the case while not all of these automated market makers are directly competitive because of different product focuses such as focusing on stable coins versus futures the defense ability of each protocol is primarily a function of the size of each protocols liquidity pool whereas larger liquidity pools and compound allow for tighter lending and borrowing large and liquidity pools in trading focus automated market makers offer lower slippage for takers on chain liquidity protocol Khyber has become the most liquid automated market maker over the last 12 months largely by tapping into other automated market maker liquidity tools such as Union swap em to buy by leveraging third-party integrations that route take or order flow it's clear that all of the automated market makers are going to tap into one of those liquidity pools as they continue to improve over time for example 0x just enabled this in their most recent v3 upgrade paradoxically wants all of the automated market makers and within a given vertical for example stable coin swaps tap into one another's liquidity pools all of those automated market makers become perfect substitutes none of the automated market makers will be able to compete on distribution the ultimate winner from this end state of perfect competition will be takers who will therefore always receive best execution next let's consider non-custodial limit order book exchanges this would include D by DX by DX new o + 0 X the defensibility of these protocols are comparable to those of centralized exchanges I'll bait with a few disadvantages first all of these protocols are subject to the constraints of the underlying blockchain which ultimately settled traits these limitations include non-deterministic order execution high latency and minor for earning all of these constraints does hurt liquidity providers and therefore increased slippage for takers second these decentralized exchange generally do not support cross margining and position netting well I hope to eventually see this develop in the ecosystem if clear that this is years away meanwhile centralized exchanges like FD X and Finance offer cross margining today and are rapidly expanding their product offerings to maximize capital efficiency for traders and lastly let's consider a mixer called tornado cash tornado cash is unique among the other D 5 protocols above while others are focused on borrowing lending and trading tornado is focused on mixing funds to maximize user privacy today tornado cash does not support private payments in a pool rather it can just be used to anonymize funds the source of defensibility and tornado is the size of the anonymity pool since fun cycle through the pool relatively quickly for example the entire acid base seems to turn over every one to two weeks the network effects are definition fleeting moreover beyond a certain point a marginally larger anonymity set doesn't really matter for example as the anonymity set grows from 500 to 1,000 addresses it's not clear that the next marginal user cares who is the marginal user who believes that one out of 500 is not good enough but then one out of 1,000 is thus in its current form terminal cache is not that defensible however in a future version of the service tornado cache aims to support privacy enabled asset transfers inside of the privacy pool rather than just anonymizing funds which is what's available today in this model capital will be a lot stickier as it won't leave the ecosystem so quickly this will allow the anonymity pool to grow much larger making it more useful for larger amounts of capital the notion that large amounts of capital will only enter a large privacy pool is unique relative to the other defy protocols discussed earlier for example if the entire privacy pool is just 1,000 eath and that pool may not be useful for someone wishing to anonymize 9,000 days and in fact that could be harmful for the first 1000 owners in the pool as the owners of that first 1000 Eve may not want a 90% probability of being associated with the other 9,000 Eve for a user who wants to anonymize 10,000 eath they may require a pool of 90,000 DS this model while not yet available is clearly more defensible than the status quo because it enables the wealthiest people to use the service and the wealthiest people by definition have the most capital and have the largest incentive to hide their wealth okay now let's get to the rankings after considering the hypothetical difficulty of forking these protocols and the empirical evidence we have in the limited number of cases i've ranked the defense ability of these protocols from strongest to weakest note that this ranking is necessarily conjecture as it's impossible to quantify in therefore rank on a purely objective basis first tether and other fiat clabber like stable coins second synthetic stable points which is maker third mixers such as tornado cash fourth generalized synthetic asset protocols such as synthetics fifth Clara lies money markets such as compound inland SME sixth automated market makers such as uni swap and lastly non-custodial exchanges such as dydx idec's in new oh i ranked USD t at the top because it faces the most competition and is still 5 to 10 times larger than its largest competitor which is us DC wall tether is controversial it's extremely defensible coinbase is one of the best capitalized companies in the space and it's been unable to meaningfully displace us DT after 18 months while it's possible that stable points different houses made changes of these dynamics in the future it's sure later now based on the commentary buff it should be clear why makers next the maker of protocol does not function if dye is not liquid and not usable external to the core protocol both of these traits are not easily for Keable and are not easy to subsidized i ranked tornado third above the lending and trading protocols because wealthy users who were gonna provide the vast majority of capital in these protocols require the presence of other wealthy users in order to make these systems work and because wealth is not evenly distributed i expect that the market may only support one the to privacy pools rather than ten plus that are available for trading and lending next this synthetics while I noted that synthetics and compound are similar in terms of their network effects I ultimately chose to rank synthetics above compound because of the real asset synthetic asset bridge that acts as additional form of defense ability below that the common traits among the protocols and the bottom half of the list is heightened competition this is clear empirically entrepreneurs and venture investors are betting that these markets are not that defensible furthermore as discussed above competitors can easily bootstrap liquidity in most of these markets fairly easy by subsidizing liquidity okay and with that we can now turn to ecosystem level network effects I'll conclude this essay by considering the implications of everything discussed above on aetherium defensibility at the ecosystem level in short the theorems defensibility at least as it pertains to D 5 protocols is materially stronger than that of any individual di protocol the primary source of a theorem defense ability is not capital or liquidity but it's the composability and interoperability of these protocols as a whole it's truly amazing that someone can use ethers collateral withdraw die against it lend out that dye on compound or lenda enemy and use that dye as collateral to borrow ZRX and then sell the CRX for eath all in a single transaction in a single moment in time the ultimate testament to the power of aetherium level network effects around 'if I was the recent bzx attack that took place on Valentine's Day the attackers transaction was likely the single most complex transaction ever processed by the etherium network chaining together five sophisticated protocols recreating this level of interoperable infrastructure in any ecosystem is going to take years just as it took aetherium years to build to where it is today as such I recommend that most new layer 1 teams focused on other use cases beyond defy at least until they bootstrap their respective ecosystems Bravo to the etherium community
