hi all in recent press interviews or at book signings and speaking engagements people have been asking what's next for me now that my book is out well i'm happy that i'm finally able to announce what i'll be working on today law and crime the leading live trial and true crime network and i announced that we will be collaborating on an investigative podcast series that explores the case of ilya lichtenstein and heather morgan the couple who have been accused of attempting to launder 4.5 billion dollars worth of bitcoin the series will be a deep dive into the story to understand the married couple at the center of it how they allegedly attempted to launder the bitcoin stolen from bitfinex and then to look more closely at the clues that led to their arrest i'm thrilled to be partnering with law and crime to tell this tale about stolen bitcoin with the depth and level of detail it deserves it will be a fascinating journey not only into the lives of this couple that has already captivated the internet but into how blockchain sleuthing enabled the government to track them down we have a press release out about it today which you can read on law and crime so if you're

compound yield across 12 blockchains got crypto choose beefy today's guest is mike brock general manager of tbd at block formerly known as square welcome mike thanks for having me super happy to be here let's start with some basics obviously square block has undergone some big changes in the last year but many of them are more just announced as opposed to fully realized so can you give us the full context of what tbd is and why it is that square decided to launch this new initiative yeah tbd is our newest business unit at the company um which sits alongside our i guess you could say i don't like i don't want to say legacy business it's probably too strong but uh cash app square and our second most newest business unit title so one of the things that you know as a company we've been really striving towards is building towards mentality that that we talk about internally as our ecosystem of startups and as part of a you know a coherent ecosystem that that works together and reinforces the other so tbd adds to that um i think very apropos to what we'll be talking about today by focusing on our efforts around decentralized finance uh cryptocurrency particularly bitcoin and our efforts around decentralized identity which i hope to talk a little bit more about today as well which we see as like really the the big unlock that needs to happen um to allow us to gateway into this this decentralized future the other part of your question around like you know tvd and like like what it is we are very focused on solving what i call the the onboarding or the on-ramping problem into the the crypto world the reality that we live in today is that the average person goes about their day and they pay for things they pay taxes they receive their salary their hourly wage they they deal with money in many different ways and the the truth of the matter is is that most people today don't really have like a practical use case for bitcoin or other crypto technologies i think we should just admit this we do need to admit this is an emerging technology i think we also need to admit that when we look outside the united states and develop economies um that actually is is less true there are in fact places in the world where cryptocurrency is playing a very important role i would like to invoke you know the situation in ukraine i think um bitcoin and and crypto has had a very large impact in terms of uh humanitarian fundraising uh i couldn't help but notice that that the international red cross has actually started accepting crypto donations for help in ukraine these are these are obviously very very real things that are i'm very pleased to see but in terms of what we're trying to do is you know we we look at the potential of this technology and we see that potential especially in that very powerful example of unlocking a future where access to the financial system is not contingent upon creditworthiness or quite or whether or not i mean i i guess you could say whether a government wants you to have access to the financial system or not and i and i say that not so much directed at democratic governments but like in situations like we are now seeing in parts of the world where where people's financial access is is used as a as a weapon of political disenfranchisement so we we look at this we we look at that and and we think that that's like a future that we want to see and and to do that we need to build tools to let people on board and on ramp into that into that ecosystem and so tvd's focus is building those on-ramps building a massively distributed and decentralized system of liquidity for linking the existing financial system fiat rails into the decentralized system through a series of open source open protocol nodes that we call tv decks we put out a white paper on this protocol last november right before thanksgiving weekend here in the united states really detailing what it is and how it's going to work we can we can get into the details of that but but broadly speaking this is the theme of tbd which is building infrastructure to enable individuals businesses institutions and yes like even governments um to interact with this ecosystem in a in a way that that will ultimately allow these technologies to become daily parts of people's lives and so we're you know we are a far more sort of i guess you could say platform focused business as opposed to like a consumer-facing business like like cash app and you know in our you know i guess you could say we're more like a a stripe um than than like a traditionally consumer facing brand in that sense but i think that's actually exactly like where we need to focus and so my next question for you was going to be about how square crypto became spiral and then for you to differentiate it from tbd but it sounds like that's kind of the more consumer-facing business and then yours is the one that's more b2b i wouldn't characterize our business as not as b2b or b2c like i i think what you should expect to see is is more like a developer focus like a developer-focused platform ecosystem there are certainly ways in which that could have like consumer facing elements and institutional facing elements i think it's really more about building you know fit-to-purpose tooling to build decentralized solutions many of which may have like very direct consumer applications okay but but spiral is more consumer-facing spiral is not a business um it is you know i i wanna let me um i i explicitly did not i explicitly did not mention them as i as i talked about our uh as our as i talked about our business they they are not one of our business units they are a a an internal purely open source i would say like almost like quasi block funded initiative to just invest in the bitcoin ecosystem there is no revenue model uh that's going to ever be contemplated for spiral they are a pure open source arm they're only they they receive a budget from the business every year that you know that we set and they go out and they invest in what's best for bitcoin whether or not spiral you know um like we don't have any i want we have no influence on them um we like steve lee and the team are their only mandate is do what's good for bitcoin and they have done a great job with you know the development of the lightning development kit and they're working on the bitcoin development kit and they'll be lots of awesome future developer goodies that they're going to continue to work on but they're working for bitcoin um and we're sponsoring them essentially so uh they are not a traditional business unit like tvd where we do actually have a mandate to generate revenue products and services and and and contribute to the overall business so that that's like an important distinction that i'm happy to clarify okay however i guess one thing that's interesting to me is that both of them do seem developer focused and so it does sound like their efforts could be complementary yeah i think that's true and yeah how do you see that happening yeah i mean it's it's a very common question i get like what's the difference between tbd and spiral because tbd also has this really strong open source focus i guess the way i would i don't i guess the way i would try to if i would try drawing analogies to make it easier for i guess people to understand how we think about it differently is i think tbd is is trying to be a open source company inside block that's a lot more like a red hat or a or a cloud era where yes we are investing in open source protocols and tools and we are yes looking for monetization opportunities and spiral is more like the linux foundation in the sense that like they they they are like a purely sort of like um you know quasi charitable organization and it's like not actually they're not actually a charitable organization but like we kind of treat them that way that they're sort of entrusted to just kind of like do what's good for bitcoin in the same way the linux foundation is trying to do what's good for linux which is like different than like say red hat red hat is also contributing to linux but they're also a for-profit company and i think that's kind of the same this way if you're trying to like find like a like some sort of pattern recognition to kind of see it understand the difference between dvd and spiral that's like the analogy i would come up with and so as you mentioned spiral is focused only on bitcoin and well tbd i mean you phrased it a little differently i think you said that it was primarily focused on bitcoin will you look at other chains or explore other chains or do you think for now we'll pretty much only be bitcoin we will be investing in stable coins you know this is not you i mean we've said this uh publicly like we think that that stable coins are like a very powerful tool for improving the payment ecosystem going back to what i said before about the reality of where people currently exist in their lives is that you know fiat currency is still a thing uh people still rely on it they get paid in it they have to pay in it to obtain products and services um in the future we we believe that that that bitcoin will become a more viable currency for for day-to-day use but today it's not um so we we believe that like creating on-ramps into the decentralized economy of stable coins is is one of the things that that tbd is is investing very heavily in as it pertains to our disposition on bitcoin we definitely like see tbd as being like a very important on-ramp to providing decentralized bitcoin liquidity in the world because we we do believe in bitcoin jack says that you know that we think of bitcoin as the the native currency of of the internet and from that perspective like we we see ourselves uplifting that vision through the liquidity that the the tv dex network will ultimately provide and and part of that will be supporting stable coins uh so i would say that we're not purely like strictly speaking a a bitcoin focused entity although it is a very important part of our mission to advance the cause of bitcoin so before we get into more on that i actually also want to talk about your background how did you get into bitcoin and why did you decide to go all in on it i've told this story so many times but i love love telling it the truth is i was pretty disinterested in bitcoin um at the time that i was kind of pulled into it long and the short of it is in the the period starting like right right after the election uh in 2016 um and kind of coming coming back and decompressing from you know the the sort of the shock of you know the the political dynamics um in the united states having shifted so drastically we kind of came back and uh you know were starting off the year and and like we started with a hack week where everyone in in the company uh basically gets to work on anything they want to work on for a week the whole company you know just basically picks up the get they bring teams together they decide like hey i'm gonna build a feature in cash app that will do this or i'm going to people actually sometimes people don't even work on products sometimes people like decide that they're gonna you know try and improve little things in the office or sometimes they sometimes they'll be initiatives like improving human like you know people programs inside the company so hack week is this really is this thing that we do and i was at the time working on our cash app banking and cash card product which i had been shepherding for almost two years at that point and jack dorsey our ceo and founder came up to me uh in in like you know right right in that early january and said i want to do a hack week project with you i was like oh and he said i want to do bitcoin i think i looked at him and i was kind of not really like like like like sure whether to take it seriously um and he's like yeah i want i want to to build bitcoin and i and i said to him you know i'm not going to participate in hack week this year because you know i'm i'm i really i really need to get this stuff done for the the you know the banking and cash card launch in a few months and he was and he was like i really think i really think we should do bitcoin together and i was like i was like no i was like jack i can't and like i don't know anything about bitcoin i don't really believe in it and and i and i would i was just like i can't and so jack you know was like well i'm not really going to take no for an answer and so i'm just going to like set up camp beside your desk until you agree to do it which which literally happened jack literally basically like i was we have these like traded like trading floor type desks at our at our headquarters and in cash app and it just so happened that that the seat to the left of me was not actually taken so it was just kind of open so jack just was very easily able to just camp uh there and so he sat beside me that entire day um sat there on his phone i would look over at him he'd be like texting and emailing with people and he'd look up and he would be like still here and uh that went on for a day and a half um and it was actually on day two of the hack week that i just broke down and agreed to to do it and i basically started writing code for the first time um in a while and just trying to figure out like i didn't know anything about bitcoin had no idea how it worked like i started writing code not even knowing what am i even doing dev went and found some like open source bitcoin libraries and just started looking at the api documentation and trying to make sense of it and i was like and i i so that was how it happened and it was just sort of just like kind of like all right fine whatever just i'll do it i i i did another podcast recently where i told the same story um but yeah i i i didn't i didn't come to to bitcoin uh through like any sort of like spark that went on my own head it was really jack kind of really like was the one who was really inspired by by bitcoin and its potential and he just saw something in it and and he really wanted me to work on it um for the hack week and then and then after the hack week um he wanted me to continue to work on it in fact he wanted to to ship it as a product which did not immediately want to do as well and he also had to continue to lobby me and what was that product it was the product that we shipped in cash up which was the the ability to buy and sell bitcoin inside a cash app um which was a the literally the craziest thing i'd ever done in my career um not not be not not just because not not because like i mean it doesn't sound crazy now but in 2017 we were a publicly traded company there was no publicly traded company in the united states that was buying and selling bitcoin like a publicly traded regulated like fight like consumer like doing consumer financial services and the biggest problem wasn't honestly at the time to doing it wasn't necessarily government regulation like a lot of people kind of think i mean that was like a major concern there was concerns at the time on whether or not the sec was going to consider something like bitcoin and security and you know we had all this sort of like risk analysis going on like from a legal perspective but it's actually our our our partnership ecosystem you know you we had you know we have all these like we're interconnected into the financial system bank partners like you know payment network partners and it's actually it was actually that ecosystem when they kind of found out that we were doing bitcoin they were like whoa whoa what are you guys talking about we want nothing to do with this and so it became like a really tough slog to figure out how we were going to launch it so that was that was the craziest year of my life and and here i am now like uh you know a few years later weirdly enough one of i think the the biggest champions for for this other company who would have thought well so you make it sound like you were sort of forced into this but it sounds like along the way you must have had some kind of light bulb moment or something that made you fall in love with it or at least begin to like it so do you remember what that was i don't think it was like a single moment per se i if i'm being honest i think the first two or three months of working on it i was kind of in search in my own head of like a raison d'etre for the for the effort i think what really clicked for me one like at a certain point was actually just kind of going back to what i had been passionate about before discovering bitcoin so i i talked about how i was working on our cash app banking and and cash card strategy and at the center of that strategy that i was you know one of the principal architects of was a really obsessive focus on trying to maximize financial access to individuals in the united states who are underserved or unserved by the banking system it's a crazy like statistic but there's about 11 million adults in the united states who have significant trouble accessing a conventional checking account and this was really at the sort of center of what we were trying to do with with cash app at the time and one of the things that i eventually realized actually while working on bitcoin i think it's kind of really like really dawned on me at one point was that the incentive structures of the financial system that we were a part of whether we liked it or not made it very very difficult to provide financial access to everybody unconditionally and the reason for that is like varied it's it's a a mishmash of of you know like regulations uh well-intentioned regulations in some cases that have uh negative consequences it's the fact that the payment system is like old and antiquated in other cases you know the thing that i i now realize today like very like viscerally is that fiat payment is almost complete at least the united states i won't speak to other more modern systems in other countries that i'm not as familiar with but at least the united states like the ach system forces most payments to essentially be systems of credit like a payment is a credit even a debit card payment is a uh requires the provision of credit at some level because settlement is not instantaneous it takes several days in the back end for final settlement to occur so there's always counterparty risk in the system and we're risking and if there's risk in the system markets will price it in and that that turns into that that gets priced in in several different ways and priced in through fees or it can be priced and through access itself right if if there is a fear by a uh by a financial intermediary that that certain people below a certain line of of credit worthiness will create situations where the intermediaries get left held in the bag and the way that that happens is through you know payment reversals and chargebacks there's like always a way in this system of like credit and like you know credit based payments in the system that like accounts can go negative they could be like even there's no flag like this people don't realize this but there's like no flag that a bank can really tick in their software that says do not let account go into overdraft you might think that that would be possible but it's not really possible because the system the payment system is asynchronous so there's always a possibility that that the asynchronicity of the system will leave an account negative and so banks have to take that into account when they consider offering a checking account to someone and that's why you have to do a checking a credit check to get a checking account and when i realized that and i was like wow there's like really no way to solve that problem without rebuilding the payment system from scratch and then i realized one day wait we have rebuilt the payment system from scratch and it's called bitcoin yes this is why when i first learned about bitcoin in depth in may 2015 and really really understood it and i was vetting the forbes fintech 50 list so all the fintech companies were telling me what problems in the banking system they were solving i immediately knew this technology is superior and there is no way it's not going to win out like it was just clear to me because you know everything in the banking system is decades old so yeah that it sounds like a similar epiphany to mine so let's talk about what you're working on um as you mentioned earlier one of your announced projects is tb dex um or the tbx protocol and uh the way you've described it or tbd has described it is that it aims to create ubiquitous and accessible on-ramps and off-ramps that allow the average individual to benefit from crypto innovation so tell us a little bit about kind of the problems that tbdx aims to solve and how it works yeah so the the main problem it aims to solve is the one that i described the opening um of the interview which is to you know to to create ubiquitous access to the crypto ecosystem and the way that the way that that we hope that that will look is going back to the discussion we just wrapped up around how i had that epiphany around bitcoin is ultimately allowing people to self on board into the system to the maximum extent possible i envision a day where you can set up a self-custody wallet to hold bitcoin or stable coins and with that self-custody wallet supporting the tv dex protocol you can ultimately reach out into the network and say i have this payment instrument that's linked to you know a a bank account or or some like you know like fiat payable account like somewhere in the world and i want to find somebody who is willing to accept this form of payment and like also using the tv dex protocol negotiate the the necessary identity exchange which is yes regulatory necessary in in most countries to establish like a transaction of value for value um fiat for tokenized value and to do that using an open standard messaging system defined by the tvx protocol and and and buffeted by the the identity the decentralized identity um protocols that we're working on that will allow the creation of a like decentralized sets of liquidity nodes across the world that anyone can operate in theory regulated exchanges can operate if they so choose we will operate um that is one of the things that pvd will do we will we will stand up our own nodes of this network we are also working with other companies that are also interested in operating these nodes and the idea is is that like yeah like you can you can directly like set out asks for many different exchanges not just like centralized exchanges to bid on the exchange of that liquidity in a very decentralized way so it is it is a take on the decentralized exchange it's a little bit different than the decentralized exchanges we've seen up until now which are really really focused on on creating you know atomic swap networks and and creating aud you know and doing automated market making this is different in the sense that what we're really focused on here is finding a way to connect the decentralized crypto ecosystem back to the fiat system in the way that is at least as decentralized as possible the truth is that fiat is not truly decentralizable we all everyone in this space understands that right at the end of the day it's a government issued currency it's controlled by the government the supply of it is controlled by the central bank it's a very centralized thing but to the extent that like money services businesses that are in the business of exchanging fiat money for tokenized assets such as bitcoin and and stable coins that we think that can be decentralized we think the provisioning of that liquidity is at least decentralizable and commoditizable using open source open standard protocols and that's what tb dex is so in a moment we're going to dive a bit more into tv decks and some of the decentralized identifiers that mike has been talking about but first a quick word from

control of your financial future back to my conversation with mike so earlier when you were talking about tbdx and how it worked you know obviously there would need to be liquidity in the system so who are you imagining would provide that liquidity or how do you plan to incentivize people providing liquidity we will provide it um on day one um you know we we made that decision that you know if you want to catalyze a network you know you know you you know you need to show don't tell which is which is one of the things that um jack used to say um back in the early days so you know we are going to show a fully working network and we're going to be in more than one country when we launch the network to really show the power of something like this to enable not just access to the crypto ecosystem but you know and like like the potential to use this technology for you know disrupting uh traditional remittance payments is is something that that we think is is like a worthwhile initiative and actually i think one of the really i think remittance quite honestly is is one of the first obvious you know areas for product market fit for for bitcoin and crypto more generally and so you know we're we're taking a we're making a really big push um into the international arena right but but if tbd is the sole provider of the liquidity then how does that affect kind of the decentralized aspect of the exchange yeah i mean it's a good question we are working with other companies that are planning on also launching nodes on the tv dex network at least in the united states um and potentially around the world we don't have like i mean this this is this is the right is the biggest risk right to something like this that like you know that it doesn't get like widely adopted our belief is though that the incentives to adoption are actually quite strong and i'll tell you why and the reason why i believe more players will come in and provide liquidity in the medium term well it is true that this technology is like very disruptive to an incumbency out there like in in like the traditional like payment space it is also true that there is an entire ecosystem of even traditional businesses that that seek access to a more accessible cheap and reliable payment system and so one of the things that really surprised me when we released the white paper was i totally expected that i was going to hear from the crypto industry at large when i put that out there and i did i got my linkedin inbox was filled with you know the you know the ceos and biz dev people from from crypto companies but what actually really surprised me was how many like sort of legacy companies reached out and said wait like could we be a part of this like could this be like a way that like we could like actually like build like a better like payment scheme where we're not like beholden to these like old crappy payment systems which suck and it's really hard to like manage like risk loss and the transaction costs are high so that was that was actually like one of the biggest validations for me and we do continue to have i mean i can't unfortunately like those conversations are not not something that i can talk about publicly i would like to i would encourage people to uh we we do try like one of the things is we do try to be radically transparent unfortunately some of the people working with are a little bit more skittish about working in public than we are so i do have to respect i do have to respect their um their desire for privacy but i will say that i do believe that there will be more people than us providing liquidity and i'm very confident of that so you keep alluding to how these peer-to-peer transactions could be based on decentralized identifiers or what you call dids what are some examples of these decentralized identifiers so this is a very new old idea the idea for decentralized identifiers has been around actually for quite some time and there has been movements afoot on the internet since like actually as as far far away as the 1990s to come up with you know universal centralized identifiers for identity on the internet and in fact a lot of the technologies that we're now trying to adopt and and push forward do have their roots in some cases going back that far so i think it's not so much i think i think that there's a few things that that need to be said right like like one decentralized identity has not entered its heyday it is a it is a new technology but i i think that it is the technology that needs to exist if this future of decentralized finance that everybody in this space believes in is is ever going to exist and and i think a lot of people hear that and they think it's because i'm talking about like compliance with kyc and idv and and all of these like regulatory regimes that's not really the reason the reason why decentralized identity is necessary for decentralized finance to exist and be a viable linchpin of the the economy is identity is is necessary even between two private parties to establish trust to establish like like provenance of of like of ownership for that for that trust to be uh something that can be represented to third parties that other people can vouch for other people can create what we call webs of trust and allow people to ultimately engage in low-risk low-cost transactions the example i like to use and and i don't also want to minimize the fact that yes we do have to comply with regulatory obligations around kyc um but i i i like to i really like to push this point though because i think that people focus on that a little bit too much and i like to use the example of you know imagine like imagine if if amazon was a completely anonymous online company you had no idea where they were based you had like no there was no number to call there was no email address there was like really no there was no way to like prove that the product you just bought and sent bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency to pay for actually exists in a warehouse and they actually have the intention to send you that product now like like like no but this is like a really important point i think people take this concept of social trust for granted like we take we take for granted that we can trust amazon because we know it and we know that like we bought from them time and time again and like our amazon prime deliveries just keep showing up sometimes they don't and amazon has good customer service and they refund us but we take for grant we take for granted that that that's like a thing and i think there's this element in this industry there's this assumption that exists that i think is like actually just like really really wrong that like we're heading towards this utopia in the future where we'll be having these like pseudo-anonymous or completely anonymous like financial transactions where we just don't have to know anything about the counterparty and that will all sort of be like hiding in like in like digital in this like digital like like darkness hiding from the government and anyone like monitoring us and my question is is like well if that's true like are are we gonna like like if you want that to be true too then i guess we're gonna have to set up like anonymous drop boxes for you know the products to be sent to and hope that like it actually shows up and and hope that like with no recourse to you know uh trust to these like anonymous like entities that we're transacting with i i i just don't think that that's like a viable future the truth is is that we need identity like if i look like if i'm if i'm doing business with you laura i want to know that you are who you say you are i want to know that that qr code you just presented me actually belongs to you and it's not just some hacker that's like created a deep fake of your of your face and and is like pretending to be you and is actually providing me a qr code that points to a bitcoin wallet that is like actually in some far-flung part of the world and i'll never see my bitcoin again and then when i call the real laura shin she's like i don't know what you're talking about mike like i i didn't like offer to sell you that so and then i'm like by the way i'm sorry but you just got rug pulled yeah no so i think this is like really why like decentralized identity is really important and i think that like people haven't woken up to the fact that if someone doesn't solve this problem and operationalize it these are like the real like very tangible problems that the decentralized financial world are dealing with yeah yeah but but the only thing that i would add is i feel like people are already learning this right now and it's not with necessarily even buying physical objects but even with buying digital objects like the whole nft space right now is just full of very similar rug pulls and i feel like all those people they would probably say amen to what you're saying yeah no it's like totally and so this is this is why decentralized identity is like one of our biggest lifts we are choosing to try and standardize on the existing w3c you know did specification which is currently in draft it is also the technology that microsoft's ion is is built on top of which like surprise surprise like we are also like working with so through that you know like through that lens like we think that this this this the time for this technology is now and the desire the great amount of desire for for building decentralized financial systems and and operationalizing things like bitcoin and self-custody wallets is is now the killer app for decentralized identity it's not that decentralized identity is a particularly new technology in the sense that like a lot of a lot of things that we're not working on have been around for years but we think now is the time now is like you you now is that is the is where like the great sort of like product market fit use case now exists which is people want to be able to self-custody you know tokenized assets like bitcoin you know you mentioned nfts um i you know we've been critical of them and we can tell you if we can talk about that as well but but like you know i'm i'm not like you know people are free to to do what they choose but is insofar as insofar as these technologies exist and that we truly want to have a decentralized experience we have to change the account model of the internet um on its head and we have to put the account model back in the individual's control the account model the internet today is highly centralized it's the thing that i think not enough people are thinking about in this space which is that like we log in with google we log in with facebook we log in with amazon we like literally have given our identity to these big centralized companies and we now use them as like the way in which we authenticate and represent our identity to the internet we don't control our own identity and we don't have the tools to honestly like other than like taking pictures of our driver's license and uploading it to like websites and so yeah so the decentralized identity technologies that we're working on today which like uses cryptography and and like you know the the public key infrastructure in the same way that that that cryptocurrency wallets do to be able to like actually have a piece of identity that you own that you control and yes that other third parties can attest like credentials to i can have a decentralized identity that has like a linkage to like a company like block like pbd that has kyc the customer and has put has has like basically confirmed that you know you are who you say you are this is your legal name this is your birthday this is your social security number that this is you know we've done a credit check this is your fico score and you can have like a a company like us vouch for your did and issue you a verifiable credential that you can then potentially reuse where other companies or other players can say well if like block or even our competitors like coinbase or paypal did it that we can say look like we we see that and we we recognize that that like reaches that that reaches a certain like threshold of like you know uh of provenance for that person's identity and we can like essentially use that to establish a greater degree of trust for that identity without compromising privacy where the the individual remains in complete control of the ability to distribute that information as they see fit they don't have to like whereas today you have no control of that you have no ability to know like like like who has your information and why you have no ability to revoke access to that information and even beyond that the technology provides for the use of even greater privacy preserving technologies that allow us to establish trust like zero knowledge proofs like we imagine a world where in the future you can have a did and rather than having credentials that are filled with like privacy compromising information or or information that could like enhance your risk of identity theft can actually be like provided in an opaque but still provable way using zero knowledge proofs you can imagine a future where i have a did i'm in california so like if the state of california wanted to support the ids say at the dmv they could the dmv could choose to issue a verifiable credential to my self-sovereign identity and say this person solves we issue like in the same way that we send a crypto payment to your you know your public key they can send to my public key that like i i know you are who you say you are and you're licensed to drive the state of california and that can be something that any other person in the world could verify if i chose to say here's my identity i'm providing you the verifiable credential that california issued me you can go and take that verifiable credential and you can ping the dmv directly and they will verify that that yes he is licensed without actually even having to like disclose my name or my address or any of that other information which typically goes through it but still have 100 confidence that it is true that i am who i am and i am a licensed driver what you've really done is you've accomplished the best of both worlds right you've you now have an identity that you control that is yours that no one can take away from you that other people can attest elements of of of credentials to like driver's licenses like kyc like even just like i don't know like your ebay trust your ebay score as like a seller or a buyer whatever it is and that could be reused to create like new ways of thinking about risk and trust that doesn't require us to like do the thing that we currently do which is like give all of this like privacy compromising information to everybody but instead create this like buildable social trust scheme that's shareable and viewable and in full control of like the individual that will ultimately i think allow us to achieve what i think we all want which is like a decentralized financial system and one that is far more privacy preserving and actually far safer for everybody safer for me and actually safer for institutions now you have this like private privacy protecting and preserving system that also gives people high confidence that people are trustworthy and this is so so this is this is the the true potential decentralized identity and why i think it's the great unlock for this whole quote-unquote decentralized financial system and web that people are talking about yeah no question that i mean resolving this issue is is going to be huge because just i feel like anything that tries to connect the blockchain to something in the real world is a really really really difficult problem to solve and there's a reason right now that uh you know kind of all the things that have taken off in the blockchain world tend to have been things that are inherently digital and not things that are you know exist in the physical world but i did want to ask you a few more questions about tb dax you may have seen that vitalik buterin told bloomberg's emily chang that he was skeptical of defy on bitcoin he said the difference between bitcoin and ethereum is that on ethereum there is native functionality that allows you to essentially directly put either eth or ethereum based assets into these smart contracts into these lock boxes where there is then arbitrary conditions of any kind that can then govern how these assets get released bitcoin does not have that functionality to the same extent jack is basically going to have to essentially create his own system that enforces those rules and then on the bitcoin layer the bitcoins will just have to be owned by probably a multi-sig wallet controlled by jack or just the participants in this system it looks similar but it will end up being something with a much weaker trust model what's your response to those comments so my response to this i've debated some of these issues publicly already on my twitter timeline and in other places and i'm sure i will here and and in other forms but what i would say is i think there's like i i actually just kind of reject a lot of the premises of these arguments and so i feel like there's a lot of like talking past the other side of the argument here because i feel like when someone says like well you know the bitcoin blockchain doesn't have you know these these capabilities these technologies um so how are you going to do these things there's this like unstated premise that in order to have decentralized systems you have there has to be a blockchain and this is like the premise that i think that like doesn't get heard enough like i i think people think of me as like a bitcoin maximalist i don't think i am at all i i mean i i'm a big supporter of bitcoin like obviously like i i want to see it succeed but i don't have some sort of like partisan like affinity for it where like like i you know like my identity is tied to it and i want bitcoin to like win like come hell or high water and like i honestly i i i like the the folks at that solana and like i i'm i'm friends with like some of the major investors and those things and we've had like very like heated debates about that and i so and i wish them well and honestly like if i am like proven wrong and like these like ecosystems like flourish and they like grow into what what they're hoping they they are i'll be super happy to admit that i was wrong and may you know maybe tbd will be building like solutions on top of those systems in a few years i'm always open to being wrong it's something like i try to pride myself on what i will say is like the the nature of my doubt and the reason why i haven't jumped on that bandwagon is because i don't think blockchain is needed for decentralization in all cases in fact i would argue that blockchain is a terrible way to decentralize a lot of things i like to think about this from a very first principles basis what is blockchain good at i think it's very good at money i think that's what like it does on bitcoin i think that's what it does on a lot of these blockchains and i think that that has consistently been the thing that it has proven itself good at you see it that's what people are doing on crypto exchanges they're they're treating it like money they're treating it like a a cash like asset like case proven product market fit established where i'm really skeptical is yes like in like the the argument for smart like generalized smart contract chains and like what that means and the reason why i'm so skeptical i generally like i i generally think that the unit economic story of smart contract chains just doesn't make sense to me from the perspective of a and i from like a as somebody who has built like product at scale for consumers i have a lot of real questions about the assumptions that are made in that space the first is that the reason why that we will see adoption of platforms and ecosystems built on top of these smart contract chains that are powered by like solana or ethereum is that there's a seemingly a pent-up demand for new like newly envisioned services built from the ground up that individuals have a stake in that they have some sort of control in that they can have ownership in that they can like use cryptocurrency as micro payments in lieu of like ad supported models in order to like you know establish like you know like greater freedom and like buy-in and like this really very like quite honestly utopian vision for the internet and actually i think that would be great if that was true i just don't think that human nature works that way um i my my counter argument actually to uh that that story isn't even like inside the crypto ecosystem itself it's it's like it's platforms like tick tock right like everybody has everybody understands that like that a platform like that having you know the like high profile you know like censorship at the behest of a government that didn't doesn't want certain political messages to be present on that platform led to a huge political blow up the last the last administration of this country tried to force the sale of its u.s assets to microsoft you know and ultimately that was killed in federal court in the united states um and so you know bike dance you know still has full control of that platform now the reason why i bring this up is that like despite the fact that everyone knows this like my daughter knows this my daughter's 13 years old she understands this she understands that that that the chinese government probably has undue influence over the platform but she doesn't care like she like like this is this this is like this is the thing like the like individual individual customers do not like do not react to like to these very like political and ethical and moral incentives like i mean i do actually i don't i don't use the the platform for that reason i am very principled about the products and services i use but my daughter isn't and neither are you so i don't know why you're bringing this book are you saying that um defy and bitcoin will be more centralized and people won't care i don't know where you're going with this no what i'm saying is i i am skeptical of defy in as a smart contract based system at all so when i talk about d5 what i'm saying is the ecosystem of decentralized finance is not going to be like this thing that's like completely been built on top of blockchains it's going to be a it's going to be a set of decentralized systems decentralized identity you know commodified and decentralized services on the internet but i don't believe it's going to it's going to be built as like touring complete applications running as decentralized apps on solana or ethereum like like i think this is like i think this is like why like we're talking like past each other the reason i'm talking about tick tock is because i'm talking about consumer incentives around why would somebody adopt say i don't know like like why would you use a social network that's built on top of salon or on top of ethereum well like is do you really do we really think that consumers are going to build are going to get solana or ethereum wallets and engage in micropayments to interact with these new decentralized services that i hear you know i hear people in that system i hear the people at andreessen horowitz and stuff talking about how consumers are going to want to use this because they want to escape big tech censorship and stuff like that and i just don't believe that like the incentive structures that people think would lead to consumers like jumping through all these additional hoops to achieve decentralization of everything this this web 3 narrative is real i don't think it's real so yeah so you're saying that bitcoin d5 will be more centralized in different ways but people won't care is i don't i somehow that's it just feels like that's what you keep saying but no no i i i don't think that the only way to create decentralized financial services is purely through finding ways to like put the entire instrumentation of of services on the chain itself i think decentralization is not purely a function i i i think what has happened is that people are using blockchain and decentralization as as like interchangeable words and i don't think that they are right well that's just because well but i mean typically when you have a blockchain you have you know this distributed set of nodes that are running things and so it isn't like there is you know just one entity that's controlling the network so i think that's why people tend to view them as the same but but your is your because sometimes so people sometimes make the point that they feel that a lot of these blockchains really are controlled by you know one or some small number of entities so is that what you're trying to say that that's one of the criticisms that i i have and i would in in many cases lob at them but i'm saying something completely different i'm i'm making an argument that very few people make i mean other people have actually made this sort i add you know like aaron levy from you know he's also made the i think a very similar argument to the one that i'm making which is that i don't believe the incentive structures support the thesis that a lot of people in d5 are making so when i talk about decentralized finance i'm not talking about like rebuilding the new york stock exchange on top of ethereum or solana i don't think that that's going to work right like i i think that it is very obvious to me that the marginal economic costs of doing that are not something that the rest of the economy is willing to pay in exchange for just like knowing that like that that they're safe from censorship i'm saying you really have to think about like i think it is i think it is a good thing and it's why i believe in bitcoin that it is censorship resistant and that it's decentralized but the way that it works is it works through it works so well because of the adversarial dynamics in the network actually make it more secure those things are not obviously true in a lot of these other smart contract chains and so when i'm talking about decentralized finance i'm talking about the full gamut of of technological tools that we can use for decentralization that includes things like the centralized identity that we're talking about which by the way is not just about like identity like it also creates new avenues for decentralized service discovery and things like that but there's also other avenues for decentralization there's there's technologies like ipfs which is also not based on a blockchain and i think that this is like kind of the message that myself and others have been trying to like really like push the conversation in is saying that like blockchain is not the best decentralization tool in all cases i think we all agree that decentralization is good that we want to see decentralization of services decentralization of finance decentralization of governance these are all good things but i think that a lot of this industry is lost in the wilderness trying to basically shove everything into these layer one smart contract chains and i don't think that it's that it's the technology that's the best fit for the job in many of these cases and i think that's the conversation that i've been trying to have and i feel like people talk past each other here okay yeah and then and then they can say well how are you going to do all these things in the bitcoin blockchain well i'm not i'm not i'm not going to do those things on the bitcoin bucket i'm going to do them in different ways using tools that are better fit for purpose right no that makes sense i mean even people who work on things in ethereum they definitely also say not everything needs to go on chain um but so since you're actually discussing all this i definitely wanted to ask you about how tara recently decided to back its decentralized stablecoin ust partially with bitcoin and the creator or the co-founder of terraform labs do quan was recently on my podcast and he was talking about how this will create a layer two on bitcoin or a d5 ecosystem on bitcoin and i was wondering what you thought about that i don't have the many developed thoughts on ontario i'm going to take a mental note to dig in a little bit deeper i've been very heads down on what what i'm working on whatever did you hear about how they're buying three billion dollars worth of bitcoin for now and want to raise that up to 10 billion eventually to back their snipple coin i have not been able to help but notice in my twitter timeline celebrating tara's regular purchases of bitcoin look i i i believe that that yes i believe in layer two solutions like i'm a big i'm a big supporter of lightning um i don't think it is the only layer two solution i mean the reality is is that like exchanges themselves are arguably layer two solutions i don't think they're good ones i think we're trying to disrupt that that centralized model with tv decks but but yeah like yeah of course i mean i think yes like in order for the decentralized financial economy to emerge we're going to have to create like higher levels of abstraction to to deal with a whole modicum of of problems that moving to a new system of money presents and but would you view what tara is doing as competitive or complementary to what you're doing i i think that what we're doing with tv decks is pretty universally complementary to the entire ecosystem right now i mean i view our strategy as like a rising tide lifts all boats so you know the thing you know i've said this before like if my our if our biggest competitors in the world and we've talked to some of them by the way um want to come and work with us on this and they want to use it and they want to provision liquidity and they want to build competitive products and services on it i have said very consistently that we will work with them that like we're we're working in the open and right now our model is is to basically uplift the ecosystem and and increase the viability of that ecosystem and so i don't seek to like stake out sort of like some sort of like unfair competitive edge so i i view i view us i view us as like working purely in the interests of the entire ecosystem which yes we believe we'll benefit from that we'll be able to you know to build products and services that people will will pay for to support these systems um and our competitors may very well do the same they may try to compete with those services maybe maybe they'll be better than us so i i welcome all competition i i also if if somebody thinks that they have a a better idea um for accomplishing this the problem that we're trying to solve i certainly welcome their their feedback or their efforts competition is good and then earlier when we were talking about how um you don't feel that a blockchain is necessary for decentralizing things in general i think the reason that a lot of these other chains are using blockchain technology in their networks is because as i'm sure you're very well aware they will launch their own token and then the users of that protocol kind of feel this sense of ownership or alignment with that protocol and frankly oftentimes then get some share in the governance for that reason but that ends up becoming an incentive to those users and kind of brings those users into those that ecosystem so you don't feel that that would be a method that um tb dex would use to attract users or liquidity um i mean you know famous or not i don't know if this is famously but i did notice in some of the writing about tb dex you said that you would not be releasing a governance token which is again another way that these protocols will often decentralize so you know what what are your thoughts on kind of the usage of tokens to incentivize and attract users well i mean we will not create a governance token it's also important to note that our protocol is a decentralized messaging framework that is ultimately doing like service discovery through the did mechanism so we like i i would going back to my attempt to disentangle the conversation between decentralization and blockchain i mean tvx is a decentralized technology that is not based on blockchain um and and that is that is a very deliberate decision that we've made because we don't think that we think of blockchain would make our technology more expensive we think that um needlessly so actually uh we don't see any need to like burn you know these these transactions that were that were mediating or the information that informs the the the settlement of those transactions into a blockchain uh for eternity and to pay for block space and store data and storage on that network to do it we think that's the thing that's a really really bad unit economic model and you know we when we and we think actually like undermines the ability of a network like this to ultimately become even cheaper than the existing mainstream options for international remittance and settlement so we very deliberately have sought to build a decentralized protocol that does not rely on a tokenized like a governance token on a smart contract chain i mean that like that like like very not not as like i i don't i don't not as some sort of like flippant rejection of it but like we don't think that that that those technologies are fit to purpose here so we we've designed this and i mean a governance token wouldn't make any sense right like it wouldn't provide any security to our network it would only make it more expensive to use it i mean as currently designed our network our protocols should be as free to use as the web protocols we're using to have this conversation today and so earlier in the conversation you also mentioned that stable coins will also be a major focus are there any particular stable coins that you feel you would be more likely to use or are you thinking about launching one we have publicly announced in conjunction with coinbase and circle a few weeks ago that we that we will be working with them um on usdc and so usdc will will be one of the first stable coins that we invest in supporting so that that is public information so i can i can repeat that here we are since we do want to be very internationally focused we are evaluating uh stablecoin options for other non um us currencies around the world but i have nothing that i can speak to on that firmly right now okay the last question is that the homepage of spyral says bitcoin is the best money it should be used like it and i get this question from normies all the time they don't believe bitcoin can be a currency or you know i i would even say that uh in the bitcoin world itself a lot of people will talk about it being digital gold which obviously um you know nobody uses gold really as currency um so what do you say to people who think that bitcoin cannot be a good currency or that it will not be used as a currency i i got this along i mean look i mean i think it's going to be about like showing and not telling and i would say like check back in 10 years and i have a strong belief that the incentive structures that that underline this technology and the emergence of technologies like lightning and i'm not trying to avoid the the you know vitalik's criticisms of of you know the the pagan and pagan structure of lightning earlier i don't think i i have much time to to dissect that but like i the i believe in in layer two is as sort of the the main way to do payment i believe that like i i believe long term the incentives towards adoption are well in bitcoin's favor particularly even more so i i i think a lot of us can be very us centric but i look at countries around the world like i look at like argentina and venezuela i look at africa where like el salvador obviously where bitcoin and lightning payments are actually seeing real mainstream use cases like a bull worked against you know runaway inflation like oppressive control you know over over money and banking um and commerce and i believe that the proving grounds of this technology are not even here in the united states right like i think i think these technologies are being proven out like in real time in many developing countries around the world and i think it's inevitable that bitcoin is i i i don't i'm not going to i actually am not going to make the argument that like bitcoin will will be the only currency in the future um i'm not i i know a lot of people believe that i i kind of am willing to um withhold judgment on that future but what i will say is i'm super confident that bitcoin is going to be an important part of people's daily life in five to ten years one way or the other all right well this has been super fun chatting where can people learn more about you and tbd you can uh follow us on our tbd twitter uh account where we uh are always like giving updates on what we're doing sometimes it's uh we are a little bit lighthearted there and joke around a little bit um and also uh we we i we don't have our official website launched yet but what i will say is that we are uh racing uh to get that set up we have a team that's that's working really really hard to get our website put together where we're gonna actually be able to bring together all these things that we're currently working on um so look out for that and we will definitely be announcing that on our on our twitter feed so i was i was here twitter account's probably the best place to follow us right now perfect all right well thank you so much for coming on unchained thank you laura this is fun thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about mike block and tbd check out the show notes for this episode unchained is produced by me laura
