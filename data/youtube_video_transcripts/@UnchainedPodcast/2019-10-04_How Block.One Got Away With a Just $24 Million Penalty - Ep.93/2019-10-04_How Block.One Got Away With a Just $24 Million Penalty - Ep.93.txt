principal at Blakemore Fallon welcome Zach hi Laura thanks for having me you've been on the show before but for those of you for those who don't remember you are a former SEC staffer and the author of the regs a Jobs Act crowdfunding roles and this week the crypto world was I don't think incredulous is overstating it that block one got away with a four billion dollar year-long ICO that advertised itself in Time Square and they paid a mere twenty four million dollars to the SEC for it and didn't even need to register us tokens as a security which is pretty different from the outcome for some other coin issuers such as Paragon and arefox which also held icos so why do you think that was the outcome in this case sure so we take a step back the block one the SE C's order against block one was limited to the ERC 20 token that it sold as part of the ICO and and not related to the EOS maintenance and so I think there's a distinction here that that's important because the yes they raised a lot of money in what was purported to be or perhaps intended to be an overseas offering for which Regulation S was unavailable ultimately they violated the securities laws with respect to that offering of the ERC 20 token and the SE C's order is sort of cabined to that to that issue alone doesn't really address the issuance of EOS main net token and so since it doesn't address that what do you think it means for cos like should we now be worried about the EOS tokens or do you mean or do you think that that means that likely the SEC will not pursue anything against the EOS tokens I think it's hard to say I mean you know you can read whatever you want into the silence I suspect right and you know I see a lot of people out there suspecting that that means cos has a pass I think that's a bit of an aggressive posture I wouldn't necessarily view it that way I think the the SE C's order is really limited to the four corners of what it discusses and it doesn't to the extent it doesn't address it we shouldn't we shouldn't sort of read in what we you know outcomes we would like or things we would surmise to be the case so it's it it's I know it can be frustrating but we were kind of left with what the order says and and whatever else that doesn't say is is open for speculation all right yes and there was plenty of speculation which will actually get to you a little bit more in a moment but first I also wanted to ask about this waiver that block ones legal firm coolly requested for a block one um what was the waiver for and what will having that waiver enable block one to do in the future sure so you know settlements generally like the one that block one entered into our highly negotiated there's no reason to expect that block one was any different right now this was probably a process involved not only these the staff of the division of enforcement related to the offering I'm sorry the order side of things but also the division of corporation finance with respect to the waiver side of things and and what the waiver what the waiver addresses is the the potentiality that block 1 could be disqualified from the ability to rely on exemptions from registration that companies typically rely on when raising company raising capital privately like Regulation D or regulation a and the reason for that is that regulation a has historically had a disqualification provision in after the adoption of the dodd-frank act those those disqualification provisions or some or ones like them were added to Regulation D and so both regulation a and Regulation D have bad actor disqualification provisions which prevent companies and certain parties like directors who are subject to commission orders a cease and desist order as an example like the one that block 1 was entered was entered in against block 1 prevents them from from being able to rely on those exemptions on a going-forward basis and as you can imagine without capital companies died particularly startups block 1 is an interesting case because it's not like they were starved for capital or you know they shouldn't be right with a four billion dollar raise but the waiver process is really not one based so much on the capital needs of the company but rather based on the regulatory requirements specified in the rules and and here the requirement is that block 1 had made a showing of good cause that it wasn't necessary under the circumstances to for those exemptions to be denied you can read as you said you can read the the good cause arguments and Cooley's waiver application and you can see what what case they made for why they are demonstrating good cause I think part of it is this ongoing this ongoing engagement with the staff to the extent that they issue or distribute digital assets going forward so that there is a multi-factor analysis but that sort of waiver process happens with the division of corporation finance they have delegated authority to issue waivers the Commission of course can issue that as well but the the order itself the substantive cease and desist order typically lies within for the division of enforcement and those two things kind of because you're negotiating a package settlement they work hand in hand and so the reason you may have a the the sediment on the cease-and-desist side and the factors and limitations that are applied to that kind of work in tandem with the waiver side so that the parties at the end of the day get together and agree that okay we you know this is this is this this is our settlement proposal and part and parcel that would be that we can continue to raise money going forward if we need to you know there's not necessarily fraud here so and as I said they demonstrated with good cause as is described in the letter and they got the waiver as a result yeah Catherine we've released one of her famous annotated versions of the letter and I don't remember her comments but you know she did say things about how her jaw was on the floor and stuff and when I read the letter I viewed it as one big way of saying like the adults are in the room now because it kind of went into detail on you know the different new positions that had been filled in the background of those people well one other thing though is just when you talked about how you know it's not clear really what this means for Yoos tokens and stuff like that i did see one person on crypto twitter jake servants key a lawyer at compound finance who previously was a securities lawyer he said that he does not typically see where there's like two different actions against the same issuer at different times that if they were to have acted against us he thinks that what they would have done at the same time any I mean he did admit it was speculation but do you agree that that is less common well I would say that the question of who is the issuer is an important one because block one was clearly the issuer of the RC 20 token whether or not block one was the issuer of the EOS main that token is a different question and I think that you know at least as I understand the way that network was launched and the EOS main net was launched is that it wasn't necessarily the same parties and so I think there the question of who is the issuer and what were they issuing that's the very nose or obviously the questions and I think with respect to the token that the issue 20 token that block one issued you see the action you see the order you see the results I don't see any order or anything that addresses the the issuance of the EOS main net token and how that came into existence and the implications for whatever parties issued that no I'm not saying that there there will be implications just that that there's the potential here for a different issuer issuing something something different and we know whether or not and how block one impacts that analysis of EOS or what people are expecting when they receive Dios and how they received it and their ongoing efforts of whomever they are expecting to rely on that those are important considerations those are the considerations you would at a staff level and is that any securities lawyer would have to sort of an at analyze in figuring out the the import of this as it relates to us and for kick which obviously is another company that issued a cryptocurrency it via and ICO and eventually was sued by the SEC they closed their app last week what they apparently will continue development on the Kin token so wouldn't what you see is the overall significance of these two outcomes together you know kick on the one hand and block one on the other well I mean the block one one I suspect has been has been probably brewing for a while and so I think this is just I think it's a you know this is an accident of history and timing and the fact that kik announced what they did last week and this came out this week and in addition to the the nebulous settlement so it's it's hard it's hard to say I mean I I do think generally what we're trending towards right is the is that the issuance the issuances of digital assets in initial coin offerings that predated last year are or problem under the securities laws and there's going to be a continued remediation that needs to happen to the market in order to sort of get this right on a going-forward basis it's unfortunate what happened to to kick if they had to close the app as I understand it but that's sort of the nature of the nature of entering the space and trying to operate within the space and with you know what that's fraught with with risk and uncertainty so we're gonna discuss the nebulous settlement in a moment but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible will the world follow France and advocate banning privacy coins will government backed stable coins become the new Fiat are distributed and peer to peer exchanges just a flash in the pan the answer is maybe virtual

Fallon so as you mentioned there was this other SEC announcement about nebulous what happened there well nebulus offered and sold securities back in 2014 and 2015 in violation of the securities laws I don't think that that's really disputed as far as as far as an out as what happened they clearly offered at a time and didn't appreciate the importance of these laws and this was this was early relatively early on in the space so not surprising that there was a section 5 violation there since that time they've they've engaged council and conducted compliant offerings going forward of those same securities so I think what you have there is just really a traditional violative sale of securities and the settlement reflects that and and on a going-forward basis they similar to block 1 will engage with staff before they issue any more digital assets to the extent they want to continue to rely on on the waiver that was issued at the same time as as the settlement the cease and desist order was issued and so nebulous obviously now has the sia coins that are trading and they did release a blog post that essentially said that the SEC did kind of like thoroughly vet what was going on with the sia coins but then they didn't ultimately take any action on that it's sort of stopped short of saying like the SIA coins are in the clear but I was curious to know kind of how you took you know the fact that they the side coins themselves weren't part of the action yeah and I think this is kind of relates back to the block 1 in that you we we shouldn't read into the silence or that the lack of discussion I take Jake's point and it's a good one but the fact that the signs are not discussed at all is is a glaring in some ways a glaring omission given what people understand to be that network and how it operates so a glaring omission like that I don't know you can read that either way I suppose they want the one thing I think I know one thing I did notice in the sediment order is that it mentions specifically that nebulous did not intend for SIA stock SIA notes or SIA funds to me being mediums of exchange on the side Network now whether not that you can read that to suggest that it meant for the SIA coins to be mediums of exchange and they're fine again you'd have to read that sentence then because it's not there but I think the that that sort of indicates to a certain extent to the staffs position as to with respect to those three stock notes and funds not being meetings of exchange so going forward if you were to be you know working on a project that you think could use a token and you were to think of how you might release it to the crowd knowing what you know now about the various actions s you see has taken how would you do it well I mean I think I think the developers of digital assets have a lot more tools at their disposal than they than they've ever had right they had more tools today than they had four or five years ago in that they have additional token standards that have been developed that address potential Security's loss concerns of fungibility or trade ability aftermarket trade ability the ability to bake in restrictions one of the things that that block one tripped up on was that you know at least according to the FCC's order was that they were the tokens were immediately tradable in the u.s. in the aftermarket now you can you can build in bells and whistles to on a technical level that prevent those types of things based on token standards are based on your own based on your own implementation of an asset and so I think developers of digital assets have a lot more tools at their disposal that they need to use to avoid some of these concerns you don't need to just issue er C 20 tokens all the time those are the ones that that a lot of these orders are based off of and for you know not necessarily without good reason from a securities law standpoint because by the way they can fly around in the aftermarket and the easily the way they can be easily integrated in digital asset trading platforms so I think that that what you'd want to do if you're developing digital assets going forward is to really think about the tools that you have available from a technical side to avoid some of these concerns and then there's the obvious concerns of how he test right you don't want to be promoting aftermarket trade ability you don't be promoting the potential for the asset you're selling to appreciate in value and certainly not on your efforts so there's the general things that you can avoid which which aren't shocking to anyone who's been in the space but as I said I think I think people have a lot more tools than they realize I know and often times when I speak to technical developers they say oh but you know we can't do that and and I'm just you know it kind of reminds me of a teacher I had in high school who says you know who used to say that a camp means won't and and I think this there's some times that there's the ability of people to do things and they just don't want to do them oftentimes it's because of these financial incentives the financial incentives really really screwed up the market in some level because it created this moral hazard that is hard to this was really hard to avoid and I think as a developer you can you can avoid those now by just by with the discipline that comes from appreciating these types of actions yeah well so while all this has been going on obviously the last time you and I spoke it was because of blogstock going the route of doing an ICO via a reggae plus offering and essentially what that means is that the Stax tokens that they sold are going to be securities for the foreseeable future side note the amount that they raised is less than the penalty that block one is going to pay but anyway so minobii n-- what happened with kick you know being sued by the sec block one getting off with this settlement and nebulous as well and then block stack now going this route do you feel like there are still gray areas that remain in how securities laws will apply to token issuance in the US or do you feel like this sort of covers things and people should have a good sense of what to do going forward I think the SEC has been largely judicious and effective in delivering the message it needed to deliver to the market to appreciate what the implications are of issuing digital assets you'll probably see more cease and desist orders coming out and you'll probably see more companies going the reggae route like blog stack and so I think they're you know the outstanding questions are really how how can a token that is issued you know can basically some people say morph into something that is is no longer maybe start as a security but but eventually over time no longer be considered a security and that is sort of the outstanding question for me that's a really interesting question intellectually and I think there you know because it implicates not just the law but also the technology and so there's some there's some really interesting questions there I think as long as people appreciate the risks here and build with securities laws in mind then I think they'll largely be fine because there are ways to avoid it there's nothing wrong with avoiding the securities laws you are complying with the securities laws you're not not complying with the securities laws if you avoid that right so there's nothing wrong with that but to the extent that what you're doing implicates the securities laws appreciating how to navigate them it's just is just key and fundamental responsibilities of any one building in the space so there are ways out of it and and there are ways if you're gonna do certain things you can't avoid it and so you just you need to be adult about it and appreciate the space you're in and what your it is you're trying to build and if you have to rejigger the network or it's incentive systems to get it right and get to a place that works for you as a company then so be it so one other a bit of news I wanted to ask you about was that this week we also saw a bunch of crypto exchanges including coinbase Krakens circle and Patrick's band together to form the crypto raiding council and a bunch of people in the crypto community were kind of derisive of this effort and said it presented a massive conflict of interest because the course exchanges have this incentive to list as many tokens as possible and therefore to give favorable ratings where a regulator might not and because you used to work at that as you see for so long I did wonder how you thought this would be taken by the SEC yeah I mean I think I might you know my gut reaction at the first summer heard it was a bit of this it's the fox guarding the hen house sort of thing but but but there are you know there certainly that's not just it right there's another side to this which is that you have to start somewhere and these to the extent that these platforms are getting together and trying to socialize internally and come to a better result internally amongst themselves so that they are there the standard deviation sort of is is not so great among them then I think that's a great thing there's nothing there should be nothing wrong with that I guess the question is why why publicize it why you know if you're gonna do that sort of thing that's great there's nothing there's absolutely nothing wrong with that and and having putting out puts out there with respect to your one two fives that can be scrutinized is also valuable because it starts the conversation so the communication aspect of this are the resocialize among I think is is these are good things but I think there are problems with it as well and you know typically you know we have nationally recognized statistical rating organizations the credit rating agencies that that are not the same people who are issuing products that are so rated for a reason right and I don't think that the council is really suggesting that I think they're just trying to get tools out there for discussion purposes but I think it you know they're obviously gonna get shot out about it because because of their there's place in the space and that's sort of their their own moral hazard here with with putting numbers out that that implicate the assets they're there they are themselves listing but so I'm kind of up to mines of it I mean I think somebody's got to start this conversation and so this scent they're doing that great but at the same time at the end of the day they you know I think a little more independence and separation if people are actually going to rely on these for any for any reason needs to happen I don't think they're the best people to sort of have people others relying on those ratings for any real purpose other than to for information yeah I really was reminded of the financial crisis the role that the ratings agencies played and how essentially in a way those frankly ended up being meaningless but we'll see how this plays out it may not be the case here well thanks so much for coming on the show
