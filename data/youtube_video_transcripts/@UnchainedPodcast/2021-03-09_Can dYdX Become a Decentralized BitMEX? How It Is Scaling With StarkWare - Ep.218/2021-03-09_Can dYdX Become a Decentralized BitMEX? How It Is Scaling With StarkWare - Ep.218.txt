the board at starkware welcome antonio anneli ellie thanks for having us excited to be here antonio you and ellie partner to launch cross margined perpetuals which went live at the end of february explain to us what cross-merchant perpetuals are why you chose that as your project to scale and why you chose starkwear yes absolutely so perpetuals are a type of synthetic product that's really popular in the crypto space so not a lot of people know this but perpetuals by volume are the most popular type of trading instruments on all of crypto basically the volume for perpetuals is more than all of the volume for all the other products including just base spot trading on crypto combined so it's a really big market but kind of i think we're one of the first in d5 to really get into this market so we think it's going to be really big the reason why we're so excited about it long term is normally in kind of the traditional financial markets you see the derivatives or synthetics volume being about 5 to 10 x higher than kind of the base spot volume one interesting thing that happened in crypto just in the past year is for the first time the derivatives volume on crypto surpassed like i said all the other volume in crypto combined and it's well on its way to kind of reaching we think that five to 10x the volume mark of the entire rest of the market combined so it's a huge market we're really excited about it um and the the main reason yeah and that's the main reason that we're excited about launching this product um more specifically what perpetuals are is like i said they're a type of synthetic product all synthetic means is that when you're trading these types of products the actual currencies that you're trading don't actually exist in the contract so for example if you're trading a bitcoin perpetual there's no actual bitcoin being custodied and there's no actual bitcoin under the hood we just kind of come up with this synthetic contract and it tracks the price of bitcoin and the reason these are so popular is that they can be traded with leverage leverage basically just means that you can multiply your gains and your losses and trade as if you had a lot more capital so it's much more capital efficient to trade on these types of products and that's why they're so popular all across margin means is it's a bit of a technical term but it basically means that you can have one account or one pool of collateral that collateralizes any different type of market that you might want to trade on so as compared to isolated margin which is what we had on our layer one or kind of our original product that means that for every different type of product that you want to trade so say you want to trade both an ethereum perpetual and a bitcoin perpetual you have to put down collateral into two separate accounts so it's not nearly as capital efficient whereas because of the scalability that starkware is now able to provide we're really able to offer cross-margining and that's really important product feature that we're excited to launch to our users yeah that seems like a no-brainer if that technology enables you to do the cross-margin because i could imagine as a user it would be very frustrating if you wanted to trade multiple assets and had to collateralize each and so why did you choose darkware yeah absolutely so we did a lot of research on this about six months ago right before we started working with starkware and the main things we were uh considering were obviously starkware and kind of by extension zero knowledge rollups and ellie can talk a lot more about that we also considered optimistic roll-ups and specifically optimism and then the third kind of thing we also considered was other layer one blockchains so things like solana or near and the reason we chose starkware was for a couple different reasons so first of all the level of scalability that they're able to provide is really really high so i won't touch on this too much because obviously ellie can dive a lot more into it than i can but basically the way it works is you take just an arbitrarily long list of in our case trades and through zero knowledge proofs um or stark proofs you can basically transform them down into a constant sized data object and then so it basically doesn't matter how many trades you have you just transform it into this constant size thing put that on the blockchain and that's where all the scalability comes from so the main uh requisite thing that we're obviously looking for is a really high level of scalability and this isn't exactly rocket science but right now uh for anybody that's used d5 just the fees and the gas views on ethereum specifically are obscenely high and currently it's costing about 100 to sometimes up to literally a thousand dollars per trade in gas fees to execute a trade on layer one on ethereum and this was just obviously something that we had to solve as soon as possible and kind of the second main points what was exactly that the as soon as possible and starkware already has is kind of one of the very few scaling technologies that already had a really good history of building quality products in production we're not the first exchange or decentralized exchange to launch with starkware um they're also launched with another decentralized exchange called diversify and they've been running uh you know successfully in production at that point whereas a lot of these other kind of like optimistic roll-ups and other l1's are very much unproven so it was really important to us and it was a really big selling point that it was already live it was already working in production we solved all the architecture problems and we knew how to do it and kind of the last and which is kind of like the last point which is a bit more subtle um is something called like withdrawal times um so for anybody that's kind of familiar with optimistic rollups one of the drawbacks is that you actually can't withdraw from optimistic rollups for you know it depends on the configuration but oftentimes like up to a week whereas for starkwear with their stark blocks um you have basically instant finality once the block is mined on layer one and that's really important because you know for us like who's going to use an exchange where you can't actually withdraw for a week yes there are certainly ways to get around this by kind of you can have like liquidity providers front fast withdrawals which we're actually also doing on starkwear so that means you can have instant you don't even need to wait for the the stark batches to be confirmed to the blockchain to get withdraws um but if you're thinking about becoming a liquidity provider and happy to talk more about this in detail but the thing that you need to think about is like what the withdrawal period is because suppose you're a fast withdrawal provider for optimism or you know by extension any optimistic roll-up protocol you basically have to have enough capital to cover like an entire week's worth of withdrawals for the system which even for us as kind of like you know a relatively smaller exchange compared to centralized exchanges is like millions and millions and millions of dollars to the point where it's just like totally financially unfeasible um whereas for us because the the stock we're blocks are mined roughly like once every hour or so we only need to have like a smaller amount of capital to front withdrawals in the system and then the last thing i'll say is compared with uh just kind of other layer one chains uh starkware and the system we're building on top of starkware settles back on ethereum so it has basically exactly the same security properties exactly the same decentralization properties as ethereum does which is really important to us and even more important it works with all the ethereum wallets and this is just absolutely critical from a user experience perspective if you're a decentralized app and you want to get users you have to support the wallets that people are using and because we're just settling back on ethereum we can use exactly the same wallets that all of our users are used to using and just continue to provide what we think is a really top-class product experience on d5 to them and ellie so i know antonio described briefly how um the starkware solution works but why don't you dive a little deeper into these zk roll ups and also maybe contrast it with optimistic roll-ups which he mentioned and that is another popular uh layer two solution that a lot of d5 projects are trying out right so the the basic um problem that all rollups try to solve is the problem of this limited resource which is the uh you know block or the block space on on a blockchain in the case of ethereum you only have 12 and a half million gas to allocate among all the competing um transactions every in every block uh every 15 seconds or so and because there's a lot of demand these days for for this resource there's the you know prices are shooting up okay so the way that roll-ups work or all scalability solutions l2 scalability solutions work is that they sort of take a lot of this computation and data and everything that costs so much and takes it off chain and um so you it's it's a little bit like an iceberg where you put the tip um on l1 which is ethereum and and you use ethereum to sort of verify or do the minimal kind of stuff that needs to be done to make sure everything's safe and then all the the rest is taken off chain so like an iceberg where you only see on chain the tip okay now this is the idea of of all l2 scalability solutions that we're aware of now roll-ups are a particular version of scalability solutions that have added security it's sort of a trade-off what they say is we need all of the information for each and every user to know exactly the state of her account at any given point in time we need that information that raw data to appear constantly on l1 right we don't want any of this data to sit with some data availability solution um which is another option so so this is a trade-off you get the security of l1 for your data the downside is that there's a linear amount of basically more transactions means more data on l1 but but it's a trade-off um we at starkware support both options of this data availability um situation so dydx chose to go with the rollup mode which means that all of the data sits on l1 diversify for instance chose to work with offloading the data to a data availability committee that is also very secure and operates in a different way and so so these are two types of trade-offs there's even a third type where you can let the users decide whether they want to pay extra for having their data on chain or whether they're willing to they want to save costs but but uh you know rely on this uh l2 data solution we call this a volition and we're also going to support that with some of our customers in any case that's what rollups allow you now within rollups there are two main ways to deal with security one branch is called validity proofs which stark where in starks are one of these uh ways which basically means whenever you move the state whenever you change this tip of the iceberg to something new because you're updating the state of your system it must be accompanied by a cryptographic proof in our case those are starks that are very lean and short and cheap to verify exponentially uh cheaper than the amount of computation that is uh you know that leads to this change uh on on chain and you cannot move the state without a validity proof and this ensures that you will never have uh any movement to a state that is not valid and does not have integrity okay so this is one way to deal with it and that's these validity proofs and the cryptographic assurances they give allow you to have the instant finality that antonio was talking about and that the dydx customers are going to benefit from the other kind of solutions are game theoretic fraud proof based solutions optimistic roll-ups which say something like this anyone can move the state of the system to any new state right including to a fraudulent or invalid state and then there's going to be a period during which you know parties uh can can sort of raise a flag and there's gonna be some um process by which you sort of sort out whether the state of the system is invalid or is valid and there's a certain game going on that has a bunch of interactions between two parties one is saying no this was fraudulent the other party's saying no this was good you have to wait a little bit and allow this thing to sort of peter out and this is what causes this capital inefficiency that comes from you know funds need to be locked for a long enough time in order to make sure that no one raises a flag and if flag is raised uh you know to sort out what happened so those are the optimistic roll-ups so just to summarize again scalability solutions take a lot of uh the the load of computation off-chain roll-ups mean that all the data the raw data not the computation and not the storage still appears on l1 for added security but there's a trade-off you pay a little bit more and then within the two families of roll-ups you have validity proofs like uh starks that allow you instant finality and you have optimistic roll-ups that come with this finality period of roughly a week or so till you can remove your funds off as far as i understand just from the description it seems kind of obvious that it's better to have the instant finality and yet there are teams that are choosing optimistic roll-ups as far as i understand is that simply because the technology is maybe easier to implement now like it's further along is that what the case is i don't think that's the case i think that i think that our technology is further along you know we have more projects that are launched or ready to be launched with with our technology it's a okay one thing that is um offered by um some optimistic roll-ups projects is to say that um or or you know to describe it this way you basically take all of your existing solidity code you press a button and it automatically works just as previously now i'm not entirely sure that actually is the case but this is a very tempting proposition that causes a lot of projects to say okay we want to press that button and have it automatically uh working so i think a lot of projects are definitely saying we want to wait to see that happen now it hasn't happened yet for any meaningful project uh you know we we have to wait and see so so i think they're saying we are willing to take you know bite the bullet of the uh capital inefficiency and the uh you know the the extra sort of security issues with with having these fraud proofs you know the ability to attack them and delay the system and whatnot because we are tempted by this um you know proposition that we won't have to modify our code significantly you know i'm biased of course but i think antonio and dydx made the right choice of going with a better solution in terms of capital efficiency you know we started working with them roughly six months ago and it's you know already on main it so i think this sort of you know practically shows that this is i think a better route and we hope other teams are gonna you know go down this route as well yeah definitely when i realized the timeline timeline on that i did think that that was a pretty quick how you guys roll this out and uh before i forget because i've now forgot multiple times i wanted to mention that diversify who we've mentioned a few times is a previous sponsor of my shows um and so then in terms of scalability how many transactions per second are you now able to process versus you know what it was before so um i i prefer to talk about things that we actually demonstrated live on on mainnet rather than you know various uh i mean there are a lot of numbers floating out there for things that theoretically could be done or you know on so on mainnet we for reddit bake off we demonstrated a single proof that settled 300 000 transactions and it was in roll-up mode meaning that all the data was on chain and the effective tps for this and this was on main at ethereum this was a few months ago before we were uh working with dydx this was a tps of 3 000. with diversify we you know we have demonstrated the ability to reach the trades of 9000 tps and and for payments we can go to 18 000 tps with dydx you know the system is just now being ramped up and we'll be very proud to announce uh the uh you know effective rates that we get once we once we actually demonstrated them but uh you know we can go uh uh we can support uh well i mean you know we saw this tweet that there are more than 80 000 people waiting to join the um you know the dydx system once it launches so of course this causes you know we're up for the task but it sort of causes you some you know some sort of uh you know some angst uh you know hoping that everything will function properly but we will report uh in in in a small number of weeks the actual numbers that that you'll see on mainnet live i can just see it now i'm going to have to like run an update and be like by the way they you know tout out all these numbers and it no i'm just kidding all right um so for the uh perpetuals products some of the features are that traders can now trade with zero cash gas costs and so how are you making that possible is just is um dydx just paying for them because it's like a such a small amount compared to what it was before pretty much yeah um obviously because it's a roll up and settles on layer one ethereum there's still our gas costs and and we're basically paying for like every time a stark batch it's called or like a stark block um is committed to mainnet uh we're paying for that but it's really not that much and that's kind of where all the scalability features that ellie was talking about just really come into play where it's just costing us you know however many x less than it was before um it's gotten kind of get down to the points where we're really able to charge fees that are much more in line with what traders are used to paying on centralized exchanges um so even like fees on centralized exchanges and crypto are like fairly high right like they're kind of like even like 20 bips is like a lot higher um and that's kind of what you'll experience on like an ftx or binance than what you'll see in traditional finance so that's like the the revenue that you make in fees is more than enough uh to cover in this new case like what we would have to pay on gas so we're like i said just aiming to charge fees that are really in line with what other exchanges charge and no longer will the fees have to be deterministic or kind of dynamic based off the current gas price environments on ethereum very interesting and so in working together i mean like i said i it is impressive that you managed to roll this out in six months but i'm still wondering you know everyone in deep fight in particular is looking at different scaling solutions that is really deemed to be probably the main issue right now so i was wondering what lessons you guys you feel you learned in working together um especially for d phi in general or other d5 protocols that are interested in scaling yeah maybe i can start um i think the first thing is kind of what ellie touched on before which is that for my opinion for a good technical team it actually doesn't really matter that much what language your smart contracts are written in um like we're happy to port our smart contracts to like rust or solidity or you know soon to come out like cairo which is starkware's new programming language that they're coming out with um for their stark roll-ups which i can talk a lot more about um so i think the first lesson was that it's really not that big of a deal if you're a good technical team to move to a new coding language and i think people just put like way too much weight on that in terms of making things backwards compatible yeah i'd say that maybe one like second learning that we had is that basically for for the like current contracts that we have starkware wrote them like they wrote them in kind of their uh their own cairo language uh and one of the things that they're working on which i'm really excited about is what i just mentioned before is their cairo programming language which will allow third-party developers to come in and write their own contracts so i think that'll even be like a really big step up um from the the build process that we had because of course whenever two different companies are working together it's just a little bit harder to have like coordination across the two teams like for example like starcrow was writing all the contracts and we gave them like pretty detailed specs but of course there's like some back and forth on various edge cases for those contracts and just making sure be able to have all the kinks ironed out and have it exactly the way we want um if like later we're able to come out and our developers are able to just code in cairo directly and have that run directly through starkware like i promise you we could get the build times down like to like three or four months or like even less so that's something i'm excited about uh looking forward into the future as well yeah so uh on on our part the first thing i just want to say is uh you know it was it was and still is such a pleasure working with uh such a professional team uh as the counter parties on on this it's like uh you know we so we learned a lot about uh first of all the the the business and the business logic that is needed in these cases and this of course helped us and will help future customers and players that that want to build uh you know on top of this and and and extend the capabilities of starks and cairo the second thing that was really important for us here was antonio mentioned this cairo is a programming language which allows you to express in in in a way that programmers uh you know express themselves any computation in any business logic that you want to scale and and i want to emphasize this because probably not all of your your listeners are aware that when you come to zkp technologies one of the hardest parts is taking the computation the high level computation that you have in mind and then converting it to these very intricate mathematical objects that are really really hard to deal with various things like polynomials or finite fields and so on and and what cairo achieves is is a very clean abstraction of all of that and it sort of allows you to just write your business logic in a very clean way and this uh partnership was for us yet another you know test case for the agility and the feature velocity of cairo and of course along the way we we we're constantly improving it and the whole framework that it builds on and all of this is really important for us um because as we already announced and this also ties to what antonio said our plan is to allow teams like dydx and of course anyone who wants to permissionlessly write their own contracts um and then deploy them on an l2 to reach arbitrary scale we call this starknet and it will be launched later this year and basically it will be an l2 in which you can deploy your logic um so um each further iteration where we work with teams especially such a professional team as dydx you know we sort of uh hone and make the tooling much better so that when we release it uh to uh to the public it's gonna be much more ripe i just wanna mention that when they say releasing it to the public it's not something that is in the future it's actually something that happened in the past so um and everyone's invited to go to cairolang.org cairo dashland.org and basically download cairo start programming and send proofs right now to a service uh that is on robsten it's called sharp basically shared proving so you can have several different applications sending their proofs all to be combined into one single uh proof that goes on chain and is verified for all of them and then you can amortize gas cost a little bit better so cairo and the same programming tools that we used in order to build the system our part of the system with dydx these tools are already available for everyone to use uh with a lot of tutorials and uh so we're very excited about that and uh you know much more is going to come down there and so just so i'm understanding this idea of a stark net it's almost like a new kind of ethereum in the sense that you know it has its own programming language it's turn complete and so now people can use that programming language to create d5 programs that uh use zk roll ups and so are inherently kind of like scaled from the get-go and and maybe even then uh also have that feature of composability that layer one d5 protocols have on ethereum is that correct yes lara it's exactly that we think of it as a just like ethereum and being turing complete it does not have the gas limit of ethereum that's the whole point it's an l2 in terms of security it gets its security its security is as safe as that of l1 ethereum um and is going to rely in a lot of aspects on on l1 for various aspects of sequencing allowing users to uh you know send commands to this l2 to extract their funds if they need and you will have composability you can have permissionless i mean you will have permissionless deployment of smart contracts it will be transactions uh again permissionless any user can submit it you'll have decentralized operators provers uh and uh yes that's that's our vision yes well that sounds really fascinating because um so my next set of questions is uh about dydx and perpetuals and kind of diving more into that but why don't we just jump to one of them right now because i was going to ask um antonio about the fact that obviously these d5 protocols do benefit from composability on layer one i think it's slightly less of an issue for dydx but antonio can you just tell me how you have been thinking about that and um you know how that factored into your decision to go with uh starkware and ck rollups yeah so it definitely is a factor first of all um but i think you touched on it and i think for us and specifically for derivatives or synthetics it's actually in my opinion much less of an issue than it is for different spot trading uh protocols like for example like let's suppose like uniswap wanted to migrate to like any given layer two one of the things they would have to really think about is like well okay are there actual tokens that people want to trade on this layer too for us again we don't need that because we're just using synthetic contracts and all we need is one literally one token like basically just a collateral token to exist on this layer two and then synthetically we can create just any given asset that users might want to trade i'd say i also have kind of a counter culture view on this and especially as it comes to d5 but really our mo at dydx is to take a very full stack approach to building our products um so we you know we like to think that we do everything like everything down to building the smart contracts to building like the back end servers that run the order books and the matching engine uh to building the front end to eventually like building the apps that we're going to come out with um and honestly like we just think that we can build it like better than like other third-party teams would be able to for the most part um whereas a lot of other defy is you know has this ethos of composability and like this product is cool because it's like built on top of like 0x api which is like built on top of unit swap and curve and like all this stuff and that's awesome but that's just like for us specifically like not exactly the target that we're going for we really just want we have like a singular mission which is just making the best product um for advanced traders on cryptocurrency and we really think that we can offer that um in a really high quality way without too too much composability um just through perpetuals on layer two even right now and that's not to say that like there will never be composability for uidx like especially with a lot of the stuff like ellie was talking about with kind of moving just other contracts to the same basically like stark roll-up chain i think that's really awesome and we'll certainly unlock some things for us but uh just the when you think about the trade-off of like okay like you know a thousand x or whatever scalability versus like you know some composability it's like you know i will take a thousand extra like you know 1000x plus scalability right now over that any day all right in a moment we're going to talk more about the perpetuals product but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible with over 10 million users

and you'll get dedicated developer support dispute management and fraud detection start building your online payment form today visit square.com go slash unchained back to my conversation with antonio and ellie as you've noted perpetuals are some of the most popular trading products in crypto at least on centralized platforms and i wondered what benefit do users get from trading perpetuals on a decentralized exchange yeah absolutely so i think it's pretty similar to the benefits users would get from using any decentralized product so the first is just security it's a lot more secure to hold your own keys i'm certainly not the first one to say this but trading directly on a smart contract through your hardware wallet is just a lot more secure than trusting your keys to a centralized exchange and i actually have a lot of experience with this uh i used to work at coinbase as an engineer um and i was in engineer work one of the things i worked on there was their hot wallet service um so i'm really familiar with kind of the security level of centralized exchanges and one of the cool things is that even if you do a good job on security as a centralized exchange there's just so much overhead that goes into securing like that level of funds because now there's like a 90 billion dollar incentive or whatever to hack coinbase and you have to ask coinbase to spend resources proportional to that to secure your platform even if you're doing it the best way so like i say that's mean like for us as a decentralized exchange we can move a lot faster can offer like a lot more products um after we just like focused on securing the smart contracts um i'd say the second is transparency um so especially for more advanced financial products uh like synthetics and derivatives you're not only trusting your coins to the exchange you're also trusting the entire execution of the contracts that you're entering into to set exchange and are counting on that exchange to you know honor the contract exactly uh as it was written up so for things like you know bit max and fgx and not to pick on anyone i mean this is just like the way like technology works before blockchain um it's just like really a black box like how a lot of this stuff works on the centralized exchanges like you know when were people getting liquidated what were the index prices that caused these like liquidations to happen how much money is in the insurance fund like all these different things when is the insurance fund used um those are all kind of factor into it and on dydx of course because all the contracts are open source and transparent anybody can just go in audits we can look at our audit reports and just understand exactly the contract that they're entering into and then i'd say kind of the last thing and this is something we're going to be focusing on just more going into the future is access so we're not quite there yet in terms of dydx right now is what's known as a hybrid exchange so that basically means we have some decentralized components and then we also have some centralized components so the central components are kind of our portable our matching engine which basically we have running on our servers to just offer a much more performance level of trading to our traders but one of the things we're going to be focusing on going into the future is just decentralizing more parts of the stack and that'll allow us to just offer dydx to more people in more places of the world because again once we get closer to this vision that all of efi has where it's just open source code running on a permissionless blockchain uh anybody you know basically anybody anywhere in the world will have access to that code yeah and i was something that interested me was when i was looking at kind of the descriptions of dydax it sort of almost seemed to me like dydx was aiming to be almost like a uniswap of perpetuals maybe offering more like a long tail of a variety of perpetuals but then as i read more um i realized oh well since you're kind of using this closed order book based dev which then competes against these other derivatives exchanges that operate more like automated market makers um that are like uniswap i was like hmm so maybe i'm wrong because maybe those are the ones that are gonna um fill that spot so kind of what vision do you have of dydx yeah it's a great question i think the order book versus automated market maker question is certainly not just a consideration for dydx i think anybody operating at dex is thinking about that right now my opinion on this and this isn't a super original thought is kind of somewhere in the middle where i think that order book based models are vastly superior for trading kind of the top call it like 100 or 200 markets by volume we've seen various centralized exchanges be extremely successful working directly with market makers and you know ftx is a prime example of this it probably has the exchange that has the most different pairs and you're able to just offer like a really high amount of liquidity on those top markets i think automated market makers certainly do serve a purpose but in my opinion i think they're better for just trading like the long tail of assets and in my opinion like that was the the product market fit that unisoft found which i think is awesome um just people coming and trading like all these various tokens before they were listed on centralized exchanges or kind of that weren't even listed ever on centralized exchanges but they were listed on unit swap like the moment that they launched and that's a really powerful thing but for again for us specifically at dydx like our goal is to become one of the biggest crypto exchanges period but on a three to five year time horizon and we think kind of the combination of you know what i talked about at the beginning with derivatives becoming already being the biggest market and then just we think will become even more of a percent of the market and then obviously decentralized exchanges as well which are currently like i don't know five percent or so of the market um that are super new and we think will grow over the next three to five years um so if we're able to win that market of like derivatives plus d5 um we think that'll be really big but i'll conclude by just saying like i think specifically for derivatives where we see the real volume is not in the like 200 plus like markets by volume is really in those top like hundred markets and honestly really just in the top like five or so like the bitcoin perpetuals to a lesser extent like the eth perpetuals that are traded on centralized exchanges like literally just bitcoin perpetuals i think almost do more volume than literally everything else in crypto combined so it's like it's a real power law thing and it's like if you want to be the biggest exchange you have to be uh you have to serve like the this biggest market that's 10x bigger than all the other markets in the highest uh highest possible quality way and we think that's by order books just because order books are able to provide just a much higher level of liquidity given a certain amount of capital for the markets that they operate on and also because you're using perpetuals which as you mentioned are a type of synthetic the oracle that you're using becomes ultra important because that then becomes probably a main attack vector so how did you decide upon chain link as your oracle provider yeah absolutely so i think chain link almost the name sort of speaks for itself in d5 at this point just most of the uh like leading products or building on chain link or at least things that use technology that's like similar to chain link like dydx also actually operates on maker.oracles which are you know not exactly the same but kind of use similar technology to chainlink but we're really excited about partnering with chainlink and one of the really important things that we had to design with this layer too which was an open question and we designed this alongside starkware was how do we solve this oracle problem um like do we wanna like there's no oracles right now on layer two basically because nobody's on layer two right um so like how do we get these oracle prices on layer two and we thought about a lot of different things like potentially like building our own oracles that are specifically specific for l2 and we potentially could but we would have had to have sacrificed on security there um so the thing that we ended up on was just working directly with kind of the three of us like us starkware and chain link themselves actually did a good amount of work for this um was basically just putting the exact same oracle prices that they're already reporting on layer one but putting them on layer two and this is a really powerful thing because now we get the exact same level of security that everybody else in d5 is used to with kind of the deleting chain link oracles but we get it on layer 2 instead and it's actually even better than that because the whole point of layer 2 again is that it's just much more scalable and much faster so one of the really big problems we ran into on layer one with any oracle provider is not at all like limited to just chain link but the problem we faced was there was a lot of lag or like a lot of latency in the oracle prices especially when prices were moving fast which is the worst time to have lag in your price circles like every time this is a bit of a generalization but more or less like every time like the price would drop by like 10 it would take you know five to ten to sometimes fifteen minutes for that to be reflected um on the layer one oracles and this is a real problem if you're operating a leveraged exchange because your contracts don't know that they should liquidate people um and if the price keeps dropping the entire protocol could become under collateralized and this was the main thing that was holding us back from offering higher leverage so on our layer one product for our perpetuals we were only able to offer a 10x maximum leverage and it was exactly due to this problem of like the oracles are laggy basically um but now on layer two can take the same security like i said but we can reduce the latency can reduce the lag by a factor of like 10 to 20 x roughly um so now instead of having to wait minutes for these oracle prices to be reflected on our system we can do it in seconds um and that's kind of what centralized exchanges can do as well um because again they're not even using a chain but for us we can offer like a similar level of leverage starting out at 25 x potentially could raise that higher just you know starting out a little bit more conservative but even just this fact of now the oracle prices are much more performant allows us to offer a new feature on our product that's really important in higher leverage um higher leverage is actually super important for operating a leveraged crypto exchange as you might expect um binance recently released some statistics on their users usage of leverage and what kind of like multiple of leverage like all of their users use and i believe the most popular leverage was around 20x i can't remember the exact statistics but it was something like 30 or so use 20x um it was like some small percent like five to ten percent used there like crazy like 100 100x leverage um but if you're able to offer this kind of like 25x like maximum leverage that's just a huge step up in terms of like the quality of our product yeah yeah i could see um that appealing to people um in the crypto space and so um let's also dive a little bit more into um some of the starkwear things um like cairo in particular i wanted to ask a little bit more about because ellie i saw in some of the blog posts who was being described as one verifier to rule them all can you explain what that means yeah so uh that's a terrific question typically what happens is and this this is something i spoke about earlier you have a computation in mind and you want to use a zkp to scale it so this computation you have to somehow express it and convert it to some algebraic format that is very hard to deal with uh security securely and efficiently a bunch of polynomials or you know i can throw a whole bunch of math terms here at you that basically say the same thing some complicated algebraic problem sometimes has some number theory in it and then it's very complicated so whatever means you did for that you you would have to work very hard and really there was a limited amount of complexity that you could deal with and then you ended up with some system that is very specific for um for the problem at hand so for instance in zcash so i'm i'm i'm a founding scientist of zcash so there there's a very specific circuit that deals with uh you know shielded payments and it's crafted towards that in at starkware in our initial uh version one of uh diversify there was a specific set of uh you know the analog of a circuit a specific set of polynomial constraints that had to deal with that so it's a little bit like building an asic or some chip that that is you know one per computation now with cairo basically we have a a set of constraints or you know a set of this math object that is the zkp analog of a cpu so a cpu is one chip that can deal with any computation right you send the computation as a program as data and it is executed that's precisely what happens with cairo in fact the name cairo the c comes from cpu and the next three letters are air which come from the algebra so it's like a cpu algebraic object and you put it once out there and now you can basically express all computations that you want and have one verifier that you don't have to modify and change that deals with all of them and again the analogy you should have in mind here is is that of a cpu so you bought a laptop there's one cpu there until you replace it you know in two years time with a faster cpu which likely will also happen at some point with cairo you're going to run all of your computations all of your programs on using that one cpu without replacing it so that's the same idea with cairo it wouldn't work well if the way you had to express computations to the cpu was very hard but it's not so there's a programming language called cairo that is very developer friendly looks like a programming language and now you can write all your computations in this language and they get automatically compiled and proofs for them are generated for the correct execution and put on chain through this one verifier to rule them all yeah it's really impressive and you also earlier mentioned the great reddit scaling bake off and that was when reddit and the ethereum foundation invited some of the or not some just any ethereum scaling projects to show how their project could be used to scale reddit's community points which now i think is used by just hundreds of thousands of users but later they want to roll it out to all 430 million reddit users so explain a little bit more about your participation in that and how it worked and um i mean you talked a little bit about what you were able to achieve but just describe the experience yeah so they gave a challenge that they in which they said well we have this point system so think of these as some tokens that currently are you know administered over the reddit servers but they would really like to put them on on on main and actually the way i think it started at least from our point of view is that we we took uh one of the more popular uh reddit uh subreddits and we basically took all of their transactions i think it was like something like 12 million accounts if i'm not mistaken or something or 1.2 million accounts i forgot and we just put one proof for you know for a whole bunch of stuff i think this uh impressed uh reddit uh i'm i'm speculating that maybe some other uh you know l2 solution said oh you know it's not a fair fight why don't you do a challenge or something like that anyways they said okay we have this grand challenge uh you're supposed to take uh to show how you can um deal with 300 000 transactions which is a huge amount and show us how your scaling solution is gonna you know deal with them had had they been given to you as part of the system um and and you want to sort of have these transactions be spread out over a period of five days because 300 transactions you know that's a big amount of transactions let's see okay so and there was five the the time for this uh bake off was given five weeks so we did it in four weeks and instead of spreading the transactions on on five days we put it inside ten blocks and these ten blocks basically nine of them the proof was one block it could fit in one block but there was all this data they didn't ask for it to be in rollup mode but we we said you know what the hell let's do it also in rollup mode so we put all of the data on chain and then it took us ten blocks so instead of five days um we put it on mainnet um in one proof um you know 10 blocks most of it is just data not the proof itself so you know i think the twitterratty agreed that we sort of uh hit the ball way out of the park you know i would love to have reddit pick up the phone and say hey guys you know you nailed it let's work but um i don't know i don't know what they're doing there at reddit with respect to this thing you know they haven't announced anything since then so okay so we we got some pretty nice pr um and um we moved on uh i guess we'll have to see what where where that goes what happens with that um so as we all know there has been a lot of talk in not only crypto but also in the traditional financial world about gamestop and robin hood and scaling of these centralized solutions i mean er not solutions but exchanges and even um if we just think about like a coin base how they've had so many outages and and you know i mean when you when you look at how when markets act the way that they did in the gamestop period which i think we all know is pretty much how crypto acts like pretty much all the time um and we see that that cause problems for robin hood we know it does cause problems for coinbase i was wondering what you what your thoughts were on how defy is positioned to address these issues i'll try to answer this i mean there are two aspects to it there is one you know the sort of a technical scale can you deal with it and and um you know in the conventional markets it's not the scale of the right the the trading systems that that is the problem right that that sort of they can deal with that um in the crypto world this used to be the problem um i think with technologies like ours uh this is no longer the problem i mean we can we can reach the scale of uh you know nasdaq or uh visa or uh you know if need be even uh alipay or wechat this is so so this doesn't have to be the problem the other issue is that of the um you know the sort of t plus two that everyone's talking about right that the way the markets work is that the finality you know you're given some time for finality and and in that respect crypto is way better because uh be it on l1 or l2 with the instant finality like uh dydx perpetual is gonna it has um basically as fast as the market uh sorry not not as the market there's as fast as the blockchain progresses or the l2 progresses that's basically the state of affairs and again you also these uh issues and then there's the third aspect of like centralization and censorship you know there were various rumors that i have no idea about about you know various parties not uh being happy with certain transactions so sort of stepping in and of course the decentralization of blockchains is what prevents this so blockchains have instant finality they are censorship resistant had such a thing such as gamestop been played on crypto uh the main problem would have been scaling you know they can deal with such an amount of transactions but with our technology that is solved as well yeah so you know nasdaq you're listening to this episode you know please pick up the phone we'll be happy to serve you so i don't know what the number of transactions per second were when the gamestop mania was happening but are you saying that it was an amount that something like starkber okay that zk rollups could handle do you know what the number you can handle uh um we can handle i mean you know we'll have to put a lot of ing like okay the technology can handle uh any reasonable tps that is uh currently you know in any financial system in the world okay you said it was 3 000 transactions per second was that the number well we we displayed on mainnet something that is at 3000 tps this is something we displayed but if we you know if we had to service um alipay with uh it's 250 000 transactions per second um there's nothing in the technology that couldn't put that on l1 of course you'd need you know we need to have a lot of engineers to sort of uh move to bigger machines and whatnot but uh there's nothing that prevents it and if we needed to deal let's say with a visa payload which is in the 2000 to 25 000 uh tps uh we could deal with that uh pretty much today and antonio did you want to add any thoughts on game the game stop issue robin hood yeah i mean i think ali gave a really good summary on that um the only other thing i would add is what i touched on before in terms of transparency um and i think that was a really big factor that went into just a lot of the chaos around gamestop as well like i don't know exactly what the facts were but i think one of the issues was that there was more than 100 short interest on gamestop and that just made it like once those hedge funds had to actually cover um because the price was going up so much they literally couldn't i like the shares that they needed to cover because it was more than the entire float of gamestop um whereas something like that in crypto would have been you know people would have seen that coming um and people would have been able to see like okay well we know like all the the short positions on d5 like total this much we know that like float is this much um so they would they've just been able to have like much a lot more transparency around the market which i think is important as well yeah or the systems even could have been designed where it would not be possible to short more than existed so yeah um so something else i wanted to ask about is there's been a trend in defy that differentiates between these like fair launch projects and then vc projects and both of you have gotten investment from big name vc firms like dydx has investment from injuries and horowitz policing policing capital one confirmation three errors capital defiance capital um starkware has investment from paradigm sequoia coinbase ventures scalar multi-coin capital and so i know neither of your projects have launched tokens yet but i just wanted to hear your take on this debate between fair launch tokens versus vc tokens yeah it's an interesting interesting question i definitely don't think that there's one that's objectively better in terms of like the path for any given system i really think it has to do a lot with the complexity of the systems that you're building for example like let's take us or i mean actually stark is a great example of this too like the things that we're building are just very technologically complex and sure you could come out of the gates and be like hey i'm dydx i have this dream to like someday hopefully build a protocol for perpetuals and this is like theoretically how i'm gonna do it like give me your money for a token um but i don't really think that that's like an optimal way to go about fundraising or an optimal way to go about company building more generally um people always ask us constantly i hear you like why have we not done a token yet like it's it's pretty obvious um that you should do one um and i agree and trust me all the things going on on in the market are not lost on me but the thing that i always tell people and the thing that i really believe is uh we're not doing a token because we're like you know fundamentally opposed to them or something like that um we're do not doing a token right now because we believe that it's more important for us to build a really great product first and then like once we have a really great product and we have strong product market fit we have a lot of great users uh when you can throw just fuel on the fire on top of that with a token then it's like you get to be you know you don't just get to be but like you have an opportunity to be like you know in our goal of like potentially becoming like one of the biggest exchanges in crypto period so for us like that's always been the goal has been really big to become one of the biggest exchanges and we really feel like this is the best like expected value like way for us to do it long term to go through and we've been around for like three and a half years now which in crypto is like literally forever um just like go through and take these like three and a half four years like building an amazing product um i think we had kind of started to hit our stride on layer one but then we just ran into like all of this nonsense with having to pay like hundreds of dollars in transaction fees and there are a bunch of like other product limitations that we had on layer one like finality was pretty long like a block time things like that that are now solved on our new product and we're really excited about our new product i mean uh you know ellie touched on this before but we've literally had 50 000 people like sign up for our wait list on our alpha and it's getting to be more like every day so i think a lot of other people are excited about that as well and again that's like with no token or anything like that so it's just organic interest in our actual product um and then like once we have like strong product market fit um then if we you know later and no guarantees or anything like that but later if we go out and like launch a token um that's how we think we we become really really big and we feel like the the amount of the company and therefore the like hypothetical tokens or whatever that we like sold to investors to do that is well worth it um because now we have just like four years of development experience behind us and a lot of expertise to continue to build great products yeah and i meant to mention earlier that i did an interview with antonio actually i don't know what year that was do you know what year was that i think it was a long time ago it was either like 20 i think it was 2018. so it was like right after the ico yeah probably talked about the same thing then yeah so um you know clearly the project has evolved since then it's just yeah it was quite different um and so people should listen to that just to hear more about antonio's history um but from what you were describing so it sounds like you probably will launch a token and so would we expect it would be a governance token and maybe you would you know add a little liquidity mining scheme on top of it yeah i'm not going to talk too much about it in particular but like it's not rocket science probably like we're taking a look at all the things that have been successful like in the d5 space and yeah those things that have been successful i would say are governance and liquidity mining um so if we want to fulfill our goals of being able to grow in the maximum possible way um you can use your own intuition about what we might do with with such a token but again it's like it's not 100 that we're going to be doing this um like even like in this like bull run or whatever like no matter like how long that lasts like we're not going to launch one until we're like really happy with the current state of the product and we really think like honestly believe that once we throw fuel on that fire that we'll be able to grow um and just appreciate like everyone's patience until then and of course it is like in our long-term plans like i was talking about earlier in the episode to decentralize more of dydx and to not just have say for example like our contracts be controlled by like some multi-signature contract forever um and clearly that that goes hand in hand with governance too and ellie so you also talked about how starkware will be decentralizing and do you plan to do that with a token yeah so so i'll get to that in a minute i won't comment much on it i just want to add to what uh so son what antonio said about um you know the fair launch versus vc um we incorporated uh three years ago at the height of the ico craze and everyone was saying oh you know you must you must do an ico that was the previous version of it um another aspect and we didn't and another even though you know filecoin was raising a quarter billion and tezos and so on um those were the happy days then what we said to ourselves and also to other projects we were talking to who did do tokens was that you're basically going public you know from day one and there's this price ticker right that everyone sees you know your employees the outside world and you haven't really done anything yet so it's a very it could be a v very demoralizing experience and it's a you know it's a then you're these there are these market fluctuations so that's another aspect of just you know managing expectations of your employees and everyone and the public as you're sort of building something and we wanted to build something very quietly and to get you know top engineers and mathematicians just to work very patiently on this so so that was the obvious route for us but others have gone the other way now regarding uh you know decentralized darkness and token so so i won't comment on on tokenomics i will say this that it's clear to us that an l2 that is decentralized will need to have proper crypto economic incentives for the various players that are out there uh you know we're going to have decentralized proving services um that are operated by numerous players you need to have coordination among them they're going to be uh sequencers of transactions you need to take care of payments to the l1 amortize the gas cost and so on and so forth all of this uh begs for uh you know game theoretic uh mechanism design and cryptoeconomic mechanisms but those are yet to be determined uh and just like we waited patiently with any sort of tokenomics till now you we really need to understand how starknight is going to be governed and administered before we can make decisions on the right mechanisms all right so neither of you want to comment too much on any tokens but are there any other developments coming up this year that either of you want to mention yeah maybe i can start i mean i think the the main thing that we've just i mean i guess it's even hard for me to like even for the next year we've just been so heads down like focused on building out this new layer two product with starkwear and the other thing i think i didn't mention but it's worth talking about too is it's not just that we took our layer one product and put it on layer two we literally built an entirely new product like new servers new ui new everything um so we've been working really hard alongside the protocol work that starburst been doing then and i've kind of been in the thick of that as well in terms of coding and stuff um so yeah certainly we're about to have the public launch in about a few weeks from now so that'll be really exciting far further on down the line i think the main thing would be focusing on for the rest of this year is just further decentralization of the protocol um so starting with kind of decentralization of like the governance of our contracts and things like that um and then starting to think like how can we decentralize like the order book and the matching engine components that we still run in a centralized way right now no timelines or anything like that for any of that but that's what we'll be focused on for the rest of the year and i'm excited about that like it's really hard problems but that's how we're really going to realize that the long-term vision of what we're building so on our side first of all i'm very excited and anxious about you know the public launch of uh dydx which is going to be the first uh you know major public event the closest public event on our horizon it's starkware uh we're really really uh excited for this shortly after that uh immutable x is going to be launching this is for nft and massive uh off chain minting of nfts which is a big big problem that you know no other solution can deliver right now and immutablex is going to do that um that's going to come very soon over the next few weeks looking a few months ahead we're going to be launching uh with badger dao and amm on l2 and uh that's uh another exciting thing and a little bit further i mean those are the projects that we can sort of announce uh right now there are other things of course uh being worked out and we hope to announce them really soon another exciting thing is basically the the launch of uh phases one and two of uh starknight called the planets and constellations that's gonna be in a very small number of months and these will uh allow you know developers at large to just write smart contracts and deploy them and then benefit from the same scale that uh dy2x is going to have in the next you know when it goes public um and i want to mention in this respect and this also ties the questions you know we were asked a lot uh you know how do we uh how how can we participate in this thing that is uh you know starkware's journey and and starting with things like that and people ask about you know tokenomics and whatnot and there's uh only one very simple answer that that that i and we'd start with always give them which is uh go learn cairo because this will be just like if you asked about you know early day ethereum what was the best thing you could advance your time in would probably be to learn solidity or whatever precursor was to there so right now this this language on which all of starknet is going to be built with all its skill is cairo and it's already accessible and you go to cairo lang dot org and basically start learning there's a bunch of tutorials there there are tutorials for running your own amm so you can build today your own amm on layer two with much lower gas fees there are voting and signature aggregation tutorials that you can do there and again you can start building your own products and have them integrated into start so so this is i think this is this potential of having a developer ecosystem that that learns cairo writes in it and then you have this massive uh uh amount of daps on starknet this is uh very uh exhilarating to us yeah it definitely sounds interesting to me because yeah you know we see all these ethereum killers trying to come and take developers to these other blockchains and attracting them with um you know defy capabilities on their platforms and um yeah i could see the appeal to a developer who wants to stick with ethereum um all right so we will have to keep an eye on that because that does sound interesting um so thank you both so much for coming on and chain where can people learn more about each of you and your work yeah for us uh our the best place to start is just going to our website at dydx dot exchange um there you can sign up for our private alpha which will be live really soon you can join our discord if you want to ask me anything just literally tag me in our discord and i'll probably answer um so just head over on to dydx dot exchange and check everything out there on on our side first of all follow us on twitter starkwareltd you know you can check out our website starkware.com.com co and then finally if you're a developer and you want to start building in cairo you go to cairo lang as in language dot a-o-r-g great and i meant to mention earlier that immutable has been a previous monsters of my show but that also you know when you mentioned that i hadn't been aware of the difficulties of um minting nfts like in terms of gas costs i only that's something i only found out about recently so i will also be watching that i think that sounds very interesting all right well thank you both so much for coming on our channel this has been super fun thank you laura yeah thanks so much for
