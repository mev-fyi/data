alright yeah we don't get we didn't get to see each other sort of immediately no no we didn't so before we keep chatting I just want to say to everyone and welcome to the kickoff talk for ethereal which will be this fireside chat that I am conducting with cheng feng jiao AKA CZ who's the CEO of finance and if you don't know who i am i am the host of a couple crypto podcasts Unchained and unconfirmed welcome cz thank you for having me here so in your tweet yesterday about our chat you said that last time I interviewed you I asked you tough bordering misleading questions and I wondered what questions in particular did you take issue with oh yeah well he asked me if I was worried about going to jail I mean who asked that but I do think I mean my questions about u.s. regulations I think at least were on point because you know since the time of our interview now finance has changed its approach to the US and I remember last time when I was asking you all about the u.s. regulations you said that my line of questioning was like telling somebody who didn't like hot weather that they had to live in the US or live in Florida and you said you know that like that was ridiculous but apparently now you've decided that even though you don't like hot weather you will come to Florida so now you have financed us which is specific to the US market and obviously it's unique regulations I guess we could call them and even within that there is finance USD which is approved by the New York State Department of Financial Services which is easily one of the toughest crypto regulators so it seems that I was right that the way by Nantz was operating was not really in line with US regulation would you agree with that and that's why you launched by Nancy West I think I have to disagree with that line of questioning but I think the question is worded in a misleading way it's just that ok because not every company starts in the US and we didn't start in the u.s. we wasn't targeting the US customers specifically and but we got to a point where big enough getting regulated in the u.s. is really expensive I don't like it's just like I don't know 48 stadia to get licenses with with I think our partners you're going through that process it's very time-consuming so but at a certain size we said well the US market is a important market and we want to be able to service our market so we partnered with spam trading services and there's - I far as I understand they are still very much going through the licensing state-by-state process so they're able to service I believe 37 states and there's a few big states they're not able to service just yet so we're still waiting for them to get the license go through that but the narratives not so much we were targeting the US illegally before and now we're doing the proper lane it's not quite like that from at least from our perspective okay okay well I guess now I'm two for two and asking you border and misleading questions so but speaking of be USD which I mentioned earlier that's part of Venus which is your stable coin initiative and you know that will create kind of many different types of sale coins for you know different fiat currencies and in the Chinese version of your announcement you referenced Libra when you talked about Venus and you your co-founder Yi I think that's her name I said that Venus was quote the one belt one Road initiative version of Libra and so you know when you guys made this announcement at that time it looked like Libra it was just gonna be this single global currency and Venus was gonna take a different strategy of you know being different stable coins of different Central Bank currencies but now obviously Libra is actually going in the direction that Venus was supposed to go so is that changing your strategy with Venus okay so I think this is some some misinformation there as well the Venus was never meant to be a stable point on his own it's a basket project in encompassing several or many stable coins in different parts of the world and our approach is always to work with local governments local corporate corporations or other regular regulatory bodies to issue different stable coins for different regions we did not have the thought of eating a basket packed stable coin as a single stable coin I haven't really figured out how the economics of that would work so we took a very much simpler approach say look us is a big market and also we we found a very strong partner there Paxos they're actually the issuer of the bond is USD stable coin so even though it's called - you guys tease the issue is actually not us so it's issued by a Paxos which is fully regulated by MIT FS one of the strictest regulators in the world and they bank accounts I assume is audited by some by the auditing firms I actually don't see the bank account but it is transparent it is it is like there's a of mine to it so that's one part of it and I think very recently I heard that if the government of Bermuda is even accepting PUSD for tax payments so among a few other stable coins that's also issued from the US so that's quite good we also you should be GBP we recently so that's a British pound one we also issued a B KRW which is a Korean Won one so this morning that works so our approach to stable coins that I think the simplest approach is basically look take some fiat put in an escrow make sure it's totally transparent audited regulated and then issue a stable point on that that's the simplest way there are other more fancy always like algorithm algorithmic I can't pronounce Thai word different type of stable coins which are fancier but that's fine so we just provide a very simple option for our users and we want to do this in more and more regions through the Venus Project which is a kind of encompassing project right right but actually so maybe you misunderstood my question because I was saying that now that Libre is essentially doing what you had planned to do like does that change that strategy it up no not necessarily I think Libra is kind of libras but basically based on a common perception they're very much focused in the US they have a very strong presence in the u.s. it's a US company and they're dealing with US regulators very heavily and that you have a lot of reach globally in terms of user base so that's great but I mean our philosophy is always one more option doesn't hurt users so we're gonna soar wherever wherever you make sense we're gonna provide our option so we don't see ourselves as competition to Libra and we don't see ourselves as competition to other stable coins so we support other stable coin initiatives we support so we support anything that users want really so if a coin has a lot of users will likely supported and hopefully we will be able to provide usability to a lot of users with our own stable coin that if a lot of people use it then it's great if nobody uses it then we're gonna shut it down so that's kind of our philosophy in China now is in the early stages of rolling out its central bank digital currency dcep design ants ever see its of launching a Chinese yuan stable coin as part of the Venus Project so right now to be honest we have no plans and there's two versions the Chinese yen there's the unsure check RMB that's our offshore RMB and they're not supposed to mix because channel do you have a very strict flight capital controls so right now I don't think you can get a bank to support you to issue a stable coin in China there has been attempts to issue a stable coin based on the overseas they sort of oversee RMB but very little very little adoption I think basically today US dollars still the dominant dominant fiat currency and we see that much of the volume is the US dollar based stable coins so this is actually good like stable currency actually in this is very good for US dollar it's actually improved improves the US Dollars dominance but we'll see things might change but basically if there's a way to issue a stable point properly with a banker with banking support with approvals fully transparent auditing if there's those things then we are more than happy to do that so we're talking with a few different initiatives or different projects but nothing's mr. early stages nothing's very concrete right now and what impact thing dcep will have generally on the adoption of crypto to be honest based on my limited understanding right now it feels very much like a digital version of RMB which probably probably plus a blockchain architecture summary in in there so it's still very much controlled wisdom access to it is still very much limited to learn to a number of large banks so how easy it is to you for for a sort of a crypto player to integrate that into the ecosystem I'm not sure so so far we had we do not have access to access to it so they're testing my understand is that testing it among a few big banks initially so hopefully if it gets really wide adoption if everyone in China is using it and if there's a blockchain interface that we can interface directly onto pirates and let people deposit with I'd be great if we can't if we can't do that then the usage will be somewhat limited I still useful in the sense of educating everybody about blog chair and stable coins cryptocurrencies etc and I think today if you learn about blockchain and cryptocurrencies he cut you cannot not learn about Bitcoin so I think that exposure helps a lot even if you can't use it so it's still early stages we can't use it today because it's still being very limited testing but hopefully very soon we will be able to use it and if we can then that'd be I'll be fantastic that provides a much better all right for RMB what you see yeah and another thing that I find interesting that's happening right now as we're seeing this you know race amongst these Central Bank digital currency is taking place is that obviously at the same time we have this pandemic so it's curious to know what impact do you think the corona virus and the economic fallout from that will have on the adoption of crypto and also I wondered if you're like already noticing any trends in terms of the activity on Finance sure absolutely so I think there's definitely a lot of trends that we already noticing the most obvious one I'm buying us right now is there's higher trading volumes there are far higher trading volumes ever since like a couple like but about two months ago so they could be a different a variety of different reasons contributing to that you could be that people are just bored at home and they just pray more because there's less other distractions or other interesting things for them to do it's also possible that given that the governments of printing money at record speed to sort of support the economy or to try to recover the economy and now there's those money is starting to flow into cryptocurrencies and we've seen the price recovering so but all of those things I think have a very fundamental impact and also the coronavirus has a huge impact in the sense that traditional industries are very much stopped right so production in like like basically we can print a lot of money to sort of hand out money to everybody but the fundamental fact is production but like you know a lot of sectors have completely stopped there's a few essential sectors that still going strong and online online virtual businesses are going strong which is good for us as well but then with the government printing so much money right now and everyone being bored at home so both of those both of all of those factors contribute to the growth so yeah I mean we so far I think I think as many Kol or like oh geez say in the space we're kind of witnessing a perfect storm for Bitcoin and crypto currencies so I think if cryptocurrency does not shine in this environment then I'm in the wrong industry so I'm pretty but I'm very confident about it so during this time you also became the number one crypto futures trading venue why do you think that shift happened to be honest I think we got lucky there so I think when we but the futures platform actually have grown very quickly as well again I thought you would take multiple years to grow to the number one platform for futures because when we we only started in late September last year so really only only just over half a year and then we they were existing established players with very large volumes and we thought and we thought it was gonna take a while we deliberately engineered the product to be a little bit different even though it's just futures yes we copied a lot of other features other people's features but the fee structure is very different our fees about one-seventh of the existing players for a feast that they charge for the taker side so we have very aggressive takers for the reason so we can we are very attractive to the sort of smaller retail guys we don't have a high maker rebate so it was deliberately engineered to be slightly different from the existing platforms and we were growing slowly and to be honest on March 12th with the biggest futures exchange experience so many issues and that's the day when the Bitcoin price was moving really really widely the Bitcoin price was dropping and even wants to trade luckily our system stayed up and and so that moved a lot of liquidity to us and actually don't be known to most retail people about us futures as the fastest API and most stable API so we average somewhere around 5 to in milliseconds where which is about like somewhere between like one third to one tenth of the latency are other platforms so this kind of things over time they kick in but I honestly we didn't expect you to be that quick so and we are we still offer a very limited product in through the futures we only have the perpetual the perpetual futures so we're actually looking to add settlement futures our futures is settled in USD of the US USD stable coin and we were looking to provide a cryptocurrency stable crit what's cryptocurrency settled futures contracts so all of those things are going on but I think we got lucky on the futures growth I would say that somehow your career in crypto it seems to have been born under a lucky star one one other thing I wanted to ask about was just like so what you're seeing kind of initially now in these early months after the corona virus pandemic would you do you think that you're you know you that you have a sense of how long-term this will affect the adoption of crypto or or how you'll see crypto trading or who gets involved in crypto how you know how all those things will change yes I think my feeling could be very wrong this just my personal opinion is the impacts can be on the level of month so I think we're gonna see I think you took a bug you took a couple of months for the impact to take in so you didn't clicking like on the second day when we felt there was a financial crisis when the stock market crashed Bitcoin actually crushed it with it so you actually didn't have that sort of a safe having effect on day to day basis but I think we're seeing that there's a strong recovery right now and so you see in a couple months and I think over the next few months maybe six months 12 months 18 months ish we're gonna see very very significant impact I think people are more and more people are gonna realize ok well this just our limited cash flowing around and they're only getting the minitek of the cash they will want to put that into something that's of limited supply and the easiest thing to put that into is actually cryptocurrencies so that like before that option 10 years ago that option wasn't available but now this option is available people can buy gold but other than a few like really old timers nobody really wants to buy gold anymore so I think and also there's more and more people are becoming more and more aware of the different economic impacts of different actions government take so I think over the next 12 to 18 month we're going to see some really significant changes into the quick in the crypto space and right now we're in a situation where there's a like there's a hacking going on right so it's a perfect storm so after the having the bitcoins actually going to be decreased well the new supply of bitcoins can be decreased a significant so the butterfly is very very limited and people will just have to I think and more and more people come in and we like the data we see our our platforms right now in terms of new users and also as well as old users who whose account has been dormant has been like they're really coming back alive you really really quickly so our customer support has been really busy as helping people forget with the password resets etc because there's a lot of guys who like to forget their password after a while right so we see all of those things happening so I think in the next to 12 to 18 months we're gonna see some really a really significant increase in adoption in the in the crypto space yeah yeah we'll see what happens it's true that historically that has been the case after having so let's switch from talking about bitcoins to aetherium your proposed by Nance smart chain which is a smart contract platform will be compatible with aetherium but what do you say to the people who think that by Nance smart chain is attempting to compete with aetherium well I think basically that depends on the definition of competing because it's really a person it's a really a very personal subjective view for for each individual so I mean you can say your theme is competing with Bitcoin I'm not sure if that's you also said B&B is competing with Bitcoin at a broader level maybe you can also say we're kind of compliment each other so we so initially when bioscan first started our goal was to just provide a for a very fast chain that solves a skill it's a performance issue with many of the existing block chains and so that we can run a decentralized exchange ayat and so that go has been achieved but this isn't right but given the popularity of centralized exchanges and the ease of use for centralizes changes I think most people still doesn't know how to hold their coin themselves to be honest like if you guys if you grab 100 guys on the street only 99 99 of them will now know or at least are not confident holding a big coin on their own so until that changes and we're looking and I think that the central exchanges will be relatively small but you could change very quickly we don't know one of the most requested features were by this chain was a smart contract and and everyone wants a EVM theorem a virtual machine compatible smart contract chain so we said well if users wanted less provided so we view ourselves as complimentary to to your theory of not not not competing I think if you does a lot of things very well if you miss first team did fulfill their vision in the sense that they did build a unstoppable machine it is what the one point is your version is still a little bit like they have performance bottlenecks which everyone's experiencing so hopefully 2.0 will solve that but from our perspective look if something is already working and there's a very large community is already familiar with solidity programming then we should just go along with it instead of fight it so we view ourselves we never really view ourselves as competing with a serum with supporting cerium we listed on - comm we list we have a very large number of pairing for it so I think we support the initiatives that they're pushing forward and I think some of the technical problems they're trying to solve are very meaningful if you film 2.0 softly performance scalability problems using sharding that's super useful so we hope we hope that they do well and so if I am a developer or user why would I either create or choose to use an etherium job on the by nan smart chain as opposed to on etherium number one - - on the - change if you should talk on your back on the bonus chain and use the smart contract there you can just pour it over your film contract you will work on post chants and then when you had one when you have it on your bonus yet there's a bonus in July decentralized exchange the finest text that works out of the gate it is a very fun I think that Dex - change is very well done it has a very to the extent possible a very user-friendly interface and very fast matching engine and just works and and then you're also in a bind a psycho system to be honest most developers you can be in both ecosystems there are a lot of coins which are do a chain or multi chain right now so there's just another option and then you feel - Dex and your trading volume is high enough we you get a higher slightly higher chance of listening on - calm so you're kind of more visible to the - ecosystem we - okay the ecosystem has a very high number of users the bio psycho system also has a large number of users and so that ended two slightly different user groups to be honest the balanced ecosystem has more heavier traders and centralized exchange users whereas the ecosystem has more developers and more sort of the tech-heavy sure decentralization type of guys so it's very - different even though we're kind of within the same industry the style there's some differentiation between the different players so it's just another choice that we provide for you for developers and users so it sounds like if there's more traders on in the finance ecosystem then maybe it would make sense for some of the D Phi projects - y-you know to move over there or to create it okay okay so I wonder if I wonder if there will be at there people who will say you're stealing our D Phi users and developers what would you say to them so to be honest I think there's always two sides we can look we can view anybody else on this planet we can always view them as a collaborator or we view them as a competitor for any person on this planet because they're breathing alright that's breathing my air so I think basically we are the fundamental situation we're in in this industry is that we are a the mark is not nowhere near saturated right so only why you 1000 people have some kind of crypto right now so only 0.1% of the population have crypto there's 99.9 percent of the expansion that can be possible in a saturated market if you introduce a new player yes you're gonna take market share from other other players in a nascent market we one more player coming will make the what makes the ecosystem bigger that's much better for the ecosystem so we would want to invite liberal to come in we will want to invite IBM Microsoft other guys Google to come in so I think having more players in a small and not saturated market but nowhere near saturated market makes this industry bigger so now we should be all collaborating to make this industry bigger now once you once you achieve like like say look if you want to do another I don't know search engine you're probably you're probably competing with somebody else if you do another browser if you're probably competing with somebody else but if you do you another blockchain or another blockchain application or another even another exchange chances are you're not competing directly with us there there's so many users who are now using - right right now so only 0.1% of the population in crypto only a small portion that are using bonus so if you launch an exchange in somewhere else you can get more users into this industry and that helps all of us so that's two ways to view it I think that's really depending on how a person what likes to view they that depends on their world view we don't leave anybody a competition right now so we just want to cause I space bigger yeah that reminds me I I asked a similar question to one says coz pressed years ago and he mentioned he was talking about a different industry that he had launched just startup in but he basically said what you're saying that competition just grows the pie today's episode is brought to you by Kraken Kraken is the best exchange in the world for buying and selling digital assets with all the recent exchange hacks and other troubles you

out which merchants are available in your country download the crypto calm today all right well one other thing I wanted to ask you about was some of your big news this year which was that by Nance recently acquired coin market cap and because Bynum's is an exchange and is also at least one of the largest holders of vnb if not the largest some people say that buy Nance could have an incentive to sway the rankings and the reported volume on coin more if you cap so what do you say to people who are concerned about that well I think so if we do that then we could if we do that in a negative way it's just for the benefit of bonus then coin market cap loses a lot of value that you provides so I think neutrality is a very key value for coin market cap and I recognized very well myself and the coin market cap team recognized that and did we ask the coin market cap to fix some of the fake volumes on coin market cap yes we did and I think all the community agrees that there's a lot of exchanges we're putting fake volumes there what we have our influence in that discussion I think also yes and but coin market but all the business units what I call business units so I believe - dot-com the exchanges one business unit CMC is one business unit trust wallet is another business unit we have like I don't know 30 50 different business units each business unit operates relatively independently and so if - one wants to put an ad or CMC they will pay for it so the finest comics change business will pay the CMC business - for that ad and they were paid at market rates they'll get they'll get the lower tier of the market rate so they will not be ripped off because force has really left pocket right pocket but I think from my perspective to make foresee the best thing to maintain value over off of CMC and - they'll come together is CMC being the CMC and - calm exchange being the exchange I think both are strong enough to compete on their own we don't need to sabotage one business for the benefit of another business - dot-com can compete it's already the number one exchange by most metric by most matrices as CMC is the largest traffic website because it's useful to a lot of users and so and also banners calm well not unnecessarily benefit give some benefit to CMC just to CMC on so I think most businesses will compete independently and they should give value independently and that does not involve CMC directing all the traffic to - comm so people don't have to worry too much about that and you did reference obviously the fake volumes or at least the inaccurate figures on coin market cap what can you do or what can coin market cap do to make the numbers more accurate so so what I did was basically I posted a Twitter I post your tweet and asking for feedback and that was probably the number one feedbacks why people want a fix so I just asked team just fix it somehow I don't care how you guys fix it the team has what they call a liquidity metrics so they look at the order book that's they look at a bunch of other matrices to try to fix it and when after that to be so I mostly used column ArchiCAD for the bar for the coin market cap so when I look when I look at a specific point I go for I look at that I'd be used to look the user calling market cap for exchange rankings but it's so accurate right now it's kind of less useful and I look at the adjusted volumes that they had I was like what that's even less accurate than the reported volume so I did give those feedback but other than that I didn't tell them how to fix it so I said look there's a bunch of mattresses you can use you can tie it together with web visits so you can type to get they also they also have data or album clicks how many people click on the links for each exchanges to go to the exchanges and bonuses number one even though - is mostly ranked like a 15 and our 20 or 25th spot because likes there's a bunch of other guys with fake volumes in front of that so we look at those we look at those data even historically by us is number one and actually if you look at the album data it's very it's actually very accurate that's that gives a like a very accurate so they have a lot of data that they can use to sort of fix the ranking I didn't I didn't I I didn't ask I didn't tell them specifically how to fix it but just look that's not number one user requested feature you guys fix it yeah well we'll see how that goes good luck to you guys on that one other thing I wanted asked about was you know you guys launched this leverage trading in October and you did it with 125 X leverage when high leverage can so easily cause traders to get wiped out why did you offer such high leverage okay so I'll be I'll make a confession the high leverage is more of a PR gimmick so the 125s is only available for smaller amounts so if you want to trade like I don't know a couple hundred bucks yes you can go 100 you can go hundred twenty-five X and at large your money's gonna trade ten million dollars no you don't get you don't get 125 X leverage because if you can if you can liquidated the liquid it is not the current liquidity is not in the in the industry is not strong enough to support that kind of liquidation so it's a tier system where it's for smaller amounts you get that because you get to that kind of leverage and we have a deleveraging system that if you if you if you approach your margin and then you get the leveraged most of people actually only use like 10 20 max like most people don't really use above 30 50 X so they high leverage is really sort of just well there was 100 X and there was a hundred at 1 X we said 100 100 what and one doesn't really divide very well I mean 25 divides much better you can if you divided by 8 you get a nice number if you divide by 7 you get a nice number so we just said well let's go with that so most people don't use that high leverage okay okay well we got a nice admission there so this is gonna be something else that a lot of people are gonna be curious about in early April 11 class-action lawsuits were filed against a number of crypto companies and token projects and Finance was one of them the suit named you and your co-founders huh Nene and Roger Wang as defendants the lawsuit noted that in 2019 finance averaged more than 2.8 billion dollars in daily trading volume had more than 15 million users worldwide and listed 184 tokens and it also talked about how in 2018 finance brought in four hundred and forty six million dollars in profit and then the lawsuit said quote how did a company that was barely a year old generate such extraordinary profits by building a platform that solicited the buying and selling of unregistered securities on a historically unprecedented scale what is your response to that and so on that point my our lawyers told me not to say anything so I would not summon on that but we have lawyers handling it so it is what it is I think every company well we were not without losses from the very beginning we had a Sequoia suing us at one point so that's resolved again I cannot comment on that on that on that outcome on the details but that's completely resolved no issues anymore so which is her lawyers handle it one of the tricky things in this world is that in the world I was brought up in at least the values I was taught you're innocent you're proven guilty having somebody suing you is a standard but not a standard is you say is a normal part of a business process but today many people think that as soon as there's a lawsuit of duty which is not the right I don't think that's the right cost perception so we'll let the lawyers figure it out unfortunately in this kind of situations or the lawyers tell you tell you to now come and I so I can't comment on the specifics but what we'll see yeah yeah I think what's interesting is that this sort of goes back to our first interview where I was asking you these questions but yeah we'll see how this plays out because I think this was a these were things that a lot of people were wondering about and now we'll finally get our answer so another kind of controversial issue recently was that you know obviously so we're seeing now that more and more block teams are using delegated proof of stake and because of that some people are concerned about the power that exchanges might have in those systems because of the coins that they hold for their users and a good example is what happened with the Steam blockchain when finance initially helped the steam tokens on the exchange your use the tokens on the exchange to help Justin son as he took control of steam and then finance later reversed course and helped a fork of steam called hive to basically remove some of the control it's just in son head so why did finance change directions with steam and how do you think exchanges should handle the power that they have in these delegated proof of stake systems with the coins they have yeah so to be very frank and i said this openly a few times already which is a we didn't know you was like a contentious fork so we go through many wallet upgrades right it's a blotchy upgrade whenever there's a whenever there's a block upgrade it's very often a soft or even a hard fork and typically the developers the core developers or contact us say look there's a heart there's a heart for coming we you guys need to upgrade your wallet and support it with just follow the instructions really so they they give us a detailed level of instructions we look at it we just follow it and so when when this was and this was the theme soft or the fork was presented to me as a upgrade and I was asked just one yeah let's go for it so I didn't even I did my team so so we have my own team Todd and actually I didn't talk to Justin before this so my their team was talking to our team on the wallet upgrade and my team asked me hey it was a standard like rubber stamp process where they say oh look there's a wallet upgrade we got a supported or not say yes so that was the extent afterwards the steam community went ballistic and I was like oh okay well that's not that's not very good so I made a mistake of not realizing that which I fully admit and take responsibility for and we do not want to get involved in governance blocking blocking governance is weighing our opinions etc especially we don't want to use our our users coins to do that so if you want to weigh and then we the only way we would do that is to but make a vote feature on Bannister come so that the guys we have awaited a world vote according to their to their balances and then we use that to vote but that's we don't we don't even have that feature today because we don't really want to get into that and so after the fact and steam works in a very strict way once you vote like do what they call power up I which I learned afterwards and then is like when you power down it takes 13 weeks to our lock I think we're still probably in that process or maybe we're probably near the end of that process and so what soon as we discovered we reversed course we said look this is not something we want to get involved with we we deal with the community ask the community still have some resentment on the actions that we took they think we course the fork but the fundamental fact after we reverse the actions just in some probably has a lot of financial what I call it ability to influence that anyway we were like I didn't look at the data but for a while the steam coin prize was going up because both sides were trying to buy more steam to vote so we've seen that happening I did not really look into the details of that but from our perspective our principles are very simple if it's not a contentious fork if this is a regular upgrade we definitely support it we support the blockchain ecosystem will grow so we're a standard process now we added a check to see if there's a contentious hard fork but normally we will just support it upgrade and but we are principals if we do not get involved in other people's blogs and governance and that's for their community that's for whoever holds those coins so we want to stay neutral in terms of other blocks governance we were not interested in that so one of the interesting thing is right now there is some where I would say for any coins between like 10 to 30% of coins on exchange are - specifically so for any delegated proof of stake consensus mechanisms they have to design with this in mind so ideally you can design with this with in with in such a way that is either easy for people to withdraw the coins from the exchange vote and not have those coins locked for 13 weeks before they can take a redeposit trade or have a way for exchanges to to be able to vote on the user's behalf so we will never vote our behalf using the users coins we want to if we so there's those kind of questions which are being considered and someday we may want to support it but it does raise the question that of some of the blockchain designs where when they design is some some some of them have very simplistic designs where they just assume everyone holds they chose their coins in their own wallet and they never trade they just they just buy and expanded so but the world is not that kind of it's not that naive so we just have to take that into I just hope that other designers blockchains take take that into consideration but our principles are very clear very simple in November the block reported that Finance had to Shane high offices that closed after being visited by local authorities and then in February after some media outlets described finance as being Malta based the mall safai nancial Services Authority issued a statement saying that you are not authorized by the EM FSA to operate in the cryptocurrency sphere there so where is finance headquartered I think what this is the beauty of the blockchain right so you don't have to like where's the Bitcoin office big condemn I had an office so we we have where people around 50 places in the world and actually to just to just to just to make the record correct just to set the record they block article saying that we had a police raid that did not exist police raid on a bonus office so that was pure fake and within 12 hours of that post the B&B market cap dropped from 2.6 billion to 2.2 billion so they actually had it does that fake article actually had a very material impact on the B&B holders so they actually really was a hundred million dollars but but just to clarify I mean so the block did admit that police raid maybe wasn't the term but to you know to say that you guys were visited by local authorities checked out in their opinion are you gonna dissipate I don't even know so I think the story carries are very much different weight if you say well a government or official visible coinbase versus quiet the police raided coinbase I think I think those key things are very very different so you can't really art yeah but just but to say that the office closed after the visit from local authorities are you gonna dispute that so yes I am so again so again so basically okay and also at the same time there was a Chinese CCTV visit of an office in Shanghai where they reported it was a customer support office so it's not it's not it's not easy is a outsource customer support office it's not even buy a nice office so again so yes I openly disputed that so I think people have all the traditional mentalities they have they're trying to classify what kind of horse is a car so you have to have an office but wherever I said it's gonna be the finest office wherever wherever I need somebody it's gonna be the finest office and and you have to have an entity you have to have in a headquarter you have to have a bank account all of those things doesn't have to exist for blocks and companies well I mean just but even to do things like to to handle you know taxes for your employees like I think you need a registered business entity so like why are you office cating it why not just be open about it like you know the the headquarters is registered in this place why not just say that well we don't we don't so we don't really we just not it's the same thing that's why why don't you admit you're some fellow horse we're not a horse for a car so it's not that we don't want at a minute admit it we it's not that we don't want to we want to obfuscate it or we want to kind of hide I'm not hiding we're in the open I'm on Twitter every day I go to conference I go to fiscal conferences so we're not hiding but it's just like why don't you go back to this old way of being I mean we're not that what do you think that you're already some kind of Dow or I mean what are you saying because it's not the old way it is actually the current way and until you can say like we're officially a Dow like I actually don't know you know what what you are or what you're claiming to be so let me put it this way so I don't think we're Dow you most of us definitions of a Dow I think again I think that's kind of a binary definition you're either traditional company or you're Dow um I think we're just the team working together really well and we build a platform that works and we have multiple we have multiple places we work most of well now most of it was actually we mostly work from home even before the corner of iris foreign team we work in 50 different countries now we have a we have a large team that works together to a come and go it's just a new type of organization I wouldn't classify to be honest if we classified as I doubt there's gonna be a lot of debate I would not add out so I don't want to go there either yeah I mean nobody would call you guys'd oh and can I ask where you are right now where you're doing stay at home yeah I mean I mean yeah sure so it's 70 we're in Asia I prefer not to disclose that I think that's my own privacy all right well that's gonna have to be where we're gonna end because it's now 8 a.m. and that's it thank you so much cz for making this fireside chat happen especially last minute and I hope
