thin air you know I I'm gonna I'm gonna sound super curmudgeonly saying this but I'm gonna say it anyway I'm just gonna feel how it lands which is that you know when I when when I was first investing into infrastructure this was like 2018 2019 after the 2017 Bull Run and at that time it was really clear that ethereum was not going to scale ethereum was not uh performance enough to be able to handle all the demand for transactions and that created this generation of Founders who were like we need to scale block space when you scale some of our contract platforms and that was the Genesis of the solanas and the nears and The Avalanches and and all the plasmas Roll-Ups all that stuff came out of that era because of that very strong need that everybody saw that this stuff needs to get better and improve so that we can do the stuff we want to do on chain right it feels that now in 2023 um it feels like the best minds of my generation are once again all working on infrastructure um but the it's not really clear to me that there is the same crushing need for everybody to be focused on it right like we we we kind of we kind of have Roll-Ups right but people oh but you need you need you know perfect modular DA's then you need this shared sequencers then you need like some fancy Mev Contraption to you know more accurately democratize this and that and it's kind of like well I we finally got a bunch of people on chain we finally got lots and lots of people Unchained we've got lots of block space we have so many places where you can launch an application we have rollups I mean obviously yeah we need products and stuff to get up and running but we kind of we kind of have the First Cut Rate to go um but it seems like all like people are kind of um myopically focused on infrastructure at a time when it feels like we really need more people thinking about how to build great applications that bring people on chain so it feels like even though we're at the same place where almost everybody's focused on infrastructure it feels much more misdirected in this cohort not that nobody should be working on it but that should really 80 90 of entrepreneurs be building infrastructure instead of building things for people to use on chain it feels wrong to me I agree and we say at the beginning of the show this is not investment advice but if you're a Founder maybe this is founder advice you know here haseeb is the VC telling you there's a wrong ratio of infrastructure to applications to use that infrastructure yeah now that said like I understand why people are doing it because they see where the incentives are right they see where the funding is going and um you know we've we've I don't think we've done any large infrastructure deals this year but most of the large deals this year have all been infrastructure so it I I can understand the the fourth you know it's a tough time to be building applications right there's not a lot of people you know with pocketbooks open on chained willing to play around with stuff except for hamster racing except for and welcome okay all right so with that as a beautiful transition let's go to the two big stories of the week so the first up is World coin so World coin for those who don't know it is a project that was originally co-founded by Sam Altman who's now the CEO of openai uh so they are a boy how do you describe this uh so World coin it's it's a cryptocurrency and the idea is that they want a sort of proof of personhood and the way that you prove you are a person is that there is an orb a literal physical orb that you can pick up there there are a bunch of them around the world and this physical orb will scan your iris and it will create some basically more or less encrypted uh record of your iris that will identify you as being a singular person it gets tied to your address as like a proof of personhood and this creates a wallet for you tied to your tied to your a scan of your iris so um they have scanned something like two million people supposedly mostly in the third world none of them in the US and in Europe because obviously this is less kosher in the US and Europe uh and so they just launched their token on Monday and their token launched uh currently it's about 250 million dollar market cap on a 22 billion dollar fdv and you're reading that right that is a one percent float so meaning one percent of the total supply of the token is currently circulating um there's that there's been like 21. that's right that's right so I've heard a lot of people say that uh this is the new Sam coin which is a very reminiscent distribution of what SPF and kind of the FTX crowd you said I just hope he doesn't use it as collateral anywhere that would be yeah I think I think Sam Altman is a little busier than than uh SPF but uh yeah it's right now very very um suspect uh in terms of the the actual real price discovery of this token because apparently the vast majority of this float is owned by market makers who have let's say complex incentives around um how they're how they're playing with this thing but then separately after this thing launched uh Vitali published a blog post basically critiquing the biometric proof of personhood system that wilcoin is using and then you've got just a lot of people taking shots at them on Twitter saying that oh you know this is like some kind of totalitarian scoop up everybody's eyeballs for the third world kind of uh I don't know whatever people people talking [ __ ] about world coin um I haven't seen a lot of positivity or basically almost everybody on Twitter is kind of mad it seems like a world coin um I I'd be curious just to hear from you guys give me the best positive take you can give on worldcoin here's my best positive take it is really hard to figure out a mapping of one person one set of Biometrics one address like you know we've seen again and again and again every civil attack possible against every airdrop that's ever been imagined in crypto we've seen people try to farm you know everything they can we've seen like armies of people spitting up thousands of accounts you know to try to take advantage of things that don't even exist yet and it is a hard fundamental problem to identify who's a real person how many real people are there how many people are using this application you know we have a decade plus of people trying to game the metrics around L1 blockchains creating fake activity and fake usage because why not it's easy to make a million wallets right and to make it appear like your blockchain has a million more users it's a real problem it affects so much of what we do and whether or not you think the approach to the solution is correct and personally I don't know if it is and it's pretty creepy and I don't love it it is an incredibly difficult and important problem to solve and it's worth solving and they're taking a creative approach itself again believable yeah I have a very different positive uh okay story uh I actually think vitalik's post was was not critical it was generally quite positive um and part of the reason is I actually think the while Sam Altman's probably someone I would not necessarily trust in with trying to not resell this type of data um some of the people who work there on the ZK side of like encrypting basically what it does is there's this device it has a sensor the sensor has a particular attestation mechanism so it can sign and what they do is they take the picture they create this sort of like hash fingerprint and then they generate a zero knowledge proof a way of proving that hey you know if you if you took the picture again you know machine learning model tag your eyes and your face like a normal face detection thing and it's the same thing without revealing the input so without revealing like hey this is the picture so that's the only thing sort of stored publicly um and the you know sort of head of research there is one of the kind of smartest but also like very privacy focused people I've ever met in this industry his name is Remco and I genuinely don't think he would work on such thing if they didn't have this kind of long-term goal of actually achieving the attested sensor privacy now that being said the eyeball stuff is personally I find a little bit very creepy I also just don't think that their auditing was particularly good and I can't really check um a lot of the the details of exactly how the system works uh it feels like they rushed it like why do you have to launch a token now like it that that just that to me just seemed like cash grab the float thing cash crab but they do have these like engineers and researchers who are amazing there so I think to me the fact that those people I think if they saw real malevolence would quit and then at that point it's like short short type of thing uh not trading advice yeah yeah okay but like like sorry but the uh yeah I think I think there's a lot of cool things are doing but yeah the token just really felt cash grabby I don't know I don't know what else to say I mean my only argument against the token is I'm just disappointed that it's like an L1 token like I would think if they're trying to make a currency for the whole world to use they would have waited till at least a token it's not though right or like it's kind of like no it's on and out yeah it's on ethereum but the wallet that they create for you when you sign up with worldcoin yeah it used to be a polygon now it's on optimism so it's like you know it's kind of going where the money is so they can buy the token even though the token doesn't really do anything today I I agree I think the tech is actually very cool I think the goal is actually very admirable and like I don't know what will Envision that like the current way we do kyc and like passporting is actually Superior to this I think it's actually way better than the sort of the current system um but I agree I mean the token I remember you know we were looking at the round and like you know some of the business models like oh well you know maybe we'll like you know charge people to yeah look up your ID or like maybe we'll you know do some like metamask uniswap fees and it's just like kind of a big question mark um and so I'm like so it doesn't feel like that's really figure it out and it feels like totally unnecessary to like launch a token uh when you don't even really have clear pmf and it doesn't really serve a purpose and you know meaningfully decentralizing the system all also I think a very good um you know a bunch of people have commented on like their docs are missing a lot of but like like they've been working on this in the open for a while but they kind of like rush to launch it in a way that just didn't seem like timed well it felt like forced whether by and I don't know who Force the investors whatever it didn't feel like extremely uh you know like a natural kind of launch but again like there's a lot of people who work there who I have the utmost respect for and I really think if they were doing something duplicitous I do not think any of those people would stay and that the moment you see any of them leave that's one that's like all right the orb is just trying to [ __ ] you I wasn't true I find this argument of like I know people there it's cool don't worry about it like that I haven't gone through 2022 I have a very hard time the difference between like Remco and spf's Remco is a like long standing you know in ethereum development look Bronco is awesome I completely agree with you I completely agree with you I'm sure they're paying him a lot of that Sam almond money yeah yeah sure sure but but I I just kind of think like there are a lot of things like at this point that like if they continued [ __ ] up I see a lot of people who work there leaving and they've said as such so it's like I I also so a very funny fact is in 2017 2018 I met one of the co-founders who's currently now who's kicked out by Altman the current co-founder this guy Max and I thought he was a raving crazy lunatic when he told me this idea he was like yeah like you know I used to work at m-pesa which is this uh payment system in Africa that was on mobile phones and I think the number one problem is this identity problem and the reason it worked in Africa is because the cellular companies all made this like Federation and you could kind of like they agreed to tell each other whether someone was a real person or routed the right way and he was like What if you could do that with blockchain and I was like okay how do you plan on doing that he's like I don't know there's got to be a way to do it and so I remember when I first heard this I was like this is [ __ ] crazy this is like this is like Silicon Valley hubris that we're going to give Ubi to everyone dot dot right like it started as a Ubi project it didn't start as like identity project the the identity thing was about give a Distributing Ubi but then it was sort of like a McGuffin like the end goal wasn't the thing that it became like the the thing that you have to do to get to the end goal was the main plot in the story and that's like what you have now but yeah I just I find it a little bit distasteful in the way the token was launched and I think they're going to have a very hard time coming back from that yeah I so I will say to to wilcoins credit obviously we've all kind of said the main things that there are to say in terms of critiquing them um I the one thing I will say about worldcoin is that it is a big vision and that is one thing that I think a lot of people in crypto have been missing for the last year I mean when you have that many eyeballs that is a big amount of vision wow great 10 out of 10 dad joke thank you Robert um I yeah it is it is ambitious and it's also I mean it is more or less exactly what we were talking about which is that almost everybody's trying to build infrastructure where are the people building applications and I mean it's not exactly application yeah this is an application but also people do it is kind you know yeah it's a spectrum it's crypto right you get you take what you can get I think at least the better version of worldcoin that I hope will happen but unfortunately investors will require a Sam Alton like figure to make this thing not sound like it was deranged suddenly going into actually existing uh is just like attested sensors in general like this idea that like the sensor generates some proof of identity that wasn't generated by a computer that's in general going to be one of the biggest applications like I just don't and I feel like World coin can completely [ __ ] up be AOL and the AOL Time Warner merger but like still we'll have at least given people this idea that like this you can actually do this at scale which I cares about here's my idea here's my startup idea for some crazy founder out there you make World coin without the orb where you could just use the webcam right in front of you and like everyone could just like go on their computer and get 10 coins there's no 25 for some team it's just like everyone who can scan their face onto the computer and rotate their face and do all that gets 10 coins and that's your fairly distributed crypto asset bad news for you about what uh video generation works these days yeah I I was about to be like there's no way you can yeah a tensor thing though is is real like that yeah that that's going to be the future the question is how do you get the hardware costs for it down enough that yeah anyone and their mom could write what Robert just described but like your webcam happens to have an attested sensor and it costs 10 bucks put the adjusted sensor in the webcam yeah yeah I mean I was going to say I think the reason the Optics of the order obviously Optics or obviously weird
