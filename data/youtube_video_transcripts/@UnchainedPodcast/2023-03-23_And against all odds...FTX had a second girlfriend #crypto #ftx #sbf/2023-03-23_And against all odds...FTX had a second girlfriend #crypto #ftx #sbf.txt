bear claws are only my second favorite claw today STX is entered into an agreement to claw back 99 of the value of the assets held at modulo Capital a so-called obscure crypto fund AKA crypto fought SPF funded last year Angelo Capital was founded in March 2022 by two people one of whom was romantically involved with SBF from two of SBS X's were getting rich off FTX money it was like that's what they liked about him SBF claims to have given modulo Capital 75 million dollars less than he actually gave him his defense 75 million dollars to SPF is nothing that's what like two extra weeks in jail unfortunately it does represent 99 of modulo's total assets which is like the time Mark Zuckerberg pledged 99 of his wealth to charity except in this case I think modulo actually is going to have to pay up now FTX and Alameda have to give up their claims to modulus which seems fine that's like sending her food back to the chef after you've licked the plate clean SPF is not immediately responded to requests for comments but if we know SBF it should be about 13 seconds
