welcome to forbs podcasts hi everyone welcome to Unchained a forbs podcast produced by fractal recording I'm your host Lauren a Forbes contributor covering blockchain cryptocurrencies and FinTech thanks for tuning in if you've been listening to the show and like what you've been hearing it please review rate and subscribe to Unchained on iTunes or wherever you get your podcasts it helps spread the word about the show for today's episode I'm speaking with Gerry Britto and Peter Van Valkenburg executive director and research director respectively of coin Center a nonprofit research and advocacy center focused on the public policy issues facing blockchain and cryptocurrencies hi Gerry and Peter welcome to the show thanks for having us hey Gerry let's start with you how did you learn about Bitcoin and blockchain and come to fun coin Center so I first heard about Bitcoin in February 2011 on a security podcast that I listened to and it sort of hit all the right buttons for me my whole career I'd spent in technology and policy and I sort of fell down a rabbit hole and I was very lucky being the right place at the right time somebody working in technology policy in Washington DC at a time where very few people were paying attention to this and so I began to write about it began to ask people around town DC on the hill of federal agencies are you guys thinking about this and people really weren't and some who sort of had closer jurisdiction may be worth it had to have heard of it and knew they should be paying attention but there were warrants and so again I was at the right place the right time began to write about it I said the Mercatus Center at George Mason University at the time and eventually developed something called Bitcoin a primer for policy makers which was an introduction to a technology I works why it's important and what are the regulatory implications and in 2013 helped the Senate Homeland Security Committee develop the first hearings on Bitcoin testified at those hearings so again just really was very lucky to be at the right place at the right time to sort of be a DC guy on this technology and around the same time there again increasing interest from government about this technology policymakers were getting to see it you know this intersected with consumer protection with anti-money laundering rules with tax rules with commodities and securities rules and so they're going to be paying attention to this and they wanted to ask questions about it but there's nobody you know couldn't pick up the phone and call Bitcoin and so it sort became apparent that there needed to be a serious incredible resource center for not the industry because we don't represent the industry but for the technology and so myself and some other folks who were interested in seeing that happen found it quite sire about two years ago that's some really interesting distinction you make between the technology industry what do you mean by that so coin Center is because you mentioned is an independent nonprofit and what that means is that we're not a trade association so we are more like the Electronic Frontier Foundation more like the EF F which represents the rights of users to use the internet for the Internet to remain open and we're less like and probably not like all the Internet Association which represents the interests of Google and Facebook right so so while the Internet Association and the e FF have lots in common a lot of the same interest at stake one represents industry and is you have corporate members that direct your organization the other is an independent nonprofit it sets its own agenda and is really looking out for the technology to remain free and open and that's what we are we exist to make sure that open blockchain networks remain free and open and that users have a right to use them and that to the extent there will be regulation that that regulation is rational and that it is a slight cut as possible and how do you do that what does coin Center do so you know at horror mission is is to make sure that open blockchain networks get the same regulatory treatment that the early internet right so the early the early internet boomed and flourished into what we have today in large part because the government policy was one of being completely hands-off and to the extent that was necessary to regulate for there to be light touch regulation and that was the explicit policy of the United States towards the internet and that worked out very well and so we want to replicate that for open blockchain networks and we do that really in three ways we do education we do public policy research and we do advocacy so the education piece is where we spend probably most of our time especially half over the past two years and that is simply making sure that regulators members of Congress books and state legislatures at all different levels have the information that they need about technology how does it work just basically basic clear up any misunderstandings about how the technology operates how it works and we answer those questions what regulations might be affected and so we do that through backgrounders that we publish that are sort of short just the facts sort of primers on discrete topics of a technology that's there on our website we do that through one too many briefings one-on-one briefings meetings now as we have these conversations eventually we get to questions where we don't have the answers to those questions and that's because there are typically questions with law on policy where the law has out paper I should say the technology has outpaced law where the technology now allows for things the law never contemplated and so there's a gray area there's a gap and regular is going to be looking to fill those gaps and so that's where the second thing that we do comes in and at the policy research and really what Peter leads a coin Center so there we engaged in the policy thinking and develop sort of the policy positions of how should you fill those gaps that regulators will will fill yeah you know if left to their own devices they will fill them but we want to help them by developing thinking that says here's the gap here's the issue here are different alternative ways that you might fill that gap and here's our preferred route because it's a route that allows you to regulator to meet your end but in doing so you don't do any inadvertent harm and you do it in the most like touch-a possible way that preserves the freedom to innovate for innovators and in the last thing we do is advocacy which means lobbying right so we lobby on behalf of those preferred policy outcomes we will testify at hearings are there in Congress which of legislators people filed regulatory comments sort of advocating for this preferred possible solutions and just out of curiosity how where do you get your funding so our funding about half of our funding so we are our budget is about million dollars a year where our staff of five three of us are attorneys and about half of our funding comes from individuals just individual persons who care very much about this technology the other half comes from investors and companies in the space and among those we're very happy to have really some of the top people in space including in Teresa Horowitz and Union Square Ventures and digital currency group as well as coinbase big bit goes a bow circle blockchain that info you know I hesitate to begin to solicit them because I'm afraid I'm going to leave some out but anybody you can think of but also some of the newer players including Z cash the etherium foundation block stack you know basically from across the landscape okay and I'm Peter how did you learn about Bitcoin and how did you win it by coin Center sure sure so I guess it was I think it was my first year of law school at NYU and a friend of mine was chatting with me on gchat he's the two of I were always the dorks back in high school and he told me about Bitcoin this movement year it's 2011 yeah this new electronic currency and I got real close to setting up a mining node actually and inevitably I think it was probably exam season for first years at law school and if you know what that's like that's miserable so I kind of lost interest unfortunately in this mining node which was one of my bigger regrets going forward I've always been sort of a self-loathing liberal arts grad who always partially wished that he dropped out and just learned to code but anyway focused on technology policy law because of probably that regret and also because the space is really fascinating throughout law school mostly looking at digital copyright law and digital privacy my sort of hero legislation is the Digital Millennium Copyright Act not the anti-circumvention provisions but specifically the safe harbor for noticin take down which makes copyright a little less onerous for intermediaries like Google and really allowed those companies to flourish and make the internet as useful as it became and I always think that without those laws we would have seen probably the migration of a lot of companies away from the US and Silicon Valley would probably not be the thing that we know it all today as this hub for innovation so I thought I'd be focusing on copyright and I said like I said digital privacy wasn't long after that the Snowden revelations came out after I graduated from NYU law and I worked at a think tank in DC under a Google policy fellowship grant which is a fantastic program but again still working on once a copyright issues and and privacy and keeping Bitcoin in the back of my head something that I would tinker with and play with and think about and regret not mining those years earlier until Jerry we share a lot of mutual friends from his time at Merck ADIS and George Mason Jerry came to me and said hey Peter do you want to be the director of research at a Bitcoin think-tank and I think I laughed and I said that's that's ridiculous no such thing exists and don't be the right mind would do that but then a minutes later of course said absolutely yes where I sign up and that was two years ago now a little bit more now and we've just been making a go of it and it's been by far the most exciting legal policy work I think I could have ever imagined probably more exciting than what I imagined because copyright and digital privacy are areas that the internet disrupted existing expectations of what could be enforced a lot has already happened a lots already been written and in many cases were at a sort of stalemate between the need to enforce existing laws and the capabilities of the technology and where we draw the line as to what's possible and what needs to be prohibited whereas with Bitcoin that line is not a line it's a big big fuzzy gray area and that means there's so much work that I think we can do to move the needle on the future of permissionless innovation here as compared to say with with more traditional internet technologies in so what is your role Bennett coin Center sure so I'm I'm the director of research which which means a few things so as Jerry said our main job especially in our first year operation was education you know somebody at the Treasury someone in Congress or a staffer they want to be able to call Bitcoin to ask you know hey what are you doing there is no CEO of Bitcoin so coin Center plays a role where we can help educate them about what the technology is what people are doing with it and so for me that means especially coming out with a series of really plain-english explainers that in 2,000 words or less deal with a discrete topic of the technology so something like how private is it how anonymous is it because of course there are these rumors that bitcoin is this perfect you know nebulous dark network that is perfect for facilitating you know drug deals and things like that as it turns out of course bitcoin is actually surprisingly transparent and with blockchain forensics law enforcement can actually get a pretty good picture into what people are doing and how money is moving around in the Bitcoin network so we have a background err that as I said it's a short piece that's written in non tech speak and it's actually written by Adam Ludwin in this particular case he wrote our privacy background er I think you had him on on your show before and it just lays out you know this is this is what visibility we actually have into transactions and it's not nearly as anonymous as its famed and we also write some of the background errs I have the luxury of getting to write the background err on mining which is always sort of the doomsday question when you're talking with a policymaker say okay sure peer to peer money that sounds great but what's this mining thing and there's all kinds of issues there stemming from in part the choice of the word mining when in reality what they're doing is validating signatures on transaction messages and be rewarded for that but then you have to say Oh what is signature validation mean and oh we're gonna explain elliptical curves now so finding a way to explain that any number of other things in plain English is is a big part of my work but then as Jerry said whenever we have conversations with policy Maker's about what the technology enables inevitably there comes this point where they say well we regulate some of those activities and we're used to regulating the financial institutions that would have performed those activities for people what happens when people are performing these activities on their own how does the law which is usually calibrated or written to intersect by regulating intermediaries how does the law apply to direct personal interaction with a protocol like Bitcoin or aetherium for that matter so figuring out the policy thinking that needs to be developed in order to present as Jerry said the various avenues that regulators might choose because they're going to choose an avenue being able to present those different avenues what it would look like to regulate in one way versus another and then also finally advocate for an for an avenue that we believe would allow the regulator to feel like they've upheld their statutory obligations they are tasked by Congress to regulate but still preserve the freedom to innovate that is an always an interesting question in this space so to go back to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act for example you've had copyright liability that applied to third parties who shared content basically so the user uploads a video to YouTube and Google gets in trouble even though it wasn't Google that uploaded the video the DMCA was an avenue of enforcing copyright law that still had some fidelity towards the purposes of copyright law we're still going to enforce some of copyright law here but we can't do it in a way that presents massive liabilities to Google so we choose a compromise we choose the notice and takedown system you can ask to have a video removed and if Google has a system for allowing people to ask and complying with those asks of challenging them when they're frivolous then we can move forward with Bitcoin it's very much the same thing so multi-sig wallets is a great example some of the stuff that say like Ben and Mike at bit go have work done in a multi-sig wallet situation you have someone who's looks almost like a a financial institution you know there's this wallet product the customer puts their bitcoins in this online wallet product right but for those of us who know the technology bit goes wallet and any multi-sig wallet is much more exciting than that it's not that you're giving your bitcoins to accompany it's that they've given you a software platform that will allow you to generate these three keys and you the customer can hold two of them and--but those just they're holding a third key in case anything ever happens to one of your keys so this is a great situation for say consumer protection in the financial context because bit go is not a fiduciary custodian in this case if they were to get hacked or if those guys were to go crazy which they're not gonna they're awesome guys but if something terrible was to happen to bit go the consumer still has control over their money that's a an amazing new business model as compared with the normal custodial and you know we hold your money for you type model if you see in financial institutions how does consumer protection regulation apply to a company like that should they get a money transmission license we don't think that that makes sense at all because they're not custodial they don't have that sort of solvency risk but how do you write or interpret existing money transmission laws such that they go is not included in those existing regulatory rules basically you need to come down to a definition of what it means to actually control bitcoins on behalf of someone else and bit go as I think many people would agree and we've made good progress convincing many policy makers on this on this point does not have control of your bitcoins they store one key of three they are a backup recovery service they are not a custodian so coming up with that definition of control trying to get it into new regulations when they come from the states say the New York bit license or California is a B 1326 trying to make regulators aware of the differences between say a multi-sig wallet a software wallet and a hosted wallet or fully custodial wallet that's where the policy research really comes in where we try and develop legal language and advocacy materials that will push for as I said this way forward where we can still protect consumers but do it in a way that doesn't jeopardize the vibrancy of the technology and the vibrancy of the American innovative scene these details are super fascinating like these kind of you know case examples that you're giving like I love that story um and I know coin sent a recent celebrated recently celebrated it's too near the anniversary what happened its main accomplishments during that time and you know if you have really specific examples like that that's great so I you know I think you can divide it into two buckets one maybe is more on the defense the other one more sort of proactive and on the defense again it's mehar 2.21 thing because it's more about education and making sure that policymakers don't make easy to avoid mistakes and it it's it's making sure that regulators understand the technology and don't do something stupid and I it's hard to tell stories that don't make a particular policymaker look stupid but but we've had situations where you know a member of Congress will be very concerned about the illicit uses of of Bitcoin or other crypto currencies and they may be thinking of holding a hearing about this and we're able to go in there and talk to them when you're thinking about that and say you really don't need to hold a hearing about this because we're happy to answer all your questions and and actually law enforcement is doing very well going after bad guys here and also this technology is making you know consumers much better off it's something you would appreciate and then the hearing doesn't happen so it's so a lot of that is what we do is sort of avert things that otherwise go wrong behind the scenes morgan seeds it's like the FBI then you only get noticed for your failures never for your success that's right that's right on that foreigners too I mean I'm sort of the one thing we have done is we helped found something called the blockchain aligned which is a public-private forum between law enforcement and many of the companies in the industry as well is that could that make some nonprofits like wine center yeah Jason and Malin we're on the show yeah great and so you know what it does is very simple it's just sort of a clearinghouse where when law enforcement has questions about the technology or where we send the subpoena they have a clearinghouse of being able to talk to exchanges and others in the industry who might be able to answer those questions and it's also very good because it does a couple things it provides a clearinghouse service number two it helps longed-for understand the limits of what they can expect the industry and ecosystem to do because there's some you know questions that an exchange can't answer because they don't have the information and so making sure law enforcement understand the limits of what they can expect and ask is I think valuable to everybody at the same time these are small startups that are sometimes being overwhelmed by law enforcement requests and to the extent you can you can streamline those what also helps the small startups you know I think on the on the more proactive side it's a lot of work to Peter was just talking about which is developing the policy thinking that hopefully will become the policy that's adopted so give you some examples with that Peters talking about definition of control which is very important because those companies that have control of consumer funds are likely going to be subject to regulation they're going to subject to licensing subject to 90 money laundering regulations etc etc but those who do not have control should be completely outside of that so defining control is very important to make sure that we exclude multi SiC providers who exclude minors so we exclude nodes and a lightning network that we exclude software wallets should all be excluded and so I'm very happy to say that we've developed good policy thinking good language about what that definition is and it is one that now I think is largest it's becoming sort of consensus definition for example the uniform law Commission it is in its current draft of its national uniform act for digital currencies we hope that will pass next year so that's very important to us what does that give me so basically as you know each state has its own money transmission licensing regime so for example the New York bit license was probably the first one but each state has its own and with that the problem there is is it today you have dozens of states individually coming up with their own regime of how they're gonna regulate you know Bitcoin or other digital currencies or other and specifically regulate the businesses that hold other people right playing for them it's one of the things a lot of people think Oh California is gonna regulate Bitcoin as if they're gonna regulate the whole thing and this is in some ways what we're trying to do is make sure they only regulate custodial companies but that's not that's not us usually fighting a regulator it's helping them understand there are some companies that hold other people's bitcoins they're basically like a bank or a money transmitter and there are some that are not they're doing something like mining they might just be a person in their basement running a full node that relays transactions does that person transmit money no they're transmitting Bitcoin transaction messages but that's by no means that clear or obvious distinction to someone who doesn't understand this technology and it's important point because I think a lot of people think that we coin Center is pushing for regulation we want to see Bitcoin regulator we want to see these companies regulated and that's not the case we think about it this way if we say nothing regulators will regulate in that regulation that they develop will encompass not just the custodial companies but it will encompass potentially the miners in a lightning nodes and this person in their home who has and know that they're running in or you know it's an encompass all these people so the alternative to that is that yes we advocate for regulation because it will be regulation that is much more limited and limited to only those people who really should be regulated because they are holding customers bonds imposing their risk so that said you have to do that state by state because each state is developing its own law and that's very cumbersome and wieldy and then you have you can imagine being a company that needs to get 50 licenses it's very expensive time-consuming and each state's gonna have a different law a little a little bit different so the uniform law Commission is a national body of mostly academics and some regulators and they develop uniform laws for example Uniform Commercial Code which governs contracts which is adopted by just about every state country comes from that you all see the ulc develops uniform laws that then the states are free to adopt and today they're developing a uniform digital currency act uniform regulation of digital currency business business it's a great I don't even know what the abbreviation for that would be so we so so our definition of control has been influential there and then same thing in security space our thinking on securities regulation of cryptocurrency issuance I think has been very influential yeah can you talk about that a little bit more because I know that this summer there were a number of like blog posts that VCS are writing and we are seeing some buzz about these new networks that are offering what people are sometimes calling app coins right um where you know you need their token to operate on their network whether it's you know some kind of just centralized Dropbox service thing or like a decentralized reddit or whatever it might be we there have been other guests that have spoken about this trend so you know what is it that you are seeing from the regulators in terms of their attitude toward these so the question there has always been is Bitcoin of security is a theorem or ether a security you know when is a token the coin a security and if it's a security well who is the issuer who is the promoter did they register with the SEC did they follow the rules and for us we've seen many different enforcement actions from the SEC over the years but they've certainly been through tangential to Bitcoin and other digital currencies because they've been enforcement actions where you had a clear ponzi scheme something like Bitcoin settings and trusts where the guy promised you know outsides returns and he was just paying new customers with old customer money right poor old customers new customers in fact you would be a bad but it just so happened that the payment system there was Bitcoin he would you know he could've been using dollars it could've been using bananas it just so happened that it was Bitcoin and then when the SEC enforced against a typical Ponzi scheme Bitcoin is in the headline then the SEC had to say something like investments made using Bitcoin are still investments under our test for securities but that's a fairly obvious thing you're not gonna suggest that people never invest bitcoins and things of course they do what we were we saw though and this is probably too you know a year and a half ago what we saw though is that there would soon come a case there would soon come a time when the SEC would have to bring an enforcement action against a Ponzi scheme of some kind where the security in question was in fact a cryptocurrency and what very much looked like that was a case called pea coin and the SEC is presently investigating paid coin and pay point was an open crypto currency network with mining it was a flake staking I keep saying my name keeps close to me it's proof mistake not proof of work but it is an open source code repository that was forked from pure coin which was for from light coin for from Bitcoin just as so many other alt coins have been forked and developed many of them totally not scams very interesting projects aetherium probably being one of the most interesting and certainly most well adopted second - bitcoin right now and so you know when SEC they're investigating now they probably will charge the folks who issued pay point and promised the people who were buying pay coin from them that Amazon would soon integrate pay coin they were promising that the their company would always pay a floor $20 for these tokens so people bought them with an expectation of profit given the promotion that they had done and then these people you know made the money and ran away pay coin collapsed at some point something like that the SEC is gonna say this is a security and so the question would be for us was going to always be when the SEC says that peak winds the security are they going to simply say pay coins the security or are they gonna say crypto currencies are securities which would be bad because something like Bitcoin really should not be considered and even if they said pay fines the security and left it at that it would leave open the question ok well but that was a cryptocurrency so what differed about pay coin versus say Bitcoin or aetherium or steam or any of the other tokens out there what differed between pay coin of those other tokens that may pay coin of security of these other things not a security and if nothing differed or if they're silent on the matter of what different then we're all in a sort of again a big legal gray area which is which is unsettling for entrepreneurs in this space I think so you think oh I have this great idea for this app token that'll power a decentralized platform that'll allow people to come together online and agree on something like the best posts on a reddit like thing or something like that but maybe I don't want to do this because I don't want the SEC knocking on my door for failing to register as offering the security and that's quite reasonable because actually the penalties for failing to register as offering a security and issuing it nonetheless are very strong they're very you know they're calibrated to stop that behavior at any cost basically and so the question is easy I think one of competitiveness and it is a question about US laws specifically coin Center aspires to be fairly global in scope but our expertise is very much with US laws but in the securities context that's actually probably the right focus anyway international securities laws generally are drafted in a way that's much more circumscribed where the securities regulator has the power to basically come in and enumerate through rulemaking of sorts what things are securities and what things are not in the US there's no such rule making and enumeration there's a flex test which was actually set by the federal courts for what kinds of innumerable scams and that's actually a quote from the Howey case will be the sort of scams that we regulate as securities and this four-part test which I won't go into the specifics of can be applied flexibly it can be applied to cover any different type of offering and potentially something like pay coin would fit very well into that test well can you actually go into the specifics because as far as I can understand really well geek out it'll be good so the Howey test has four parts it's an investment of money in a common enterprise with the expectation of profits dependent or reliant on the efforts of a third-party promoter investment common enterprise expectation of profits third-party promoter and if you meet these then you are a security or issuing a security in which case all these regulations apply right right so you can see how this is an open test and actually the case for that that that test was formed was a case about an orange grove so it's the Howey test and the guy in question in this case was WJ Howey who owned an orange grove in florida he would invite rich New Englanders to come vacation a winter in Florida stay at the hotel near the orange grove he tore the orange grove with them and the New Englander would say something like oh the orange groves they're so beautiful and then WJ Howey would say well it's funny you should say that the groves are for sale and then they basically negotiate a deal where the new englander would buys I'm a New Englander I'm sorry I'm making New Englanders sound like suckers but the New Englander would buy a small tract of the Grove so he's partitioning this multi acre orange grove into little pieces and you would own this land you'd have a deed to it basically but you'd also sign a contract with WJ Howey where he would maintain the trees pick the fruit take the fruit to market sell it get a good price and give you the profits from your piece of the orange grove and what the Supreme Court said in the Howey test was this is not a real estate deal this is not people buying land in Florida because they want to live on it or develop it themselves they're buying they're investing their money in this common enterprise of growing oranges they're expecting profits because they expect the growth to be profitable and they're relying on WJ Howey to make this growth profitable this is a security this is the thing we're supposed to regulate doesn't matter that there's no you know fox or sadaqa certificate or formal or the formalities of offering a share it doesn't matter that all you have is what they say what they call in the case a nominal interest in the assets of the enterprise so I know I just seem to just talk about oranges for the last two minutes and this sounds crazy it's just it's just a pig well no it's just like pay coins not like bitcoins that's not like and so our framework basically goes in and looks just to say what our framework is is you're asking about what sort of things we do sort of thinking accomplished so well seeing that this was gonna come we develop a framework this is partnered it's on are available on our website are my admission framework is there are security strain work is there where we lay out - how we test and we say this is how it applies to peercoin here's how it applies to Bitcoin these are different things and also now becomes very useful for people who are building a point based applications of you go ahead right actually let's talk about how it's not why bitcoin is yeah exactly exactly so so it's easy to start with white paper is so because we can look at the Howey case I'm selling off you know pieces of land that will grow fruit and I'm giving and you're getting at the profits from that this is a profitable deal where you own a nominal interest in the assets of the shared enterprise so hey coin josh garza the guy who who's the serial scam artist actually he had previous games before this who created pay poin is selling tokens from a decentralized well an open source at least cryptocurrency you're buying nominal interests to the assets of this this cryptocurrency as a common enterprise and who are you relying on when you expect profits from pay coin you're relying on the guy who has Jerry said promised Amazon integration said Amazon gonna Amazon if he's doing deal with the Amazon Amazon is not going to use Bitcoin you're gonna buy all your Amazon goods with tape will you be able to buy anything you want and you're gonna rely on the guy who promised that in two months after the pre-sales over will rebuy these these pay points from you at $20 because they'll probably be worth more than that but we want you to know there's always a guaranteed minimum value you're relying on this guy who's the only guy developing this software I mean it's a fork of peercoin so you go to the github repository you fork it you put your brand on it he changed like a couple lines of code honestly and there were some really sketchy stuff in there too like so as I said it's a proof of stake cryptocurrency where there's no mining you stake some of your value to take part in the consensus mechanism to do the transaction validation and to get rewarded there were some staking nodes that were specifically identified in the code that earned supernatural returns so so so so basically we have to ask ourself well who are those special stagers of course they were also the pay coin developers so everyone thinks this is just a very fair deal very open technology really what this is is a common Enterprise led by one scammy dude taking in investment giving out nominal interest to the assets of the common enterprise John Garza jr. and they're relying on Jeff Garza is WJ Howey of the 21st century or maybe he's Charles Ponzi actually because the cloud mining operation he had set up before that as I said he's a serial scam artist was an empty warehouse where he claimed to be giving you access to a Bitcoin mining rig but as as Jerry was saying he was really just paying old investors with new investors money so the sec is looking at Garza and has actually charged him for basically perpetrating a Ponzi scheme in this cloud mining operation they're going to turn to the next thing he did which is pay point and and they are looking into that now quite different so how is Bitcoin different how can they say pay coins selling these pay points is a security but selling bitcoins isn't a security and there are a number of things here so we go through the prongs was there an investment of money well people do invest their money in Bitcoin you need to meet all the though so if that one's met we're not doomed yet common enterprise with Bitcoin this is a really difficult thing to actually get your head around Bitcoin isn't really a common enterprise in the way that a going concern or a corporation is a common enterprise bitcoins like any industry there are all of these unaffiliated individuals unaffiliated developers unaffiliated corporations and companies working loosely together on the big remaining project very much like there are many people in the gold industry some of them are mining and out of the ground some of them are making jewelry out of it some of them are finding industrial uses for gold so this isn't a common enterprise because it would be absurd to call the gold industry a common enterprise if I buy a gold ring or a piece of gold bullion I'm not relying on any particular company in that space to back up the value of my purchase or to make profits from that purchase I'm relying on an industry and we don't regulate the entire goal of the industry as the issue of the security so Bitcoin looks more like a commodity in that sense than a security whereas pay point we really were relying on one corporation on one going concern so that's one of the main reasons Bitcoin doesn't fit another useful question though is say why doesn't aetherium fit why doesn't a nap token for a decentralized reddit why doesn't that fit because maybe there's fewer people working on this thing maybe it is a bit more you know cohesive or coordinated and not quite as distributed what saves those things that are are not scams and are really cool innovations from being classified as securities we get into this in our framework as well and the the logic for what why those things aren't securities but aren't good fits for securities under the under the Howey test and The Associated case law is kind of interesting comes from lines of cases about condominium sales and about golf courses so just those two points just to go into them there's a history especially inside New York City of selling coop shares in real estate and people buy them to live in the apartment building they don't buy them because they expect to profit wildly from owning a share of this real estate development and the building's already so it's not really a speculative investment it's something you could do just to live in it or rent it out in a number of cases the federal courts have said that those are not securities owning those shares even if they appreciated that even if many of you buy them in speculative you buy them as a speculative intent in mind you buy them because you could use it because you could live there it is an accurate scan utilitarian Valley that's not something of course if you buy the buy the apartment in the giant Tower in New York City right now that has 10-foot by 10-foot windows and is taller than the Empire State Building you probably are expecting that it's gonna be a good investment although it might be over over later probably I think that who knows but the bottom line is there's a utilitarian value to that thing and that in the line of cases has saved those offerings from being considered securities you can think of this in the case of Kickstarter as well where people will give money to get a kegel like a pebble smartwatch which I'm wearing right now actually I love go pebble that's not a security because basically you're given your money in order to get the useful thing I got I have this watch that's what I want so something like aetherium is useful you actually need ether in order to run smart contracts so a lot of buzz about smart contracts but there are some fundamentals there that are very real the programmatic algorithmic control of money to do cool things to automatically pay people for providing valuable computing resources to automatically pay people dependent on the results of some sort of smart contract that measures I don't know whether it's raining in Peoria or not those are really cool applications and the only way you can build an open decentralized platform for powering smart contracts is by having a scarce token that rewards people for giving their computing power to that shared network as a resource so you need either to do that and you need either to run smart contracts just as you need a home to live in it you might buy home also for its speculative value you need ether to use it for smart contracts and you might buy it also for its speculative value saved from being a security if we use this same condominium case law as an analogy for the etherium is it ether is referred to as gas in many ways it's the same thing you buy gasoline to power you can also stockpile gasoline the expectation that it's gonna go up and press exactly exactly so the other line is security so the other line of cases is golf courses and I'll try to be brief with that one the golf course Country cup cases talk about when you sell an interest in the thing whether you sell it before you've built the thing or after you've built the thing so this is why this is relevant you're probably already thinking about pre-sales of app tokens basically which there have been many of in the history of golf course development something our possible future president knows a lot about and might have been sued actually for we should be interesting but anyway lots of people would decide to sell memberships to the Country Club before the Country Club was built they like get in the ground floor and the new Lynx in Scotland it's going to be worth a lot in the future those offerings were treated as securities by the federal courts in other cases where the Golf Course is already built and memberships are being sold those offerings were not treated as securities more like the qua this leads us to something so for example steam which is an apt token that creates a decentralized reddit did not do a preset that's very good at least in my opinion for an appraisal of whether steam is a security steam is also useful so some of the same arguments we've discussed in the etherium context are there steams also decentralized other people can run and develop steam clients it's not just one company but a big thing about steams initial token distribution is that there was no presale so it's kind of like these golf course cases we're not saying hey by these golf course memberships or these memberships to the future decentralized Reddit and then we'll build it and it will be awesome we're saying hey you want to get access to be able to vote up content or vote down content here's an access token it's a membership to use a thing not a speculative investment anything right that's very interesting that steam got that part right I know there is some talk in the community but they didn't get other aspects right because I think the distribution of the tokens maybe is a little bit less than ideal at the moment but that's well but but you raise an interesting point and you're not talking about securities law when you talk about it you're talking about which is very cool you're talking about community norms one of the amazing things though about these community norms is that they actually die pretty well with the Howey test as if there's really nothing new Under the Sun scams look like scams and Nan scams don't look like scams and communities have always evolved to try and ferret out the scams by having norms like hey you should do your distribution this way hey you shouldn't take money from people without some sort of obvious like basis for the value of your thing until it's on the table and securities law has evolved in this context as well and it's kind of cool to think that even when we move into the world of crypto finance or whatever scary term you want to label it we still have the same community norms evolving people criticizing other people for offering things that they don't think are right but we also might have the same legal flexibility in the same legal tests that still be just as applicable like the Howey test and its associated case law and you mentioned the upcoming election and you know you guys are two years and you know this summer we saw a proposal to have a pro national Bitcoin policy the SEC is going to have this FinTech forum where they talk about blockchain technology you know just briefly in a couple lines how would you say the attitude of policymakers and legislature legislators have changed and what might we expect the impact to be from the election so the heartening thing you know sort of working in this in earnest for two years and even for a few years before that has always been that policymakers especially in Congress especially at the higher policy-making levels and administration are very open and receptive to this technology and they're open to innovation and they want to see it flourish in the United States that's important to them so it's been very positive right the concern about illicit uses and the more and the closer you get down to the lower levels within particular agencies that have jurisdiction either with on money laundering or securities they're gonna have more and more concerns but its concerns that you can address so that sort of generally been the attitude I you know I the elections are going to have it's going to be interesting right so I know that Hillary Clinton's transition team in the technology paper did mention blockchain technology broadly and so I think there's just a general positive attitude there Donald Trump has not really said much about this it's a question mark there but you know Republicans often you know or more free market in an orientation and so you get you can imagine they might be sort of receptive to to a light touch approach I think what's going to be more interesting is how Congress ends up and how the balance of power is because right now nothing is happening in Washington nothing is getting through Congress and so to the extent you want to have a national policy that's favorable to cryptocurrencies you need things like a safe harbor for non-custodial uses of these technologies right that says to the states you shall not permission you shall not require a license from those firms that are not did not pose risks that's something we'd like to see come out of Congress like the multi-state companies we were talking about earlier for example but also miners and any number of other yeah and so we hope we end up with a sort of arrangement between the House the Senate and the White House that can work together to pass pro innovation policy great well where can people learn more about coin Center and get in touch with you so if you visit coin Center org you'll see everything you need
