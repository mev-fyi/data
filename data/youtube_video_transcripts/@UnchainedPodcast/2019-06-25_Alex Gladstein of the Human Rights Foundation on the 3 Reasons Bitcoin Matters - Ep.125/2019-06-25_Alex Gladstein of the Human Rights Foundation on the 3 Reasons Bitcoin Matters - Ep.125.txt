singularity university welcome Alex thanks for having me Laura in a short time you and the Human Rights foundation have become visible forces and advocates for Bitcoin and decentralize technologies but before we get to your work in the blockchain space let's start with some background what does the human rights foundation do the human rights foundation promotes Civil and Political liberties like free speech freedom of and from religion freedom of assembly the right to participate in your government and we promote these rights and we protect these rights in what we call closed societies or authoritarian countries countries that are ruled by some sort of repressive government whether it's a dictatorship or a king or a tyrant or a military junta and something that surprised me when I was researching this was that it was just founded in 2005 incorporated in 2005 and we started operations in 2006 correct and it would have been the biggest campaign so far well in many ways Thor Halvorssen our founder started the Human Rights Foundation as a reaction to what wasn't happening with regard to the world's worst human rights violations so there were a lot of countries and still are unfortunately ranging from North Korea to Eritrea to Uzbekistan where they don't get a huge amount of media attention in certain aspects and there's just not a lot of funding or support available to help people inside and the human rights foundation is in many ways kind of like acting as a voice for the voiceless and as a support network for people who live under these extremely repressive environments and it's a lot more people than you might think roughly four billion people billion with ABI live under an authoritarian government today and those are people that can't do some things that you might take for granted for example they can't write an op-ed in the newspaper they can't sue their government they have no real way to hold their government accountable they can't just start a non-profit like an Amnesty International or like a Greenpeace they can't really do a fective environmental work they can't do good good effect the whistleblowing work they can't even really do good work when it comes to you know the areas of labor rights or even religion so there's a vast percentage about 52 percent of humanity whose rights and freedoms are really restricted in this way in HRF was founded because it's not just for moral reasons that we want to make sure that everybody has human rights it's not just because it's the right thing it also affects everything about humanity so just to give your listeners some data something like 96% of all refugees come from authoritarian countries something like 18 of the top 20 poorest countries the ones that are in the most abject poverty 18 of those 20 countries are dictatorships 23 of the top of 25 countries with the worst access to drinking water our dictatorships and if you look at things like patent rates literacy rates violence death homicides all of these things are not just correlated but causally linked with bad governance so we believe that no matter what you care about whether it's peace or gender equality or religious tolerance or scientific innovation or having a good welfare state no matter what you care about you know in your life and what you care about for humans democracy and human rights matter so since my podcast isn't really a political podcast and if my listeners are anything like me their news intake is pretty high in crypto but somewhat low and everything else I just want to quickly and briefly define some terms that I imagine you'll probably use fairly frequently throughout this episode so first just what our human rights so Human Rights is an umbrella concept that can cover a lot of things I'm using it primarily to describe civil and political rights which are similar to what's in the u.s. the Bill of Rights the the UA in the US Constitution the UN's International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which was came to existence three four decades ago so these are things like again the right to protest the right to participate in your government the right to speak freely the right to believe what you want to believe the right to be free from torture unjust punishment the right to privacy etc this is traditionally what what what I mean when I when I say Human Rights I'm talking about basically rights and liberties and then earlier when you were talking about like I saw harrion government so how would you define that in is the opposite always democracy or like what type of government you know are you sure the human rights foundation as a nonprofit generally looks at government's and breaks them down into three types there are fully authoritarian governments where power is invested in tirely and one person or one small group of people this would be for example in North Korea in China in Cuba and Saudi Arabia different formats but the same general idea then they're competitive authoritarian countries so this would be something like Hungary for instance which is a country where there's a political party that's eroding power from the opposition and kind of creating like a you're seeing a dictatorship start to be born what what competitive authoritarian states do is rigged elections they stack their cronies on the judiciary they start to kind of manipulate the legislature they attack independent media and a third type of government was what we would call the world democracy more or less so these are you know more or less free and open countries there's no black and white from Norway to North Korea is an enormous amount of shades of grey right but generally speaking these are the three types of governments that we analyze and we focus our efforts on helping people who live under competitive authoritarian States and and fully authoritarian States and what are the problems in human rights that you think cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies could help resolve well it's interesting because I think the human rights background for me and the time spent with people who live and who suffer under and who work under authoritarian governments actually gave me a respect for the revolution that Bitcoin started when you think about the issue of control and what do governments control and how do they control people a lot of it starts with money and economics but you don't really think of it that way so for example at most Human Rights conferences currency and payments and comics are not on the agenda at all but then again what happens when a dictator wants to shut down a non-profit what happens when mr. Putin for example wants to close down an independent media outlet one of the first things they do is shut down their bank account right when a government wants to sort of persecute a particular group of people for example they may make that group of people not able to to purchase certain things or they may get sort of closed them out of a certain part of the economy when one government wants to hurt another government they often engage in financial sanctions there may be financial surveillance attached to certain technology in certain authoritarian States so when you start thinking about payments and about money and about how money works you realize that they're intrinsically tied together and a really really great newsworthy example of this would be recently in Hong Kong protesters knew that if they used their Octopus cards which is kind of like an oyster card or a metro card a little card that they used to access the public transit system in Hong Kong students knew that if they used their student Octopus cards which were linked to their identity to go to the protest that the government would see that they had gone to the protest they didn't want that didn't want to be spied on so there were massive lines of people waiting at the machines which they normally don't do to buy little cash top-up cards and I thought that was a really good example of how payments and money are linked to basic civil liberties and civil rights yeah so let's now shift to your story how did you first hear about Bitcoin I think one of the first times I heard about it was in 2014 when I read Mark Anderson's New York Times article about Bitcoin which I think still today is one of the best articles about Bitcoin I also had some friends at the time who are organizing a fun little festival in central California in the Sacramento River Delta called the ephemeral and that eat that summer I went there and I happened to be on a houseboat with Brock Pierce and rock was certainly very excited about Bitcoin at the time I still is didn't used to be and he was an evangelist for it and he really put it on our radar at the time it wasn't until a few years later though that I realized that there might be an intersection with the work that I did at the Human Rights Foundation there's a investor named Bill Tye who I know you know well who was I think the third guest on my podcast yeah I mean Bill's been in the space for a long long time and he was at one of our events in 2016 and he said well why don't we try and work together and at the time and he still is on the board of bitfury the mining company so bitfury with bills help was able to come out to the Oslo Freedom Forum in the spring of 2017 and start interacting with human rights activists and we started having conversations about financial sovereignty and financial privacy and how decentralized money might help people who live under very repressive governments and just learning about Bitcoin change your perspective on your human rights work yeah it's interesting I think it gave me a lot more hesitation and pause with regard to the status of freedom in democratic countries I had always had a lot of respect for and I still do of course for what democratic governments had achieved in terms of protecting certain types of civil liberties but the more you learn about the way money works and who controls it and how opaque it is and how elite it is and how closed of a system it is in terms of who gets to make the decisions about who prints money who makes money who monitors that who decides when to change things like interest rates even things like the Bank Secrecy Act in the United States these aren't things that normal people think about all the time and even in the human rights space I hadn't really thought about learning about Bitcoin got me a lot more curious about how money is created who gets to decide when a payment goes through and of course I had seen this a little bit with and I know a lot of people saw the WikiLeaks example in 2010 is like something that allowed this to come to the fore the news for a little while was that major payment processors like visa would blocking Julian Assange from receiving payments on instructions from the US government right and I think that that that that's that's a good example of ultimately why something like that coin is really important because at the end of the day it neutral payment platform nobody can decide that one person can't receive money or can't send it and in an age of increasing surveillance I think that's going to be increasingly important so as I started to learn more about Bitcoin I started to look more closely at my own surroundings and even I'm an American citizen I was pretty surprised at the level of financial surveillance that exists here the amount of control over money that the government exerts here even in what I would call a free country those really really shocking and surprising so that's one way that Bitcoin has kind of changed my opinion on the world and how did you start incorporating your interest in Bitcoin into your work well you know we talked to human rights activists and civil liberties campaigners and and civil society leaders from dozen from dozens of countries and very difficult political environments and we talked to them about you know what they need and a lot of them obviously need money I mean they need to fundraise and receiving that money is often difficult it's often something that can get delayed for long periods of time it's often something that can get frozen it's often something they're worried that the bank is gonna report to the government so here in a country like Zimbabwe or Russia there it may even be illegal for you to receive payments from abroad right from like a do-gooder who wants to help you burn abroad a philanthropist or a foundation right so you know I'm I'm hearing these complaints and these concerns which are of course decades old for human rights activists and I'm just sort of thinking to myself well you know we can just send you back you know what if what if you could just learn how to receive money with Bitcoin it's not that complicated and you know 2015 is different from today in 2019 today in most of the countries that were actually interested in there's like mass of local liquidity meaning there's an ability for you to turn Bitcoin at least into local currency whether it's Nigerian naira or Philippine pesos or Chinese renomii or you know venezuelan bolivar Iranian rial there is an ability within as little as a few minutes from when Bitcoin hits your wallet and has confirmed onto your wallet until when you can be holding local currency in your hand I mean we've been I've been interviewing people from different countries and through some of the countries I just mentioned we're talking about 10 15 20 minutes to attain change Bitcoin into local currency which makes it an extraordinarily effective way of moving at least relatively small amounts of money from one place to another so you were just talking about Bitcoin which I know you're a huge proponent of yes but then of course there are the other technologies in this space so one aim lay out for me sort of maybe all the things in crypto that you think could be helpful for fighting human rights and why yeah I mean I think I'll just also just break down the three things in Bitcoin tonight that I think are important and then we can talk about how other currencies may or may not have those things so we have the deflationary aspect of Bitcoin and the fact that governments can't print more of it this is very important it gives Bitcoin value it gives Bitcoin something that's quite special the censorship resistant nature of Bitcoin is really important the fact that a government can't stop a transaction even if it doesn't like you that's extremely important for human rights and that there's many aspects of Bitcoin but the third one that I'll just kind of point out is the permissionless nature of Bitcoin as a financial tool meaning you don't have to ask government's permission to receive a Bitcoin payment you don't have to have an ID or a passport so when we look at like the deflationary nature of Bitcoin the censorship resistant nature of Bitcoin and the permissionless nature of Bitcoin we have a pretty radical financial tool I think is quite revolutionary in the way that it changes the ability for people to transact with each other globally now when it comes to other projects and other values there are some extremely redeeming projects being done by people especially in the area of privacy obviously Bitcoin pseudonymous and there are some serious concerns about you know whether or not governments are using well we know that like European and American entities are using chain analysis procedures to track and try and you know observe and surveil people and actually prosecute them based on their Bitcoin activity it's unclear how many government they're doing that but it's clearly a large problem and the Bitcoin technological community you know hasn't really I don't think risen and completely to that challenge there are some people inside the development communities that have made amazing tools that do make it possible for you to at least not be the lowest hanging fruit if you practice good operational security we've done some research on this that was sponsored by the Z cash foundation actually into into the privacy of cryptocurrencies and Eric Wall has a privacy technology fellow at HRF did two really good pieces on you know just how private is Bitcoin No yeah first one was amazing in in both a software in the hardware point of view and and the answer is is not too dissimilar from like encrypted communications I mean it really depends on how how what how good is your operational security you know and even if you have perfect operational security you can still get compromised right so that's why projects like Z cash in Manero are very important not only are they for let's say very technically savvy users I think real options when it comes to needing to privately send money to each other they are aspirational meaning they they inspire everyone else in the industry and community to make more privacy features so I think that those are two projects that are that are quite important and then we have I think the the technology of the day or at least of this week which is a Facebook's project Libre right which I will say I think has probably a very large chance of having a really positive impact on humanity a lot of the things that I find really amazing about Bitcoin are its ability to do these kind of like vast borderless payments right now well we should be clear in as much as Libra as a piece as a money as a piece of technology is not decentralized it's controlled by a bunch of validators it's not censorship resistant and ultimately it least won't be at the beginning permissionless you're gonna according to the marketing materials I've seen you're gonna have to them prove your identity to open a caliber e-wallet to be able to to own and control Libra at least at the beginning they're promising a you know a transition to some sort of mission lists environment which of course sounds exciting but that's um that's something that's difficult to do once you have a permission system there are a lot of obstacles to that they wrote it don't do it over five years or something yes so we'll have to see I mean look I don't you know the question is do people trust Facebook on their promises and I think that's a really fair question to ask that that's almost a euphemistic statement yeah I think it's quite fair to distrust Facebook on everything they say but it's better that they say these things than not and I think anything from what I've seen so far it's only been a matter of hours as we sit here let's say since the technical details of what what Libra is supposed to be has been announced but from people I respect who are very technical and who look into things quite deeply in her very skeptical of most projects have actually said that like this seems like this was very impressively thought-out and it seems like it could it could be positive for the world again this would be a type of cryptocurrency that's that's not permit it doesn't have that permissionless feature that Bitcoin has it doesn't have that censorship resistant feature that Bitcoin has and it certainly doesn't have the deflationary aspect that Bitcoin has it's it's going to be a stable asset backed by fiat currencies right so it will probably track off course over time with things like the dollar and yen which are inflationary so what's interesting to me is that it has use and value but it doesn't compete at all with the three things that make Bitcoin really special to me so I think it's a very complementary technology now I've said a lot of positive things about Libra I think the main suspicions that I have are around privacy in the collection of information and behavioral and payment data I don't know exactly how this projects going to work I do know that they want companies and entities to pay a lot of money to be validators right and a lot of those people have already entered in those agreements and you have to think of like why would you want to be a validator right like what is what is in it for you and my fear is that over time validators will collect data about how payments work in a way that might be intrusive on tor into our lives and infringe upon our privacy's I certainly don't trust Facebook with my own data so I would ask you I mean do you trust them with your money I think that there is a possibility again that this is like a positive force and something that will help break down barriers hopefully between different economies and possibly be quite a good thing for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as it introduces potentially hundreds of millions of people to the idea of money that's not provided by the state right so that to me is is interesting but we have to be careful that we aren't building the world's largest financial surveillance machine I mean we know what happens when the ability to kind of control money is mixed with a near limitless ability to surveil you that's what's happening in China today with with WeChat this is an app that basically most urban Chinese people use for virtually everything and it knows an enormous amount about you and you use it for all your payments and payments say more about you than your words right so I think we need to be very skeptical about the privacy aspects of Libra thankfully it doesn't exist yet and we have time as I think like human rights activists as concerned members of the cryptocurrency industry as investors in Libra perhaps are listening to your to your show to to hold them as honest as possible with regard to how they're going to treat user data and how the system will work to make sure that it's not you know a basically a a personal data eating machine I think from what I've read and what I understand there are ways in which in which Libra can can be relatively privacy protecting they have pointed out that they would like to make this a pseudonymous currency kind of like Bitcoin which is surprising and certainly positive to hear but again we need to be worried about like what the validators are gaining you know from from running these these these validation notes and we need to be worried about how they can sort of chart payments and how they can potentially censor payments so the world needs to be like very focused on that and hopefully we can keep Facebook honest and we can keep the Liebherr project something that that is a net positive for humanity so I mean I'm sure you saw that they've been they are working with these other nonprofits so could you see yours your or the human rights foundation working with them we already work with Facebook as sort of I guess the mother entity and I think our strategy has been over the years we we also work with Twitter who's that I guess what I'm getting at is the human rights foundation works with tech companies because our philosophy is we would rather have them involved in this work than than not like I want these companies to be listening to the stories of human rights activists and to be understanding the challenges that people face in oppressive governments so in the same way that like the Facebook policy team may come to our events and be involved in our work yes we would love for the libre policy team to also be there or the libre engineers to also be there so they can understand some of the obstacles that people are facing around the world it sounds like from the marketing materials that libras very much targeted towards disenfranchised people yeah and I think that they need to be in touch with initiatives like the open money initiative and some of the other organizations that we work with at HRF so so that they can actually understand like what are the financial barriers that people face in these different countries and how can Libre be a force for good in these places I think yes that would be a really good dialogue to have all right so we're going to talk about the open money initiative a little bit later but I actually wanted to pick up on a couple of things you said one was you just mentioned something about the relationship between money and state would you how would you describe the healthy relationship between money and state well this might sound radical but I think in a hundred years people will look back in time and think that it was kind of crazy that there was a total monopoly on money by governments whether it was Democrat democracies or dictatorships I think that a healthier relationship is is probably something like where there's a separation of powers and I'll add some color to that in the same way that political power we now think of or at least I hope most your listeners think of tyranny or dictatorship is like a backwards idea backwards concept and that democracy ruled by the people is a more fair and just system and it provides checks on power checks on arbitrary power right then we have information right so I would also hope that your listeners would would maybe consider that the open Internet where anyone can permissionless lis access information is a better system of information than what we've had previously which was sort of like ivory tower and and government controlled information right so d centralizing political power and decentralizing information I think it'd been really very progressive positive forces for Humanity I want to make the same case for money I think that money needs to be decentralized I think that people need to be able to be more involved in the creation and distribution of money and that technology like Bitcoin allows that in the same way that technology like the the printing press or the internet allowed for the distribution and decentralization of information and that technology like democracy and voting sort of decentralized you know political power away from tyranny that's my sort of I guess radical idea but I I really believe that an open financial system will be just as healthy for the world as an open political system and as an open information system and when you were talking earlier about how the human rights foundation does work with companies like Facebook and Twitter in general like you have a huge technology focus I feel like at the foundation that's just my perception you know from the Freedom Forum and just some other things so why why is that my very first project at the human rights foundation in the summer of 2007 was to put together materials to be sent to the cuban underground library movement so it was actually DVDs of foreign films dubbed into spanish that were things like V for Vendetta and Braveheart and you know we did this because information is power right at the end of the day the Cuban government this is this this obviously you know 12 13 years later has changed in as much as the Cuban people have a lot more access to the Internet via this sort of packet a system where neighborhoods get information from the outside world on satellites and distribute them amongst their communities but before that you know you basically only were able to understand what the government provided you which was obviously a very brainwashed kind of very limited amount of information about how great the Cuban government was and how evil everybody else was so by giving people books like animal farmer 1984 in Spanish or by giving them access to foreign films that talked about you know the the struggle for democracy this was a very popular program and it was something that made me realize how important literally information technology at least was going to be in a struggle for human rights later in my career I worked a lot on our North Korea programs so we we've been sort of smuggling outside information into North Korea for a long time and that was originally done through literally tying a bag to a balloon and floating it from South Korea over the DMZ into North Korea and then having a small acid timer go off in the bag would open and DVDs and dollar bills and candy and flash drives would drop into North Korea as I've just kind of a omen and a like a goodwill gesture from the outside world more recently we we've tapped into the markets that are bustling everyday on the border between China and North Korea and the North Korean refugees that we work with send in information on flash drives through there so this is this further reinforced at least my personal belief that information was going to be the key in many ways to human rights over the years we also worked on information security so like helping activists learn how to stay safe with their communications by using tools like signal and I guess trying to get a better understanding of how to say safe online and how to be you know not the lowest hanging fruit when it comes to their communications and I think now you know financial freedom and financial privacy and financial sovereignty are just as if not even more important than all of those things especially as we head deeper into the Information Age I mean to underline an example I gave you before today in Hong Kong people still have the chance to use paper money to top-up public transportation cards and to buy SIM cards so that they can plug them into their phone and use telegram groups without disclosing their identity they still have that option of using cash they won't in five years or ten years there won't be any paper money left there's only 8 percent of the world's daily transactions today are our paper or metal 92 percent and that's probably a conservative estimate of all the daily financial transactions in the world are digital and that's only going to go towards zero as we as we head through the next decade so we need private decentralized money this is very very very important otherwise you know governments will be able to control their people and corporations will be able to you know control people as well so private decentralized money and and I believe that ultimately these two things can come together in the form of Bitcoin and other projects will be a bulwark against authoritarianism and the surveillance state I think that's that's kind of obvious at this point we're gonna discuss more about North Korea and corporate surveillance state and the open money initiative and all kinds of things that we mentioned earlier but first a quick word from both me as well as our sponsors will the world follow France and advocate banning privacy coins will government-backed stable coins become the new fiat are distributed and peer to peer exchanges just a flash in the pan the answer is

surveymonkey.com slash are slash unchained survey 2019 go there now to give us your thoughts on the future direction of Unchained and enter the giveaway back to my conversation with Alex Gladstein of the human rights foundation of the economies that have so far been using Bitcoin for human rights purpose where do you think it's been having a noticeable impact or like or which country's usage kind of closely matches how you think bitcoin could be used and it's most useful or a non speculative form right so I think it's current stage of its technology from what I've seen the most useful way to adopt a Bitcoin and where we've actually seen people using it is as a cross-border payments basically a cross-border payment mechanism as a bridge between two monies so I'll give more detail to that but essentially in a place like Venezuela or Iran or the Philippines or Nigeria or India or China these are some of the countries that I've done interviews in Turkey there are restrictions on what local citizens can do with regard to the world markets they are cut off in some way again that way might be because of their own governments financial controls it might be because of US sanctions it might be because of capital controls it might be because of lack of infrastructure it might be because of high fees in the banking sector there there are quite a number of reasons but at the end of the day you have billions of people who are disconnected from the financial world and what we're observing through research is that some of these people are using Bitcoin as a way to access other money meaning US dollars euros etc so you have like someone that I was just with at the Oslo Freedom Forum who's of Iranian descent and her partner she was saying you know her partner's family someone's very sick in Iran and her partner's family they live in London Bitcoin has been a way for them to send money to pay for cancer treatments in her own otherwise it'd be very difficult for them to send money from London to Tehran this is not something that's easy to do right yeah actually just for listeners I think Peter McCormick released that panel on yes he the coin did which she she spoke about that there so yeah this is a internet researcher named masa was pursuing a doctorate at Oxford at the moment and she basically revealed in this conversation that was on Peters show about how her family uses a Bitcoin to send payments to Iran so that this person can can pay for cancer treatment that was I thought pretty powerful a couple other stories would be that you know in countries like Philippines in Nigeria and these are massive countries one hundred million person countries right you know tens of millions of people in each of these countries are non-resident workers I believe it's about ten million in in the Philippines and more in Nigeria and these are people that live in countries outside of Nigeria and the Philippines and where they don't have a bank account so it's it's they're at the mercy of like third parties to get their money back to their family and in the case of the Philippines a lot of these folks work in South Korea okay so they need to send Korean Won somehow back to the Philippines where it needs to be received by their family and pesos right so that traditionally has been a convoluted delayed slow process we're on average according to Louie spoon aventura who's an entrepreneur in this space who was also on on Peters panel this can be you know roughly about 7.5% is a fee you may pay and the end to get a 100 or a or a $200 remittance back from a place like Korea to the Philippines so his company Bloom you know started working in South Korea and in 2014-2015 and they were able to get that feed out in three percent using a Bitcoin based solution so that to me is indicative of the power that I think Bitcoin can have with rare to these cross-border payments that transcend governmental financial boundaries another good example would be you know to be more specific about Nigeria timmi our friend Timmy who runs by coins which is a lagos based sort of cryptocurrency wallet exchange great love Timmy but basically Timmy was it was explaining how you know some you know very very clever Nigerians are using Bitcoin basically to like to make money in an arbitrary way on the way that different currents you float against each other so that they're not speculating in the traditional sense meaning like buying some bitcoins trying to sell it when it's when it's hot and trying to buy it when it's low they're actually using bitcoins like acquire foreign currency and try to make money in that way so it was really interesting for him to talk about that and again like I think in in places like this whether it's whether you're behind US sanctions in Iran or whether you're behind governmental sanctions in a place like Venezuela or whether you know you're just not really tied in to the to the world the financial ecosystem Bitcoin does provide you this like lifeline or this other opportunity to get access to the world economy so that that's like what I think we can observe and testify as currently like I guess like the use case now as Bitcoin hopefully becomes more usable and as there's wider like adoption of people who accept it hopefully as as payment let's say then we can maybe you start talking about it in the fight against financial surveillance we're not really there yet because no one really will it's not like you know the subway in New York City or in Hong Kong will accept Bitcoin for payments so we can't really talk about it as a way of protecting our daily financial habits until it adopts that's in that certain way but we can but it certainly technically could be the answer for that I think the answer there is more of like a socially and politically will it be feasible but at the moment the way that I've seen Bitcoin changed the world and be a liberation tool for people is as this sort of way to to neutrally and permissionless ly send money from one person to anyone else on the planet and all you need is a smartphone and internet access you don't need a bank account you don't need a passport and that's that's very very powerful but so right now obviously this is happening on a very small scale I think I actually heard you when I was researching this but you said that like less than 1% of the world's population has been exposed to Bitcoin something like that so what can you or HRF try to do to make these technologies you know either more useful or more widespread or or is that not your role like how do you want to get to this vision that your yeah well I think it's very similar to thinking about encrypted communications technology something like a signal right in the case of let's take Bitcoin for example or even add all the other cryptocurrencies right I think best estimates are forty to sixty million people by this point have interacted meaningfully with cryptocurrencies ok so again that's less than 1% of the world's population so you're right in that aspect in terms of it's small when you compare to the whole world but it's quite a few it's quite a number of people who've been affected by it we're talking millions of people who who've had their lives changed in a meaningful way because of cryptocurrency right and in that aspect I think it's probably similar to the the path that encrypted messaging has taken where at first encrypted messaging generally speaking was was greeted by the wider public with skepticism and certainly by hostility by the powers that be in terms of what what do you have to hide if you're using encrypted messaging right if you're a digital privacy advocate what are you hiding right so these were like arguments that we went through in the 90s in terms of you know what what could what possibly could you want if you're trying to encrypt something and send it to somebody it could only be bad right I think there's been a sea change in public attitudes since then especially after the Snowden revelations about the idea that no we actually need digital privacy in our communication but do you really think that there's been a sea change absolutely I feel like after the Snowden thing like a lot of survey showed that people actually didn't change their behaviors and they kind of said that they cared about privacy but then they didn't really do anything about it I mean you even even with a delete Facebook thing which happened last year like a tiny tiny fraction of people actually did let's actually break that down so so what I'm saying is that there are there is more public support now whether or not I say I support privacy and what and I go home and download signal that's a different conversation ok I'm just saying there's been wider public support for the idea that people should have private communications right well I'm saying like how do we get to those behaviors which right we are not there yet let alone with you know bitcoins so in the same way that there's no wider public support after massive revelatory incidents like the Snowden and and like whether it's WikiLeaks Snowden etc into to the fact that like like the ability to the whistle blow securely it's important that what the ability to communicate something like securely is important um these things lead to a change in public behavior now the change in public behavior may not result in your friends using encrypted messaging but it creates a different climate for companies so after the Snowden case one of the most successful things I can point to is that whatsapp decided to add intend encryption to its messenger that's my massive right they didn't have to do that they did that as a result of a change of public opinion right so oftentimes public opinion can drive companies who have vast numbers of users to do things differently and and and in in the name of privacy and security for people so that's been something we've seen happen and I think we can hang our hat on that and hope to keep pushing in that direction so in the same way you're seeing Facebook today they basically do something quite brazen announce that not only are they creating a new currency that's not gonna be just the US dollar but that it potentially will be permissionless now again I had a lot of concerns with the Liebherr project but that's something that's unbelievable and you know one would have ever guessed that that could have happened five years ago in in the era of 2014 Bitcoin if you had told somebody that in five years Bitcoin you know Facebook was gonna be announcing its own permissionless cryptocurrency I think you would have probably been left out of the room but it just happened today so so big tech companies have the potential to lay a lot of the groundwork for this and in the same way that like I think a lot of people probably learned first about oh what is encryption because whatsapp or Facebook messenger turned it on right and they got a little notification about it tens of millions of people got a notification about on that day I think now through Facebook a lot of people are gonna learn what cryptocurrency is and they're gonna learn that money doesn't need to be provided by a government it starts off permissioned yeah I wonder it might be the the solution but it's I think it's a step in the right direction I think we have to be philosophically flexible about it you in Bitcoin space think about how excited bitcoiners are about the fact that you know certainly quite a few Venezuelans you know have used Bitcoin right as a means of survival and commerce etc however most Venezuelans according to the open money initiative when they use something like local bitcoins to exchange you know their money into and out of bolivars they don't own their own private keys they're using local bitcoins as a digital escrow right so this is not philosophically what we want as bitcoiners right quote-unquote I think bitcoiners you know want people to use their private key and have sovereignty over their money that's not happening in Venezuela by and large but it doesn't mean that it's not a good step in the right direction so I think we need to retain a certain level of philosophical flexibility while still being skeptical so I guess what I'm saying is like even if you don't trust whatsapp which was later than acquired by Facebook or you don't trust Facebook with messenger or you don't trust a telegram or you don't trust now Facebook with Libra it's really good to see these companies going in that direction looking at well I mean apples trying to remake itself as a privacy company and I think we should we should be excited about that we should be skeptical we should hold their feet to the fire but as someone who cares about user privacy I'm where I'm really grateful that these companies are trying to like please an audience that cares about privacy and that cares about permissionless finance let's say as opposed to the other model in the world the Chinese model where the dominant apps are so real-time censored that it seems like it's an episode out of black mirror you know so so this is this these positive tell yeah yeah I don't know it's yeah it's one of those things where I feel like there's there is still that gap between what people say or you know and what they do because like even in Europe now when you go and you get these all the all these pop-ups and every website you know being like we're collecting information about you for a cookies right everybody just accepts or you know what I mean it's like there's no I I don't know I just feel like what are you gonna do be like okay I'm not gonna read this website now I'm not you know so in that regard you know I just won't I agree with you on that I do think people trade their freedoms and privacy for convenience far too often in fact at the Oslo Freedom Forum this year we had an exhibit and it was it was it showed people who maybe haven't used WeChat before how it works and it was a sort of a translation into English of the Chinese model of WeChat let's say and it was like up above the interface was this mirrored image of the word evil and the word easy right because it's so easy but it's also evil you know so giving up all your privacy and freedom is convenient like it is something that people will want so I think you know the answer for like people who care about civil liberties and personal freedoms and personal data lies in the technology producers and the technologists making something that is convenient that's key so whatsapp messenger is convenient so them adopting what's like an encryption is a good step in the right direction I guarantee you the whatever that this wallet that Libre is being to be used with the Cobra this thing's gonna be awesome in terms of its user design I can guarantee it it's gonna be super easy to use and it's gonna on-ramp a whole bunch of people onto non-government provided money and I think that that's really interesting yeah that is the part that's offered by Facebook itself yeah yeah and again like I'm you know skeptical of the impact that that project the projects like this will have on privacy and I'm worried but at the same time I think we have to understand that things like this are gonna on-ramp more people onto the general concepts and I think this is going to be great for Bitcoin probably I mean I think it'll get more people interested I mean look a lot of people are going to learn about cryptocurrency first about Libre they're gonna first learn over through Libre and then they're gonna dig around on message boards and email and newsletters and they're gonna be like what is this Bitcoin thing and they're going to learn about Bitcoin and that's gonna be like you know the red pill moment and the matrix where they've they've heard about Libra and then all of a sudden wow this is the real deal you know this thing is actually permissionless this time actually decentralized this thing's actually so but I'm not sure people might just use Libra it might be like Oh versus coal this works here's the world is a lot bigger than the New Yorker San Francisco where you and I you know spend most of our time probably I yes Americans like are pretty blasé about privacy but the people I work with they care about it oh wow so if I can tell people you know in Zimbabwe or in in Hong Kong or in places that are actually facing like a an actual either authoritarian government or authoritarian challenge they will rise to the occasion it's amazing to watch what Hong connors are doing today they're they're going to they're pulling out all the stops they're wearing masks to confuse facial recognition and they're using cash to you know you know quietly you know use public you know transportation services and quietly use social media coordination services it's pretty amazing so I do have this belief that people will will rise to the occasion they just won't do it where they're not pushed to do it and in America and in Europe we live in a in societies where we take our freedoms for granted for sure most people do so I think the innovations will come elsewhere that's why you're seeing Bitcoin be adopted in Lagos and in Caracas and in Tehran where Massa at the Asif uniform was saying that you know if you get into a cab in Tehran today people are gonna be asking about Bitcoin like adoptions happening in these places not in Los Angeles or Sydney or or Tokyo and I think that that's all cohesive like I think that all makes sense these technologies will be adopted where they're where they're you know most needed yeah ya know watching the Hong Kong thing has actually been was somewhat emotional for me because I'm just like oh my gosh if I were to have grown up in a country that's like similar to us and then suddenly have it become more in like China I would also be like that I would be like oh my god no like this is terrible but anyway so I like we're running out over time and I have five million questions for you and we keep talking about the open money initiative and we keep referencing Venezuela so just talk a little bit about kind of like you know this initiative that you're backing and yeah and what it is that you guys are seeing there and what you what you hope you can accomplish with the money open money initiative and and what it is the human rights foundation has always had a founding focus on Venezuela and in two thousand six and seven and eight it was tough because a lot of people thought a Chavez was a great guy and you know they were like well he's a man of the people now today it's uncool to support populist s-- it's uncool to support authoritarians but at the time people love to Chavez they thought he was like the best thing since sliced bread generally speaking I mean I just remember when I first started at a traffic was very difficult to have serious conversations about and I would say things like well you know he's like stacking the Supreme Court and he's he's taking radio stations off the air and he's taking the licenses away from TV stations and he's putting prison you know journalists and people just they want to hear it they like really wanted to support him and unfortunately sadly we were right to sound the alarm on Venezuela and it has become the worst disaster in the Western Hemisphere four million Venezuelans have already left Venezuela and as many as 8 million will have left by the end of next year and the average Venezuelan has lost something like 25 pounds there is just starvation there's absolute destruction in the form of hyperinflation massive theft and corruption environmental destruction you name it so this has all happened in the last decade and it has to happen increasingly since 2014 and 15 and we've we've always been an organization that's focused on helping civil liberties and political rights in Venezuela we've always looked at assessing the health of the country in that area and we've watched it deteriorate now what was much more acute almost was the economic deterioration of Venezuela over the last five years so when I met a group of very enterprising researchers and designers last summer who wanted to to investigate you know how were Venezuelan IDPs or refugees living in Colombia you know interacting with the world financially I thought this was a fascinating project so the human rights foundation is very proud to support the open money initiative and their efforts to understand you know how can the outside world be helpful in designing technology that the Venezuelans can use that can benefit their lives and I like that they're coming at this from an agnostic point of view from a platform perspective or a protocol perspective they're not going there to push a particular project they're going there with open hearts and open ears and open minds and they're like basically providing the world with a like a perspective on what do Venezuelans need and what do Venezuelans need dollars u.s. dollars I mean bitcoin is such a very distant second you know what I mean and they're even like different types of US dollars there's dollars in zel and dollars in Air TM and then there's cash dollars and they all have their different prices right so we're learning about this kind of amazing kind of tragic but also kind of fascinating a micro economy that has grown in this area anyway and why would the value be different depending on what form is so more people will accept different types of US dollars as merchants inside Venezuela so you will it's easier for you to spend for example you know one type of apps dollars than another type of absolutely okay so they have like a premium on the price some are more valuable right in the same way that you know digital bolivars are a different value than printed bolivars because you only need printed volleyballs for certain things and they're harder to access right so it's fascinating to see this kind of like new you know again tragic but kind of fascinating to us to see this new economy being born and there's you know a lot of suffering and there's nothing you can take away from it but but sadness says the world does relatively nothing you know to help them as well in refugees big institutions and groups like the World Bank and you know I think organizations typically help refugees you know are I don't know I just feel like they don't see Venezuelans in the same light as they see maybe Somalis or Syrians or or Afghan Afghanis yeah I mean just even though it's the exact same human situation there's something about it where they're not quite seen as refugees in the same way yet I think that that shift will come but in the meantime I think getting companies to understand how they can play a role is useful and open money initiative visits providing a window into how money works in Venezuela and what people can do and you know hearing them talk I mean I know that for example you know designing you know open-source apps that run on older phones that would allow people to like for example receive different kinds of digital assets whether it's like zel credits or err TM credits Bitcoin and then exchange them into bolivars building an app that would do all of that in one would be fantastic so so coming to an understanding of these things and then going back to the industry and saying here's what people need I think is a really really valuable design research thing that the open money initiative is doing and that HRF would love to support and in other countries around the world too so I want to switch the topic now to North Korea which you know is personally a very interesting medium of North Korean hair or Korean heritage but partially North Korean so so far what we've been discussing is all the ways that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are good for evading like surveillance dates or oppressive regimes but that is actually also the aspect that makes it good for a country like North Korea to evade sanctions and in general I just feel like that country when when we're talking about how Bitcoin can be used against a pair authoritarian regimes is the one like outlier simply because North Koreans don't have access to the Internet so they can't really use Bitcoin against the regime so it's not just gonna have to be the way that it's going to be because actually so far what's going on there is that North Korea itself the government is benefiting from vic poin yeah you know so so what do you how do you think bitcoin can help that situation well I think when it comes to North Korea I think we have to look at how the government sustains itself and at the end of the day it's about power and control and fear now it is true that the North Korean government has figured out he's very clever is very smart they've figured out that having a sophisticated cyber warfare capacity is very important right so putting money even aside for a second they've been very successful in hacking public infrastructure in South Korea of course we all know about you know the Sony hacks that you know ricocheted across America many Christmases ago there's all kinds of sabotage attacks that they've done internationally yeah have been exactly know when it comes to money you know yes it definitely seems like from what we've we've observed that the North Korean government's figured out if they if they robbed to currency exchanges that that can be an effective way for them to steal money that they need but generally speaking I think from a bird's eye view virtually all of the money that the North Korean government runs on is in the form of dollars and ran in be in their own money Bitcoin makes up a very small percentage of the ability of the North Korean government to hold on to control I think long term Bitcoin as a as a decentralized form of money that will inevitably seep into North Korea in a way that the government cannot stop at the end of the day will only be a bad thing for the North Korean government what you mean to the people satellite access already so today there is satellite coverage over North Korea if you look at block stream look at the map on their website so if I had if I had a like a small satellite device I can send and receive Bitcoin transactions in the middle of North Korea without any internet that's a start is that something that the human rights foundation would try to do that is something how would they get liquidity I think anyone is doing that probably wouldn't say that on a podcast what what I will say is that there is liquidity massive liquidity in China and at the Chinese border of Bitcoin so the coin is immediately valuable in Chinese border cities so I'm just painting a hypothetical here but if you had if you North Koreans are the most creative and entrepreneurial people in the world they're the most bold and creative and they will do anything they can to sweet Harley Nathan totally brainwashed despite I know exactly but they are incredible the ones that I've met the people who've escaped used so much not just bravery but ingenuity cleverness I mean these are these are people who don't have the tools we have they don't have the freedoms we have and I have to figure out anyway and I'm just saying that they figure it out they've they've been so successful in just exploiting the tiniest little like slivers of freedom to to to maximize the well-being for their family and their friends and and I wouldn't rule I wouldn't bet against them let's put it government I'm talking to people are going to really like turn lemonade out of lemons the point I'm saying is that over time as more and more equipment gets into North Korea that can send and receive information over the Internet and as there already exists a way to send a receive Bitcoin in North Korea and as things like open Dimes which is a way of like physically trading Bitcoin like like in physical cash potentially popularized and as as cryptocurrency in Bitcoin continues to increase in popularity in China Mazzone Li a matter of time before the stuff seeps into North Korea and starts eating away at the government's control over money one of the more interesting things that I heard from a North Korean defector was from Taeyang ho who you met at the özil transform girl is amazing oh is the highest ranking diplomat to ever escape from North Korea and I asked him a question because I had heard that in 2009 a North Korean government scrapped its currency and introduced a new currency completely meaning people who had saved for decades in cash that pile of money and their bed was all of a sudden useless and I was so curious about this in Taeyang oh of course was was there and a very high-ranking official so he knew all about this it has never been reported in the English media but I wanted to learn from him about what exactly happened and you know he was basically saying that the economic Minister of unity or whatever they called him after this happened the plan didn't work as predicted basically people were so despondent over this that they just didn't go to the markets for like a day or two that's about as much protest as they could muster they just didn't go to sell their wares because they were so depressed about what had happened to their savings and because of this was like a period of depressed economic activity according to mr. Tay and several days later Kim jong-il had the minister of economic unity executed within ak-47 is what he told me which I thought was shocking but this is for the course yeah but this is this is a story about how the government is trying to hold on control the population through manipulating money and at the end of the day bitcoin will prevent them from doing that so in be a very far off thing but I can't imagine that Bitcoin like in a sort of an umbrella you know net a kind of impact way is positive for the North Korean government I mean maybe short term fine but long term it's it's it's it's a technology that eats away and destroys authoritarianism because at the end of the day all authoritarians hold on to control over their people through financial control I love it okay hopefully hopefully you're right that this will happen over the long term so I want to ask just sort of generally about regulation because so I had multiple questions on this but I'm gonna try to wrap it in a one so we've seen local bitcoins disabling caches halting operations in Iran and presumably these are functions that I think you you know would advocate for and yeah could help people fight authoritarian regimes so in general how do you think regulation and the crypto space should be handled well not like that I think you're there's a lot of fear and European regulators seem to be the worst offenders at the moment it's really sad to see free countries crack down the hardest on this new technology even harder than dictatorships it's bizarre but you know the Finnish government has got to realize that when it basically forces a company like local bitcoins to you know whether it's complying by orders from the American government or not when it force or EU orders or whatever when it forces a company the cut off services in a country like Iran that it's cutting off a lifeline that's helping people I wish they would look at it like how can we help Iranians as opposed to how can we comply with these draconian economic policies I think that this is just the beginning I think that centralized exchanges I don't know if you've seen this but over the last few days several other platforms have closed off access to US users and I think you just start seeing this more and more and it's a phase we're gonna go through where at first governments just for a long time of course didn't understand or didn't know about cryptocurrency Bitcoin and and then they sort of laughed it off and now they're starting to take it seriously you know and they're gonna start to crack down a little bit I think the worst is obviously yet to come when when it starts actually eating away at their power but we may not be there for for a little while but but I think you're gonna start to see more and more attacks I mean India has already you know really restricted the ability of exchanges to operate in that country obviously not a great thing to see in the world's largest democracy really anti innovation and kind of tragic but you're gonna see this happen in Europe and you know maybe through the good work of people like coin Center maybe the US government will not do the worst things that I could do and maybe it'll be a little more open-minded and I do have some hope that the US government will be a little more open-minded than than these European and Indian regulators based on just conversations I've had and things I've heard from US regulators but we'll see we'll see I think it's unquestionably a bad thing to cut off technology access to people living under dictatorships and I hope that companies see that and I've certainly talked to other I guess more able and just because of their smaller and more nimble but you know companies like for example packs full or companies like for example there's like bisque for example what are these these are these are sort of more will same peer-to-peer marketplaces more sort of decentralized exchanges where people rely less on an intermediary and set up like bisque but basically these people are like super excited about being able to provide access to like users in places like Iran so when one exchange gets shut down the others I think are reacting in an interesting way so I certainly hope that companies can do what they can to fight off the regulation and keep services alive in these countries that need it so you just mentioned a couple of companies but in general like which crypto companies or projects are working in areas that you think are the most promising for human rights purposes well I mean look it's it's true to say that even though local bitcoins has stopped it's you know services in Iran that it is overwhelmingly the the most important company in the world when it comes to providing liquidity and ability to turn Bitcoin and other you know digital assets into local money it is just absolutely so important in a country like Venezuela critical so important in in in other countries I mean it's it's fairly dominant in places like Nigeria if you interview people they're fairly dominant in Southeast Asia very important East Asia so I think I think local bitcoins is kind of a real lifeline right now so I hope we can figure out ways to support them and help them you know fend off more regulation because people really at the moment need their service I mean it's just sort of network effect and that they were there first and that people trust local bitcoins as a brand in these places but it's it's really kind of amazing to watch the volume in flicky in these places just to give one example today the the volume of exchange in local bitcoins from Bitcoin to Bolivar is multiple times out of the Caracas Stock Exchange yeah yeah I mean I guess it's a low bar because who's you know investing in as well in the stock market but it's paradigm shift right and probably one of many like in the future crypto exchanges will be much larger than stock markets like I think this is the first example this isn't just like some hypothetical I came up with I'm reporting an actual fact so yes it's in an extreme economic example of dystopian one I would say but I think things are gonna get worse before they get better in a lot of places and again cryptocurrency is gonna be a serious alternative option for folks all right so I think the last questions I have for you are just about like where people can learn more about you and HRF but also I noticed so HR accepts Bitcoin for a donation yes how popular is it for people to do that okay do you like immediately convert it or do you keep the Bitcoin yes so these are interesting questions so we started receiving Bitcoin donations in 2014 and they've been very helpful over the years and I certainly would encourage people to send them to us we generally have a policy of converting the Bitcoin into dollars to spend them on operating programs but if you write us with with a note with your intention to but then you'd like us to to keep it this is something I'm looking into the help of certain people of basically setting up a sort of an ability for you to make a donation in Bitcoin to us for example that we would agree to hold on to for a certain amount of time so I really like this idea and certainly if you know listeners want to help me design this give legal advice etc I would very much welcome that you can reach me at Alex at HRF org or on Twitter at Gladstein I'm a handle so we would very very much be open to to like a law it's a long term Bitcoin donations and donations of other cryptocurrencies if if that's something you're interested in and I would just lay out as a final thought like the the four things that we would like to that the human rights foundation would really like to do in the cryptocurrency space so number one would be design research much like what the open money initiative is doing we'd love to replicate and share some of those findings and procedures around the world so that people can understand what's happening in these countries and that we can design better tools for people who need them that's number one number two would be public education so we're doing a lot of like public education about Bitcoin cryptocurrencies you know in in medium formats and in events and conferences that are not cryptocurrency related so for example when I write something in time or CNN or I speak in an economists conference I think that's in many ways very effective compared to like just sort of speaking to the same small group of people which I know and love but like we really got to get out to the 99 percent that don't know anything about cryptocurrency and Bitcoin so public education is totally key a third area would be providing opportunities for let's say in the case of Bitcoin core development so currently core development is something that's that's done by not enough people and a lot of that is because there are just certain niche resources you need to understand to learn how to code and to meaningfully contribute to to Bitcoin core for example so we'd love to try and support people from around the world to come to some of the classes of people like Jimi song or Justin moon or Jane code etc and be able to have that experience so that's something I'd love to work on is sort of diversifying whether it be from geographical diversity gender diversity etc and in the fourth area which i think is kind of most interesting is operational security for activists I mean if they're authentically and I can tell you they are authentically interested in receiving a Bitcoin payments and sending them as opposed to carrying bags of cash on a bus or you know being reliant and fearful about their bank account they do want to use Bitcoin but they need to know how to use it and they need to know how to use it safely or as safe as possible and that's not like easy to find information you really have to kind of piece that together and most of these folks are brave entrepreneurial activists not technologists right so they need like easy-to-understand guides and mentorship with regard to Bitcoin operational security so you know we'd like to partner with you and anyone else on on these on these areas of design research into global cryptocurrency adoption public education about Bitcoin diversifying that people who are doing a core development and doing operational security for people who actually want to use this stuff great well thank you so much for coming undone change it's been a real pleasure thanks for having me to learn more about Alex and
