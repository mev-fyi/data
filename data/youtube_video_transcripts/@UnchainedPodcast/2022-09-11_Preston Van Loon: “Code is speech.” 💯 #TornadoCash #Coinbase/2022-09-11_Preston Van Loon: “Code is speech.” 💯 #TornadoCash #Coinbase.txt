the code that powers tornado cache is speech it's been established a code of speech and we think that the sanctions that of has put on here is effectively putting a a sensor on free speech i think that's wrong so i've you know joined in this lawsuit with a few others and with the help of coinbase and our goal is here is to try to get that overturned we're not really seeking any like bunny or anything uh i do have some ether that's trapped in there you know i can't take it out or be a face for sanctions violations but really the goal is to get that reversed and say you know code is speech and free speech is a constitutional right
