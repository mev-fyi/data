da Hong Fei co-founder of neo formerly and shares and Patrick dye founder of quantum and chairman of the quantum foundation hello Laura so before we dive into the main topic let's hear a little bit about your backgrounds Hong Fei let's start with you how did you get into crypto and come to launch neo okay I I came across a Bitcoin in 2011 so that's almost the same with everybody else and I started to working full-time in the crypto industry in 2013 and then at that time we have a club called bit NGOs Club there are seven of us funded this club at that we spin off to a project called n shares so that's basically a new is the rename of n shares so we started in 2014 to develop and shares as a platform to issue digital assets and then we add in the digital assets we add in a smart contract to digital and shares and this year we rebranded it to the new name okay and Patrick how did you get started in this space and come to lunch quantum yeah okay hello everyone hi Laura yeah so my name is Patrick I'm from the quantum foundation ponderable quantum project I involved into Bitcoin industry since 2012 when I was still prepare my master's degree and a PhD degree in the CES one of the best technology University in China so I joined the industry since 2012 and seeing I dropped out in my PhD one it's 2015 and I worked for Alibaba for six months and then I left Alibaba and I started as a quantum project as as March of 2016 yeah so right now the quantum is the radius is the main that a few days ago and as a project it's Korean creative very big right now yeah Oh Congrats Congrats although it's a kind of a crazy time I imagine for you so let's talk a little bit about your icos Hong Fei when you were ant shares you had to ICO is about a year ago and raised about four million is that correct yeah yeah correct yeah and so I actually I saw an interview that you did with or or that someone on your team did with Smith and Crown and they actually brought the CEO Brian Leo and the researcher matched a route they were on the podcast a little while back but it in the interview the people on your team said that they felt that Western investors were more focused on the technology and they breed the white papers closely but that a lot of the Chinese were more like speculators and they tended not to read the white papers as closely so I just wanted to hear from you overall how would you characterize the Chinese people who have been investing in icos and how have you seen that change over time yes that that statement is true and things is getting worse you know in the past few weeks there are like every like 10 I tell I see us every week a lot of people that don't understand Bitcoin they don't know what bitcoin is they just hemming and want to make quick money and when the situation gets worse the old ladies are investing their retirement savings the government is stepping and stopped all the I see you in China so they were participating in the ICS themselves like buying ether and then sending ether to the smart contract and receiving tokens actually there are there are many platforms ICO platforms in China so they will help you to deal with the technical issues so you don't need to be a tech savvy to to do other things okay okay yeah but the concern was that people who didn't know what they were doing we're getting into this yes okay and then Patrick so quantum raised 16 million dollars in April for you what percentage of your investors do you think for Chinese versus West or versus non Chinese yeah so after the quantum ico finish we asked a few of our partners who hosted who helped us host as ICO so from the data we got like more than 20 countries people participated the quantum IC o---- so I think maybe 30 or 40 percent of people from the Chinese investor or the Chinese participate er yeah so may but the other personality to come from us not us because we block all the u.s. IP from the Canada were from UK were from you were in Japan Korea and Russia yeah oh wait you blocked all of those countries no we blocked the US citizens so because we made that our clear announcement like if you are a u.s. American you cannot participate all right deal yeah oh oh I see but it was so the participants you were saying we're from Canada and Europe and the UK in Russia and Korea in Japan yeah yeah Korea Japan and China and not to the US market yeah okay and Hong Fei for the Neo or back when you miranne shares what percentage of your investors do you think we're Chinese versus not Chinese the ICEA one the first I see you most of the Chinese investors and for the ICO to the one finished the last year half of the investments are coming from non Chinese countries okay so over time how would you say that the atmosphere around i ciose was in china kind of maybe a year or two ago versus now how has it changed I think year ago it's still very limited because the general public they doesn't know what what ICU is and people attending joining ICU they need to have some tech technical background but these days everybody is talking ICU because lots of them make money for ICU so the general public are investing their money and how do you think that change happened like it started with you were saying tech savvy people was it kind of like coders who were who were buying this initially and then how did it spread you don't necessarily to be a coders they just that those are people that are fascinated by the new technologies they they like to they love to try new things they love to support new things but these days there are most of them are speculators okay and there are many ICU projects I think they're there their goal is is pointless they're just they're just here to make money they are not trying to build something okay and so what are some of the maybe inflection points or milestones where you feel like you saw that shift happened it starts in 2017 hmm yeah I mean the shift point or the change point that start us happening like assume icicles yeah after some project that been pumped so high I think that because of the influence of the maybe the ECM price they jumped it like a forty times higher seems the march to the to May yeah the price wouldn't have to like a forty times so after that people saw the price one top of forty times seeing all the people I think not only in China all the people you know water they become crazy yeah I think the shift started slowly from 2017 and yeah yeah I think the reason is people are making money the organization or they started ICO are making money the people invested in I see you are making money looks like everybody is getting something so looks like a it's a it's a very good opportunity to make some profit so everybody is very excited and they just made up a lot of I see you projects and just this parallel anything any other kind of bubble or I don't know if level is really the word but any behavior in China that you've seen in the past I think it's the I co bubble is not just a Chinese thing it's a global it's a global phenomenon yeah I had read about previous bubbles in China that involved things like tea and types of wood and even the stock market that was a couple years ago like is this kind of a something that you feel like this maybe even culturally specific in a way like I I agree with you that there is a bubble obviously and I agree with you it's the same in the US with a lot of projects that shouldn't be trying to raise money are just because it's easy to do so but I also feel like I've read that China in particular has some kind of culture on speculation that often leads to these types of bubbles yes I think the Chinese because in China there are really very limited investment opportunities so people you know the Chinese Chinese UN is deep red the creation slowly so people want to reserve their their value but they have very limited investment channels the money can only stay in China you can invest in global market so if they see some opportunity they go ahead so something else that I was wondering about is when you guys were constructing your icos what were the laws in China that you had to be aware of to make sure that your offerings wouldn't land you in jail okay for the father for the question like a witch of a law area we needed to aware before we did I see oh yeah like I'm assuming yeah a securities regulation is probably one I don't know what else okay so I think earlier in China all the ico area it's just unclear and the gray area because we do not have a very clear regulation see in that area so for quantum but we saw to maybe a future the the Chinese account that may have some regulations so when we started at the quantum project we really see the our foundation in Singapore yeah but Abbi we do have a small office in Shanghai but yeah we have the gene I mean originally we come from China but azim we were we were thinking like from the very beginning we know okay in the future maybe the Chinese government to some regulation so we choose we choose the to reduce the quantum project legally in Singapore and we have a very pretty global team from nine countries yeah so but in China I think is IC o---- area there is a field Department is a taking charge like at the central bank and as a the Chinese security committee or a Chinese security Regulatory committee and maybe sometimes with the insurance like a department or they both can take it in charge of the IC o---- area but as a main regulator should be the central bank and also the Chinese Securities Regulatory Committee they are the main role to take in charges are the ICU regulation but until right now we do not have very clear like law any eco regulations tiffany tiffany nation and the IC o---- yeah but just like a regulator they saw the bigger risk right now so they wanted a magical just be like I've become a cow down or come down they wanted a market like a do not go to too crazy yeah they wanted to stop with the right now another thing I wanted to ask that is just how you guys first started hearing that the people think of China or PBOC might ban i ciose did you first hear rumors or like how did that all start for you yeah okay I will answer it first maybe the Humphrey currents at least yeah so yeah you choose like a we were keep talking to the regulator even before the regulation him come out yeah so we know like it's kind of like if you live in China you can see you like a bubble is happening a few months 1 months ago like you know everyone want to start at the ICO project like a Humphrey said most of the ICO project is just a meaningless it's a pointless it's just some some guy I want to make money so I think I do I see all these four courses they already forget the initial idea of the ICO the initial idea of the ICO it's okay I have a good idea I want to peel the open source projects and know business model okay I needed the community to support me to donate me some money I think that's a you know the initial idea since the 213 you know cryptocurrency industry but this year kind of something crazy happened so I think of the government has realized like it's a bigger risk in China right now also the ICO platform hopefully just mentioned it like in China we have like a maybe 65 platform ICO platform they help you to do the investment that'll ICO it's kind of like as a broker of the traditional stock market it's kind of like a lower older barrier for the average people no matter you know Bitcoin watching what not you can participate you can you can invest yeah so that's a big risk for the regulator so I think that's a real and why the governor they made a regulation the announcer like a few weeks ago yeah and when you say that if there are these ridiculous projects and it's just some random person who just decides to raise money with a cryptocurrency but they don't have any real project your idea what are some examples of some of the really crazy eyes use that you've seen or heard of recently yeah I think you know initially is the ICO it's a sam'l way to or you can you can use your money to form the some open source project some Telenet developer especially the blockchain industry but you know I last a few months like a lot of people come from the traditional business like okay because I saw a project okay they are a mooncake you know it's like a mooncake a company okay I want to release the ICO I want us to do my mooncake yeah so it's kind of funny you know you say for the regulations earlier yeah so that's something I think of the government to they realized oh it's become crazy right now and we needed to stop it yeah that's just one of the examples what is the other is that it's hilarious what are some of the others yeah there's some others like you know there is some project I mean okay blockchain is a very big innovation for the whole society for the whole internet but you cannot use blocks into everywhere it's impossible yeah but you know since launching is a very hot topic right now all the people come from the traditional industry no matter what they are doing they wanted to feel the summer connection what a relationship will block him so they are just assembling the blocking concept to LA to the average people because blockchain harder for people to understand it it's like the AI it's like the internet other things it's some big concept so the people they saw the opportunity is like just okay I'm doing watching business okay give me your money this is something like this yeah so you know you cannot make money from a concept you need to have real product but people realize oh I can say launching concepts and I can't get the money the in people change their initial idea you know a lot of projects as they over raised I mean some project deliveries twenty hundred million dollars in ICO some project with fifty million dollars I mean for starters why you needed that much money yeah you to want to even have a prototype yeah that's some that's still some real project then they came like some like a very very very like a hahahaha I call that it's a very normal project what even some fake project is they wanted to raise money because they say oh I have some connection with blockchain then you can give me your money because it's blocking is a trained over the new world yes you know something crazy there people already forgot her what are they are tweeting yeah well we but I just do so curious so aside from mooncakes are there any other really ridiculous traditional industries that said that they were gonna have an IC o---- the mooncake one is so funny I love it but it's just wondering if there's another yeah I think of the air yeah you know the some like has maybe some superstar in China they wanted to release some coin to say all their income in the next five year once a year yeah I can't really say superstar coin well that's actually that is I think a security they at least in the u.s. it would be yeah it's kind of a securities and you know there's like some a traditional investors they joined the industry how does it become the other wiser there's a I can feel their ginger like one months ago a lot of an injury investor they jumping into the ICU industry because the reason is like you know the invested into a lot of will start of a company but it's very hard for Oakley the startup is invest either to go to Nasdaq or go to the the Chinese stock market because of very only one person ever the startup they have the chance to go to Nasdaq so then that means like most of the angel investment of real fail so they wanted to cash out so how can I cash out okay they asked the company the Ambassador to go to two I feel lean the angel investors they can cash out yeah that's that's something happened alike last four months or two months yeah and I think because it's like I look it's some like a private company and then you cannot assail the shears easily in China but people seems to they figured oh I can do this in the IC always so I can't say on my shears yeah but you know it's it's not it's not permitted in China you cannot do this even today with the current regulation you cannot sell your shares easily in China I mean the private company shares okay yeah this is this is again not that different from what what the perception of that behavior would be in the US so now out of curiosity once the ban was put in place what was the reaction to that it sounds like you guys think it was pretty sensible what was kind of like the broader reaction from the public I think most people think it's a it's a good thing to to stock all the others scam projects but they still feel it is too strict it just it make you some good projects to earn Patrick yeah I think the public is they have some reaction some some reaction for sure yeah even home say like butter still you know there is some Gouda project in China they think okay this I co like a subtractive regulation make you some innovations in China in the blocking area yeah okay so there's so much more to discuss but we're gonna take a break we're gonna come back and talk about scams we're going to talk about refunding investors the closing of the Bitcoin exchanges and some rumors were hearing but first I'd like to take a quick break to tell

that is something that kind of really piqued my curiosity you described a lot of kind of really interesting situations where I would imagine it would be pretty complex are you guys doing that and if so how do you even do that yeah we offered a actually my answer is ICU the second one in 2016 is refundable before the man that is launched so after we from the period after we finished the ICU and before the man that launched investors our participants can ask for a void refund a full refund we received about 15 15 requests and they refunded 50 bitcoins at that time and when the ico Bank came out a few weeks ago we decided to extend that period so until october 17th the participants in impose I see us can still refund the ask for refund and they will get their Bitcoin back but they have to send back the new token so that's the way we do yeah and so you did it like you already had all their email addresses is that how you're doing these refunds no I'm asking them to asking them to send as an email at contact at near the arc and we were gave them address a new address they sent back the new and we will refund them with Bitcoin ok and how can you be certain that they didn't just buy on a secondary market ok so we will we would need them to sign the message they have a private key for the for the ICO one they have a so they have a we have their email address for this I see you too the user will have a private key oh I see okay so they have to send it to you from that account yeah okay but what if they've already sold their neo then what happens yeah actually I don't care where you where you get the new you if you invest it like one Bitcoin and get let me say one thousand new if there is such record you just send back one thousand you I want we want check its if it is the original new oh oh I see yeah okay I know but so you had already planned that but for all the I cos that haven't planned that or hadn't how are they doing the refunds I think they just refunded some of the I cos they they they've finished their money raising fundraising period but they haven't issued their token so just they just refunded all the money to the user okay yeah oh so that okay okay so sometimes and I you know I haven't participated in I see oh so sometimes you send the money but then you don't get the token until later yeah yes yeah yeah situation you just send back the money send back so either all Bitcoin okay but then what about other situations where the tokens were already trading yet new is already trading so we offered a refund option but until as we're until now I haven't see a request for refund because it's it's more profitable to to sell them in the in the market then get every fund oh really you have you haven't seen a sister oh but it's voluntary so it's not like oh yeah yeah Oh interesting okay and not a single person has requested a refund yeah okay okay so yeah I guess it's not as complex the process as I imagined one other thing I wanted to ask that was we were talking about the silly projects that you know are not blockchain related at all that were trying to hold I SEOs and I saw this one report that said the PBOC claimed that 90% of all the ICS in China were fraudulent do you think that's true and if so what examples do you have of that the mooncake wouldn't think ICU is a good example okay why was that why was that fraudulent I'm not sure what what is the exact words it used I read that statement but I'm not sure if they use the word fraudulent soup but the way that works was something like let's say I am a moon cake bakery and or or a moon cake company and I say okay I'm gonna issue these tokens and then you can redeem them for moon cakes is that is that well what the structure of this was or yeah yeah that's how it to work and you know white paper but why would that be fraudulent I mean it just seems like a stupid reason for a token but I don't know if it's yeah I I think it's based on that many many of the projects they don't have they don't even have a technical person at first when they started I see oh they all they have this idea and after they get money they then may started to hire some technical real technical person to do that job and they may not oh I see like they're just kind of marketing hey we're gonna have a nice you go but they don't even have any well okay yeah you don't have any concrete architecture for for them for the product meaning that it sort of felt like they were just gonna take their bitcoins and either and then not even issue tokens or I think they were issued tokens but they're their real intention is not to build the products their real intention is to get the area get the token that Bitcoin or easier from ICO and bend a small portion of it to deliver a so-called product and they can keep most of the money oh well yes okay the talking is a useless sometime and did the regulator's contact those issuers and you know I'm not sure you know what you would what they would do exactly but but you know brings some kind of regulatory action against them like do you know of any particular icos where the regulator's came in and said hey like you're violating this or that law I'm not sure I I haven't been contacted by the regulator's yeah Patrick yeah I think you know in China why the PBOC they say like a 90% of the project it's like a scam was a very bad project because okay because I read some news like you know in China we have some ICO program you know I see oh it's just a method for you to resell money yeah I feel itself is not a scam but some ICO project is to the scam yeah so that's a reason like I but you know in China people they cannot really distinguish is a difference like most of the public people most of people they do not really understand what's really it's the ICO under the ICO project you know they sing oh oh I see oh it's cam or the ICO itself is a scam I think it's a different concept yeah another reason why the regulator is so angry was so like subtract it's because you know in China we have some like bad people like the they use the ICU name to do scam stuff like this can people like there is some Ponzi scheme in China maybe some like a fake coin with some Ponzi scheme coins so they use all they say oh I'm doing the ICO you master you're giving me your money and I will pay you back every month yeah here is like a like I think maybe there is a there is there's some amount award Ponzi scheme in China yeah in crypto currency wart yeah it's like a the dark side of the of the critical currency like they have nothing they only have a website they do not have any they do not have any experience with the blockchain dust really doesn't have any any experience with the visitor developed from the work they just build a website and intrusive upon this kid yeah so their initial idea is to scan people but they say oh I'm doing an IC o---- you know that's kind of like already the value of the IC o---- concept in China like when people hear about as ICO they say oh I feel it's most likely the scam you know but that's a reason it's because of the too many bad people they use the ICO concept in China yeah the kind of like mecca I see will become a bad word in China yeah and for those Ponzi schemes what did they raise a lot of money were they pretty successful I don't know too much but from what I hear the like yes the CEO policy I'm like I think that this came to some people and as they've raised some money yeah and they also released as a coin but as a coin is it just like a it's a meaningless you know you give your arm P to them will give you a USD dollar to them I mean you get our coin and in the coin itself is a meaningless well that's too bad yeah I think if that's also why the regulator's Wong curry why is why they made it the most attractive regulation on I see you in China I think of the original target II it's not as the CUDA project in China the original target is a Ponzi scam in China yeah Susan why do you think they made the bands so complete and instead of just trying to target those bad actors maybe the reason is like her you know no matter because okay the CUDA projects also have some risk but as a bad project 100% a totally risk and no like a no real use case yeah no no real use yeah so I think of a firm the regulator's the point of view it's like here okay it's kind of a crazy old ICO is crazy right now I think their idea is like it you're okay letter let's as a community well let us not Letta you know the chain the two are coming down and it'll stall feet right now and to let people think about of this yeah oh okay well so this actually is the perfect segue to my next question because I also saw a report that said that the ban is only temporary and I guess someone in China I unfortunately didn't write down the name but somebody with some authority who said that he thought that it was gonna be temporary while the lawmakers hashed out the regulations and like again that all of this is just conjecture but he also said that he thought maybe i ciose would only be allowed if the teams get licenses first of course I think this is all just guesses but do you think that the ban is temporary and if so how long do you think it will last I I think it's very hard to predict the government government's attitude you know because I think it's depends on it depends on the public's reaction yeah and it's also depends on the regulator's themselves and now it depends on all the financial environment in China yeah so it's harder to say it's a temporary wait forever I I don't know the answer yeah button yeah but it is the time view changes in we will see what have you happen yeah because if is a financial environment become bad in China I think the ICU pain is forever but if the financial environment in China become much better in one year what to here might be the government of view changes our attitude on ICO one Bitcoin yeah my take is yeah my take is according to the word the words they use I don't think it's they they intend to be a temporary band so don't don't wait don't expect like two months or a few weeks later they declare a licensing some I see you I don't think so yeah I do yeah maybe no licensing forever no I see you forever it's useful yeah but I need I want to clarify one thing is that the China government only Bend raising money from general public they did not been raising money privately so you can still do a token raising in China as long as you do not you do not pitch to the general public and there are no more than 200 investors in the project and you do not promise a return of profit so that's that will be fine that would be okay to do perfect legal and do you know if some of the teams that we're planning to do icos are they planning to do it that way now to fundraise that way now I think it's a very sensitive period so no team in China will want to do it I see you at this kind of situation no matter its private or public yeah but I know a team like yeah the earlier they wanted to the ones they wanted it to do a public offering to the public as I seal the token but I think right now after the regulation came out they wanted to do our private offering to the and to that like as an angel investor yeah so yeah I know a team they are trying to do this in China right now yeah okay so basically this thing that I read where someone said that the ban is probably temporary you think that's just a rumor and I'm probably not likely to happen I think yeah I think there is some meat yeah it's a rumor they're also there's some misunderstanding you know you know sometimes in China we have different opinions from the government I mean not affirm the gun that you know some people they say the ico pain is a temporary but seeing some generally stuff from some other countries they translated adays yeah you know but it's not a bleep reason at the government yeah they come to always have the same option and yeah you know I think yeah it's a depends on the government's attitude it depends on the public of reactions it depends on the financial environment it's not a simple ICO in China I think even this kind of regulation it's a very high level officer very very high level very very high-level guys they've made it this kind of regulation it's not adjuster PBOC or just a one one department in China it's a seven yeah seven seven like a mostly influential Department in China they made this announcement yeah okay so something else I was curious about was that I read and grin it out obviously I don't speak Chinese but I read that the language of the ban made some kind of distinction between virtual currencies like etherium versus tokens first of all is that true I mean if so what is that distinction because I mean etherium did do an IC o---- is just long before I suppose were such a big trend so yeah I said I kind of am not really sure how they're distinguishing between what is legal versus what isn't legal I think Oh indeed gold even even easer know yeah even you sir even even Bitcoin you know the reasoning is like okay very few people they know like the difference like a bit of currency and as a token you know personally I think even easier me human bitcoins it suggests a token yeah it's just a simple in a bit of proxy Network it's just a token yeah but you know the token I think is a regulator they don't know the clear definition of the token another curricular currency because in the whole industry we don't have this kind of a clear definition yeah yeah I mean even in Silicon Valley or even in any other countries any other like area don't one give a very clear definition on like what's curricular currency what is a token like what is like a currency what is a cryptocurrency you know no definition at all yeah so in China like some translation like okay they call it a token but the token have a very wide like if any nation even Caribbean currencies are kind of token yeah even become e serum it's kind of token so but is it you know the reason like a you know sometimes even a regulator they do not have too much technical background yeah it's hard to distinguish it's it's even harder for us to distinguish what's the difference even for the like the experts in this area in this blocking area no one keep on a very clear determination but from the from the other like a from the folder action or the further move over the POC another camera the regulatory Department like you know PTC China they will shut down the exchange so that a basically means like and no matter what a token you are trading well what a curb you can see you are treating in your exchange platform you need a delisted it's in three months yeah yeah actually I have a different opinion wastage pattern yeah the PBOC a document they used two words that one is in Chinese its diet B or you can translate it hand token or it also means yes substitution it also means substitution in China a Chinese so it I think it refers to those tokens that mostly RERC 20 tokens they claim to do something they claim to have their own token have a specific specific usage but they they issued before their manage is launched so probably PBOC is using tote a token to refer to those kind of virtual currencies and they all you you they also used a shinny copy of virtual currencies I think those this word refers to the tokens that had already had their managed and is up and running so they used the two different words and I have seen I have seen repeatedly in some official media set we need to separate Bitcoin Bitcoin exchange and blockchain technology so the government government is encouraging blockchain technology and that's the that's their stand on blockchain technology and they also said Bitcoin is legal in China and Chinese citizen is can lawfully hold and even trade in person with Bitcoin but Bitcoin exchange is not legal at this moment because any centralized exchange should be licensed under the Chinese security law so all the Bitcoin exchanges are centralized exchange in China and it's actually it's it's no need it's not legal I want to pick apart a few of the things that you mentioned but with this distinction that you were saying that you you know that you saw in the language where they had these different words so for the token one you thought that that was referring to tokens that had been issued where the main that had not been launched mm-hmm and then the other word that referred to any token where the maenette dip has already launched yeah Oh interesting okay so let me let me say it this way the token the word token they used refer to the those I see use the tokens issued by the AI seus and virtual currency is referred to the the token that is raised they used as a funding method like Bitcoin either Oh interesting yeah so then it doesn't matter if the the tokens main now has launched it's only about you know what is being issued versus what is being received i I don't know I I think there are two kinds of explanations here yeah I'm not sure I I think the regulator's they have they don't have a very strict definition yeah okay yeah but it is kind of curious why did they use the two different words and then which which category does does each token belong to but actually you know when you were talking about how you felt like even ether or Bitcoin you know falls in those categories and how those exchanges were banned I did want to talk about that so right now as Friday morning in China and yesterday here in the US are not yet well it's for me it's the same day this morning when I woke up I saw the news about Bitcoin exchanges or at least BTCC Bobby Lee's exchange and Bobby Lee actually also it was on the podcast maybe about six months ago but so I read that he he was closing his exchange and it sounds like you're saying that the regulators are closing them all because even right now as far as I know I haven't seen that confirmed officially yes it's never confirmed officially yeah but many media that was linked to the government had repeatedly reported all the exchanges will be closed okay and why so why is the government saying that the exchanges have to be closed but that peer to peer exchanges are okay oh it's sorry you said this earlier because they need to be registered first so it sounds like this will be temporary that they'll reopen no I I'm saying that centralized exchange is unique you need to have a license to set up a centralized exchange and all the Bitcoin exchange does not have a license and I don't think the government we're licensing them oh oh so they all have to close yeah and there's no chance of them getting licenses now I don't see I don't see that okay so then does that mean that with some traditional exchanges will be able to obtain these license to trade cryptocurrencies no I don't rate exchange Olivia do that I think no no one will do this in short time in short term yeah maybe in one year two years no one here today yeah okay and why do you think that they decided to do that to ban the trading of Bitcoin there are many reasons they're not into money laundry reasons there are capture control reasons yeah one statement in the official media is that bitcoin is not there is no real use case of Bitcoin and most of the use case are trading and speculation and your more sometimes involves criminal activities so yeah I think they are many reason yeah I mean do you think that the PBOC was right that that's what people are doing and nothing else III would say most of the activities around Bitcoin is trading speculation that is somehow - yeah yeah that's true yeah but I think is the reviews I mean they take the whole capital currency as like a narrow field it's you know yes you should have see the future of the currency like at the future of the money in the world like you know this area okay they sing the occasion maybe by the in 10 years or 20 years the Bitcoin will become the the top of five currency in the whole world only after USD dollar RMB or well yeah I mean you know most of people in the broaching area they still believe like a Bitcoin sometimes in the future if you become a global currency yeah yes so what is the reaction to this band versus the ico band or is it pretty much the same or do you think people are even more but kind of disappointed or surprised people even more surprised than the scared I was scared why scared you know okay there are some new new people they join of the industry this year maybe just a few months ago and they all think ok the pp comprised of you're always going up so some people they may invest a lot into the Bitcoin and you know after the after the after PTC China comes from real close to the exchange you know the price wouldn't just a wouldn't down like a 25 percent or even 30 percent become rising in China so it's you can see like people may scare the like all the chrome maybe become useless in the future and I cannot say my Bitcoin in the future anymore so yeah it's a it have some worse influences on the IC o---- Bane's yeah you know you after the IC o---- base some of the people like they still seem to okay I can still treat my Bitcoin I just cannot participate as I see you anymore but I can still like take Bitcoin as a long-term investment but you know after the BTC China comes from the deal closer exchange I think that's bringing more influence in the society to the public yeah people are scared like okay maybe in the future Bitcoin will go back to maybe maybe $500 $1,000 again yeah and so for people that own Bitcoin in China what are they doing are they all now panic selling on VGC China trying to sell their bitcoins before the exchange closes or are they holding on to it and saying oh you know a year from now two years from now it'll still be worth more I can keep it and I can sell it you know person-to-person at that point how are people reacting I think the newcomers they're sailing yeah they're panic yeah different different actions yeah people have a different reaction they're the true believers the venturous in the crypto words they're holding their coins even buying more buying away others are panic but the newcomers say they want to flip they want to make a quick money they want to buy today may be sound next week they find out it's very difficult sell maybe in the future so they decide to just load it to sell it and so once there is no trading anymore on exchanges there the way that people will both buy and sell Bitcoin will just be peer-to-peer is that it gonna be something similar to local bitcoins or how will that work yeah I think so I think that he will be similar to look a Bitcoin yeah yeah the OTC market yeah so I actually heard that one of the over-the-counter trading desks closed again there's so many rumors I really don't know if it's true I did have you guys heard that and if so do you think that that will happen to all the OTC desks it's true it's like this like they are there the OTC our company another company there's an OTC like application the name is a pecan yeah people can yeah it's a pecan so they close to the OTC yesterday two days ago yeah oh well okay and what are you guys doing are you selling your bitcoins are you gonna keep them I'm buddy I'm keeping all my bitcoins and limit your buy more that's hilarious okay well it was something else I was wondering about was in 2013 the PBOC band financial institutions from using Bitcoin how would you say that this crackdown is different actually in 2013 they they did not forbidden the financial institutions to use because they they they they asked the lot to facilitate Bitcoin trading so many of the bank account of the exchanges is coast but now they they don't just a closed the bank accounts they shut down all they exchanged so it's it's more severe here it's a it's a it's a harder below okay well so what do you think happens next what if you were gonna make some predictions about where cryptocurrency and China is headed what would you say I think you know okay the Bitcoin it's another released by our central governor why or by any country it's a global currency only in that so it's harder to bein like a by one country well one government yeah so because it's not a released by the government themselves yeah so I think in the future like yeah it's gonna be harder for the people who want to buy Bitcoin China if all the centralized exchange like okay coin op your PDC China closed yeah but a few of the extent plan form I think the ready have the plane to go to overseas to go to other countries to reopen the exchange platform but I mean the they should reopen the exchange plan from just according to coin treating no no Fiat money no no army without dollar involved just a Bitcoin to either Bitcoin to quantum will be continued yeah so it's just a coin to corn trading in the future I think it may be become mainstream in other countries yeah so I think for the blockchain technologies in China yeah it's still growing but it will take a longer time and and the some of the team in China they want to move abroad they want to move to other countries yeah and yeah I think the the regulation for sure have some like a side effect on older startups and all the big old a Bitcoin or the blockchain related industry in China but at the future I think it's still bright yeah and what about you guys how do you plan to proceed with your own projects so our plane okay so quantum earlier it's pretty glow below jecht yeah but the or but like a film in the last six lastly a half year we first know a lot in China so right now we made just the change our folks to other countries maybe to us Korea Russia yeah but like a China is not as a highest priority right now we are moving to the main like develop from the work under the the first is a marketing our energy to to other countries yeah and we have the plane to open an office in time for next month yeah oh really nice oh well yeah yeah Colorado is great yeah and Hong hey what about me oh yeah my understanding is the intrinsic reason for the Chinese government to ban ICU and exchanges is because it is somehow anti-government and somehow it's anonymous and and he said aha yeah and I believe it is it is this it is same in other countries so even in the United States so I think global regulation is inevitable there will be other countries that may step in to the ICO or you may exchange so I think anonymous or anti censorship block chance is not the trend for the future for the next few years I think it's it's necessary for the blockchain to be compliant to have like digital identities to to make the network compatible with current legal the system and we are at Neil we are doing a we are drafting a global legal framework for smart contracts running on you so if they want to do a token raising they can do it legally in most major countries so that's what we are doing and we're and the same thing is we are going global neo is already quite global because I believe most of the new holders are
