and as for the Karen Ellison situation I mean what's the reportedness he had a meeting with a mere Times Reporter at his house or his parents house and provided his diary to the reporter and you know the story came out and it was somewhat salacious um and I think the judge in the government felt that that was a wage try to get her to back off from wanting to testify fully and truthfully this trial she is an expected witness one of the government's key Witnesses from what we know and I think there have been a number of other incidents that had gotten the Court's attention about Sam when he's been out and so I don't think people were surprised that he was the thing I think most people I've talked to were surprised he wasn't detained from the start and so now that he's the team though that really does change a lot of the Dynamics or preparation for trial and it does make it much tough around the defense to prepare for trial
