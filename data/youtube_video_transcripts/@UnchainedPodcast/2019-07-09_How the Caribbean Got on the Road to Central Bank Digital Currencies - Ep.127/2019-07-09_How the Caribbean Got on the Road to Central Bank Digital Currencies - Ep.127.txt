having me on the show the company you found it bit is working with central bank's in the Caribbean to launch central bank digital currencies and some of those might launch potentially as early as next year but before we get into that I'd actually like you to tell your story from the beginning of how you got into Bitcoin in the first place ok well I was a student Ontario Tech University in Canada I enrolled in the program in 2006 the exact program was a Bachelor of information technology majoring in network security with honors and in 2006 I entered the program in Canada left the island of Barbados relocated to to Canada and in 2010 I completed my degree but in the final year one of the particular cryptography courses had a buzzword floating around the students and that buzz word was Bitcoin and back then it wasn't anything major a lot of us didn't know what was happening but myself and a few of my classmates were mining Bitcoin on our school laptops exploring the technology and not really knowing much about where it can go or what it represented at the time but once I finished my degree in the middle of 2010 I relocated to the island of Barbados and I launched a company called bit edge technologies in November 2010 and bit edge technologies primary focus was building software applications for companies one of the software applications that we wanted to focus on as an organization was blockchain based technology but really didn't understand the technology that much was just a huge fan of what it could potentially represent especially after reading the white paper by Satoshi Nakamoto and it wasn't until 2013 that I started taking Bitcoin and blockchain technology very seriously because in 2011 I tried to apply to do a master's of philosophy at the University of West Indies in Barbados and I had email I had emailed a couple of the deans and professors but unfortunately in 2011 there was no one that could Shepherd the program and during that two-year period of 2011 to 2013 I just did some mining on on a computer in my office and I wasn't really taking the technology seriously and it was only until 2013 that I'm that I started discussing the topic with one of my very close friends again Oliver Gale and we discussed the idea of blockchain technology in Bitcoin and what it could represent and I had been trying to launch a Bitcoin exchange with my team in Barbados and I had mentioned this to Oliver and he took a very serious interest in the technology he had a finance background and later on in that month we end up building out a couple of commercial miners which we end up taking to the island of Trinidad and Tobago and we started mining Bitcoin commercially using GPUs back then FPGAs and Asics were only now coming online they weren't really on the market per se and we continued mining for the better part of the 2013 period and into 2014 but simultaneously we had focused on building out this company that was called be ITT we wanted to build a crypto currency exchange for the Caribbean region and we had started building out this this solution and launched it in late 2013 early 2014 and unfortunately we could not finance both the mining operation and be ITT so and I think it was March or April 2014 we wound down the mining operation and put our full time focus into di/dt and fortunately for us this gentleman named Peter George who's now today our chairman of the board heard about us and he met with me in Trinidad and I explained my understanding of Bitcoin and what it represented for the world of financial inclusion and the empowerment of people from a social and financial economic perspective and he loved it and he said Gabriel my group and I we wanted back you and we liked the project and he backed us and the very first thing I did was I used some of the money to buy bit calm so we transition from be ITT to be ITT calm and in building out this solution we started to gain a lot of traction in the Caribbean market specifically that of Barbados and one of the big problems we were trying to solve was remittance because you see Lara moving money into the Caribbean is extremely expensive it can range anywhere from eight to eighteen percent on average and that's a very big cost in developing nations especially when it's typically the poorest that are trying to complete a remittance transaction and losing eight to eighteen percent of your your money is it's it's not favorable and we believed that using bitcoin technology and Bitcoin itself as a value asset system we could complete this transaction for a very small cost dramatically less and was out there on the market however the commercial banks were not willing to bank us and they were not willing to integrate into our system and we could not have a seamless system of allowing a consumer to access their bank account on the completion of this remittance we could not complete the last mile problem which was when money enters into our jurisdiction how do you get that money into the end-users hand and funnily enough we started looking more in depth at the blockchain based side of the Bitcoin technology so remember Bitcoin has two sides of it is to value asset commodity site and then it's the technological innovation that is the blockchain itself and we happen to be using or looking at both and I remember one day I started looking into central banking and commercial banking to try to get a better understanding of how they worked and I stumbled upon what I thought was a pretty novel idea of well why is it that commercial banks were deciding the payment network and the payment ecosystem it should have been the central bank creating and designing a network for everyone within their local society and I propose the notion of using the blockchain technology to create a digital version of the Barbadian dollar and I had suggested this to my partners and first I got resistance but after some thinking end up I end up getting full buy-in and I remember we went to the Central Bank of Barbados and I sat in front Dartford allow world who was at the time the governor of the Central Bank of Barbados and I explained the concept of creating a national dollar on the blockchain and representing it digitally and of course the feedback was not favorable I was escorted out the office and I won't say what I was told but I was escorted out of the office and of course feeling defeated as a young entrepreneur but having grit and resilience the team and myself from bit continued to build because we believed that this would be a superior solution for a local ecosystem of payments we believed that we were on to something and we were right so it took us a couple of months and we built out a full team of compliance financial operators and experts more programmers and we really built a solid team that came together and addressed all of the issues and all of the potential risks that may surround a national digital dollar and we kept going back to the central bank meeting after meeting after meeting and it became a massive issue for us because obviously with of with a limited limited cash budget and an uphill battle we needed to have a breakthrough and I remember I finally got so frustrated that you know the central bank of Barbados was talking about they want to support innovation on entrepreneurship and they want to uplift Barbados and I got frustrated my went to dr. world and I said look you want to support innovation that's what we're building here you want to support entrepreneurship that's what you're looking at and you want to uplift Barbados this is gonna put us on the front of the global stage if we do this and right now you're the only thing standing in our way and he looked at me he said Gabriel I won't put my neck on a line for this business or for you but I can see the merits in what you're building so I will give you a nod of approval from a wait-and-see perspective pursue what you're doing continue to build out and I won't hinder you well we continue to build and we ran straight to the press we held a press conference and we launched a beta version of the Barbados dollar remembering Laura this was a legal tender and it's not legal tender at the time it was just a representation of the Barbados dollar digitally very similar to tether except our operational policies mandates would be designed around those of the monetary expansion policies of a central bank but run by a private company until the central bank gave us the full approval and authorized this as legal tender and in doing that news article and doing that that press release we end up getting a news article published on coin des now I believe this was late 2015 early 2016 I had been fortunate enough to battle my way into Satoshi roundtable now Satoshi roundtable is like this very exclusive private event of the who's who alphas of the crypto industry I had really done a lobbying effort to get bruce fenton who's the organizer to allow me to attend because at first he had said no sorry there's no room for for you there and I said look we're doing a digital dollar that's that's that's going to be used by central bank's I really do think this is the future please allow me to attend and he said fine Gabriel you can come for one day so I flew I flew up to Miami and I rented a car and I drove to port st. Louis where this conference was held and I arrived late of course because of delays on the planes and you know flying out of the Caribbean as a headache and I arrived late when I arrived just in time for the dinner hall where everyone's meeting for dinner and I remember I was sitting down with a friend of mine there and I'm preparing to eat my food and I notice it's lady she walks past me and she's giving me this serious look and then she hustles off and she goes on whispers into this guy's air and then this guy just comes straight over to me and says excuse me young man or are you Gabriel Abed from bit calm I said yes I'm Gabriel says well let me tell you I'm I'm your biggest fan and what you're attempting to do for Central Bank's is turning back the dials of control and I believe this is the future I was like wow and I had never heard that before so I'm taken back and and I don't know who this guy is and then he said so well allow me to introduce myself I'm dr. Patrick Byrne of overstock.com and of course you know at that time overstock was the first billion-dollar company to accept Bitcoin as a payment method they single-handedly caused Bitcoin to rise significantly in value by their acceptance so I was already a massive fan of this guy and I was like wow okay I definitely know you are dr. berm well this is such an honor and he said well can I join you for dinner and and he sat down with his team dr. Ali on saini and and you know they spent the next couple of minutes picking my brain and discussing it and then he disappeared with with an entourage of people following him and everyone wanting to talk to him and once again I felt like I would never have the opportunity to properly discuss what we're building with this guy I just knew he was a fan and at this resort I think it was Club Med its massive and by Barbadian standards huge and I remember it was around 11 or 12 o'clock at night and I didn't really know much people there and I was feeling fairly lost I knew that there was an event and I gathering happening the net key the net key house our apartment and I could not find this place and I was walking around mindlessly looking for it and I'm feeling pretty upset and depressed and in the distance walking towards me says dark tall figure and as it gets closer I realize it's dr. Byrne he says Oh Gabriel I'm lost and I can't find where everyone is and and do you perhaps want to join me on a walk back to my room and I'll have a I have a meeting starting in my room and maybe you can give me the 5-minute elevator pitch on the way back to the room and when we get back to the room you know you can excuse yourself and I join him on this walk and you know I spent those five minutes pouring my heart and my soul out to this guy on what I believe we can do for the people of this world from a financial inclusion perspective from an empowerment of the Caribbean people perspective and how we can really change the face of Finance and well we got back to his room and he said you know Gabriel I'm gonna cancel my other meeting why don't you join me on my balcony and and let's discuss I want to know who you are I want to know about your background let's try to become friends and I think we spent until 6 or 7 a.m. that morning going back on 4 if he you know he educated me on the Austrian School of Economics i educated them on my beliefs of central bank digital currencies and how they should operate and we really spent some time getting to know each other and I had you know bragged a little bit and told this guy you know I knew I knew heads of governments in the Caribbean and I have access to ministers of finance and I know the central bankers and I believe that I'll be successful in the Caribbean region and the Caribbean was the perfect place to build this because they needed it because they have trade agreements amongst each other because had been for too long oppressed by the global financial network and I had believed this beat to be the perfect litmus tests or the perfect petri dish testing realm for this type of innovation and this guy called my bluff he said okay well if you have all these connections and network prove it my jet is beautiful my private jets being fueled up and in three hours we're gonna board it and we're gonna fly into Jamaica for starters well okay this guy is serious so I remember I called my team back in Barbados and I called Oliver and Simon I said guys as it's happening you know let's try to get the troops together can we get dr. demian King and Jamaica and Chris Tufton and Jamaica and Jamaica stock exchange ready for a meeting I'm gonna be flying into Jamaica in the less than two hours and while we flew in we flew into Jamaica and and dr. King was there he was there to pick us up he took our straight into the meetings with the with the heads of the Jamaica Stock Exchange and then we met the ministers of Jamaica and then Patrick turned to me after the meetings which went very well and we're very successful he said okay now do the same in Barbados I want to meet your central bank I want to meet the head of your Bankers Association I want to meet your Minister of Finance and we'll be flying into Barbados in the next hour - well I did that again I call back Barbados Oliver we're flying into Barbados we need up all of these meetings like now is just happening and and of course my team they couldn't they couldn't believe it they thought I was you know crazy or joking or but no I wasn't crazy or joking this was happening and by the way I'm running on 0 hours of sleep and well we arrived in Barbados and and I remember my partner Simon he came up to me and he saw that I had looked broken and and I bawled out and to this guy's arms and and well we we ran into the meetings and dr. Byrne met with our central bank and then he met with the Bankers Association he met with the invest Barbados which are the investment arm of the Barbados government that helps foreign investors set up and guide them and then he met with the Minister of Finance and I remember he looked he told the Minister of Finance I'm about to invest millions of dollars into these young men and I want to know that if I invest in them that the powers that be won't stop them because you're going to protect them and I want to know that if I invest in these young men and we put Barbados on the front and the center of the global age of central bank digital currencies that we have your support and of course they said yes and needless to say two months later you know we're sitting in a press conference announcing overstocks mega deal with bit calm the largest ever technology investment to a startup that the Caribbean had ever seen and we use that capital to continue to build out the evolution of what would become bit calm today I can expand on that a little bit more if you would like Laura well yeah let's let's do that but first I actually want to fill in a little bit of detail in that story initially when you were meeting with the governors of the central banks like what was the pitch that you were making in them was it to solve their remittance issue that you know you could use your platform to do the remittances and then with the digital dollar that would be a way where people could turn that into local currency or or what like what was the reason that you were saying that this would be a good idea well to be honest with you Laura I was I was just flying into countries on my own and walking right into the offices of central bank's going straight to the receptionist and saying to a receptionist I would like to meet your governor I have a proposal but I'd like to meet make to him or her depending on the country and a lot of the times I got through I actually was I actually got a meeting on in some cases the same day or a couple days later because I would say I'm in the country for X amount of days and I did this in Trinidad and Tobago I did this in Jamaica I did this in several different Caribbean islands and I would then sit in front the governor's or the deputy governors or whichever team they would put me in front of and I would pitch them on the following I would like to create my team and I our company would like to create a solution that would digitize your national based your m0 or m1 your you have coinage and notes your paper money and we would like to digitize that and then digitizing it we can create we can increase your seniority which is the the difference between the cost of printing money and the cost of issuance of money we can increase the accountability of your national dollar we can make it more efficient to account to count to transport to secure it's cleaner and safer with less bacteria so I had a full pitch on the the benefits that this system can bring and their reception was usually positive until I got to the blockchain part and when you go to the blockchain pirate you immediately got the hairs on their back standing up and I would have to argue that look digital systems are great and technology is important but blockchain is too superior solution because of the accountability that the technology brings in its transparency and its integrity and it took us several years to convince central banks of that so my main pitch was around the inefficiencies that we can solve it was around the fact that we can bolster our regional trade because in the Caribbean we have what's called the revised treaty of shag aramis which creates a union among our member islands very similar to that of the European Union the Caribbean has one of the strongest trade unions in the world but it's being underutilized we don't have our own grassroots custom design payment network there is no multilateral clearing facility within our region and the advent of this technology not only allowed you to create a national digital dollar but a regional trading system that bolstered and supported our intrusion alert and that was usually my pitch and it still to this day my pitch it's sort of like a B to B not B to B but like a like this will make your backend efficient kind of pitch this would make your entire economy efficient this would make your entire central bank settlement system efficient this would allow direct currency swaps multilateral clearing facilities trade weighted index currencies benchmark index currencies you name the economic model you want to create amongst your member states this technology made it possible and and that was where we tried to focus with it on them but the more important part was your citizens need to be empowered you have over 50% in some cases of people within these islands and these countries that don't have access to modern banking facilities they're under banked and unbanked and that is madness in the 21st century so being able to come at this from a technological perspective with a superior technology it can solve these problems and it can make our region really shine and it can allow us to really use these regional trade agreements to allow us to really rally the the goal of a one Caribbean while independently having our sovereign identities and that was really the Holy Grail and then was the pitch sort of like an M paisa kind of pitch where it's like people don't have bank accounts but they have phones and we can because ok yes because some of the islands bolster over a hundred percent mobile penetration rate where the average Caribbean person in some jurisdictions have more than one smartphone so the notion was not necessarily an M paisa Laura because while in pace is a great solution for Kenya in the African jurisdiction it it faced one major problem it was controlled by a private organization and in the case of Kenya more than 50 percent of the country's transactions go through a private organization what we had designed with central bank digital currencies was an open payment system not a closed payment system one that was mandated by the Monetary Authority one that was not controlled by a private company but by the organization or the entity that had set the fiscal rules and policies they had now been able to with our technology in our solution creates an open e public money system setting the standard and uniformity for all financial institutions whether you were a bank of FinTech a credit union or just a developer you had the same level of access across the board but this standard was set by a central bank that's the main difference from m-pesa bet comm wasn't creating a payment system that would be controlled by bit comm bit was creating a payment system that was controlled by the central bank so that the standards of payments and this network would be open and accessible to all citizens and all corporations and entities within that local jurisdiction and beyond so how did that work exactly because you said that you didn't necessarily have the blessing of the central bank but they wouldn't stop you either so because in that regard you know it wasn't exactly a partnership how did it function more like a central bank digital currency as opposed to like you know you you mentioned the comparison to tether as opposed to something like tether which is managed by a private company well that's an interesting question so in Barbados we had functioned very much like an EM paisa where we were a private company you would give us your dollars we would store those dollars in a one-to-one format with a with a commercial banking entity and what would end up happening was you give me let's just an example you would give the company 100 physical Barbadian the we would store that 100 Barbadian dollars with a financial institution and turning around we would make a counterparty 100 digital Barbados dollars noting this was full reserve one to one not fractional so in doing that we had created an peso type model but this wasn't our goal now and I believe 20 late 2016 at a conference in Washington DC that was being hosted by the CCAA I was giving a speech on the advent of Central Bank digital currencies and I met one of our younger governors of a central bank dr. Timothy Antoine and I had spoken to him briefly on the phone but in seeing him in person I had been able to give him the concept of what a central bank digital currency should look like how it would work and I had explained to him that no central bank had signed up with us now in some time 2017 Laura we were realizing that central banks you know they're very serious organization they're very conservative as a matter of fact they're probably the most conservative entities in the world we weren't getting much traction from them some of them were saying well you know you're from Barbados why isn't your central bank doing this as yet or we'll wait for you to get one central bank first before we take you seriously or we see this and we'll wait for another large organization maybe like the Bank of International Settlements to give full sanction of this well that wasn't really working out quite well and in meeting dr. Timothy Antoine of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank when I had told him about this technology he went and did his homework and one of the key things that he said was I would not be the governor that allows fair told us back we want to ensure that our people are empowered and I'm paraphrasing I don't remember exactly was that he said but it was along the lines of fair would not be the factor that holds us back we will ensure we need to do what we need to do for the empowerment of our people and in 2017 I met this gentleman named Rawdon Adams and Rawdon Adams was a gentleman who had a level of pedigree son of the soil of Barbados and his grandfather and father were very important characters to the evolution of the Barbados political and business fair along with that of the Caribbean our central bank is the Tom Adams financial center the airport that you landed in Barbados is the Grant Lee Adams International Airport so the Adams family had done well to put Barbados and the Caribbean on the map I believe his grandfather was the chairman of the West Indies Federation which today is CARICOM the same carry comb that I spoke about earlier on our on our call and when I met rod and Adams I got super excited because this was a gentleman to understand understood financial technology he had worked in the arena of Finance he was from the sea was a son of our soil and he understood fully the problems that were facing that we were facing in the Caribbean and I remember we were at the time looking for our Eric Schmidt you know Google had surged a brand and Larry Page and they brought on what they were calling a gray hair someone more seasoned than I experienced to guide the company forward well we were looking for our gray hair a bit and at the time I was a CEO and you know we had interviewed some guys in Utah and some guys around the world and they weren't really understanding the Caribbean problem they weren't really appreciative of the Caribbean issues and the unfortunate part is we weren't finding someone in the Caribbean that were understanding the international issues and the problems around global monetary authorities well rotten Adams checked the boxes and after going to dinner with this guy I remember calling dr. Byrne and and Peter George and the rest of my partners are saying guys I found our I found my replacement and I really want you guys to consider consider this guy I want everyone to meet him you know I really do believe this could be our our leader you know III would like to hand off my company to someone our company to somebody that I believed but do justice by it and well a couple weeks later you know dr. Byrne and Peter and everyone was flying into the island and meeting this guy and lo and behold Rawdon Adams was was hired and he took over my reins as CEO of bet calm and one of his first orders of business was to champion this governor dr. Timothy Antoine in the direction of central bank digital currencies and in February of 2018 Laura bet calm and the Eastern Caribbean central bank the Eastern Caribbean central bank which by the way is the central bank for eight Caribbean islands and it's the currency union for eight islands signed a contract with bit calm to move down and to move down the road towards building a legal tender and a digital version of the Eastern Caribbean dollar the entire dream that we had dreamed was now coming to light and now this II public money system was no longer a dream but becoming a reality great

to my conversation with Gabriel so I wouldn't understand more what this system what how it's built like what kind of blockchain is it built on is it all permissioned institutions that run the network and if so who decides who they are and also then do you definitely need a blockchain for that rather than just a database well Laura so let's let's go back a little bit here when we originally designed the notion of a central bank digital currency we had used the overlay protocol of Bitcoin bitcoins blockchain and we used a specific flavor called color coin protocol and that was back in 2014 unfortunately not taking into account of lightning that work the Bitcoin protocol is quite cumbersome for value placement on its overlay protocol and it was quite costly per transactions and for the storage issuance in the revocation now you can't empower an entire nation of people from a financial perspective if every transaction they're sending has a extremely heavy cost so we started looking at other technologies such as ethereum litecoin as well we started looking at a hyper ledger by IBM and what it really boils down to Laura is this is a collaborative effort between debt and the relevant central bank to making a decision that best fits them and one of the superior things that you can use is a decentralized blockchain based technology for many reasons - security aspect the trust aspect the transparency aspect the integrity aspect the open-source movement aspect and the global development aspect so it really boils down to that of a choice that the central bank needs to make and I'll be made on a per case-by-case basis while you know I may have my own opinions and while bit may have a preference of a technology they would like to build on it it is a collaborative effort between that of our organization and not of the central bank and now while I'm not a privy to discuss the solutions that we're building on top of you can you can bet that it's based on a blockchain based technology but so let's say that you end up working with several different central bank systems in the area and as you talked about like efficiency and interoperability or or or just I guess regional trade was kind of one of the goals there so then I guess interoperability would be important right so then shouldn't it absolutely oh really so kind of the same system as opposed to different no well you see you can't you know some central banks that I have spoken to have a preference to one blockchain or maybe someone within their IT department that's quite smart has done their own research and has a preference of another blockchain maybe a large organization like IBM has done a really good job of positioning themselves and that might be a choice what it really boils down to and this is a great question because this is one of our current problems that we're solving is ensuring that you create a digital dollar standard so what's really cool and happening right now that's being led in Barbados and in the Caribbean it's it's it's called the Caribbean settlement network and it's being led by our chief economist Molitor cran in collaboration with the Caribbean Development Bank the Caribbean Development Bank is the largest lowering Bank of the Caribbean governments and they taken under their wing the the Caribbean settlement Network as an initiative to building out this network of dissimilar technology-based solutions and one of the main mandates they have is to design and create what they're calling the digital dollar standard and the digital dollar standard would explore the the common denominators that a central bank's digital dollar should follow from a reference implementation from a code implementation from a public/private key pair encryption mechanism perspective on how these various mechanisms whether they're similar or not should function together for interoperability so the beautiful part is no matter what technology a central bank uses as long as they follow these reference implementations there will be interoperability and that is one of the key takeaways here is that we understand that no one blockchain technology is going to win and that no central bank or all central banks will not use the same blockchain technology and we have to understand that and we have to appreciate that that's the future of where things are going but where we can make sure we're position and where this the Caribbean Development Bank wishes to see the positioning happening is that interoperability is key and therefore this Caribbean sentiment network is focusing on building the legal and the technological frameworks to ensure that these dissimilar systems are interconnected and that they function with each other so that is a massive problem that's currently being solved as we speak and let's also talk about with this product that you have called m-money which i believe is is in Barbados so how does that relate to the Barbados digital dollar and and what what is and money what does it do and how does it work great question so in lieu of not having full sanction by the Central Bank of Barbados to create a legal tender and a digital version of the Barbadian dollar we were fortunate enough that we entered into a regulatory sandbox that was designed specifically with us in mind by the Financial Services Commission of the Barbadian government and the FSC and the Ministry of Finance and the central bank have joined the sandbox initiative to to oversee and money deployment within our local country so what it is it's everything that you could imagine a digital dollar is from the aspect of a user being able to pay for their coffee or the merchant being able to accept a payment privately using a proprietary solution designed by bit now it's not a full blockchain Laura but we are transitioning to that and with our work with the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank and other central banks we will eventually transition that to a full decentralized blockchain solution however in the interim and while waiting for this to become a full legal tender we have been regulated under the Financial Services Commission's regulatory sandbox where they can test where they can pilot where they can allow them to observe everything that we're doing from an issuance perspective from a payment perspective from the sending the receiving you know we currently have thousands of users in Barbados and hundreds of merchants across the island utilizing this platform so it's only a matter of time before we exit the sandbox with full regulatory approval and hopefully our central bank sees the merits of this solution hopefully they understand the advent of central bank digital currencies and they then champion they then champion this to be to make and money a the m-money product specifically the Barbadian digital dollar a full legal tender on the island of Barbados so what and money is its the representation of the utility that a central bank digital currency would look like because Laura let's look at it a central bank goes and issues a digital dollar well that's great they've been innovative but what happens now who's accepting it how is it being spent what does it look like in a local economy who's receiving it what does that look like from accounting perspective from a security perspective from an auditing perspective well that has to be designed and m-money steps in and fills that gap perfectly by allowing us to show the full utility of a central bank digital currency and it allows us to prove the viability of digital systems and digital payments within a small island developing state and how are you getting that into people's hands and like is it is it just like normal brick-and-mortar merchants or is it you know kind of like like websites or or mobile apps where that are adopting it where people can spend it oh yes it's all of the above it's local brick-and-mortar merchants whether it's a grocery shoot store you can go into a one supermarket in Barbados and buy your milk your food and your and your your drinks and your meats and your toiletries all using the mobile app or you can in addition use the teller functionality so some merchants merchants can ought to be either merchants who just received digital dollar payments or they can ought to be both merchants and tellers and the functionality of a teller teller te ll er the functionality of a teller is to allow a consumer to move between the digital world and the analog world and what that means is that I could bring my physical paper money to that teller deposit that paper money to that teller and that teller would give me the counterpart of digital dollars and maybe for a fee or maybe for free an encouragement for you to spend and shop at their local store so on the island we have dozens of merchants and tellers hundreds of merchants of dollars around the island currently allowing consumers to move between the log in the digital world and we have thousands of consumers using the platform for their digital shopping and of course lara has you you question does this work on websites yes there's API is that integrate into e-commerce and there's the ability to integrate this into your apps and your digital platforms so we cover both the brick-and-mortar and we cover the digital world and is there anything in it for the consumer where they feel that this is definitely superior to what they're using like and and what kind of it sounds like maybe volumes are low since it's still kind of in this testing phase I guess and you say it's just you know thousands of people so maybe it's not it's not very widespread yet like how do you get wider adoption like well what is the motivation for them remember Barbados is a small island with under two hundred and eighty thousand people so thousands of consumers is by Barbados is measurement quite large in the grand scheme of things I guess if you were looking from an American perspective with with a population of around 40 million thousands isn't really anything to scream about but let's also remember this is a chicken before the egg you know horse before the carriage kind of deal we're talking about a cash dominant society now moving towards a digital platform this is this is a long play here that we're going after so while we don't imagine we're going to convert the whole island overnight it's a matter of time before this superior system takes place because for the consumer it means no standing in bank lines no bank charges for the monthly service charges the per transaction charges consumers don't have to pay to send or receive which is one of our core principles and money ambit no sending and receiving fees for the consumer because we don't believe that's fair we don't believe that's right it's a it's a human right to be able to participate in a financial system and when you add taxes or fees to that you're being very unfair so for the consumer it's nothing but a win because now you can sit at the convenience of your home all of your all of your expenses now from the horse-and-carriage perspective we need to convince merchants to accept it but the merchants will say well you know where the consumer is coming from and then you need to convince consumers and the consumers to say well where can I spend it so is you know it is quite the battle but it's one that we're prepared to take on and have been taking on over the last year it's a matter of time before we get more utility into the app you know adding more functionality making it more user-friendly adding government taxation payment services being able to pay your national insurance and being able to receive your national bursaries these are things that are coming these are things that we're working on and the unfortunate part is we're building from the ground up we're building from scratch no one's coming in and and giving us the software no one's coming in and giving us the clients no one's coming in and giving us the merchants we have to build an entire ecosystem here we have to create this from nothing and we've been doing that so it's it's right now not not as widespread as as you know we would like it to be but we understand that this is the long play and and we're in this for the long haul we have been doing this for the last six years and there are zero intentions to stop and if you're not charging the consumers in any way then how does that make money well when we provide a solution we when we enter into a central bank or a Monetary Authority we're giving them the entire stack of Technology all three layers of the money supply chain to empower them to move from paper money to digital money overnight saving their economy in some cases millions on millions and millions on millions of dollars so when we offer them all three levels of the supply chain in the form of ready-to-go software and of course every central bank needs to be customized the central bank themselves are the ones that will that will finance and pay for this product and it's the commercial banks and the merge that would also have auxilary fees attached to it so for us a bit it's our main focuses central banks and there's around 186 central banks around the world that allow us to save them billions of dollars if you were to collectively look at what they're losing from poor inefficiencies within their local economies the fact alone is printing paper money's expensive Laura you know that paper plastic linen dollar that cost a lot of money to print so stepping in and saying hey we can make this may nine point nine nine nine nine percent more efficient and cost-effective well almost every central bank in the world will see this as a no-brainer to pay for this type of system and we are seeing that currently and I believe there's also an identity component to the system so how is that being used and could it eventually be used for other sorts of purposes because as you know in the blockchain space everybody's saying that this technology could be the underpinnings for some sort of identification system for governments or or or a decentralized identity solution well we aren't an identity company but we do work with several we work with identity mind we work with net key and we work with shift and there's several other components and offerings out there and our main objective is when we approach a central bank with a central bank digital currency all right identity partners to come full tow with us because you did rightfully say it there is an identity component here which helps central banks provide you know a level of oversight that they would need to understand what's happening within their local economy it helps provide things along the lines of suspicious activity reporting it helps battle things like money laundering and terrorism financing it really does empower an entire country with that and combining digital dollars with identity provides a superior solution for economic oversight and empowerment you also found it Polly Abed which is now the single largest shareholder of the Barbados Stock Exchange how did that happen in what do you intend to do with that position okay this is an interesting segue this is by the way completely this is completely separate from bit calm and and my own private ventures so I met the polymath team in in Canada and I was quite intrigued by what they were trying to build for the securities market and I found that they could really be a massive solution to benefit regulated stock exchanges in moving them towards a digital world of stock issuance and I overheard through the grapevine that KPMG and ey were looking to sell their shares in the Barbados Stock Exchange yes they were shareholders and I had something to do with a conflict of interest and they were looking to exit their positions and I approached polymath at the time and I had made the suggestion that we should look at partnering in a joint venture agreement to acquire these shares and the vision that I saw was being able to take a small island developing state regulated stock exchange with 40 years of reputation and history and Trust and evolve them to a much more efficient book based system and in doing that allow a potential network to be formed with other stock exchanges around the world the polymath guys Chris and Trevor and the other partners considered it and thought it was quite a brilliant approach because it can empower the polymath platform and it can empower a small island developing state a polymath by the way is headquartered in Barbados and well we made the offer and we were it took a very long time from a regulation perspective because obviously when you're dealing with highly regulated businesses one doesn't just get transfer of shares overnight it requires regulatory approval a lot of due diligence on the characters involved and a very large process that with a lot of due diligence and it took us about a year and a half and but we were able to acquire KPMG and ey share position to allow poly abed which is a joint venture of Gabriel Abed myself and polymath to become the single largest shareholders of the Barbados Stock Exchange mind you it's not majority we are not the majority or major shareholders but combined we are the single largest shareholders and that gave us a voice within the organization and it allowed us to work closer with the CEO of the Barbados Stock Exchange Marlin yard who is quite a progressive thinker and in recent months the Barbados Stock Exchange has made announcements that they are moving down the road of building out a blockchain based securities and equities environment with a full digital order book system to allow the local and international companies that are domiciled in Barbados to have a new platform that would allow them to listed early trade there Jolie and of course all be based on blockchain based technology so another advancement and another another great maneuver for the Barbadian populous you've also been serving a special technology advisor to David Burt the premier of Bermuda and that was one of the earliest countries to pass a series of crypto friendly regulations why do you think Bermuda has been so welcoming of the industry ah interesting question so I am the special technology advisor directly to premier David Burke and I met him at the World Economic Forum in Davos and when I met premier Burt he had indicated he wanted to do everything and anything needed to create stability to further the stability of his local economy create more jobs for his local people create economic growth and encouraged foreign direct investment and of course Laura I pitched him on blockchain technology and there was a couple of others of us from the global blockchain business council I think George from bitfury and and Sandra from G BBC a couple of us were there yes Santa Rosa right and and and I think Dante as well Dante this brat and who I believe was one of your guests very recently on the show brilliant well with that kind of lobbying effort you know and that kind of brainpower talking to a leader of a country you know he was very intrigued and he said you know if you're serious about blockchain technology and this could be an avenue to create economic growth foreign direct investment and jobs for my people then I'm interested see yourself on my Shores well a week later I was in Bermuda and I was working with the premier on an advice perspective of looking at their local laws and there was a couple of us so it wasn't just me but I'm the only one that's his direct adviser on blockchain and technology and you know I had never I made a promise to him we both made a promise to each other the promise I made to him was I would serve premier Bert for free without charging a cent and I will be his advisor if he promised to be the leader that our industry are needed because at that time we didn't have a single leader in the world that was serious about this technology and willing to pass any laws to create a home for us we didn't have a home Laura we didn't have a home that mandated the right type of legal frameworks and we made that agreement with each other and premier Bert proved that he was one of the first politicians in history that I have ever met that honored his word and worked day and night with his ministries and his team and his government to become the first government to create what's being called today that Bermuda stack of Technology which is a series of new legislations that passed the lower house the upper house and the Senate in a very little amount of time I have never seen a government move as quickly Laura ever in my life and within three to four months this leader had all of these laws passed and all of a sudden you know well he did what he promised to do and after promising that we entered in a contractual agreement where every year premier pays me one cent for my services and now this guy is leading a country that has the most forward-thinking laws as it relates to blockchain based technology and now tons of companies are flocking to their Shores to establish on their Shores I remember I reached out to shine pings out of by not cz and I said hey you need at that time cz was by nots wasn't where it is today and they were having some regulatory issues and I said look why don't you come and meet premier Bert I'll meet you in Bermuda and C's he flew over to Bermuda I met him there and next thing you know premier Bert and him are working side-by-side and and they've entered into agreements on launching by not from Bermuda don't remember by NASA's position in so many different countries their whole goal is is to make sure that they're not seen as headquartered in one country but many but the point is that the industry leaders from dr. Patrick Byrne to cz - you name it have all thought to the Bermuda to create economic growth foreign direct investment and job creation for the people of Bermuda premier Bert has done and is doing his job so yeah and people should listen to the episode with Suzy if they haven't already and I do know that from your bird has said that just as Bermuda has become a leader in the insurance industry he saw an opportunity again you know for a small country like his to to become a leader in another versioning industry and so I think that was kind of the appeal for him with blockchain technology so you you also launched a fund digital capital asset management how how big is the fund and what do you invest in well I'm not privy to discuss the assets under management the fund the fund has has only been around for just under two years and our main focus is is protocols math based protocols that is our mandate and that's why we design digital asset fun and the fun came about because I met this gentleman on a random on a random conversation named Richard Galvin who had over 20 years experience in the banking world from JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs and at the time he was looking for something more innovative and something that invigorated its soul and and matched who he was as a character and I told him you know Richard I I want to start a fund I have a few dollars maybe we could look at doing something together and I do not have any experience with fund management I do not know how these things would operate I just know blockchain technology like the back of my hand and the two of us partnered with a couple of others and we built out this fund and it's called digital asset capital management which is the management group and the particular now it has three funds under it but the main one is called digital asset fund and our whole objective as a fund is to invest in math based protocols and that's what we do and that's our whole mandate and the fund has performed beautifully this year and I'm very and to be honest Laura I can't take any credit for it well while I do help with Oh Flo and I do identify the blockchain projects and I help with the vetting process you know Richard is he's just such a boss you know late if the crypto winter saw so many funds fold up so many funds didn't make it through and so many funds lost massive money for their clients but Richard was just you know so having someone of that pedigree from the banking world step into the new world of blockchain he's just been a godsend to the fund world to the blockchain fund world and and and you know I remember I was freaking out during crypto winter and this guy wasn't even fazed you know he was just so stable and so mature and professional and and brilliant with how he managed every aspect of the fund even all the way down to cutting out his salary in some cases to ensure our fun continue to perform and you know we rallied through the crypto winter and now we're seeing the fruits of our labor and I gotta give Jack his jacket Richard Galvin is quite an OG so from talking with you especially from the early part of your story you seem to be a true Bitcoin er and yet most bitcoiners are against centralized to anything or I don't know about most but a lot of them and yet you're kind of working on the central bank digital currencies which are by nature centralized so why do you think that's an important step and how does that fit into kind of how you see this technology playing out and becoming adopted so that's a very loaded question or us thank you for asking it I didn't expect to get easy questions on your show you're known for being a tough one but look I'm a maximalist when it comes to Bitcoin ie and this is my personal opinion this should not reflect that a bit calm I just want to remind you're you're investing in exactly yes yes well we're investing in math based protocols which are which are pretty important because Bitcoin does something's very right but doesn't do everything right but I I believe in I believe in proof of work and I believe in the security and the immutability of that the inability to edit forge destroy or tamper with a record it's why we are here it's the exact reason we are all here today is that single word immutability nothing beats that because of the proof of work security behind Bitcoin there is no displacement for the energy computational output of a consensus driven ledger technology like Bitcoin so let's start there that's my personal opinion but I'm also well aware that like the newspaper and the internet not everyone is going to champions go and read a blog you're still gonna have people that believe in their paper buy newspaper similarly with a central bank you're not gonna be able to convince a nation or a body or an entire globe that bitcoin is a superior system nor does it necessarily meet their needs in their daily transactional purposes you won't be able to get everyone convinced nor does it meet their needs so you know looking at the technology I realize that bitcoin for me was great but it wasn't gonna suit the poor guy on the street who needed something stable who believed in his sovereign dollar and who didn't even understand technology and in looking at that I realized we had to build something that was a transition from the old world to the new world and we had to ensure that what we were building was going to create a smooth transition because look we're not gonna see a break overnight where dollars just die and Bitcoin takes over or whatever the next monetary evolution is we're never going to see that it's going to be a slow transition in addition to the we're not going to be able to convince the world that this is a better solution in addition to that we need to appreciate and understand the laws of a sovereign nation and the job of a central bank to create stability and Trust in their national dollar and in looking at this technology I believed that this allowed central banks to meet in the middle of decentralized digital systems it allowed them to issue their national dollar on this immutable ledger system to allow them to have the benefits of the security of immutability the trust of this type of solution the transparency in their issuance and at the same time allow them to maintain their control as a central bank because remember the central banks and the monetary authorities are the ones after all that create an issue and control the money supply of their local economies and I believed that in building a central bank digital currency this would be the natural evolution of where a central bank or a society needed to go before we even began to discuss a future where an entire country move towards a different type of solution so to answer your question I believed that this to be the natural evolution of central banks alright well we'll see how it plays out where can people learn more about you and bit calm well if you want to learn about bit calm its WWD I dot sorry I was about to say our old website di da TT which I believe it's still alive but it's WWB itt calm bit with two T's you can learn all about us we
