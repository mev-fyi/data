hi everyone this is a special episode of a panel on due diligence in the crypto space from the time summit a bridge alternatives event I had a brief but very interesting discussion with soon as I need founder and CEO of family office Nima Capital Eddie to slack of Texas Children's Hospital and Joel Cantor of cancer family partners in it they discuss how they invest in the NASA and web 3.0 space as outlined by polishing capitols Olaf Carlson we earlier that day they also talked about why a year of experience in crypto is so valuable how they determine who the serious players are in the space and why the speed of disruption from the internet revolution gives them motivation to get into the crypto markets this was a fantastic conference with great speakers and questions from guests enjoy on may 11th and 12th some of the most interesting humans from around the globe will come together in Brooklyn for the ethereal summit hosted by consensus to collaborate on building the decentralized future

more a request an audit visit WWF hello hello ok everyone we're gonna get started with our next panel this one is about investment and operational due diligence hurdles in crypto asset and my panelists are eddie d black assistant director of the Investment Office at Texas Children's Hospital Joel Kanter CIO at Cash your family partners and soon as I heed seemed it's the founder and CEO of Nemeth capital so let's talk about the operational due diligence and we've got a little we've only got like about a half an hour so why don't we just start right in with the different types of investment that investors can make in this base and what the pros and cons at those yeah I think from like actual like evaluating funds you they don't actually look that dissimilar from like a traditional investment that you're probably used to evaluating like you have some that block tower this book yesterday like more of a short-term kind of discretionary trader it's just the underlying assets are crypto as opposed to to equities you have some that are kind of like look more like a long biased equity manager where they might own ten assets have you know kind of a three to five year time horizon you have others that are kind of more unlike the venture capital into the spectrum where they're looking at smaller opportunities where they're trying to help the management teams or the developers scale and they have more of kind of a venture capital approach some that are focusing more on like icos and so there's there's a broad range kind of across that that that you know i think when you actually get to the underlying strategies it's similar to evaluating any other manager that somebody from an institutional investor would be used to evaluating from like a style what's their competitive advantage all of those types of things I think it Eddie I just wanted to also frame this because you're only describing the crypto hedge funds right yep because even with beyond that what are some the other investment opportunities yeah so I think right now I mean it's primarily looking at you know whether it's crypto currencies such as Bitcoin or or or others like manera there are tokens like utility tokens you heard you heard or loss speak a little earlier on things like golem or file coin that provide access to a network that has some kind of utility to the end user and then beyond that there's there's there's icos there's funding early stage kind of management teams or developers to to pursue and kind of develop a protocol those are you know in my mind kind of some of the big bigger categories and I think there's there's other areas like you know what Olaf was talking about earlier with Dharma I mean down the road being able to be a lender on a platform like that is you know opportunities that you kind of don't aren't there yet today but that will develop over time or investing in things like crypto kitties if that's kind of more more of your fantasies yeah actually there are a couple of opportunities out there and there are certain platforms that are attempting to enable you know lending utilizing a blockchain you know there's mining there are opportunities to invest in mining so it's been a relatively rich opportunity set I would say which which is only growing like how well these actually turn out is another issue I mean because there are plenty of risks associated with these that like we don't typically see in traditional funds and Sunnah I know you are investing also in some of the VC firms and the startups yeah so we're invested across the spectrum we're invested in crypto funds blockchain VC funds we invest mostly directly pre IC o---- seed stage VC and what we think it comes down to which is actually something you taught me early on aura is the underlying talent so for example as you explained to me again early on you were like someone like a Joey Krug who built a gur which was one of the first companies built on top of aetherium like following what he does and seeing you know what projects is he like who does he you know write articles about her how is he talking about mining or scaling or for example like a Joseph poon who wrote Lightning Network for Bitcoin and aetherium and recently over the last couple months also wrote plasma with vittala computer and like really get into the underlying talent follow them see what they're doing and seeing how the technology is accelerating and leapfrogging up on itself and then seeing okay what are the new applications and to that and something that we're finding is and exciting new development is there are some investors and funds that are focusing on the application layer so they're investing on the protocol layer unlike for example there's in a firm called IDEO they're a design firm and they have been working on user interface user exchange dynamics network design community building around protocols and Joseph poon for example said this is the most exciting fund because they're launching a fund that is going to come out of the ecosystem by far because they're gonna help scale out the technology globally in a way that I think we all know is going to be possible and it's just a question of the technology finding its scaling solutions like Olaf said and actually I spoke with Olaf about this fund as well and you said that's amazing to focus on the daps at this stage because it feels almost a little too early which is the time to get in like invest before it's obvious I think that's just generally a theme that we follow as a family office so we apply that to everything yeah I would just say that like that that sounds really interesting we can talk about it later like the interesting thing for investors today is like everything is sort of inefficient today every like there's nothing in this space where you could say all right everybody's got the joke right we're talking yesterday at the conference about the lack of alpha in markets like when you look for alpha you want like complexity and people who don't understand it you want volatility like it's it's really all here you know and actually one other thing I guess you you want is alpha donors like retail investors who are willing to give you their alpha right and and and that's what like this space is providing today and so while I think that's totally totally great I think on a slightly more mundane level there's still a lot of opportunity for normal long only investing in the space absolutely because we've been talking about sort of the different layers at which you can invest there's like the protocol layer and there's the a player how do you know there's these French capital times the hedge funds the the startups how do you determine kind of which type of investment you want to make and what are the differences like in returns or around strategy well I have my answer like I I know that I don't want to be competing with Olaf for you know determining where I want to put my money and like an ICO or a project and so you know much like I did for many years like looking at you know stocks and bonds utilizing hedge funds and experts to do it like we we will almost always utilize a manager or fun structure to to make those investments and do anything when I on that we were probably more in the same boat okay well I also wanted to ask because I don't yeah so on the crypto trading side we as a firm actually learned a valuable lesson which was that the traders definitely do a better job treating and that being on the inside of the ecosystem is actually not even that helpful so like we definitely bucket things into crypto blockchain BC we have different people in the firm focusing on the different areas for example the beginning when we started investing in crypto um we had competing funds to see who would do better I had my little fund and the traders had their fun and I thought this is gonna be such a layup I'm totally gonna outperform them because I'm in the you know center of the ecosystem on all these telegram chats I have advisors like Joseph poon and you know Charlie noise and navall Ravi Khan and you know they're constantly giving me the updates and I have to say the market like I kept trading on the information and more often than not the market just went the other way and I know we have like around the Bitcoin for for example and things like that and my trainer is actually far and away like outperforming so it's funny like in some ways some asset classes in the area are actually more you know follow more of a traditional like technical trading framework with some obviously fundamental information but it's not necessary such an advantage to be like inside the you know value creation on the other end of the spectrum like the early stage seed stuff it's definitely helpful to be talking to the insiders and seeing you know what's already been done where is there still white space how is it technology advancing well one one thing about what you just said is that I do wonder over a different timeframe might you actually end up you know being right on the chakra my brain maybe especially if you were doing your test over the fall then that you know may not have worked out super well for you yeah and then I'm sorry look actually want to comment on that because you didn't mention it all in terms of funds it's definitely helpful to have people who like metastable or old off like that's the perfect scenario where they have the technical a little bit but are also able to like Lucas Ryan does at metastable look at the underlying protocol and analyze it and all that yeah I don't want to take away from that the ethereal summit hosted by consensus is anything but your average blockchain conference joined builders philosophers policymakers artists and humanitarians from around the world on may 11th and 12th at the knock-down Center in Brooklyn for two days of storytelling and

aftermath of the dow hack quant stamp is building the first smart contract security auditing protocol designed to secure all smart contracts in a cost-effective and scalable manner relying on humans to audit smart contracts is expensive and error and with the exploding growth of smart contracts that solution just won't scale the team at Kuan stamp is developing a solution to audit smart contracts on the etherium network in an automated and decentralized way that can scale with the growing demand being built by a team of PhDs who collectively have over 500 Google Scholar citations quant stamp is paving the way for safer and more reliable smart contracts that will power the decentralized world to learn more or request an audit visit WWF what I want to also is in this current round west of crypto how do you determine who the serious players are and who you can trust because there's a lot of people that you can't trust as we've seen there's tons of scams there's a lot of unserious people that are just getting everyday people to throw money at them and initial point offerings so how do you determine who you should work with or who is legitimate or serious yeah I can go first I mean I think for us like being a children's hospital like fiduciary for your children's hospital like that's something that we think about a lot clearly and so a lot of it comes down to who are venture capitalists that we respect and where are they allocating their money so I mean I think one of the I think inflection points for like endowments foundations other institutional investors like really rolling up their sleeves on the space was when I think was March or April of last year it came out that like Sequoia andreessen horowitz founder spawned and others were investing in poly chain and and metastable that was me I broke that news in July yeah I know it's a great article yeah but I do think that was an inflection point for this this people in RC to be able to say okay if I'm scrambling for capacity to get into this next Sequoia fund like why does it not make sense for me to look at something where they're willing to pay an external manager some kind of fees like that seems like it would be someone with a high conviction idea and then it also makes it easier to pitch to a board where you say that you know we're Co investing alongside this manager we have a lot of respect for so our network has kind of our way of kind of getting into that of like who to trust what has been through you know our GP relationships on venture capital side yeah the one thing I would add is like absolutely you know I agree with you know both you guys like it's all about your network which is no different from the investing that most of us do when we look at long/short equity funds or macro funds right you use your network you figure out who's credible but but the one thing that's a little difference is that there there's really there's such limited history in this space like there's not a lot of precedent this truly is an experiment and like there's the idea of sort of dog ears in the crypto world and like Olaf's been doing it and you know 11 or whatever like he's a he's like the George Soros of this industry even though he's 28 years old right and so I think like with each additional year of experience it's tremendously valuable like just to have seen all the mayhem that has occurred in this industry so so I value personally I look at experience quite quite a lot when I look to allocate to managers yeah there's something funny that Olaf said to me before he was like talking about you know some of the crypto crashes or something or maybe we're in a downturn at that moment and he said oh my god this is nothing compared to when it went from 32 to $2 like you know everything like all the way back in 2011 and and in fact that he was like 21 or something and I bet like most of his life savings and then it devastated him so anyway I'm gonna do you have more to say on that yeah I agree followed the talent which luckily in this ecosystem is still it's such a small community actually it's not hard to go and you know get into the weeds to go on medium or Twitter and see what are the thought leaders saying and that's the beauty of diligence in this it's still a small ecosystem so if you get in now even if you're just intellectually curious or interested and don't necessarily want to invest yet it's really fun to just get the ethos and understand how is the technology gonna unfold and what are these people saying about how the world is going to evolve along with it and speaking of who you know you work with what about on within an institutional investor who within that company or entities should be dealing with this type of investment well I think you know I don't know exactly who but like the volatility is such like the most dangerous thing for an institution is to to get cold feet at the wrong time right that's what destroys many potentially good investments over the long term it becomes two paths dependent you draw down you get out and like there's no better case study for path dependency than the crypto world and so what what I would say I don't work for an institution anymore but I did for many years is like what I would say is anybody who has a right to pull you out of that investment like I would argue they should have a hand in the diligence so that they can really appreciate not just reading a memo like this will draw like there are many good funds that have presented here or less many of them drew down 50% in the first quarter I'm sure I'm not sure I would guess right and so unless unless you're in it unless you have an appreciation and you built up that knowledge I think it's very hard to live with that so so that's the only thing I would add on the institutional side yeah I think the thing I'd say is most often it seems like it's whoever was investing personally and then they get really excited and they're like hey why shouldn't we do this for the actual group that we're we're managing money for and so that I've seen that kind of come across multiple areas like I focused more on like equity public market strategies but I was excited and it didn't make sense to not have not be looking at it on behalf of like in the institution we're managing money for but more often than not it seems like it's kind of more within like the venture capital seat like whoever's overseeing that just because of the relationships and the fact that they're investing in this ecosystem and their network and all of that so I think it's probably somewhere in between but I think it is kind of since it is a new territory it's kind of open to whoever can be able to add value within that okay and then as we were talking about in the earlier part I mentioned something about so I actually agree with you that it's actually more about mindset than what particular vertical they're in so finding someone who has an entrepreneurial mindset but also a long-term investing mindset makes a lot of sense and somebody is organically passionate about it who wants to read about it at midnight and get into you know what's plasma or what are the scaling solutions or what's Olaf saying there has to be that intrinsic passion that's involved in it and I think it has to be personal to some extent that we have that the person has a connection to the world that we're in now and a connection to the world that might come about as a family office money is very personal to us right like my constituents are my kids and my grandkids I feel like man I'm about to say an expletive but I'm not like I better not miss this I better not like miss you know of the next internet wave and I better not lose this money to you know companies that are about to be disrupted because the technology is gonna go like this parabolic and then a whole bunch of you know companies like blockbuster banks you know could really just get wiped out very quickly as we saw you know as the internet ramped up you know newspapers things that were considered very safe for for example family offices were just you know almost overnight and you couldn't get out in time like I think from an institutional mindset it's really important to look at these larger scale movements and understand what's gonna happen before we can see it yet because that's the time to look and prepare for example Facebook did a study that showed that 92% of Millennials have an extreme distrust of banks and if I even just look I have a six year old and an eight year old I have a really hard time imagining them actually walking into a bricks-and-mortar bank because they already do so much on their phone my daughter you know she's coding apps with her girlfriends like it's such a different mindset and it's important I think for us to have the neuroplasticity to not look at the world that's here now but to kind of extrapolate out what is that going to look like because when you have a technology that gives part of the people that's more efficient more secure like those things to win out like it's a logical connection you know it's an interesting point actually which which makes this technology a little bit different is that you know you talked about blockbuster and and the changing of the guard and and value accruing here and declining here but what's really interesting is is that like if this takes off and it isn't if right there are lots of risks but but if it takes off and if olaf's of vision is any close to you know close to being true then like this value will not accrue to equity markets like which i think is a really interesting idea and so like the S&P like Amazon wins these guys lose but the SMP might be sort of similar like if if Tasos wins you know when they disrupt uber and twit you know who knows like there could be a real changing of the guard of where that value is accruing in the ecosystem which i think is sort of an interesting idea and not to just pass the baton down here but but I think on that point to is is like you can assign a probability like you can say that what Olaf said has a 10 percent likelihood of succeeding but imagine what the prices of these underlying assets are gonna look like if that vision succeeds and a sign like a probability multiplied by that and I know that's a little simplistic but I mean we're investing is in the game with like probability and so I think sometimes like there's a tendency to think about things in terms of like it's all or nothing it's a hundred percent or zero and I think that's part of why I became excited about it and interested it's just because of that you know say it's a 50 60 whatever probability you assigned but multiply that by the return and think about it also some what is a hedge for disrupting the traditional business models that that we all hold through the markets and I think that's a critical link that a lot of people who were kind of at zero and may may want to think about so I totally agree with you on all those coins as I was telling something the other day the likelihood that things stayed the same is pretty much zero and so you know there is gonna be something that comes out of this technology however I want to reference what's you know said earlier about blockbuster and about how fortunes can change so quickly and turn that on its head a little bit because we are in such early days in this space we've seen so many hacks of exchanges we've seen a lot of people losing their private keys and losing lots of money so when you are investing and you're doing your due diligence how do you account for the way that the various institutions or companies or protocols are you investing how do you you know make sure that they're following best practices when it comes to security and that you're not gonna lose your investment why I don't you know I don't think there are established best practices yet which is one of the challenges of doing diligence now that there are some things that that folks are doing so for example there's a process of white listing where you you limit the addresses to which funds can be sent so you don't there's no fat finger like because once you send Bitcoin and you send to the wrong address like it's gone right so what steps can you take to ensure that cannot happen right in terms of like we just heard this panel about you know qualified custodians and I think people are now starting to move in that direction but but in in my you know limited experience over the last 12 months like I think it's a very much get in you know like roll up your sleeves in and try to understand how it works and because there there are no easy answers to what is best practice that I've come across too many aspects of crypto investing and I think like where this is very different from like a traditional fund evaluating a funder strategy isn't operational due diligence and I think that I'd put a twist on the panelists yesterday we the four active managers said that you know don't try this at home like I'd say you actually should try this at home but in a small amount because you will learn so much and you such better questions of the fund managers because when you go into coin base by your Bitcoin and then you want to send it to you know in exchange so that you can make a trade like you know you want it like to your point like you mess up one single digit like it's gone like and and that's a stressful situation and Satoshi doesn't like pick up the help desk and like say let me get you your money back like you're you're you're you're in you're in a bad situation and then when you get to the exchange you you know to look and feel a lot like kind of a traditional like Schwab or you have like limit orders market orders etc but then once you get it off like say you're buying Z cash or something you can't put that back in a vault a coin base you have to go and buy like a hardware wallet or some kind of wallet to store it and so then you're like okay well where do I do that and there's like treszura ledger and which one should I use and then when you plug in your treasurer you always hope that the money's still there because it's the thing you bought for $100 off Amazon and like that's kind of stressful too and so understanding like all of those types of things is like a reality of kind of where we are within this landscape and you will be able to understand like okay if a hacker got control of my computer and saw me sending it to this address like are they using private VPNs or are they like making trades at coffee shops on like public Wi-Fi are they white listing the addresses so they can't do that who has access to the funds like you can have a trading error but it's actually an you know an intentional allocation of funds to like a separate account or something like that that there's a lot of areas where this could be problematic and rogue traders and all those types of things and so I think that's where this is like very different and very important at this age and in the life cycle is to make sure like the operational side is is buttoned up and in a good place yeah and I totally agree about learning how to play with it yourself because even if you have just a few Bitcoin on one of those little hardware devices that's in the tens of thousands of dollars right there which most people are not used to holding some little you know it's like the size of a USB stick that's worth that much money and not losing it which can be a problem for some people like me because I'm really good so one other thing I wanted to ask about was volatility in the space how did that affect your influence or affect or influence your investment decisions I think for us I mean you know volatility you can adjust for sizing and just sizing and smaller I think there's also it also makes you like it makes us more interested in cost averaging so like a venture structure made more sense because you have a three-year investment period and you're kind of cost averaging it over that period so I think it makes you it makes us more attentive to like one we want to cost average in and two we want to make sure it's kind of sized appropriately from that well it actually presents an interesting problem because like the the perceived wisdom is you know put 1% or 2% I don't know what the numbers your is like so if it goes up a lot you make money and if you lose like you don't worry but but but a strange thing happened like you invested money in June of last year and you put like one and a half percent and all of a sudden it was like four or five percents like wait I don't want to lose 5% so like the whole sizing issue gets very wacky and and it's almost like trying to to account for an exposure of an option let's say or Delta adjusting an option in your book and typically at least if you're investing in funds you don't have the option to use the word again to to get out quickly so so the size the sizing issue presents its its own challenges we've found I mean thankfully the market took care of my 5% position it's back back down to two so the market solved at that time but so I think one of the things that might have been affecting the market is the regulatory uncertainty how do you guys factor that in so again I think it's really important to do one's research and read up as much as possible on you know how the CFTC is thinking about this how the SEC is thinking about this you know all the way up to minuchin and Trump and you know I was asked to write a policy proposal for the administration and I think to the extent that we can take some of the fear away and focus on the way this our administration can create a legacy around power to the people would be really hopeful and to understand that is obviously something that we can all get involved in and then I think something else that's helpful in terms of regular because it is moving so fast you need to it's changing everyday to look outside the US how other countries like Switzerland and you know certain parts of Asia Japan are looking at things because at some point countries are gonna have to adjust their regulation in concert with one another because otherwise there are going to be this large imbalances so with the volatility and the regulation I think both of them it's important to look at long term trend lines and say does this make sense in the long run and to look at it as a long term investment proposal while educating oneself and tweaking things along the way and how do you know if something makes sense in the long run without what the regulatory clearing I just gonna add like to your previous question on regulation I mean I actually think I think most people think of it as like this uncertainty and it's scary but in a lot of cases like regulation has actually been good I mean watch go to youtube and watch big kinect video of like this guys standing on stage screaming about how much money is gonna make everyone like it is like nauseating how fraud like it was and like that's where the regulator's got involved with like I believe is like a cease and desist letter and so there's there at least thus far like part of the knock on this space has been that you know it is filled with all these types of people and and I think that where the SEC has taken action has actually been in areas like it's like good you know like that that should not happen because there's like you know retail investors that are getting duped and so that makes sense and it seems like on the larger scale of how to characterize these as securities or not and and kind of like the recent testimonies from CFTC chairman Giancarlo and others like it's been pretty positive like Giancarlo was he gave like a story about how his his daughter is really passionate about it and how we don't want to like you know the younger generation is like really interested in this so we don't want to like dant like squash their dreams you know and and that's you know CFT chairman like that's that's there's actually like I feel like more positive although it creates uncertainty but with uncertainty creates you know I think opportunity - okay great so we are running out of time but I just wanted to see if there were any questions nope okay all right well thank you so much [Applause] you [Music]
