cryptopians that's b i t dot l y slash c r y p t i p-i-a-n-s to pre-order your copy today again the link to pre-order is bitly cryptopians additionally i'll be doing a facebook live slash ama tomorrow wednesday january 26th the 8th anniversary of vitalik buterin presenting ethereum for the first time at the north american bitcoin conference in miami the ama will be about my book which is about ethereum and the 2017 ico craze but you can also ask questions about recent crypto news head to facebook.com unchained with laura shin to rsvp and ask questions again the link for the ama is the pinned post at facebook.com with laura shin finally i wanted to mention that in this episode and and will mentioned an interesting fact about their new product which is that fifty percent of the

guests are ian lee and will papper co-founders of syndicate dao welcome ian and well good to be here yeah great to be here sir all right you two have an announcement that is dropping the day this podcast comes out tell us what your news is yep so today we announced that we launched our first mainstream product on top of syndicate protocol in public beta and that product is what we call web3 investment clubs and what it does is it allows any group of people typically their friends groups of angel investors or web3 communities to come to our protocol and easily launch a investing dow as a web 3 investment club on syndicate in a single ethereum transaction for just the cost of gas it effectively transforms any ethereum wallet whether it's a multi-sig or a meta mask or a ledger into a powerful investing dial and imbues that wallet with all of these really powerful capabilities to invest together as an investment club completely unchained with no back end and uh what that means is it allows these clubs and groups of people like basically to turn a lot of these group chats that people are in already today where they're groups of friends and they're like buying nfts or maybe they're investing in you know different projects in the web3 space or even investing in startups uh off chain into equities and things like that and turn that thing into an on-chain club as easily as a group chat and so we'll get into a lot of the details around the protocol and the application and and um you know program that that we've we've been developing with a bunch of partners over the last number of months but what we're really excited about is how this tool really begins to democratize investing to people that and groups of people who may not have been able to access these tools or afford these tools traditionally because these tools have been very difficult very expensive and very you know slow to kind of like be able to use and we make that you know 10 to 100 x easier and also embed into the tool and snap into the tool various partners and various even tools that we built on the legal side that enable these investment clubs to maintain their investment club status uh legally and compliantly so that they have the peace of mind to ensure that they're using these investing dow investing jobs in the right way for themselves their dows and their members i love this i find this such a fascinating new product so for listeners who are listening on the podcast that was ian talking um just to help differentiate the voices and i did want to ask though you know just stepping back like investment club isn't a common term at least it's not one that i've really used much so you know regardless of kind of like the web3 component in your product just what is an investment club generally so it's really interesting because investment clubs as a as a concept had been around for thousands of years the earliest example of an investment club in recorded history was in 1898 in texas during the wild west probably in some saloon or something like that but the reality is these investment clubs have existed ever since then in the real world actually before web 3 even before web 2. in the real world typically what these things look like are groups of people in oftentimes local towns they get together at a community center or a restaurant they meet up they're oftentimes friends and community members they'll talk about traditionally often times like different stocks that they're looking to invest in together they'll make kind of purchases together club there and pool their capital together to reduce transaction costs you know spread out risks learn together you know win together basically and what's what's fascinating is that has existed in the meat space in a non-digital way in a non-internet native way for hundreds of years but it hasn't been modernized for the internet and it certainly hasn't been modernized for web3 especially as you know obviously web 3 has created all these new assets that are native to the internet and live on the internet and so what we've done here with our first product on top of our protocol is modernize investment clubs for web3 where they natively can live will be created be run and natively live on the internet where these assets are being created and live as well now what's what's interesting in addition to this though obviously is we've built these kind of like web 3 native tools which is specifically like a dow technology to invest natively you know together as a group of friends on on the internet you know in web3 today on ethereum and other chains in the future but in addition to that you know we've we've taken the time to snap in for example like we teamed up with latham watkins to generate open source legal agreements for web3 investment clubs on syndicate where people can generate these legal documents automatically using our tool sign them with their web wallet to provide them with those additional kind of guarantees uh in the in the real world legally and then the second thing is we've also partnered with this fintech from the web 2 world called doula where they're teaming up with us so that any investing down syndicate or any investment club on syndicate can get legal entities in delaware and wyoming they can make state filings they can get eins they can get get fiat bank accounts and they can also file taxes and issue k ones and so they can do everything basically in the real world that a traditional investment club would be able to do but they're now natively run in web 3 using our infrastructure well it's it's so fascinating so let's walk through a hypothetical process of people forming one of the web 3 investment clubs will do you want to take this one yeah happy too so um typically these investment clubs will start with either a thesis or a community so existing dow communities will uh want to spin up clubs so that they can invest together or someone might have a certain thesis like on chain nfts or the future and we'll spin up a club related to that and then from that point they can go to syndicate and set up their investment club in literally 45 seconds and with that one unchanged transaction they have their club ready to go and they can send the link to anyone in their community when they want to be able to deposit they just send it via private messages and group chats and they're up and running so we took a web to process where these investment clubs in the web 2 world were very time consuming to set up and run and we made it in the web 3 where it'll take under a minute to set up and run which is just a huge huge leap forward in the accessibility of these investment clubs and when you were talking about setting this up so how is it all structured is it like there's i'm assuming so this web address is it a multi-sig and then you know when you were talking about the chat and everything is that built-in do you have like a chat platform so all the investment club communications are on one platform or like how how is all that structured so we allow you to turn any wallet into an investment club and depending on the size the investment club and the security requirements of the dow will use different options if they're looking to join really fast moving nft mints they probably want to use a hardware wallet for example if they're looking to make private investment into a token they'll probably want to use a multi-sig if they're dealing with larger amounts so clubs can choose the wallet that's the right fit for them and we can convert that wallet into an investing club right now the tools that they use are the tools they're already using to organize their communities so we're compatible with any tooling that they may be using whether that's token gated discords for chat or a snapshot for governance in the long term we are definitely thinking about how to build stronger communities and we do have a community product for membership nfts that allows people to form a community and easily administer it but a lot of that is coming after the core investment club launch and so who can participate obviously in the us we have accredited investor rules but from your documentation it looks like non-accredited investors can artists participate but then you know probably i guess they're limited in what they can invest in can you just talk a little bit about that yeah so we've been you know doing a lot of work on this over the last number of months because what we think is really important is that tools like what what syndicate is building and others for dows to really move forward as a technology in particular in the case of like the application that we're launching with investment clubs they need to guide users and provide users with the right tools to protect themselves their members and their dows right and so we've we've invested a ton of time uh internally as well as working with a bunch of external partners as we mentioned to get this really really right and so with investment clubs it's really interesting because you know there's a web page on the sec's uh website where you can you can read up about how they look at investment clubs investment clubs generally are not regulated by the sec provided that they meet certain guidelines for example fewer than 100 members no public solicitation there's no investment advisor no performance fees or carried interest and also everyone must participate as members of the investment club in decisions right and so those sorts of things have been actually designed into the tool that we've built and also the kind of adjacent tools like the legal document tools and other things that we've we've snapped into it to allow people to run their investment clubs and and help them run their investment clubs as compliantly as possible now with respect to like what these investment clubs can invest in that's a really interesting thing because that is actually determined by whether or not accredited or unaccredited people can invest in that asset that they're you know purchasing or investing in so for example like an investment club is investing in a startup um and uh like it's equity like in in an early stage kind of venture round or something right startups you know often for those those capital raises will require that the investors are accredited and if that uh thing that is invested into it is a vehicle like let's say an investment club then that startup will often require that that investment club is an accredited vehicle which which means that that investment club and all of its members need to be accredited investors okay and so for certain types of things like that right um there are those accreditation requirements and that is something that the the creators and members of investment clubs need to you know decide and follow for themselves when using you know these tools and and also creating investment clubs of their own whether in the you know traditional world or you know on web3 using syndicate that said however there are a number of assets where people can buy that without being accredited you know good example of this would be like bitcoin and ethereum right i mean people can go to coinbase and buy that very easily and so investment clubs that are formed to invest in assets where you don't have to be accredited right like maybe they're buying an nft that they really love like from an artist or something or you know they're a community of people that are trying to support certain creators or certain projects in web3 where they allow people to you know invest in those those assets you know or even like an investment club we see some of these on the platform today where they're actually not you know investing for profit but they're actually almost using it like a like a grant vehicle of some kind to support like the development of a certain community you know those those types of investment clubs can have unaccredited people um as part of those and so obviously it's like you know we provide in our tool a number of protections and also related uh tools and services or partner services from from you know teams that we partner with to to help them with that but provided that you know they've they've done their diligence and figured out you know what what they're able to do and what they're not able to do yeah this this tool is uh available to people who you know are not necessarily accredited if they if if the club can invest those assets and that's incredibly democratizing and empowering for communities that need it the most um we believe so we're we're really excited about that and i did happen to notice in a wiki that you wrote up about your investment clubs that um you know you referred to these clubs where they'll need to have all accredited members if they want to invest for instance in startup equity and then you wrote we are working hard to change this so that more people can have the same access and opportunity so please stay tuned for updates can you give a hint as to what that's about um sure yeah so we you know are on this long-term mission to try to democratize um the tools to invest to as many you know people as carefully thoughtfully and legally and compliantly as possible because you know this gets too you know to the mission a bit of syndicate but you know when you look at web 3 and and the power of uh web 3 right it has this that the technologies and these networks are really incredible in terms of the ability to decentralize and democratize you know access you know these these powerful kind of systems to more people around the world and that's fundamentally a good thing right but the capabilities to invest and the capital that invests in web3 today is still you know kind of skeuomorphic with the you know traditional world right and and so the tools and the infrastructure to invest in web3 natively in a network native way in a community driven way has not yet in our opinion gotten to the point where it's truly network native with web3 and that's what we're trying to do because we want you know more people to participate in the development of web 3 the investing in web 3 the wealth building that results from investing in web 3 and frankly if web 3's the new internet and it's rebuilding our world we need more people to participate in the building of this world because what gets invested in shapes how that world gets built by whom for whom et cetera right but so how are you gonna i mean are you like doing lobbying with the sec or like you know what i'm saying like no no so we we we are we are working you know with existing regulation right i mean good example is the investment club product right we are following by the book like what's within sort of the regulation to be able to introduce a tool that is web3 native but also helps you know users of that tool maintain compliance and maybe to get specifically to your to your question right you know the law is very complicated when it comes to investing there's lots of different structures beyond investment clubs obviously which are not even you know technically regulated the fcc there's things like three c one funds there's 506 b funds there's 506 c funds et cetera and even you know other thing variations within that and what we are working through um you know very diligently is identifying you know existing legal frameworks where um they similarly to investment clubs can be modernized for web3 and what we're finding is that we believe it is possible to create these tools that enable these investing dows on syndicate to follow existing regulations and compliance but introduce web3 native capabilities to them that thoughtfully enable more people to be a part of these systems and okay you know how exactly that works is really really nuanced but that's what what we're trying to figure out bit by debt right right it reminds me of how for instance stacks did an ico but it was within the regulation a crowdfunding role so it's like you know kind of fitting it into existing laws so you kind of touched briefly on some of these other things but i just wanted to dive into them a little further you know you talked about how these uh investing dows or investment clubs can obtain legal entities and i just wondered you know if you could talk a little bit about why it is that some of them might want to do that and then also you know you talked about how it'll enable them to handle their taxes which is pretty interesting so you could talk about those two things yeah i mean what we're finding is you know again this this user behavior around people um pulling capital together with friends you know often people that have known each other for a while and live in these like group chats or discord channels that's been happening you know especially with the uh rise of you know these nfts and things like crowd buying uh in in web3 is has become kind of a more common um user you know behavior and pattern what we're also finding though is is two things like what they're doing right now is they're kind of you know just throwing into a multi-sig or a wallet uh that someone's running there's no kind of like tooling on top of that that makes that you know easier uh more powerful like for example with you know investing dials on syndicate they have this you know really robust dashboard that shows and visualizes assets in real time like nfts tokens and even startups that they invest in so it becomes this like portfolio management system on top of a wallet so they're oftentimes just doing this kind of manually and they're also tracking all this stuff on a spreadsheet like a google sheet right and it's very manual you know it's very kind of like labor intensive uh lots of times there's like errors or just inconsistencies because data isn't updated right and so basically syndicate in a certain way like offloads like all of that onto the smart contract in our application and on top of that right like which is not what a lot of dows these these group chats are thinking about but you know the ones that get more serious and they you know they they want to follow things by the book and not worry about you know certain things like um do i need to pay taxes and how do i do that like easily and compliantly right that's where these uh this fintech partnership with doula comes in where you know they can help dows on syndicate do all of that really you know easily and affordably um annually so they just kind of get those services you know don't have they just provide the information file the taxes get the k1s which you know all members need of an investment club to be able to you know file that with their their taxes every year and you know it gives them that peace of mind which we're finding a lot of these you know investment clubs actually do want and we think might be one of the key limiters for adoption of investing dows or investment clubs in web 3 because people are just kind of you know worried and don't want to deal with all this stuff that they don't know yeah i feel like at the end of every year or at the beginning of every year there are jokes in crypto about all the crazy things people did with their money their previous year and how their accountants are going to have a headache so the investment club members will get a token what is that going to be used for yeah so the token itself broadly speaking represents the cap table of the investment club so it represents the ownership shares similar to biology's mirror tables slash mirror shares that he described in a recent post um that on-chain cap table we've had has existed since the beginning of syndicate and we've been working on the product for the past year yeah and just defined the mirror tables and mirror shares for people who didn't read his post uh yes happy too so cap tables are traditionally managed via centralized services and you're dependent entirely on that centralized service to define who owns what and that's a single source of failure so if there's any inconsistency in the data any difference in what was promised versus what was given it's uh you're you're you're you're dependent entirely on on that on that centralized service to make it right or not and there's many cases where things go wrong for example for startup employees um there's so many cases of people and being promised for example one equity price and ending up paying a much higher price just due to some nuances of how those how the how the stock grants worked and being out like many many thousands of dollars of differences and that's because it's a centralized service that's not available to all members and not transparent to all members but by moving the cap table essentially the ownership stakes on chain that is now not only can all members verify their stakes there it can also be guaranteed in the smart contract that for example distributions of profits will be given out according to the ownership shares on chain not only is this more trustworthy this is also far easier to manage we talk with groups where they sometimes spend multiple days just sending wire transfers because every single wire transfer they send they have to go through the bank's verification process so we'll have to do that 80 or 90 times separate phone calls with a bank um often times like 10 to 15 minutes per phone call with syndicate because we've already moved the ownership stakes on chain when it comes time to keep up profits you just say the profits are being given out according to the ownership stakes never can claim it in the smart contract so we take a process that can literally take days to coordinate for tracking deposits in and and distributions out and make it fully automated um and fully uh fully removing that centralized party that you had to trust saving managers a ton of time and giving members a lot of confidence in the uh in in the fact that they will receive what they've been promised and then before you go on uh back to the tokens i did want to ask so you're calling the mirror tables and mirror shares but is that because you still are managing them originally in some kind of off-chain service that you know is run by a centralized company or is it all just being run in the smart contract and you're just using the word mirror table and mirror shares even though it's not actually mirroring something that's awesome yeah we're fully living in the future so it's fully unchained we don't need to mirror it a lot of people have been asking us about mirror tables and mirror shares and we're able to show them oh you actually don't even need to mirror it you can go directly on chain and directly live in the future you don't need that bridge anymore um you don't need you can several ties the antiquated past if you want to and uh and one thing we're so excited about is um this relates to a question of the token so underneath the hood syndicates are brc 20 is to represent ownership shares which means now they're composable with every other tool in the ecosystem that you might want to use so for example the ownership chairs can be plugged into snapshot for governance so now communities can make determinations based on based on uh based on their holdings you could even provide another startup that's getting launched could provide exclusive access or airdrops to investors in a highly related syndicate imagine for example a new fintech started up saying i want to offer my investment to all the early investors in stripe they could do that with syndicate automatically so under the hood by moving your cap table on chain your ownership shares on chain what you get is the ability to compose this with the entire rest of the ecosystem so we unlock the full power of composability because these shares are erc20s that being said it's of course up to the managers to remain compliant so um we uh we we keep transferability disabled by default as one example to ensure that the investment clubs are are compliant but the composibility of unlock is really really phenomenal and essentially it's it gives these ownership stakes superpowers to access the rest of the ecosystem oh okay so the reason the tokens are non-transferable is to prevent issues around um i don't know just anything involving a probably illicit activity of some sort or like anti-money laundering or stuff like that is that the reason for that it's related the investment club regulations so um so the investment clubs can't have more than 99 members um and they also can't have passive holders everyone must actively participate so if you transfer these to say a a smart contract that's fully autonomous it's not clear how that smart contract can actively participate we make it easy for users to remain compliant so we keep that disabled by default if they work with their own lawyers and their lawyers determine what what they can and can't do then of course they're they're they're welcome to um use the protocol in the way that they've been advised but we we make it easy to remain compliant so we we provide a happy path to ensure that the investment clubs are set up correctly yeah investment club regulation like membership interests can't be you know traded and stuff like on secondary markets so that's a big part of you know ensuring that you know this tool is you know helping people maintain that status okay but since there's like a limit of 99 members let's say that so let's say you the three of us are in some investment club that already has 99 members and somebody leaves a new person could join the investment club is that right and they would just get a new 20 a new erc20 token yeah typically what happens uh what we're seeing is a lot of these investment clubs they organize themselves as different seasons so they'll have like season one season two season three and the membership in each season will uh change actually every season some some people will kind of continue but then they'll introduce some new members and some old members will kind of you know like not be a part of it and we're finding that that's actually like the very common pattern with with investment clubs uh with syndicate but you know yes could someone you know join uh leave an investment club for whatever reason or uh and whatnot yeah and then and then at that point you know someone else could could be admitted all right so in a moment we're going to talk more about the backstory behind this but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible join over 10 million people using

these investment clubs the web 3 version yeah and you want to go go for it we've been talking about this for the last four years so there's there's yeah it's um maybe why don't we do this because i was going to ask you next how you two met and started working together but maybe that's a better way to start off yeah yeah so uh will and i met when we were both at ido's uh crypto team in 2018 uh this was the beginning of 2018 and back then right it was it was a world of difference in the crypto space it was just on the back of kind of the ico boom and then crash right and you know it was kind of actually like the beginning of the crypto bear market what was interesting in particular with really with respect to investing at that time in crypto was you know the ico uh wave in my mind at least really introduced this fully democratized decentralized and permissionless model for investing now obviously there were a lot of things about it that were not good and uh especially specifically from like a regulation perspective but what happened interestingly enough right like in 2018 was that the pendulum swung really hard the opposite direction and it kind of like re-centralized around like the saf model which you know persisted for over a year after that and what i thought was kind of always weird about that was well wait a minute like these technologies that are being developed are intended to be owned in a network native way by the community of users why is it that the capital that invests in these network technologies are not also network native right and so that kind of question was something that will and i started researching at the time when we met we also did a deep dive into decentralized social networks back in 2018 and what the future applications of those might be and the conclusion of that which we ended up designing this pseudonymous decentralized social network in early 2018 was that the primary application of there were two major insights the primary application of a decentralized social network was actually for the purpose of decentralized testing and democratizing investing and we looked at that we were like that's kind of interesting why is that the case the second conclusion the second insight though from that work was that the infrastructure was not ready and the market wasn't ready for that idea defy wasn't really like a thing there were a number of primitives that didn't exist that syndicate or an idea like it needed before that would be possible and so for for you know once we came to that kind of assessment will and i said well let's go you know work on some other stuff will went to another startup to focus on a number of things including decentralized identity i you know continued in the defy space and you know with ideo continue to invest and incubate startups and in 2020 you know we started seeing these primitives get landed in d5 that really started to harden right and will and i took a look at them and and sort of said wait a minute if you take some of these primitives and you kind of match them together and then you match them with the decentralized social network that we had conceived four years ago we now think syndicate is possible and that's when we started working on the architecture for it in late 2020 we we arrived upon something that we thought would work and then we um formally set up the company and and went full time into it in early 2021 so it's been about a year uh since we started working on it and uh so what do you mean working on the investment club what three investment club idea no on syndicate as in general as a company i mean you know we have a much broader kind of ambition and road map from a protocol and product perspective than investment clubs but investment clubs are the first you know tool on top of the protocol that we're opening in public data that we've been incubating in private beta with over a dozen communities over the last six months and in the coming months we'll be you know releasing more and more infrastructure and tools for web3 native investing endows so is that kind of what the main mission is of syndicate dao yeah we're definitely laser focused on investing dows um as a company we believe that investing dows are the future and we think that it's really really important to get it right so that's where all of our effort is is around that being said every doe that manages assets in some capacity isn't investing down so dows that are holding their native token or debts that are holding uh stable coin reserves are implicitly investing doubts so we have a very specific focus but a very broad market available to us and so the name is syndicate dow but you called yourselves a company so it's a centralized company that is called a dao so so um we we uh we essentially um have in the long term plans to become a doubt right now we help people set up doubts we do we do want to be a doubt ourselves and that's certainly um something that we spend a lot of time thinking about the syndicate uh doesn't tend to launch a job at some point and we we we intend to grow into that the thing that we saw starting and running to other cells was that getting the initial state of the dow right is incredibly important because once you launch it down it's very very difficult to change we are we are going to be very deliberate and very careful and very intentional about how we set up our dao because we want to make sure that we do right by the whole community of syndicate users yeah syndicate is the com the development company that is building this infrastructure as will mentioned you know we we intend for our technologies to be decentralized and community owned hope to one day you know launch our own dao also some people refer to gaozon syndicate as syndicate dowse so there's kind of it's a little confusing but it also uh sometimes works really well so yeah yeah i guess are those like syndicates on angel list and and is that kind of basically just like a proto version of the web 3 investment clubs i think that some people do sometimes look at us and and think of us as maybe like a web 3 native version of you know different tools that angellist also provides will should definitely go into this but i mean i think that's kind of maybe a more near-term analogy and skeuomorphic analogy but it's but the but you know we're we're trying to really build like web3 native infrastructure for both investing and dow's dows generally and and so i think kind of the way we think about syndicate is a lot different well you should share your you know vision on this yeah yeah definitely um so by making web3 native uh investment clubs we think that the investments that these clubs make and how they operate will look dramatically different than what came before one analogy we use a lot internally is that the disruption of investment clubs um to venture capital will be similar to the disruption of youtube to the film and media industry where youtube and syndicate both are cases where you dramatically lower the cost of setting these things up lower the difficulty so it's much much faster to do so and increase the distribution instead of in the web 2 world these investment clubs were often in-person meetings and town halls now it's taking place in discord and telegram in the web3 world likewise with youtube instead of reaching audiences via cable via television and networks and film distributors you're now able to go directly to your audience as well on a global scale it's hard to say how the world will be different given how no one can anticipate what changes will come about from this kind of product but we do think that the investing dowsing syndicate will look very different than the traditional investing taos they will be much more community driven they will be much more open they'll be much more accessible and the types of investments they make will look very different so it's something that we're excited about it's one of those like uh known unknowns we have no idea what the freezer will look like but we do know that it will be very different a good example is that you know of the dozen or so groups that we've announced you know launching and that have been helping us build this investment club product you know over 50 of them are investing dow and investment clubs on syndicate that are women led or all women dows and you know these dows are bringing more women and other population communities that traditionally haven't participated at the same scale in web 3 into web 3 and into investing in web 3. and that's like really amazing and we love that you know we can support missions like that because that really aligns with kind of like what we're hoping syndicate will do long term at a global scale another example is like you know we have two daos one called mori music dao and then another is dow jones and both of those are actually led by communities of creators in the nft and in mori's case specifically the music nft space and so it's a bunch of like music nft collectors creators you know technologists that are coming together very passionately as a as a club to invest in more nft creators right um and and investing in their own community and we think that that's like one of the most amazing things is that this tool is for is a community driven tool for communities to invest oftentimes in their community to develop and to help grow it and and you know bring bring it more and more into web3 so we're really really excited about you know seeing that already on syndicate and i wanted to ask about you know that fact you mentioned about how about 50 of the groups that are already working with you in their investment clubs are investing downs about how they're led by women why do you think that is that's a good question i mean um part of it is like we are sharing um and communicating a mission of democratization and empowerment for communities and and we're showing it right at all levels of our company and and the product you know we have a lot of really amazing incredible women uh leaders at syndicate um and we're you know hiring more uh by the day but also like in terms of the partners that we we work with and look for we're really looking for especially during you know the private beta phase where we've been incubating this for you know six plus months we've been looking for really values aligned mission aligned long-term partners to work with right who are going on this journey together with us to make a difference using these technologies in the world for people and society and so i think that that's you know that that has attracted uh certain types of communities and people to come to us organically and you know we're meeting more every day actually as we share more about what we're doing and honestly it wasn't like intentional we we um just kept working finding new partners to work with and as we got ready for launch we got everyone together and it was like oh my god you know 50 of these groups that we were working with are either all women or women led and it's it's really cool to see that and we hope to work with you know as many communities as possible who honestly deserve access to these kinds of tools and opportunities so um you know that's a big part of why we're doing what we're doing i love it i love it i find that so fascinating and um yeah i will i'll try to reach out to some of them to ask them some questions i actually wanted to go back to what we were discussing about how you guys think that dowse will be as disruptive to vc as youtube was to film and television so hilariously while i was doing the research for this i saw this coindesk article with the headline will daos replace crypto venture capital and i you know couldn't help but notice you know syndicate has received 20 million dollars in series a funding from andreessen horowitz ideocool adventures coinbase ventures variant coin funds scalar capital i mean these are all vcs so you know why do you think that they're interested in investing in you if this is going to be disruptive to them okay so i'll maybe take that one as a former uh you know and still i i you know disclosure i'm still a venture partner at ido but i was one of the co-managing partners of that crypto fund for four years right and i i've you know come from that space i think a few things about this so i guess you know to to address um one of just kind of those things specifically what we are doing here is is actually trying to attempt to solve a really massive difficult complex you know seemingly intractable problem in society around inequality of access to investing opportunities at scale globally that in our opinion is driving inequal opportunities and inequality in in many different ways right and so to do that like it's it's not um sufficient in our opinion to create a smart contract deploy it and kind of hope that it goes well we are in this for the long term and we're going to do this the right way as long as it takes to do it well and do it right so to do that we need a lot of patient capital we need values aligned partners who can help us and actually bring not only capital but actually like really important capabilities and and expertise and networks to this project to make it as successful as possible so you know partnering for example with ideo which is actually where will and i met we incubated this thing but also partnering with like teams like andreessen who have been incredible in terms of helping us think through all the legal you know regulatory considerations when designing this protocol and product and stuff to get it right but you know we've also brought probably more than any other crypto project at this point in time more than 300 founders builders creatives you know people in our community other investors into this project like we have the you know head of financial inclusion at the gates foundation who is also you know a part of this and many others like uh them that that are contributing to this this is this is going to be a long-term effort to to do this and the conversation was very interesting right when we were talking to a lot of these vcs like you know are they aligned with us or or you know do they not see what we see and i think that honestly if you've been in this space long enough you know that the writing's on the wall like you know that like the the traditional models for investing today in web 3 are skeuomorphic to web 3. and that the native model for investing in web 3 in our opinion and i think you know our investors who decided to come on this journey with us also realize that the native model is very likely a dao model and so what does that mean it means that it's inevitable and rather than kind of you know hide from that let's just go for it together right and do it do it right and do it together and so you know is it going to completely disrupt venture capital will should definitely comment on this because i maybe have a a different and spicier take but maybe i'm a little uh you know traditional in the sense that i think that it will disrupt and transform venture capital but that doesn't mean that certain players or you know especially forward-thinking ones won't be able to successfully transform and transition to this new model and i think that you know a lot of the groups that have come on this journey so far and many more that will come along the way like they're gonna actively kind of like work on on that and uh you know there are a number that we're already working with that you know are planning to do that like in the same way that you know web 2 vcs are now transitioning to become like crypto or web 3 vcs i think the next logical step is that web3 bcs will actually become investing dows uh in some way shape or form in the next five to ten years yeah and before will gives his two cents on this i just because we keep using this word and i'm not sure everybody will know what it is chemorphic and feel free to correct my uh definition here but i guess it's like applying um kind of like the way things were done before just to this new technology whereas like as you know something that's like more native to it would you know not be schemorphic it's not like you're imitating you know it's like it's like something schemorphic is when you know the internet was first created and i used to do this because i used to work at publications like newsweek.com and wallstreetjournal.com and new york times dot com you would just put the publication on the web um and so that's kind of like an example of something that's chemomorphic but i don't know if you have a better definition before no that's right i mean it's yeah skeuomorphic would be like yeah let's put a venture fund on the blockchain right and and these things and and to be honest like that is like gonna happen so you know skeuomorphism it has a purpose like you know as as far as transitioning to the more web3 native world but like even when you take like for example an investment club and then put it on you know put it out you know as a dow on on chain on ethereum right even though that is in some ways geomorphic right what will was mentioning about how the infrastructure underneath that that powers it on syndicate and how it's composable with web3 that starts to unlock these web 3 native capabilities like out of the box that you wouldn't have if you just left that thing on web 2 and that's a big part of how this these skeuomorphic models are actually going to likely seamlessly transition or more seamlessly transition to web3 native models in the future okay so yeah well do you want to give your take on some of our investors when investing in us literally said to us i know i'm putting myself out of business but having a stake in the future is so important that i am going to fund this anyway um so but that being said i mean people still go to movie theaters um it's just that movie theaters are a ton less important than they were before what we've already been seeing in the venture capital space is the commodification of capital so if if all money is the same and you're given the choice between a fund that's offering you a million dollars or 99 values aligned crypto users operators angels i think that that choice becomes very obvious the way venture capital firms have been competing has been to develop more and more services around recruiting legal compliance things along those lines and that has value i think that will always have value um i think that if syndicate is uh successful like they the the the vc funds that add value will still survive just like really nice movie theaters they'll survive but it won't be the only channel for getting money and um it will be a most capital we believe will be raised via investing doubts and then you'll fill out your round with a few like traditional bc funds or the services they provide so instead of a case where the majority is from vc funds and a small amount of rentals and users and operators where you believe that model will flip where the majority of it is from the users and partners that you work with and then a small amount is from traditional funds i wonder if the reason that andreessen is raising this 4.5 billion dollar fund now is to just sort of get in while it's good and then let you know if they see the writing on the wall they may know in the future they may not be able to have such big funds but anyway i don't i don't have any information their future plans but i do have to say that andreessen is an extremely long-term aligned partner that's one thing that i think traditional funds will use to compete is that if the funds are long-term partners and they stick with you for a long time that is also a value-add in a space where so many people are thinking short-term um and andresen is one of those people um for sure as is all the investors on our cap table we chose them for that reason right yeah i mean clearly uh you know the list is definitely all people who are all in on this space so will i did want to ask you also about this kind of like other thing you've got going you've had quite the ride as the creator of adventure gold which is part of the loot system and i was wondering if you had any takeaways from that experience you might want to kind of give the audience a little bit of background because it's really interesting and explain how you think it might be relevant to dows and investment clubs as well absolutely yeah the loot ecosystem and adventure gold is definitely an example of the future that um we're already living in the future is already here just not evenly distributed and loot is one of those features uh i recently wrote a history of adventure gold um that people can find on my twitter at willpaper yeah but can you just kind of recap it a little and yeah absolutely so to give to give some background adventure gold uh is an in-game currency of the loot ecosystem so loot is an on-chain essentially rpg game where at a time when so many nft projects were promising these super unrealistic road maps we're gonna have a full game built in three months etc etc loot was here's a bunch of items you could use in a future game that's it and it was the role of the community to add those primitives some people added in characters some people added in land i added in an in-game currency and adventure gold um definitely uh exceeded my uh my my wildest expectations i wrote it in four hours at an airport um and did not uh did not did not i i'm just just so grateful for the community adoption that it's received i think that um one of the most important takeaways from adventure gold is the importance of so uh the the one of the really best aspects of it is the importance of widespread distribution because it was a fair launch i gave every single token away to the community i didn't reserve any for myself i had loot sure but i didn't reserve any special portion and i had an infantismo portion of the supply because it was so widely community owned there are so many people helping out with adventure gold or integrating it into what they've built and that is really incredible that by giving it away people find it useful and people start to start to contribute back to the ecosystem um so that's one really really um important takeaway um the second one and yeah i i i've talked about this in the past but it's definitely worth emphasizing for anyone thinking about launching it down is once your tokenomics are set they're really difficult to change so make sure that you get the tokenomics right up front with adventure gold i uh gave it all away where every loot holder could claim i had no idea how big it would get so um i i didn't have any like long-term vesting built in for example if i'd known how big it would get i would have added that in and now we are adding that in later on um the the community members are building out code for that right now but i've had it done from the beginning i think that um would have been significantly more helpful so the the biggest thing that we helped out with at syndicate one is defining their community and their purpose and they should have an extremely specific and clear purpose so in this case the purpose for adventure gold is an in-game currency and the community is the loot ecosystem that's very very clearly defined the second thing we do is we help them define the initial tokenomics and that varies a ton based on the goals of every community but the initial tokenomics once launched are really really really hard to change so we help daos a lot with getting it right and giving them flexibility to to adapt down the road um and we have um upcoming community products not part of the investment club launch but um already available in private beta that work to create a set of best practices around community building and to economics for jazz so we definitely see our role in the space at syndicate as setting the standard adventure gold was a personal project it wasn't really to syndicate but many of what i saw from it and many of the lessons i learned apply really well to it and i've written quite a bit on the history of adventure gold with closability so anyone who wants to dive in i've worked to make those lessons as accessible as possible to anyone considering starting it down all right so you kind of hinted at some of the other stuff you're working on i don't know if you want to give even more of a preview but just in general where do you think dows will go in 2022 yeah so there are two sides of the syndicate um the investment process and the community the investment process is what we've been laser focused on for the past year creating just a fantastic end-to-end experience for setting up and managing investment clubs and we're really happy with the results of that 2022 is when we're thinking a lot about community how do we help these dow communities build really really strong ecosystems how do we help them grow how do we help them adapt over time we already have a membership nft product launched that can upgrade over time as community members make more contributions that can then give them all sorts of really interesting perks and bonuses to recognize them for their contributions and we're also thinking a lot about how to build a community around syndicate as well a community of developers and an ecosystem of people who who can take part in building on top of syndicates protocol um as infrastructure so those that's a lot of what we're thinking about for 2022 and all of that is already in testing it's already built it's just um not rolled up publicly quite yet and did you want to add anything yeah i mean i think a couple things from like a market perspective so i'll kind of mention two two trends that that we think are really interesting now with with infrastructure like syndicate that's rolling out right one is like what would it what happens in a world where there are hundreds of thousands or millions or tens of millions of investing dows you know the the investing world has been as well mentioned like in this multi-decade transformation towards more and more commoditization but also decentralization even before web 3 like with angelus syndicates and rolling funds and all these things right i mean that's a part of like this kind of broader historical arc and dow's we think are just going to take that to the logical extreme and so in this world where there's millions of these things out there but not only millions of of investing downs but the fact that they're programmable and they're composable with one another like syndicate dows on syndicate protocol are composable with each other that's going to enable really incredible things possibilities uh that you just do not see in web 2 where dows can actually start to coordinate with each other programmatically uh on on web3 networks so that's kind of like one area of research that we think is really really promising the other area that i think is just as interesting is will was kind of alluding to um us you know what is an investing dow really um and what is even investing really like do does is investing um specifically meaning like the investment of money and financial capital or can investing actually be brought in to mean investing time talent um energy resources attention those kinds of things and in that context right like you can actually open up the design possibilities and design space for what investing means and therefore what an investing dow is and can become so a good example is like we've been working with this dow called vector dao that you know has launched on syndicate dr dowd is a group of designers in the web 3 space that work with different web 3 projects and it's a club of people kind of but they're not investing capital they're investing time and talent and that is really exciting to us because you were you were asking earlier like how are we going to increase access and participation given in existing structures we think that there's something really big there where people who there there are people who can invest capital but there are also people who can contribute time and talent and there will be models down native and web 3 models where those two things capital and labor can come together and uh you know lots more to come on that front but that should you know give you a sense for how big potential i think syndicate could could tap into in the years ahead well i love it that is i that's very fascinating i cannot wait to hear more about that all right you guys this has been such a great conversation i just really enjoyed it where can people learn more about each of you and your work
