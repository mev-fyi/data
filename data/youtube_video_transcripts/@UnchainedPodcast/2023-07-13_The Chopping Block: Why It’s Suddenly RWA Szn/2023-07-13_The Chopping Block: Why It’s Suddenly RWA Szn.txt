not a dividend It's A Tale of Two fun now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet generally speaking airdrops are kind of pointless anyways um I named trading firms who are very involved I like to have the ultimate D5 Protocols are the antidote to this problem hello everyone Welcome to The Chopping Block every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry insiders perspective on the crypto topics of the day quick intros first we've got Tom the D5 Maven and master of memes next we've got Robert the crypto connoisseur and the tsar of superstate new intro for for Robert who we'll be talking about it today uh then we've got to ruin the Giga brain and Grand Puba at gauntlet and today we've got a special guest Blake the real world asset ringleader at Goldfinch oh I like it and finally you've got myself I've received the head height Mana dragonfly so we are early stage investors in crypto but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice legal advice or even life advice please see choppingblock that XYZ for more disclosures Blake welcome to the show uh we are going to do for the first time ever a real world asset show because crypto has gotten so boring and so uncool that we decided we finally I'm kidding I'm kidding we had um of course it's big news that Robert announced the launch of his new company superstate uh which we uh we want to dive into a little bit on the show uh but we thought it was a good opportunity to dive not just into what Robert's doing but the broader landscape of real world assets and we thought there was no better person to bring on board than Blake who's been you know kind of an OG in the real world asset space and has been added for a while Blake maybe we could start off with you giving an introduction about yourself and Goldfinch what it is and and what got you into the realm of real world assets uh yeah sure so first off thanks so much for having me on the show uh big fan and in terms of a quick background on myself I uh used to work at coinbase as an engineer uh back joined in 2018 and left in 2020 to start uh Sarah goldfinish which is uh a private credit platform built fully on ethereum everything happens fully on chain and from the very beginning we've been excited about doing you know what was now into real world assets rwa and uh we we were just you know at the time I think and and still largely you know crypto is uh you know mostly kind of self-referential landscape right and we felt like we really need to kind of break out of the Matrix and we were just really excited about bringing the value of crypto to real businesses who were doing real stuff and maybe didn't have to already do with crypto and so that's what we've been doing since 2020 largely doing private credit lending to businesses in Emerging Markets but also we have about 20 of the portfolio in America and so uh that's that's the thing and I think your world assets is really place where crypto has to go in order to grow in my mind so let me just step back a bit and Define real world assets because maybe for us it's kind of you know we know exactly what we're talking about the history of real world lasts in crypto goes back a very long time like I remember when I first got into the space people were talking about real world assets and at that time it was like asset tokenization and you know kind of the terms have evolved over time as far as I know the first real asset to get tokenized and still the largest real asset on chain is dollars right so technically every single stable coin except for algorithmic on chain stable coins are basically real world assets there's dollars in a bank they're in the real world that's why they call them real world assets there's something off chain that's being represented on chain some some kind of claim or some kind of you know kind of monetary equivalence between what's happening option what's happening on chain and I remember there were things like digix which was an early attempt tokenize gold uh tether has tokenized various other assets like I think they had silver they had you know other uh non-usd currencies but for the most part and then of course in I remember in 20 um the 2017 cycle then again in the 2021 cycle a lot of excitement around okay can we tokenize real estate can we tokenize other kinds of assets like apartment complexes and boats and you know all sorts of things that maybe people might want liquidity for and I think we've talked about on the show that I think in the past there's been some magical thinking I think on behalf of a lot of people around asset tokenization the idea that if I tokenize something then magically it will become liquid and there were a lot of companies that kind of got got funded and kind of drove this excitement of this idea they're like wow you know crypto trades 24 7. crypto you know anybody can buy and sell at any given time there are a lot of real world assets like real estate that are really painful to transfer or to sell or you know there's all these documents they take forever they don't work on weekends and it's like wow can we bring the crypto magic or the on-chain blockchain software-based intermediation to all these traditional businesses and I think this led to a lot of unrealistic expectations a lot of people getting disappointed they're like hey why hasn't there been more progress it seems like still today by far the largest market is dollars and not a lot else is working so Robert let me bring you in tell us about okay that's kind of where we are I don't know if you disagree with that uh characterization tell us what led you to be like cool I'm gonna go do super State sure so I'll start by saying that I hate the term real world assets because I don't think it describes the opportunity so it also insults all of the Assets in crypto that are crypto native assets so I like to segment the world into two camps one in which assets are issued on the blockchain for the first time that's where they live that's where they were created ether is a great example it lives on a blockchain it doesn't live in like a database or a spreadsheet or something like that all the tokens issued on ethereum are crypto native assets and then you have traditional assets which are issued on other ledgers spreadsheets physical paper you know old ass database software or things written in Cobalt whatever crypto native and then traditional assets everything exists in the real world in my opinion so I don't like to use the term but you know I know a lot of people in crypto do use that term but I just like to segment it real quickly between crypto native and things that are not native to blockchains so what got me excited was actually the opposite of excitement uh it actually goes back to 2017 when I started compound you know in 2017 I thought that by 2022 five years later the whole world was going to be tokenized you know I remember when I pitched VCS in like 2017 I was like oh man you know by 2022 in five years everything's gonna live on the blockchain and so a market like compound or uniswap or whatever you know would be able to interact with all of these incredible assets where you could build one system something like compound or something like uniswap or something like you know any protocol and eventually more and more things become interoperable with it there'd be more assets eventually would handle stuff would handle bonds eventually handle Commodities you know whatever and that never really occurred because not that many things came on chain um from off of the blockchain dollars Incredible use case incredible product Market fit you know we've seen you know 150 billion dollars plus at given points of stable coins obviously there's a lot of demand for that and the Invisible Hand really pulled it onto the blockchain but that's pretty much the only thing that's migrated over so far what you know we have seen early signs of life for are things moving the other way things moving off chain right and I'm really excited to talk with Blake about this but like when I look at maker when I look at Goldfinch a lot of times it's wealth from the blockchain getting sent to something not on the blockchain and like kind of like this opposite direction migration um obviously it builds a much more unified system and it's incredibly important and Incredibly exciting and Incredibly powerful but it's oftentimes dollars moving the other way you know like maker now has all of these you know real world assets or rwas but it's dollars moving away from the blockchain away from the crypto Nativity not onto it it's kind of like this like right reverse migration in a sense and so you know the thing that got to me was saying well it's been now six years right I originally thought it was gonna be five years and everything would live on a blockchain in six years nothing besides a simple dollar actually exists over here and what can we do to help facilitate this migration and so well hold on Robert let me let me pause you there real quick why do you think that is what's your theory of the case of why other things haven't migrated onto the blockchain well I think it's a supply and demand problem so I I think this is really like the Invisible Hand of markets not getting people excited enough because like when there's enough demand when there's enough of a pain point when there's enough excitement it will happen people will figure it out the one thing that has gotten people like moving so to speak are stable coins like there's a clear demand for stable coins there's clear product Market fit that is a use case where the market ushered it into existence because so many people around the world demanded it or wanted it I think when it comes to things like you know tokenized real estate the demand is like microscopic still right there's very few people who are like man I'd kill for that Skyscraper Live on the blockchain it's incredibly cool doing it is like you know achievement unlocked but I don't know how many people demand it I don't know how much like Capital demands I don't know how big the Invisible Hand is that wants to will it into existence it's super cool but how much like Capital demand is there for that I don't know it has I don't think it's very high and I think that's one of the reasons why we haven't seen you know more of this succeed I think there's a lot of it's just like regulatory issues especially for public assets to come on chain right like you know sort of like whatever the thing and crossing the chasm where they talk about like total cost of ownership there's like the cost of actually using the product but there's sort of the total cost of ownership that goes outside of the product which you know for a lot of these funds and especially wealthier individuals or family offices who might be buying this this type of asset well there's also like well how does the accounting work and like do I still get the same tax treatment and like this headache and brain damage of having to think about blockchain assets I think is just too much for a lot of that stuff to have migrated over so quickly and I think that's another piece just needs to get figured out before we're going to see like the mass migration in my mind but it's also true for usdc isn't it the like uscc at least I think until recently I don't know if that has changed at all but like it's not treated as a currency for for tax purposes correct yeah yeah I think the then the demand has largely come from crypto native people who probably don't need to think about all those same issues like they just go on coinbase and they you know send in their dollars they mint uscc and they go up go about their day right right yeah interesting can't hold it I don't think right yeah yeah okay so so given that starting place um the two of you pursued different directions of which Real World assets are the most interesting markets to pursue uh Robert let's start with we kind of your story for super State can I or go ahead add one thing disclosure is that Robert and I are small investors in culture I realized we didn't didn't say that yeah anything we see may be very very slightly biased and will be used against you yeah all right go ahead go ahead Robert um so yeah why why given this backdrop why super state yeah so you know in trying to solve this problem of like why haven't things come on chain for the most part you know we're starting with the idea that it's because you have to go to where the demand is and where we see the Demand right now are for not just dollars to come on chain but low risk highly liquid sources of yield to come on chain and in a massive scalable way where we sit you know we think that treasuries and t-bills and short-term you know extremely high quality instruments are what people want to hold on blockchains and so what we're trying to facilitate is just the path for um these types of assets that come onto the blockchain not for the dollars that were on the blockchain to go off chain and then buy them but for those assets in a regulatory structure to come onto the blockchain so what we're doing is we're spending a lot of time focused on the legal and Regulatory process to bring these assets on chain because that's where we think that demand is and over time as there's more and more Global demand for additional assets on chain whether it's real estate or Commodities or whatever fill in the blank ideally there's a path to bring those assets on chain as well and so you know really it's a fund creation business with a structure that enables those funds to become crypto okay so I mean I get it rates are north of five percent a lot of people you know probably everybody in this thing included we have we have some money you know uh getting a short-term interest from the government you got you are not the first to do this right so there's Auto Finance which is the largest I think that's kind of purely defy oriented there's Franklin Templeton has some launch anything on Stellar I think uh something yeah yeah as I said the uh this is being discussed on Twitter today but the Frankel Temple thing is actually bigger than Ando which is like very counterintuitive almost two hours yeah it's actually kind of crazy 300 million in Like Money Market ETF tokens on on Stellar uh you should actually maybe you can show the rwa.xyz slash treasuries uh if you want to see yeah and so to be clear if you wanted to the process right now if you want to own one of these is you need to like go whitelist your address you know kyc whitelist your address and then you can go and buy these treasuries and you get some yield on Stellar or if in the case of ondo on ethereum um can you can you zoom in a bit Tom because I I think it's pretty hard yeah um so yeah yeah uh Franklin Templeton ondo um Matrix stock which really is actually Matrix ports um uh product stpt it's like tokenized treasuries Maple has this pool and I think this this site is slightly off and that they count flux Finance which is ando's compound Fork so it's a money market that they built that is whitelisted for Hondo products so you can take your tokenized Money Market ETF that you've you know onboarded and purchased through Ando put it into flux and then borrow against it at a rate that is pretty attractive I mean you're paying like you know half of you know margin rates on like at traditional brokerage and you know these people are also getting you know yield if you just put usdc in and you're not buying the treasury so you're not this is not actually tokenized treasuries but it's being lent against um tokenized treasuries and flux I think it's something kind of interesting about the two I believe that whole kind of Market is partly there because the rates on compound were like lower than what was getting paid out on those people I think were basically leveraging that capital and then blending it into flux who then I guess and buy more on the treasuries right so there's an interest rate Arbitrage that once people have access to uh treasury yields they can use that they can borrow against you know stable coins and basically increase demand for stable coins on chain which pushes up the interest rates on stable coins and pushes them closer to parity obviously they're not going to get exactly a parity but it does mean that the rate on stable coins should get closer to that risk-free rate which is not really possible when you don't have treasuries on chain at all now the treasury is on chain right now the order it's on the order of like a few hundred million right maybe 500 million a little over 100 themselves yeah and then Franklin Templeton is like you know close to 300 or something like that so right now the outstanding supply of stable coins obviously in the tens of billions it's a massive massive amount of stable points out there so there there is no way right now just with the different Central and how many treasuries are out there to actually do the interest rate Arbitrage and push the the yield on on stable coins up but okay there are a lot of people doing this Robert what are they doing wrong why why do you need to come in and and fix what these people what mistakes these people are making yeah so and the first thing to say is that there's obviously room for many different approaches and many different companies right like there's both Vanguard and Fidelity and both of them are managing trillions upon trillions of dollars right it's not that anyone's doing anything wrong but we're just taking a process slightly different so there's really two names you've already mentioned Franklin Templeton and ondo super States somewhere in the middle of the two of these so Franklin Templeton is going the route of creating registered Investments where they file a prospectus and then it's available to be purchased by anybody Ando is going a different route where they're relying on exemptions from registration and saying you know you have to be a qualified purchaser which means you have to have five million dollars to purchase their fund Ando is super ethereum native Franklin Templeton is on Stellar super state is kind of the hybrid of these two approaches where it's a registered approach where we're creating a registered investment we submitted a draft prospectus a preliminary perspectives to the SEC about two weeks ago so it's a registered approach not an exemption from registration so that it can be held by anybody the goal is to be a very ethereum native on-chain component and so it's kind of in the middle of those two and up and we believe that that's something that the market is going to want which is something that you know has a clear registration statement and is ethereum native as sort of The Best of Both Worlds and we'll see how it plays out over the next couple months years decades but that's the approach in a nutshell and Robert actually what kind of uh access is going to be possible on this phone who can purchase it yeah U.S investors or offshore with us addresses retail investors here Yeah so basically anybody who can buy a mutual fund today they can they can buy a stake in in the Super Steak fund um but you know a smart contract or an AI or a dow or whatever they would not be able to to directly own Super State the super State Mutual Fund all right so let me let me take a step back so I think I think we understand the approach let me ask kind of a broader philosophical question is like why is it good to have more tokenized treasuries on chain and maybe let's just start there and like I kind of want to dig into this discussion because I think it's actually quite interesting uh why Robert why is it why is it good to bring tokenized treasuries on chain well if you this sound look super abstractly why is it good to have a blockchain at all right like wait is that is that where we're starting okay yeah yeah let's start let's start really low right okay so really foundational I think having assets that are administered and owned and tracked on blockchains is better than traditional ledgers it's better than the stack that they currently reside in in tripod because in the end run you're able to get more from them you're able to get all of the composability of D5 you're able to get all of the automation of smart contracts you're able to get the transparency of a blockchain where every action that's ever occurred is auditable plus the programmable open source nature of it you're able to get the instant settlement you're able to get the massive like speed and portability advantages over prior ledgers right having things on a blockchain is super super good right and so having the old assets the Trad Phi assets move over and start to live on the blockchain more and more and more over time is just overall going to be a net benefit for Society for investors for Regulators for everybody I can also add a little commenter because I actually talk to the Franklin Templeton people um months back we were actually kind of looking to do a treasury's product as well and go such and um we talked to Franklin Templeton they had actually they spent like quite a long time getting the SEC comfortable with this fund they started it a while ago for them it was actually originally sort of like almost a science experiment they were like hey let's do something on the blockchain this was like years ago and the rates were still zero and they didn't really expect anybody to use it um but they were like well let's go through the whole process because it takes quite a while to register for fun anyway they they spent all this time and like they were talking to SEC he said well how are we going to like subpoena you for records and they're like it's right here like it's right there you just need to look at it and they also told me that once they actually been running this for a while their actual cost of operating the fund are substantially lower from what it cost them to administer a traditional fund so I think this other I was talking about is spot on and we have some evidence already of that from Franklin Templeton at least from the phone calls I have with them interesting but let me Let Me Maybe um propose a Counterpoint that I was I was just thinking about actually while I was um taking a shower this morning when we were preparing for the show is that so right now in D5 right like so we talked about this interest rate Arbitrage it's not really being done yet because they're just there aren't enough tokenized treasuries on chain um when this interest rate Arbitrage successfully happens and the rates on chain go up another way of thinking about that is that you know uh you know what the FED has been doing for the last two years is they've been raising interest rates and because they've been raising interest rates you know they've been kind of crushing investment I mean we're all VCS we're all investing less you know the the incentive to take risks instead of to innovate all that stuff goes down because it gets crowded out by basically just you know government paper right and so effectively what the government is saying is invest less take less risk and instead just give your money to me and I'll hold on to it and like cool down the economy and so when you are bringing more tokenized treasuries on chain basically what you're doing is you're raising the on-chain interest rate right you are basically playing that intercessory role of like bridging what the FED is doing in the real economy and bringing it to the on-chain economy and telling the on-chain economy hey invest less slow down don't invest so much in growth and instead put your money with the US government and just have it sit there and kind of do nothing because we want to slow down the economy this is going to make yield farming more expensive it's going to make token issuances or like token emissions more expensive is that not going to yeah it may bring more tokenized Treasures on chain and maybe it's oh great it's so efficient for you know on-chained mutual funds for treasuries but isn't that going to result in slowing down the rate of innovation on the blockchain or it'll speed it up because people have to create entirely new things yeah about the rate of innovation is quite the right metric there to go with the interest rates going up because it's it's taking quite a lot of innovation just to just to do it yeah but it is it is directly tied to the cost of capital right I mean the cost of capital on chain goes up it's harder to get usdc to provide liquidity for uh blah blah blah I mean you can argue whether that is innovation I don't know Tom I think you're sort of positioning this as either or like either your assets are in treasuries or they're being you know deployed elsewhere invested elsewhere and I think I actually kind of think look at like steak teeth and liquid staking dravens as sort of a comp um of you know the eth you know yields is basically the risk-free rate right like block emissions Plus um um transaction fees and that competes with everything else so hey it's not super attractive to you know loan out my eighth for one percent when I can stake it and earn four or five percent or something like that and that's true for everything right if I have my eth sitting in like blur waiting to bid on an nft or if I have my eth sitting in a dow and and you know waiting to you know commissions a proposal and so instead of the kind of the current Trend actually is replacing eth with um liquid sticking your derivatives like staked eat and so the two sort of compose so I can have my youth I can get my yield and I can use it in all these different other you know places as well where I might normally use vanilla Ethan so instead these these rates actually sort of compose with each other and complement each other and so I think similarly like we could probably see a similar thing with you know these tokenized treasuries or something like flux usdc where hey if I'm you know using this as collateral to trade on some you know decentralized purpose menu I don't have to sacrifice the risk-free rate in order to trade perks the two can actually sort of compose with each other yeah I mean I think another natural thing in that vein is that yeah staking derivatives didn't like completely Crush everything else right there was still there's still enough liquidity in in other assets like a lot of it definitely went away I think the the bigger question is just more like how well can these high rates diffuse through the existing defy ecosystem right like the real advantage of staking derivatives is they are basically more or less equivalent to eth in D5 from like the perspective of monster defy there's really not a difference between Ethan a bunch of mistaken derivatives but the treasury assets are a little bit weirder right they they do have some restrictions you have to go through this sort of indirect route of borrowing against that well like like there's clearly some friction to to them diffusing through the ecosystem and so that's the thing I think would be more interesting I I don't know if I buy the token emissions have to go up type of argument though because what will end up happening is if fees are denominated in that if those tokens have some claim to fees well if the rates went up and they have something where they're collecting fees denominated in that asset they should be earning more too right like like I'm not saying it's perfectly you know reflexive in that sense but there's a they should be if they're able to utilize those assets and charge fees in those assets terms they should be at least earning some of the beta to the growth of that asset now if the protocol is not able to do that then that's different but I think like maybe from the perspective of innovation that would be the part of innovation that probably would have to happen which I I love your assumption that uh protocols charge fees that's very that's very yeah the very Charming model of how the blockchain works no no but the LPS the LPS are in fees right and the LPS are also earning the farming assets so there's there's sort of it's not it's not totally clear to me that you have to overcome in fact you may have to compensate them less than the native token because they're getting more like raw Rewards treasury asset that they're earning Visa right if they're earning fees in fusdc it's like I I'm just saying like I I don't think it's right I mean look I think the reality though is that like look if you're farming you have to farm in stable coins because you need it to be open and permissionless right presumably I mean maybe not I don't know maybe there's some world where no you can see kyc you didn't have Unchained treasuries yeah I think like you know there's a lot of people now launching like CDP platforms um or you know basically Forks of like you know liquidity or whatever that use liquidation derivatives as collateral instead of ether and like you know those are quickly Rising as like the dominant form of collateral I think um Ave is now over e makers uh safety that's about to overtake as like the main form of collateral so um you know the two can compose and I think you know again as long as you have players who sort of bridge these two markets the rates should converge right like you have something like um flux you know usdc and you then you have the actual tokenized uh charges themselves and so yeah they're not going to be on par but you know anybody can go and use flux usdc to go do you know farming if they want and in theory they should all become you know more liquid over time yeah I mean another sort of reverse experiment of the thing you're talking about is in 2021 when rates were basically zero and crypto rates were very high and suddenly traditional Finance people were able to access the crypto rates via centralized NDS now of course that didn't work out the way they planned but they were able to access it and they immediately went towards that uh and it actually had sort of a this feedback loop effect some of it could some of it bad a lot of that but I think you should expect the same thing I I don't I don't think there is I think like at the end of the day if the if an asset's really good collateral and taken everywhere and it has positive yield and negative carry and like low carry costs like people gravitate to that right that's it well so that's it's a very interesting point to ruin because you're sort of analogizing okay well you know raising the rates on chain is kind of like what Tara was doing of having these really high rates that are kind of pulling Capital into crypto and that Capital then disseminates and the cost of capital gets lower in crypto that argument works if there's a differential between the interest rate off chain and the interest rate on chain right in this case the interest rate on chain is actually lower than the interest rate off chain and what the tokenized treasuries are doing is they're they're equalizing the interest rate across the two my mental model of of capital on chain and this might be this might be part of why I think we might um be looking at this differently my mental model of capital off chain or sorry on chain is that there's really like two kinds of capital there's opportunistic Capital that is just looking for yield and they're like you know just to kind of cutthroat hedge funds they'll do whatever and then there's like Capital that's kind of stuck on chain which is you know people in China who are you know they're just like look I want dollars and you know tether is the best way to hold those dollars and so that that capital is captive and they'll take whatever rate they can get so if the best rate is two percent on compound it's like great I'm gonna get two percent of compound I'm not gonna be able to kyc and get you know the five percent from Super state so I'm just gonna I'm just gonna live with the two percent so be it or maybe I'll take a little more risk and put into private credit through Goldfinch but that Capital isn't isn't moving right and so that that kind of that black hole of pulling in more capital from off chain that tarot was doing I I think it's not likely we're going to see that just because we have tokenized treasuries on chain that those actors you know even if you live in Hong Kong you can get access to treasure Guild from Hong Kong no problem right this is not it's not something that you have to be in the US to get access to what do you what do you think of that take yeah I I agree that there's there's some version of that that's true but I I do think like suppose there's another Bull Run each price goes up Suddenly the USD East staking rate looks significantly more attractive than treasuries but maybe I actually want to hold a portfolio that's like 60 40 USD but I don't want my USD portfolio to be only a carry cost for me effectively I I do actually want to like be earning some nominal yield this is a perfect product for that right and like my point is people rebalancing into the the bull and bears they're not going to be like I'm going out of eath completely to stablecoin or vicer I other than board Apes owners uh they're not going to be kind of uh you know doing that right they're going to have this kind of in between but they kind of want yield on both sides and I could I think it like makes the rebalancing costs actually a lot more palatable you know and like as these portfolios get larger especially due to staking rewards kind of spreading through the ecosystem you you definitely could imagine that this this has a a place as viable collateral to compete with USBC or whatever so Blake let's let's bring you in give us the case you know we talked about treasuries give us the case for private credit as being an attractive real world asset to bring on chain yeah so I think it's yeah I think it's actually a good good kind of compliment here because as I remember saying bringing these treasury yields on chain that is I think everyone would agree that's largely a product for crypto native investors right for the people who are already on chain because for the most part you know what Aldo's doing they're literally giving you a BlackRock ETF they're adding 15 bips and then saying here you go now you can buy it on chain so people from the off chain World versus traditional Finance they're not going to be taking their dollars and bringing it on chain to buy the Ando product generally speaking I would think I mean as like a there's my default case however uh because not us all is it's very very publicly available it's really really easy for anyone to try to find to get access to their rate uh already um the private credit thing on the other hand it's actually very hard to access generally speaking especially for a more like kind of normal everyday investor it's very very difficult to access and so you know this is sort of the whole other end of the spectrum where it's it's not public it's very hard to access and it's very bespoke too and it takes sort of a lot of expertise to be able to to look at these deals and decide whether or not they're good or not and so that's where like we actually again with like our whole whole thing we want to bring back to people who are outside the crypto space into the crypto realm and so offering these private credit deals you know we want to bring investors who aren't already into crypto and bring them on chain through and act through an asset then can you give us an example of a private credit deal just so I mean a lot of people might not know exactly yeah so uh you know really private credit is just doing lending to businesses by and large and so you know example of a borrower that uh is our goal financial company called pedroy uh they do smartphone financing in Mexico and so you know you buy a phone from them they'll they'll pay for it and then you pay pay them back over you know the next two years or whatever and you do monthly installments and if you don't pay back they happen to have software on the phone that will shut off your phone and so everyone wants their phone to work people pay it back um and so you can do that with tons of businesses all over the place you know that was a sort of specific fintech lending business but you can do it with your invoice receivables uh you can do it with real estate you can do it with all kinds of stuff goldfish tends to focus on fintech lenders as our main bar hours but that's that's just a rough idea of private credit and private creators asking class by the way has just been growing like crazy and this is I would say generally a really exciting time for private credit because as the rates go up that actually pushes up that's like the floor of race that every business in the world needs to pay and so all of the rates that everyone is paying have gone up by basically four or five percent in the last couple years and so you have really high quality companies offering you know 10 plus yield and of course that is going to take on more risk than going to the treasuries but it's also pretty much our year you're not talking about 10 plus and in a world where the stock market is kind of questionable and you're not really sure is this gonna be a good year or a bad year people are starting to reallocate their portfolio there's a thing like bonds then you know private credit also needs to be really attractive and you have people like KKR and BlackRock everybody is really doubling down on private credit now this is kind of like a golden period of private credit or the Golden Age and so we think this is a great time to be offering credit to people and uh we're going to still be doing it fully on chain we actually I'd say different than a lot of other places we want to be focusing actually kind of more away from the crypto native investors into a more masonry investor we're really trying to take advantage of things like layer twos and account abstraction and embedded wallets to make the experience really really seamless and we want to bring that that more kind of normal mainstream investor have them barely even realize they're doing everything fully Unchained in a self-custodial manner but get access to this deal that they can't get anywhere else and so then I think that is that's a good way to bring more people in because again it's not this thing that can just go on their Fidelity account and get it's something that's that's unique to what we're doing and also in terms of investors you know if we can take Capital directly from investors anywhere in the world there's all sorts of you know payment processor fees that don't have to take place on chain and then you know eventually we can get all these other benefits of interoperability and transparency and stuff that you know Robert's been talking about I want one actual other thing that I think might be worth mentioning to our listeners is the private credit Market say in 2022 and 2021 a lot of it was actually serviced by Banks like Silicon Valley Bank and I think like once they had kind of had their explosion in February it became clear that a lot of these credit opportunities had to be funded by like fully private entities versus like pseudo private entities like uh FDI insured bank and I think like that has contributed to in a way that to the boom I mean Blake yeah you know yeah it seems like that has been like one of the big drivers that have heard of so that boot was actually and that that story you're bringing up with banks you're used to doing this landing and sort of receding away from it that's actually been going on since the financial crisis in 2008. after those uh new regulations came into place Banks were basically asked to hold on to more cash and more safe assets and so if you look at like their their balance sheets their balance sheets have actually shifted up about 20 in cash and like their lending has kind of gone down right they're just sort of flipping and so this is that's like a huge amount of money it's like over a trillion dollars worth of lending it was taking place 10 years ago or 15 years ago and isn't now and so private credit has been just continuing to fill the Gap over the last 15 years and so you have all these these different private credit funds and stuff who kind of specialize in their different niches of okay I'm going to focus on fintechs in this region okay I'm gonna focus on trade Finance in this region and they really learn to understand that that that business and that industry and they learn Civics and what kind of stuff they need to put into their loan documents to like make those as safe as possible and you know that is where we've seen this just explosion of private credit it's really last 15 years it's not just the last two but the last two may have accelerated it so taking a step back the real world asset story when I hear from large institutions right whether it's the the black rocks of the world I mean you can see in Larry Fink's annual letter he talks about asset tokenization being a big story um you see it from Goldman Sachs you see it from uh Wellington you see it from you know a lot of these really large groups are looking very closely at the idea of bringing real world assets on chain that said it's taken a while and you know things haven't you know we're not we're not seeing explosive growth things are growing and things maybe are going to start working but we're waiting for that um we're waiting for that moment when this stuff really starts to uh kick into gear if and when it does and let's let's uh take it for granted for the moment that it does what does it change what happens Downstream when all of a sudden you have you know large private credit Market on chain when all of a sudden you have very large pools of treasuries on chain what does that change besides the obvious thing of oh interest rates on chain go up what else changes because of that I think you're also the you know you have interoperability of these assets you have a lot more transparency we should be able to increase the accuracy of the pricing that can take place you know because historically if someone's holding on to a private credit asset that's in some random funds book that no one knows and most of these funds that are not they're not even Tech enabled by and large right it's not like they're not on chain they're just like not even on computers right they're usually holding documents in some because you know custody partner that they work with or they're you know holding themselves and so I think getting all this stuff on chains are going to drastically increase the amount of information we have about these loans so you'll be able to see the payments coming back from the borrowers right you say okay yeah this thing's been paying back all the time loan documents can be pointed to through you know URLs that you can put on chain that kind of thing which should just I think really help facilitate these markets now you said before and I think it's true it's talking stuff is going to magically be liquid right and you know from private credit and real estate all this stuff is very very bespoke right like even one house over in the same neighborhood is not the same house you can't just assume it's the same pricing but I do think as you bring more stuff on chain you can start having things that are probably built on top to help increase that liquidity like ratings agencies and things that are looking at stuff and you're like okay you know this stuff it's been underwritten by this team they're like pretty good they have this long track record which we can see this borrower also has a long track records other stuff we can see all that stuff and you know I'm gonna call this B grade whatever right and now if you can really bring all these different private assets and call it under one risk category then I think you can actually really legitimately create a lot of liquidity but I think it's going to be a while because this is kind of like multi-step process if I'm going to get the stuff on chain and then once it's Unchained then I think other people can probably build on top these kind of raging things that can help increase the liquidity but also just nice stuff around you know moving money around quicker if people you know actually send money from one thing to another like one thing that was interesting about a recent Goldfinch alone we did this callable structure with a company in Singapore called Faz and that callable structure is this thing where investors have the right to call back their Capital whenever they want to or you know every quarter they're like a Redemption right basically and for you know a regular borrower that's actually that's a pretty annoying thing operationally to do if you have lots and lots of investors right but uh because you'd have to have different bank account information from people in different parts of the world and like how do you handle all that who's going to pay for it but in blockchain world we tell them hey look doesn't matter how many investors we end up getting like one payment to one smart contract every quarter it's all you need to do and operationally that's a much easier lift for them and that is a I call it liquidity enhancing structure that is really only possible through something like the blockchain and so I think you just get a lot of these nice little benefits that can add up over time but I also generally view the blockchain as like this it's a social technology right like it's more powerful the more people who believe in it and more people who are using it and so it's this slow kind of exponential thing so we actually started seeing a lot of people use it where that interoperability comes into play because that's why I think it just it's surprising all of us at how long it's taking it seems like another big difference so you mentioned you know the the digitizing a lot of these businesses kind of pulling them forward into to the 21st century let's say same time making things more trustworthy making things more transparent making things you know always online and very easy to execute for just trusting the cash flows of these businesses that otherwise would be very difficult to underwrite another thing that seems to me to be a direct consequence of getting more real assets on chain is a different class of consumer coming on chain then who's there today most of the people who are on chain are speculators um just by just by volume obviously there's some people who are Unchained because they want to just hold some usdc and they want to have some safe assets or they want to hold some Bitcoin and they're not they're not really speculating per se but a lot of the people who came on chain over the last few years are basically there to gamble and the having a set of users who are there to make more or less sound financial decisions and basically save for the real world really changes the kinds of products that we can start offering on chain and actually get adoption with and how do you guys think about that uh I think a thousand percent and this is a big reason as well as why we are trying to make this shift really increase the the user experience so that we can go after this mainstream audience you're talking about because the djens who are on there today they want 10 to 15 like a day right and like fundamentally the product we're offering is 10 to 50 a year right and so like you know we just can't sell those people and so we have to sell them a mainstream investor who wants to make these sound financial decisions as you were saying we want to give them the opportunity to do so but we want to do it on chains we want to be building this whole platform for the future where we see everything headed Robert what's your what's your take on that what do you think changes when you start getting more kind of risk-averse investors coming on chain well I think what winds up happening is it winds up being a more permanent like overall Financial Marketplace when there's many different types of customers many different types of investors many different types of end users all looking for different things right like the more use cases and the more sort of like end users in one place the better and the more things are just gonna like happen and the more like connections get made and like products evolve and like the assets evolve as well you know so I think increasing the diversity of end users is only going to be a good thing right like because you know they'll stick around and do something different and like they'll use another product and they'll put money somewhere else and they'll reinvest something and blah blah blah blah and it all compounds and so the long-term outcome is just going to be like you know I I think of like 15 years and I'm really bad at this because I used to think you know we'd have all the real world assets on chain right now so I'm totally wrong but I think in like 15 years you know it'll just be like oh everything is here right it's just like Wall Street three you know it's just like oh she's just where things operate and you know they don't operate on the paper and pencil way anymore they just stop right here yeah I think it also it'll decrease the volatility of the space substantially because as Robert's saying when you have this diversity of use cases and people doing it for different reasons then okay well just because you know XYZ tokens aren't doing well anymore it's risk off that doesn't mean you leave crypto land right you stay on because oh well now I get private Credit Now I can get treasury yields now I can hopefully eventually get you know public equities and things like that and again it'll just really decrease the volatility make it more of a real economy yeah I think I think like to this point earlier about the play you're talking about treasuries of like oh why wouldn't I just leave crypto and go buy it if the rebalancing cost is just so low to do it without leaving like then you won't leave right like people will just and I think that that gets to this this point Blakes me it was like transaction costs for this stuff are not zero especially for the especially for the like kind of not d-gen stuff in the sense of I I in in the back of my mind I'm like oh that's also what casino say of like cheap drinks to keep you in the casino it's like oh look for the real money makers which is get you to buy jpegs that's human nature though that's like I think that's because make it more in your face of course a Robert Robert and Blake are the bartenders who are keeping everybody uh keeping everybody past midnight yeah I think that the uh the two approaches like Robert and what we're doing they they come together they really are complementary in the sense that like you know if we're bringing someone on to do private credit some of their portfolio they may want to say hey I've got some dry powder what do I do with this before the next investment well if they're invested in emails maybe you know through through superstate right and that's a that's a really good combo right we want to be able to have them Blake yeah make it happen so they're not they're not buying any jpegs is what you're telling me one of the funniest tweets I saw this week was someone complaining about how people aren't trying to acquire failed nft projects and like they they have no exits and it's like what what were you thinking obviously there's no like what are they buying the Discord like these are selling the issuers or selling the collections I think it's like the issuers have technically had companies that received the eth or multi-cigs that receive these and they want to like sell whatever they think they are nft holders do or the owners of the projects do owners of the projects like like they were just people lamenting like there's no M A for nf2 projects and I was like what are you talking about so if somebody makes like sad Apes right and like obviously it's some like knockoff and nobody wants it sad ape owner is looking for somebody to take over the sad ape project that has already fizzled out yeah yeah yeah wow um yeah weird this is a very weird industry um I so just one more thing that I wanted to touch on um so you guys are talking about okay you know we're starting with tokenized credit or private credit or sorry token as a treasuries private credit you know maybe eventually we'll get to public equities I I was I was a think of mirror so uh for those of you don't know mirror was uh one of the projects in the tarot ecosystem was basically like the you know basically building perps on uh uh you know U.S treasuries and this was a meme for a long time and something that we we took a lot of interest in is this idea that look look if you if you take these you know um Delta one derivatives that people love in crypto and you just wrap them around traditional assets you can basically create synthetic forms of just about anything as long as you have a price feed and um you could do it for Bitcoin obviously with a perp but you can with a professional swap but you can do it for any asset so long as you have an index and uh there was there was a moment when some of these things were getting some traction or people were excited about synthetics people were excited about mirror and they all kind of fizzled out and it does seem like this is probably the best theory for why which is that there was nobody on chain who actually wanted to make sound financial decisions and that basically the part of your portfolio that you were acting like an adult with you were not bringing on chain you were keeping that in your brokerage account or whatever and the stuff you bring on chain you're like hey yo I'm here to gamble I'm here to farm I'm here to do whatever but I'm not here to you know buy some Apple stock and you know hope that the Oracle works yeah it's sort of the I totally agree I think it's also sort of the same reason why we haven't seen like on-chain index funds work it's like no one's trying to diversify their portfolio on chain they're trying to go go 100x long Pepe like it's just a very different sort of mindset with apes and miladys right right ah true true which actually is where that that diversification actually might have worked out what what about what is the 60 40 portfolio of nfts that is that is absolutely correct no but what ratio what ratio no I I you still have you have to come up 60 40 68 40 milady okay wow yeah you might be 80 20 the opposite direction now I don't know I don't know I'm gonna rebound yeah yeah Auto rebalancing Auto rebalancing um okay there's there's one more story I wanted to cover today um so there's a there's a company called Arkham which is kind of a blockchain intelligence company they you know they do kind of a bunch of data that you can see about what's happening on the blockchain and so they had a token launch so they're launching a token which I had not realized that they uh have a need for a token but apparently they do so uh they're launching a token I think on binance Launchpad or something and uh this token well first there was some kerfuffle because um there they have some referral program where you can like post a link to like hey sign up for Arkham with my referral link and this referral link was a base64 encoded version of your email like your raw email so people could just read each other's emails uh provide from posting these referral links which was hilarious they eventually fixed it um but that that's just funny um but the product itself the product for which this token is being created is basically a kind of communal tagging system where you can I don't I don't know what the token mechanics are but more or less you know you stake something and you're like ah this person or this address corresponds to this real world person and I'm staking this amount of risk on it it's basically like a crowdsourced tagging you know who is who you know how to realize uh real world identities correspond to online addresses system um and a lot of people got upset about this because they're like hey this seems like basically a kind of incentivized de-anonymization network this is like this is bad this is going against the crypto ethos of allowing people to maintain their anonymity if they so choose um curious to get thoughts from the panel on is this good is this bad is this part of growing up as an industry that like hey you know I mean obviously etherscan has this tagging mechanism and there's an ancient that has you know it's not as though these things don't exist somewhere but it doesn't seem to rug people the wrong way of like hey I'm just gonna like pay people I'm just gonna crowdsource different people and pay anyone to claim that this person corresponds to this address what do you guys think about this I just think it's a faulty mechanism like what's stopping me from going out and getting a couple tokens and saying that 0x1234 is haseeb you know and just I don't care about learning losing or burning my tokens like it's a troll against a c you know so you know who would have thought the Oracle problem was hard to solve yeah who would have thought this was a difficult thing I may have heard of this I may have heard of this well and I I'm I'm kind of inventing the token mechanics I don't actually know that's how it works is how I assume it works I can't imagine how else it would work but yeah thing people are like staking on these facts we do not speak of token Registries okay this is like an auger throwback really you know it's like you you stake the token you dispute like escalation game this is like true yeah actually you are you're completely right this uh presumably would be the same Academy now again I I have not actually read the thing and I just heard we just heard about another podcast that was sued for uh not correctly reporting a story so I'm going to caveat what we say very clearly is that I have not read the token mechanic so it could work in a totally different way so please Arkham please don't sue us uh although it's it is it is I will say it's a very shadowy name for a company that makes me afraid of losses I still trust I'll say that it's with Arkham is the name of the insane style from Batman isn't it the name of the no the Gotham is the name of the city um Arkham's the name of the insane asylum yes yes yeah they issued a uh like a statement today or yesterday and there was this other sort of funny meme meme running around where people were looking at the founder on on LinkedIn and like he had you know his his past history and then he like won interest like one thing he was interested in on LinkedIn it was the CIA and then everyone um in their in their uh statement today they had a section that was like are you like the FBI or the CIA and they're like no we are not we are like not associated with any law enforcement and I'm like I feel like your company is really not going well when you have to specify that you know in public like we are not you're not a government project yeah are you the cops yeah okay that's a I mean I I mean you know a little bit of Route people having to ask yeah okay well interesting um so is so I think we're all on board with like we don't think this is going to work let's say there was a version of this that did work uh or that was a a trustworthy repository of addresses I mean look regardless of whether or not this Arkham system works etherscan does this nanson does this is this good to encourage this to reinforce it what do you guys think about these kind of uh address Registries there's also ethereum uh attribution system yeah yes which I believe a number of people uh I know for sure well I'm not sure it running somebody is working on building something to help do their own attributions or attestations sorry Association is the word I mean to be saying ethereum attestation system that's like an open standard I think a bunch of large companies are going to be doing that which sounds obviously better than any sort of token staking mechanism right I honestly would probably just prefer to trust some large company who has a reputation at stake which is actually something really valuable for them rather than these tokens which will fluctuate in value wildly anyway but that's a that's a self attestation right that's like saying this is my I'm coinbase this is my address correct it would be like coinbase saying this uh this is this person's address or this person has been kyc for a third party I see I see yeah third-party giving accusations about someone else which is what I assume Arkham was trying to do here like someone else is taking time yeah I I like I understand some of the motivation I think it's maybe not as nefarious as people assume it is very laborious and manual to actually like tag a bunch of the you know Market maker wallets and somebody exchange wallets and you can do some you know basic heuristics to sort of identify them but like you know someone has to go there and go through every all these things I'm like it's not always gonna be 100 accurate and so I think part of their thinking and I think Arkham basically tries to compete with nanson and sort of being this token on chain intelligence platform hey what if we can bootstrap our own you know data set and instead I think it is obviously it can be used this way but I think it's also been sort of presented as uh it's a you know doxing uh doctor earn platform um which I think well doesn't the white paper start off with the sentence the inevitable end of blockchain is to have everyone doxed or something like it has some ridiculous something that sounds like it's out of like Peter Thiel meets Batman fan fiction that like I don't wow that's pretty that is pretty dark the white paper is just so so good you're really living up to the game it was just like written by someone who like seems a bit like lacking any form of social empathy with any other human on the planet ouch too many years in Gotham City he'll do that to you man it wears it down wow okay the Robert was telling you want to add I was just gonna say they're clearly playing up that like dystopian fan fiction element they're they're feeding off that for their own brand and their own energy so yeah okay well uh either way well let's let's hope that they managed to uh get this registered I mean I don't actually know what I hope I don't know I want their registry to work or to not work is is kind of like here here's the here here's the phrase de-anonymization is destiny that was like when I saw that wow wow that's a that's a very good tagline for the CIA yeah it's like it's like everything they write just you know seems to just be like you know I could have trained chat I could have asked chat to be theater right what would Peter Thiel say about blockchain data and monitoring people and like it would have come up with this I feel like DARPA must have like been their lead investor or something it's a little too it's a little too on the nose um anyway all right before we before we get sued we have to we have to wrap the show to be clear these are all the we have no idea what's going on so don't take anything seriously let's go ahead and wrap uh Blake thanks for coming on the show it was great to hear about what's going on at Goldfinch thanks man wish you wish you all the best and uh and Robert congrats on the launch of super State anybody who has money put it in this is not investment advice but you should absolutely maybe if it's appropriate for your portfolio you should you should buy tokenized treasuries I I love I love the descending sequence of disclaimers that was like the best part [Laughter] because I'm getting better at this my my um yeah my my ability to disclaim as something as soon as I say it is uh being in this industry you get you get on top of it anyway all right we got a wrap thank you everybody see you next week [Music]
