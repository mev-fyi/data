not a dividend It's A Tale of Two fun now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet generally speaking airdrops are kind of pointless anyways um my name's trading firms who are very involved I like to have the ultimate D5 Protocols are the antidote to this problem hello everybody Welcome to The Chopping Block every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry insiders perspective on the crypto topics of the day so quick intros first we got Tom the D5 Maven and master of memes next up we've got Robert the crypto connoisseur and captain of compound then we've got tarun the Giga brain and Grand Puba at Gauntlet and finally we've got myself I'm haseeb the head hype man at dragonfly so all four of us are early stage investors in crypto but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice legal advice or even life advice okay so for those of you who are not tuning in live we just went live after the end of the New York Times interview with SPF um I think it's uh actually I guess the second interview that he's done but certainly the most high profile and it seems like the most hard-hitting I'm just going to give a very quick summary of some of the stuff he said because a lot of it has kind of been repeats of you know things he's already been asserting publicly and in his tweets so some of the some of the key quotes that I pulled out from the conversation he had with Aaron Sorkin first he said FTX us and FTX Japan are fully solvent and he expects that they can pay back customers he's surprised that they haven't already and he's confused why they were pulled into the bankruptcy he was asked at some length about the shibboleths and the game that westerners play that he uh alluded to in the Vox article and he sort of he tried to paint it as though this is talking about marketing uh he's like oh you know we do all these like dumb ESG marketing campaigns blah blah blah in order to get uh regulatory stuff don't forget that he was like well I'm sorry that a private conversation that I thought was the truth was revealed he said that first before yeah like true true he was so Aaron asked him about uh criminal liability if he expects that he will have criminal liability and Sam gave a very interesting answer to that he said look there's a time and place for me to think about that but right now is not it right now I need to be focused on customers and what I can do to help make the situation better now Aaron also asked him when did he know that there was a problem at FTX and Sam answered he knew that there was a problem starting on November 6th November 6 was a day that CZ tweeted that they were going to sell their FDT uh it was November 7th the day afterwards that Sam Actually tweeted that FTX is fine all assets are fine we don't trade with customer funds and so this seems like potentially a in admission that Sam knew that things were not fine when he made that tweet and that tweet of course was later deleted which indicates probably what we already suspect which is that he knew that that tweet was uh was was not knowingly correct at that time he he's he repeated again that he uh regretted that he allowed the bankruptcy process to come into place and he felt that it was possible to potentially make all customers whole and when it was asked why he sort of alluded to doing something like bitfinex which presumably means issuing some kind of debt token and using that to quote unquote make customers whole and just continuing to operate and then lastly he said which he also said in another interview that he has 100K left in his name so he you know presumably doesn't have a whole lot of money left and his just hanging out in the Bahamas so those are those are what I kind of perceive to be the highlights reactions we just we just got off the video what did you guys think oh yeah I I think he meant Andrew Ross Sorkin I'm sorry Andrew Russell my first point is that he said a lot of things and didn't bring the receipts for any of them you know he can claim or make any statement he wants he's done that for a long time but a lot of the things he said you know he didn't necessarily provide any evidence for him how much money does he have who knows most of those entities have been in his name how much crypto does he have if you want me to believe that he has no crypto you know I I will answer with extreme skepticism my take was you know he seemed to be framing his own defense whether it's a defense in the court of public opinion or the court of the Department of Justice by Framing everything from the beginning to the end as I'm innocent I didn't know things got away from me you know this was just a funny mistake he yeah so it does seem like he's continuing to assert the defense that basically this was a margin position that went wrong there was no clear decision or moment that he made to say okay we're going to take customer funds and give it to Alameda you know he's continuing to assert that this was just kind of run-of-the-mill margining that went wrong and how the risk systems didn't make this apparent to them I I I think that's just part partly the interviewer not understanding how a derivatives exchange Works to realize how absurd it is to say that that's what happened uh I'd like I think if interesting like thoughts you know understood how clearing and settlement that derivatives exchanges is it works normally and like why this makes no it makes no sense to be like someone sent you money in your bank account I'm going to credit you margin in my exchange like makes no sense at all there's no settlement guarantee I think like that that was probably the weakest question in some ways because it he didn't like kind of press on like how how could that even make sense that you did that at all yeah it's it's somewhat hard you know right now for us to piece together everything that's happening because we're getting it yeah in bits and pieces looking externally and but I I do feel like you know once like some of the actual internal Communications come out ideally in like Discovery like there should be a paper trail like to sort of that this happened right I doubt they you know had everything done over phone calls or everything done in person surely at some point someone put in writing what was that would actually happen then we'll have sort of a Smoking Gun right now it feels like you know we're trying to sort of figure out how the system worked from the outside just by seeing sort of what it's emitting the fact that they had all these auto deleting messages in all their internal conversations I think is going to make it very difficult for any kind of criminal investigation to get a Smoking Gun now I mean given and also given the quality of the accounting the accounting was so bad that clearly it's gonna be very difficult to actually do any forensics here to understand who was involved when these decisions were made um it seems that you know Sam is asserting very clearly like look I didn't know and if I had known I would have stopped it and yeah he's saying that look this is my responsibility because I'm the CEO and I messed up but he's also asserting that he was not uh he was not knowledgeable and ultimately that is almost always the key element of a criminal prosecution is the State of Mind of the person who's committing the crime if they didn't know that it was happening then generally speaking you're going to get civil liability not criminal liability now there are certain things I think that are pretty slam dunk like that he made misrepresentations to customers when he said that FTX was fine that they broke the terms of service in a knowing way and or that they mis-made misrepresentations to investors it seems now that many investors are raising their hands and saying look we were made assertions about the relationship between element and FTX that were not true and that were demonstrably not true even even uh you know with respect to just the detail that we learned which is that Alameda had a special status in their liquidation engine there was another interview that Sam did recently with Tiffany Fong which is actually the very first interview I guess he's done in that interview other than Kelsey Piper's you know Elite DMS and in that interview he was asked directly about the back door that the Wall Street Journal reported on and Sam's claim was that no there's no back door like I can't even code how would I make a back door that seemed very confusing to me like wasn't he a quanta Jane Street how you you know I I remember once I remember when I interviewed there when I left College one of the jokes that one of my interviewers made was our Founders only know two programming languages VBA or XL and no camel and nothing in the between so like I could kind of it there's there's actually some reasons philosophically for them that I I could most of the quants actually don't do a lot more like picking up the phone than pricing things rather than purely like Tech based trade yeah I guess even if you're writing a lot of O camel that doesn't mean you know how to like write an accounting system it doesn't obviate Gary from having done this right like let's be fine clearly the CTO code right if he just told one of his close allies within the company to do this in secret like it doesn't change the fact that he ordered there to be a back door look the molecule has one person who could have done it that's all that matters sure at least one I mean so okay so I think we're it feels like the whole world is kind of on the same page at this point uh other than Bill Ackman I don't know if you guys saw Bill Ackman live tweeted during the talk that he said call me crazy but I think SBF is telling the truth it seems like everybody except Bill basically thinks that okay we kind of roughly know what happened and I think we we see the the defense that that Sam is trying to make honestly what impressed me the most in this conversation with Sam is the fact that like there is no upside for him in doing these interviews and he's very clearly now at the point where he's like back to his old self it actually was one of the things that the the New York Times had this like live uh live blogging of you know different Snippets from the conversation and one of the things they said which I found very interesting is like New York Times uh wrote this themselves which is that they said like something like you know Sam is kind of back to his charismatic self and he's using his intelligence to try to you know kind of win over the audience uh and his in his vulnerability and it's very clear like Sam knows that this he's very good at this right it's kind of what made FTX so successful and he's basically ignoring the obvious advice of any of his lawyers and he seemed like potentially seemingly you know the stuff that he said in this interview will almost certainly come out in a criminal trial if and when he has one and so it does seem like I don't think there's an n-dimensional chess here like this is just clearly bad for him to be doing these kinds of interviews and directly answering questions that potentially implicate him on criminal liability like I think he just genuinely believes what he's saying at least with respect to you know this is not the time for me to go in a hole and just disappear you know who agrees with you Bill Ackman he'll actually give you the details of the story I don't know that I believe the details of the story but in terms of Sam's just sense that like look I just I I can't just go and do what's in my blind self-interest because I feel like a strong sense of responsibility like it's hard to get like what is his motivation if like like if you think it's all a Machiavellian with respect to getting on the New York Times deal book interview which is basically I mean what happened there was like a cross-examination this was the most unfriendly interview I have seen I don't know what do you guys think about that I mean I think leaking some of the specifics like you serve around the November 6th date seems like a big [ __ ] up but it does seem like hey you know so far you know from all the leaks that have come out assume Sam said nothing it seems extremely criminal right it seems like hey there was there was you know Mouse Behind these actions and so all of his you know interviews so far have been trying to spend this like plausible deniability story right oh I I [ __ ] up it was a mistake accounting issue and I think that that hope is that you repeat that enough times and people begin to believe that that was actually Sam's State of Mind especially again if we don't actually have those that written evidence so if that is sort of the message that's being spammed out you have this voices group that's actually pushing that versus you know everything else that's being leaked out about the back door and you know all these other sort of intentional acts that he took I think it's also possible he just can't help it that you know like the he's so used to the spotlight he's so used to being a part of the conversation that maybe he just can't resist continuing to interject himself into that conversation he got hooked on crypto Twitter yeah it was way of like like when asked about the stimulants he was just like uh well I didn't drink alcohol until after I was 21 I was like what kind of reflection is that and then he like started being like Oh I needed help focusing but clearly I wasn't focusing enough my head exploded I thought that was a legitimate answer which is like look I mean the guy is like he was his leg was twitching he plays World of Warcraft on calls clearly he has a problem with focusing right so I can understand that like this guy for everything we know about him probably does need some medication for his lack of focus so I thought that was a I honestly thought that was a reasonable answer but it's still funny I I thought that was that was like that to me that was the best part right he didn't even like he could have just been like no next question right yeah and instead we like learned about the fact that he was like boring in high school weirdly I got recommended a um like a talk that he gave in like 2018 on on YouTube just like through the algorithm or whatever and it was it's it sort of reminds me of watching like old Trump videos of like this person was actually a very charismatic you know well-spoken person and then and so it's so hard to sort of square that with sort of this like weird Twitchy Goblin that we now see on on screen but like you know at the time yeah it was it's a very sort of different version of Sam so like I think you know maybe it just was you know partly because of this but yeah it's strange to see him again on screen yeah I thought um I I it seemed like maybe he'd set that up himself I mean I doubt he was getting a lot of help on it he needed a camera crew that thing looked like a guilty definition he was looking down and constantly you know doing this thing as he was answering questions and I was like uh it it does not this does not seem like a good way to make yourself seem innocent so yeah especially in the court of public opinion like the all these clips are gonna be replayed over and over and over again it does look like you're in a confession Booth by the way that was that is a hundred percent that is 100 the vibe of uh of watching that that interview oh well um okay I think we should we should kind of zoom out a bit and talk about some of the broader backdrop of what's been happening over the last week so when we left things off in the last episode we were talking about Genesis and some of the fears around the Genesis and solvency and I believe last week we said that we thought Genesis was probably going to be okay and now a lot more details have come to light and we've learned a valuable lesson which I think we I think I alluded to very briefly last time I was like oh you know after FTX I never I don't feel like I should be that confident about anything now we learned why is that it looks like there was a lot of funny business in the accounting at Genesis very very high level the understanding that we now have from from different things that have been reported to the Press is that uh dcg the parent company of Genesis uh made a loan to Genesis uh sorry not alone what they did was they bought out genesis's bad debt in three arrows so Genesis had I believe 2.1 billion dollars of exposure to three arrows and dcg the parent company of Genesis bought that debt at par meaning that we are going to make you whole for that 2.1 billion and so we're going to pay 2.1 billion for this debt but we're not going to pay it in cash we're going to pay it in a promissory note that pays out over 10 years so basically they're going to get like some you know annuity effectively for next 10 years um but supposedly there's some term in that promissory note such that if Genesis goes into liquidation then dcg would be forced to pay the full value of the promissory note so the the note would come due immediately if there's a liquidation of Genesis which I assume at the time they weren't thinking was a serious possibility and that was the reason why you can say we're solvent because yeah okay we don't have the cash but we have the ability to call all the cash that would otherwise be necessary um if and when we you know kind of you know go we have to go to the mat on this because of a liquidation so that's now happening basically you're now in a situation where dcg has to do something with this promissory note uh now that Genesis is stuck we realize hey when we were told that Genesis was solvent we were including this promissory note ECG does not have 2.1 billion dollars in cash to pay the value of the promissory note and so either one Genesis files and then pulls dcg into bankruptcy because dcg will be called on for this 2.1 billion dollar liability which obviously they're you know they're not going to pay 2. billion in cash they don't have that so either one both entities go into some super complicated bankruptcy procedure or the other possibility is that Genesis goes under and then the the note is itself auctioned off at some value less than par but somehow it's prevented from dcg going under because maybe the creditors would find that to actually be a worse outcome I don't exactly understand I think this is a lot of what people are trying to figure out right now but tldr it looks very very likely that Genesis either one is going to have to file for bankruptcy or two they're gonna have to go through a restructuring such that the creditors of Genesis are going to have to collectively agree that like hey let's agree to get some uh you know let's basically reduce our claims at Genesis uh in order to avoid a bankruptcy just because the bankruptcy would be so deleterious to the big creditors to to Genesis so this is a live situation we don't really know exactly what what's happening but it seems like markets are now pricing in that there's going to be some relatively calm resolution that doesn't involve a bankruptcy but involves a creditors kind of renegotiating what's happening at Genesis Robert I know you're closer to this than than we are any further Insider I don't know if that like you're not able to share I mean you know I'm only closer because I think out of the four of us I'm the only one who's a creditor to Genesis so it's the embarrassing of being closer to the situation uh I have more empathy with everyone who got wrecked uh with FTX I'm wrecked with Genesis you know I don't have any more information than that what's been discussed there Ryan sulcus tweeted out a weird financial model uh earlier today saying like gcg is healthy everybody like take a look at this financial model you know full story coming tomorrow that could be you know more optimistic than you know reality but if you're looking for something interesting go find that tweet I think the thing that I'm looking for is you know whether or not they're pushed into bankruptcy involuntarily I think at this point you know any number of you know creditors could push them into bankruptcy you know if their obligations are in default they halted withdrawals there's a lot of customers that you know had uh positions that matured and that could ask for their funds back um or whether you know they're able to work things out without filing the bankruptcy uh petition so you know I think the odds are high let's say 80 but the thing I want to ask about and press yuan haseeb is you said the markets are indicating you know a gentle resolution I'm actually curious what markets are you referring to yeah okay I could be mistaken but I believe after the news was reported that um the Genesis creditors were seeking a non-bankracy resolution that markets were bounded if I'm not mistaken did that not happen yeah that that's like Jerome yeah that's today that's today but this happened a few days ago did not okay or whatever I I take everything that I just said with the greatest love I have no idea what markets think although although I I would be I would be curious if anyone is actually trading like ECG credit default swaps because like this could actually exist that was what I was I was kind of curious if you knew that that existed or something yeah if anyone listening is trading dcg or Genesis Credit default swaps or derivatives somehow please tweet at us after the show let us know that's super interesting I mean I mean certainly it's interesting for people who are creditors in case they want to head yeah you know I've heard of people buying and trading bankruptcy claims you know obviously there's been a huge amount of activity uh at FTX and people trading bankruptcy claims back in the day there was a huge amount of Mount gox bankruptcy claims being traded I know it was like Fortress the hedge fund made a huge business buying bankruptcy claims um I don't know if you can even trade the claims prior to bankruptcy maybe you can maybe there is already activity in Genesis claims that would be really interesting um you can make like a warrant right that's like only exercisable when the event happens and like if not then it goes it's just worthless yeah there's there's a lot of uh folks who are buying out FTX claims as well um I think Genesis a bit early for there to be a market for claims that I guess possible planes are crazy though like I feel like yeah they're like five to ten cents or so I think they've gone up like I think they've gone up yeah they were initially closer to five cents in the audio interview that Sam did he said he expects creditors to give it 25 back which is also where I imagine you know a lot of people who are buying these claims to expect these things I don't know because when you're buying the claims your your first of all you're taking all the risk away and also you get your money immediately right so these claims are going for like maybe of what I saw was like 12 cents roughly um that was a few days ago right I'm saying Sam is expecting when this is finally finished that you will get back 25 cents of a dollar which is what I said which may take many many years and obviously there's a lot more risk and correct yeah to double your money in like five years betting on an FTX recovery seems insane like if that's the risky one everything is better shout out to Laura actually I forget exactly who it was but she had someone on recently who bought a lot of Mount gox claims I believe on Unchained who like walks and walked he walks you through the entire process of like with like to buy a claim what's like process so like highly recommend listening to that I forget the guy's name it's like Thomas something but it was it was like very interesting destructive right so okay so besides Genesis which is still an ongoing story um the other big thing was uh that blockify finally filed for bankruptcy now this one I think everybody sort of Saw coming I think there was no question when FTX went under that block five was you know a goner but uh they it turned out if we learned a few things from the Block five bankruptcy so for one we learned that um among the biggest creditors so FTX is one of their creditors we also saw that um the SEC apparently had a um 30 million dollar credit uh to their name as well also the apparently the reason why blockify was taking so long to file because everyone kind of knew that okay block five is toast I mean given their exposure to FTX this is not going to end well but apparently they were selling all of their crypto which was about 250 million dollars worth of crypto they converted into Dollars uh before filing they also are apparently there's like now uh claims going around about Sam's Robin Hood stake which was pledged to block fight I didn't totally fully understand how this relationship works but there's all these kind of you know kind of Spider-Man finger-pointing meme going on right now between uh blockfi Alameda FTX so it's all it's all a bit of a [ __ ] show but block by itself has a bunch of fun stuck on FTX FTX is a creditor block fi then there's this Robin Hood thing um so I'm all around I'm pretty confused about what exactly is going on here and I don't think we have a clear picture yet of the assets versus liabilities of block by either so we don't have a good sense of what recovery would look like what I think the thing was that like some of the funds barred from blockfire were used to buy the Robin Hood shares from immersion Technologies which was like this other entity and then later I believe that companies shares were used as like either part of the bankruptcy purchase and pledged effectively and so there's this very weird thing where like block money went by Robin Hood chairs which came back to block fires collateral but unlike defy you know you can't like Loop you don't know what Loop how many times it's been looped it does seem like there's a lot of Loops in this whole thing between Alameda and FTX and block Phi and all this one of the things that came out also in the interview just now is that Andrew Ross organ asked SBF like okay so why did you why did you spend all this money trying to buy block fi and Voyager and you know we previously speculated on the show that the answer was that he was trying to essentially save his own bank because if you know ft oh sorry if Alameda uh allowed block fi and Voyager to go under well they were two of his largest lenders and that would have like exploded the whole thing much earlier that was that was a theory anyway it turns out a few things have come to light one supposedly that it was reported early speculated that the purchase price for uh block fight was in ftt it turns out not to be the case block fight claimed that actually the purchase was in cash and so they they had I guess minimal ftt exposure or no [ __ ] exposure but then second so in the interview what Sam said is that like look by the time that we actually made these purchases uh they had already margin called us like we had very little loans coming from blockfi or Voyager until the reason why we were buying them was purely to kind of stem contagion in crypto which was at the time his stated goal I don't know what you guys think of this story and again it's probably hard to put together the truth just because it was so long ago and it doesn't seem like they're keeping records on any of this stuff but what's your what's your perception of that the the recasting of the purchases you made over the summer well the one that I read and I don't know how much truth there is to this and this is for like the sluice up there was that you know with things like block find particular you know by acquiring block fi they move the number of block fi customer assets to FTX after the fact and it's possible that it was cash positive for the XTF FTX broader organization and it also moved assets from the US entity into the offshore entity so you know the example of how this worked is the U.S entity provided a loan to block fi with the U.S entity sellers the U.S entity is the one that's highly regulated and everything is kosher blah blah blah right then block five moved its customer money to FTX International and more money than FTX us put in and the net impact of this was money positive for the co-mingled Alameda FTX international organization to help buy them time that's my understanding but I could be mistaken there's one other thing that was funny in this interview which I thought was hilarious was like he was like yeah and although and all the in all the jurisdictions where we were forced to follow the rules like the US and Japan like people are solving I mean he basically said that which is basically saying like if we were forced to follow the rules we follow the rules which implies you know it's not forced to follow the rules then we don't have to do anything and I guess this idea of like moving all these U.S assets off shores in that vein of like trying to avoid any needing to to kind of deal with the rules as I say not to shift gears too much but one thing that I also feel like is somewhat damning or confusing about the ftx's like opting like being a lender on FTX is opt-in like you can have your funds on the platform but not have them being lent out and so the story of like you know hey we had a bunch of bad collateral we took out you know some loans the cloud goes down that would make sense if like those losses were then socialized amongst the people who were part of the lending margin program on FTX but like if you weren't then your funds should have been separate so clearly there's like some sort of commingling otherwise like there this should not have been you know possible yeah I think it's pretty clear that we don't really understand even the nature of Sam's story about how exactly like how exactly he's even claiming mechanically this whole thing would have worked and uh you know I I think it's very unlikely we're going to get any clear answers unless either one somebody who's much deeper in the details actually interviews him um or two we basically see this thing dragged in front of a trial of some kind um I think I mean arguably the bankruptcy trial will have to unearth half of this these questions more deeply right that's why I actually think it was announced why would it well I mean it still has to do recovery for it it put all the envies in bankruptcy including Alameda and like every random entity except for a few like a very small number like Ledger X and stuff that didn't enter right but it's not clear to me that like this is the kind of thing that would happen in a bankruptcy court I think it's much more likely that they're just going to find the assets figure out the creditors and then figure out the bet the you know how to distribute what's left right a bankruptcy court is not there to like you know figure out who did something wrong right it's not forensics necessarily it's tracking down all the money getting it back getting it to the people who deserve it yeah so I don't know that we're gonna learn anything much from the bankruptcy court other than just like what like what the money was spent on I think that will learn and there will probably be a lot of stuff of people going after Sam personally going after some of these entities that were separated going after some of the real estate so there'll be a lot of that that I think will come out uh through the bankruptcy proceedings but I doubt we're going to get it again any answers about what really happened it's just such a complicated question and a bankruptcy judge isn't really even equipped to investigate that question so yeah although I in this case I feel like one of the reasons I'm a little more convinced some of these details come out is because where and how the assets are stored in custody right now is still extremely unclear based on some of the statements made by the current the like genre of like we don't actually know how to like get keys for certain things or like you know some of the custody state is weird and so I think that will force you to do some forensics in the process if that makes sense yeah that that is that is possible that is possible the another thing so after a lot of the FTX Fallout there was also this binance Recovery Fund and there's a lot of weirdness around this Recovery Fund so I don't know how many of you guys been paying attention to this so CZ announced that hey binance is going to step up and we're going to you know dedicate a bunch of a bunch of money to backstop the industry it looks like there were some contributors um we like jump contributed polygon contributed GSR contributed but it looks like there's only 50 million that was total contributed by Outsiders as far as we can tell and then binance claimed that they were dedicating 1 billion in the USD to this sort of bailout fund Tom you you were going some detail on the story what what are we seeing with this binance Recovery Fund thing well I think people just are a bit confused because you know it's basically uh the address that binance listed as like The Recovery Fund is like a single address that was moved from a binance hot wallet his address is moved from like binance seven so it's like like why is the entire you know Recovery Fund being stored in like a single wallet and like why was it moved from like a finance wall is this very confusing right now and especially given that CZ also sounds like he's trying to go out and raise more money for this so yeah this isn't like a really very clear story around this I think is it hobby or okay is also trying to start their own Recovery Fund so I guess now everyone has a Recovery Fund uh as well yeah so we have these recovery funds now but like what are they bailing out things are exploding and they are just kind of sitting and watching I don't understand what this is for sure Society they take you seriously Sam was right all along you guys it turns out uh he was more he was telling the truth when nobody else would admit it well I think binance is and this is my hunch finances is going to bail out all the programs from like the binance law Finance launch pad and their incubator and all these like you know low to mid-tier projects that have run out of money or lost all their funds on FTX or whatever anything that they've like backed in the past you know they could probably like bail out those teams with a couple million dollars to get them to keep building in the financing system I saw a bunch of posts like this that were like developer on Solana moved to BSC or move to BNB chain sorry to be in between and I I like I think there's like there's something about like binance is using this as an opportunity to like grow the BNB chain ecosystem I mean not that the ecosystem it's really an ecosystem fund yeah I mean it was interesting I mean not that this is the metric you should always look at because it's quite gamable but it was interesting that pancake swap flipped unisoft tvl this weekend uh not coincidental with the arrival of this fund so there's something weird about the there's something going on in BNB chainland that I think this is meeting I know I know I know I know no no and this is comparing V2s I just who cares about V2 because it's all moving to V3 where it's more like all the really all the really low liquidity random coins are in V2 does pancake swap have a V3 equivalent no not yet but the V3 license expires when like April so I feel like we're gonna everyone's just gonna deploy like right now there's a thing where everyone who wants to deploy V3 has to go to uniswap governance get governance to approve like deploying on your chain and obviously you you know I'd say uniswap governance is very anti-bnb chain so I don't see that ever happening but that's why unit swap confidence will extend the license for another year okay they choose to do that yes oh yes the actual terms of the business source license are governance can grant additions and licensees to it or it can change the data so if okay so just so I understand uh because I'm not super close to this so if somebody goes and deploys uni V3 on BNB chain what happens like who sues who how does this work I mean I don't know if we're actually going to find this out but I assume uniswap the protocol votes Law Firm to see some projects okay I have no idea I have no idea how this is actually supposed to be litigated in Clara's Court uh if I'm familiar with the unified license you guys can trust me on that wait do you remember what was that trial that happened of like that guy Yaz like there's this like fake trial trying to like censor him and it was like kind of a kangaroo court in Claris I I forget if it was Clara Ed knows Aragon Aragon is where we saw like some crazy uh yeah yeah Aragon was not Aragon was nuts Aragon was like a kangaroo court somehow we found a way to build all the technology to reinvent Soviet Russia in the 1920s wonderful wonderful okay well speaking of um think of chaos and D5 so we did have also last week a very interesting attack that took place against Ave and this is this kind of caused reverberations across all the lending protocols in defy so tarun and Robert I assume you guys are are closest to this but I'll give the very very high level so we talked before about the mango markets attacker Avi Eisenberg uh Abraham Eisenberg is his full name um so he was the one who manipulated mango markets and took a very profitable trading strategy quote unquote he announced earlier this idea that he could basically do an attack against Ave by borrowing assets that were essentially that were less liquid than Ave was kind of giving them credit for and essentially manipulating markets after doing large loans so I think essentially the way the attack were actually true it's probably better if you walk through it describe for us what exactly happened with the attack what happened with curve and the you know the the all the the kind of play-by-play why Ave ended up incurring bad debt at the end of this episode well well I mean the bad debt that the protocol had is the the thing that you're you should be worried about at the end not not the the ones he made but he was sort of doing the a little bit of the opposite of uh what happened in mango where instead of trying to push the price up of some piece of collateral to borrow everything he actually put some usdc's collateral then shorted curve try to push the price down and then basically by pushing it down he basically could borrow all of the supply of curve and then if it mean reverted then he then you have then you can do a mango style thing now he didn't really analyze where curve liquidity was there was kind of not there are not many places to get curved for instance comics Finance is a place where people end up locking up curve for multiple years and there's quite a bit of liquidity in there and so it was easy for people to take the other side of his trade and basically brief him for shorting this in the way he did um the protocol realized bad debt because basically there wasn't enough curve to do the liquidations and so it was just expensive in some ways sense but the total amount of bad debt was like under two million dollars so it was relatively small yeah so I I think at the end of the day like the the sheer destruction and overall liquidity since the FTX incident has that made these mango cell things more likely which is why I think people are being much more cautious now but the the main point is in the v3s of both compound and Ave there are borrow and Supply caps which you can use to kind of limit the max size of these types of so if I can if I can summarize in a sentence there were some stale parameters for borrowing and lending long-term mostly borrowing long tail assets and these parameters assumed market conditions that looked more like you know January than that looked like today and all the stuff ironically that we've been talking about with credit destruction for mango it's actually quite different uh versus different yes in mango it was sort of the Long Hill parameters here it was sort of there's this weird thing where like the the collateral used was actually like good collateral and the liquidation threshold was somewhat high and it's actually very hard to convince people to lower oxidation thresholds in these communities on the major assets meaning East wbtc usdc tether so so if you put up usdc and then shorted curve so it is it's a little bit more nuanced uh if you actually go and but yes it's one of these things where like liquidity conditions deteriorated going through governance took you know by the time by the time we've got the proposal would make it through it it was late and so you know yeah we submitted a proposal and first stuff but I I guess the point is uh I think yeah it was sort of unprecedented but there was it wasn't like a huge loss also maker had some bad debt as well last week from Gemini earn so if you remember uh maker put part of the safety module into Gemini Urn to earn some yield and it incurred some losses from them and has written them up and paid back how much do you put into Gemini earn and isn't Gemini earned Genesis yeah so they wrote they wrote it off completely and just paying it and die back to the it was about two million dollars it was almost the same thing yeah they were just starting this program it was like dripping into Genesis yeah that's great that they I mean it's not luck right like they did the slow roller that's great good for them well it's not just a sport I mean there there's some luck in that the timing of when this happened right could have been totally different of course like I'm still so but my point is both protocols had these kind of events they were relatively small communities responded pretty quickly so I would I would just like say that you know and you can see how the debt is and people are all fighting about it versus like I don't know how how did Genesis get like billions of dollars of debt and like not you know like not liquidate anyone it's kind of mild good question because the humans didn't want to liquidate their best customers I mean I think for I mean oh yes that is definitely true I think for Genesis and for for Gemini Erin specifically my understanding is like that's actually a large bulk of sort of the debt it's like almost a billion dollars is coming from Gemini earn and I think it is inherently this weird issue which I don't know why was this these programs were set up this way where you said inherent like duration mismatches right where you sell these sort of yield services to retail customers with the idea you can always deposit you can always withdraw like a bank but then on the back side you're making you know fixed term loans to to market makers and so even if the loans are are fine like you're setting yourself up for a bank run because inherently like there's no way to sort of you know and these aren't very liquid assets it's not you can go to the fed and like borrow against them or sell them easily it's like these are sort of weird bespoke lending agreements and so it's almost as if like you know you raise a few million dollars and you like you know told all the Gemini earn depositors to go on vacation for six months you know when these loans are supposed to expiring to get their loans back like that is almost like an easier solution rather than like trying to get everyone immediate liquidity for a product that just isn't designed to have immediate liquidity yeah I mean that's true but I mean what you're describing is banking and like that's what Genesis is Genesis is a bank right I guess my question is like why did Gemini not sort of fake that into the slas the the idea that like these in you know certain market conditions is not guaranteed you're going to be able to withdraw one-to-one or put some limitations on that or something I guess better on I mean you're right that I guess this is just banking but it's weird to me that that they're not more presented more more clearly up front yeah Gemini is one of the biggest creditors and I think that's Who Genesis is negotiating with right now um because if Gemini pushes them into bankruptcy then it's all going to be a gigantic mess and I think it's pretty clear that's not good for Gemini or for Gemini customers but yeah I I think the answer unfortunately is that that's what banking is and banking is basically the business of duration mismatch and trying to manage that duration mismatch so that it doesn't explode in your face and that's why eventually we invented central banks is because managing those duration mismatches in times of of real of real trial generally requires a bigger stronger Bank to come and save you and you know if you recall that's what we thought CZ was doing when we thought it was still a duration mismatch thing but now we know it's not a duration mismatch thing but that was presumably what the story was about how binance was going to save FTX that was basically a pseudo Central Bank stepping in to help a weaker Bank yeah I mean in all of these cases you know you have entities in the case of FTX it was essentially running out making Venture Investments you know and buying up all these things with FTX customer money in genesis's case it's having like you know longer term assets longer term loans against really short-term Gemini earn customer money that wants to withdraw every time bad things happen in all these cases it's you know investing for the long term with liabilities that can be demanded on a moment's notice yeah it's true and I think look I I agree with you Robert that you know defy shows us a much better way to resolve these problems it's much better to have everything out in the open have smart people thinking about this and not just a management team that's pushed into a corner and has to make up stuff to defend itself we've seen the same behavior basically from FTX as from Genesis which is that they just say whatever they need to to keep deposits on platform and the deposits leave then all of a sudden everybody is uh you know just goes quiet so as a result of this attack which to be clear we're actually not sure whether uh Avi made money from this attack because you know presumably he was shorting it on a centralized exchange so we don't know how the positions ended out we do know the open interest and it was not very high on any yeah I was going to say there was only like 70 mil in like open interest on curve perp so like I think he just like evaporated 40 mil unless he had maybe some you know long exposure but I I don't know if there's like a giga brain move for the for the curved Shore I see so we think most likely lost money do you think someone like that wouldn't be bragging about it if they even broke even that's fair for everyone I think I think specifically he was like building up this short piece he was trying to reach um so Michael the curve founder has like I think a few hundred mil in curve as collateral and so trying to hit his liquidation threshold which was like 25 cents and they hope that that would cause that to sort of you know massive dump and unfortunately got got discovered and and uh squeezed right yeah and then curve released their their white paper for their stable coin a great a great move to have in your utility belt when you need it I I will play my one criticism I mean I that there's maybe some benefits and merits to put in that tape which but it's very under specified but I will say the one one my one criticism is I don't think any defy mechanism needs to use the word adiabatic because it has nothing to do with crypto and that paper has it six times singer yeah so okay so the consequence of this was that obviously there was some bad debt on Ave Ave is going to pay that back and so I think obvious can be fine it's a relatively small amount of debt for Ave as well as for maker and then Ave Paws lending markets for 17 of their tokens uh compound then went and did the same thing which is I think a different set of like 10 times that's the problem is Ave V2 doesn't have uh caps you can't you can't there's no like debt ceilings got it okay so until other V3 arrives for now of his paused The Lending markets for these uh for these tokens um compound instituted these borrow caps and and I think Ave will do the same once they migrate to V3 I think this is a good place to end on because I know uh Turin you've got to stop here but it really speaks to the difference again which we've talked about again and again over the last three weeks between D5 and C5 in any time where you have a lot of Market instability and you have you know credit kind of collapsing and a lot of fear in the markets bad things happen but you can just see how Stark the difference is between what happened in D5 and what happened in in centralized players right Genesis likely going to bankruptcy blockify imploded every single lender in the space has basically died and of course FTX has gone under in absolute disgrace when Ave and compound were facing the same pressure what did they do except everybody shows up puts together their Collective brain power sees exactly what's happening with the exposures and pulls things down uh and on the whole despite the fact there was a coordinated attack that's not even was happening at FDX and FDX they did it to themselves but in this case this was a this was an attacker trying to bring down the platform and the thing performed beautifully it took on only you know a million and a half of Baghdad which was like less than one percent of the debt in the protocol I think like less than half a percent of the debt in the protocol yeah to put in the context the the bad to revenue ratio is still less than uh when I was like looking at the the said numbers relative to that uh I think it ends up being like three or four percent and the average bad debt to life ratio for secure blending below credit grade in the US is like 15 so it's still quite a bit lower in terms of things like that so yeah before we end I actually want to ask a question to each of you which is what is your prediction for the telegram decks telegram announced today that they were going to like they're going to have nfts in the decks and we're this field 2018 right again yeah this is all the way back to the origin isn't this what they were told they weren't allowed to do yeah that's why I'm like I'm like whoa right it was Securities issuance violation then um so they said okay we're not doing telegram open network and then some random people supposedly grab the source code and decided they were going to spin it up and then telegram or you know at least uh durov looked at this and was like oh this is so cool it's actually working we are going to start supporting this blockchain within telegram despite the fact that they had to give the money back to investors that they originally raised which was a massive amount of amount of money so okay my prediction for the uh honestly I haven't been following it super closely I saw the announcement today it seems like ton token has a huge market cap I think it's valued like 2 billion uh circulating 5 billion FTV but very low liquidity there's very little of this thing trading on any venue and I think it's like the biggest exchange it's on is okx and it trades like a couple million a day on okx so I I don't know I have a hard time squaring this but I'm I'm not personally a believer in like the message you're building a DEX in the messenger which to me basically is all those telegram OTC groups that people are trying to sell you coins in telegram was trying to compete with them bad timing but yeah fair enough I A friend of mine sent me a ton token recently because I didn't really sort of believe this like wild story but then I learned that because I have a Us phone number uh I'm actually not allowed to have a telegram wallet so you know if you hated you know region gated exchanges and region gated dexes and read you getting relayers you're gonna love the region gated blockchain um or region gated messenger I guess yeah Fusion locked messenger yeah Robert what's your prediction I can't speculate on this all right what do you think like I said I think their their goal is to like kill the OTC chats that are in television fair enough well we'll have to see what happens um I think this is probably so just as a quick uh caveat uh before we before we wrap up the show normally the show's done every two weeks um we've been doing this weekly basically since uh FTX exploded is because the velocity of news has been so crazy um it seems like now things are finally stabilizing obviously there's there's still after effects and contagion that we've yet to see from FTX but I think the velocity of news is slowing down so we're probably going to be going back to doing the show every two weeks but thank you everybody for tuning in it's been amazing to see how excited you guys are to uh hear from us and and get our our views on what's going on in the space hoping that things calm down a bit thank you everybody and uh you'll hear from us again soon [Music]
