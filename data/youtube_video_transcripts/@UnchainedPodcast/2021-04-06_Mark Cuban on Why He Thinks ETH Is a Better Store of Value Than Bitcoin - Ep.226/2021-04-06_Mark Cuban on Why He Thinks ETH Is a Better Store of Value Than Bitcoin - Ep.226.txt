to optimize fees maximize returns and enable extremely high capital efficiency for liquidity providers today's guest is mark cuban the billionaire investor owner of the dallas mavericks shark tank shark and now crypto and nft investor welcome mark thanks for having me laura so you've said that you believe the odds are that people will use eth as a store of value and not bitcoin can you explain why yeah i didn't say not but i think there's just significant differences between the two um both of them effectively are platforms that enable a lot to happen but bitcoin right now has really evolved to be primarily a store value and it's very difficult to use it for anything else it it you know if you want it's become digital gold where and you can use it as a platform that enables other things but it requires a whole lot more right it requires wrapping or doing a variety of other things and it really be it acts more as collateral a lot collateral than anything else in order for it to gain additional utility um whereas ethereum you know there's just a lot more built-in utility in its organic and native form right just just the ability to use smart contracts organically and natively is just a significant difference right now that's not to say there are layer twos on blockchain i mean on bitcoin that you know create new value and create new opportunities but you really have to work a lot harder on um bitcoin than you do on ethereum and then so for that store value aspect for eve like saying people will use it a lot are you saying simply since they expect they'll use it then they'll just hold on to it more naturally no not necessarily i mean obviously with 1559 everything changes right and what happens going forward is going to really impact how people perceive it specifically as a store of value but because people are using eth to buy nfts to do more things and because smart contracts just makes it a little bit simpler to do development and because we're looking at you know hopefully a shorter term evolution to eth2 and i know we've been a lot of people been saying that for a long time i think you'll see there's more reason to buy eth right now beyond just being a store of value but it doesn't exclude you know being a store of value to buy e if that makes sense yeah yeah and i also was curious because recently the um bitcoin what am i saying paypal has enabled us users to pay with bitcoin ether litecoin and bitcoin cash at merchants and i know that the dallas mavericks did briefly accept bitcoin as payment and i just wondered what your opinion was of this offering it goes back you know actually we started accepting bitcoin 2017 is when we started and you know people have always looked at me as a bitcoin skeptic and let me explain why and so i i mean obviously i've been familiar with bitcoin since it's you know initiation at least my initiation to it you know 2012 or earlier um when i first got involved um with playing around with coinbase and got exposed to it and back then it was really the the narrative around bitcoin was that it was going to be a currency and to me i never saw bitcoin as a currency and if you look back to any conversation i've had about it i've always been really positive about blog i was one of those people that was positive on blockchain saw bitcoin as a store of value but thought it was crazy that people thought it would be a currency because there just wasn't the ability in its network to to handle transactions and it wasn't very simple for grandma to come in or grant body come in and use it easily and so i wanted to see if my thesis was right you know by the time 2017 rolled around and we were able to get um a payment gateway set up so you know my attitude was if people wanted to spend bitcoin as a currency let's see if they'll do it i'll discount babs merchandise and mavs um tickets and nobody did and you know it was more an experiment to see if i was wrong and as it turns out you know bitcoin really is not designed to be a currency and you know there's lots of people that have been talking about the lightning network for years and the changes but as we saw in 2017 you know there's a reason why there's there's a bitcoin cash right there's a reason why there was you know there were a lot of hard feelings in what happened with bitcoin in 2017 and and the underpinning of that was that it was not going to be you know you know traditional bitcoin was not going to be a currency and that's really where you know people had had disagreements with me on my stance but you know here we are in 2021 and now people think you're crazy if you spend your bitcoin you know and if you use it as a currency and and that said you know a little aside just just because um i'm part of the crew and i'm a bitcoin believer as a store of value i'm making an exception and i had already ordered a new tesla um a few months ago and so when that tesla gets ready to get shipped i'm gonna buy some new bitcoin i'm not gonna get rid of any of my existing bitcoin and and use it to buy my tesla yeah that's smart for the capital gains tax reasons right um yeah so one thing that is interesting what you kind of pointed out is that you do have a contrarian view to a lot of bitcoiners and another thing that you said which i found interesting this was on the defiant podcast was that you don't uh see that there will be any correlation between what the federal reserve does and the price of bitcoin and i just wanted to hear why or why not because that is obviously a very different opinion from a lot of people yeah look you know any alternative ask that any asset period that is looking for appreciation has to be sold with narratives has to be a share stock right apple computer used to be a cyclical stock and went up and down with cyclical now it's a gross stock you know you can just make you can look at any um stock any asset from baseball cards to gold in particular and there's got to be a narrative the narrative for gold historically has been a hedge against doomsday a hedge against inflation it's not it never has been you know that's just the narrative that people use and i mean i i've never if you go back to the things i've said over the years and written on block maverick.com i've always thought gold was kind of a joke you know that there was no true intrinsic value other than some you know industrial manufacturing and true gold holds the color better than most metals but no one needs gold jewelry you know it's not like the world can't survive without gold jewelry so you know the narrative that it's precious helps build value and bitcoin kind of is the same way there is no true connection between inflation other than the fact that all assets could go up in price right with inflation and bitcoin could be one of them but so could the cost of a car and so could you know anything else for that matter cost of bananas and and so there's just there's no real proof or tie there but it's a great narrative if the federal reserve keeps on printing money then you need an asset other than the federal reserve that you can hold in order to offset that the inevitable inflation that comes with it great narrative nothing in fact that shows that that that correlation will hold and it's the same with gold you know if it were up to me we'd sell all the gold and fort knox and whether we put it in bitcoin bananas or use that money to pay for people to eat which is my preference you know to provide food for people so they don't go hungry there's no correlation and there won't be other than the natural inflation of all assets okay by the way i do love how you keep talking about bitcoin and bananas because there is a famous video of you saying would rather have bananas or bitcoin people can look that up i actually just want to add or i'll put it in the show notes but i do want to um go back to what you were talking about uh ethereum improvement proposal one five five nine this is the one where the transaction fees will be burned on the ethereum network instead of being sent to the miners and i wondered what you thought that would do for the price of eth and then if you would like project out into the future how that would kind of affect kind of this like bitcoin versus ethereum narrative which is sort of like a weird narrative because they're they're just different things but i was just curious to hear you know who knows exactly i mean i'm not trying to be a prognosticator on pricing or anything like that but if we get to proof of stake when we get to proof of stake you know the the holdback of the impact on the environment will change immediately and that is going to give some people a reason to use ethereum as a store of value over bitcoin right there the fact that with proof of stake you're going to be able to have you know some multiple um significantly higher multiple in transactions per second um that's going to improve the utilization and the opportunities to create on bitcoin you know there the advancements in applications for smart contracts right now you know we see quite a bit of utilization of smart contracts for nfts but those are really just proof of concepts for what can happen in the business world applications like insurance legal documents the list of applications everything that you do using digital right now can there can be a better distributed database decentralized application that can be done on ethereum and so you know i think the the applications leveraging smart contracts and extensions on ethereum will draw bitcoin right so bitcoin will be a store of value but because it has to be done using miners you can't just switch to proof of stake with bitcoin there are there is going to be some hesitancy now that i'm not that doesn't mean i'm going to sell my bitcoin i'm not but at the same time i think let's just say i own a lot more aetherium than i do bitcoins wow um although i did hear that at least the percentage of your portfolio is still uh it's like i think half of it half of what you own in bitcoin in terms of dollars is that right yeah i'm close yeah okay you obviously have known about bitcoin for a while you've been a little bit of a skeptic in terms of its use as a currency so now it seems like you are all in on crypto and d5 and nfts and i just wondered what for you were some of your light bulb moments well you know i like to geek out on new technology whether you know i'm the i'm the guy that you know as a i started i started becoming more aware of ai i'm going on you know aws and doing machine learning tutorials i'm taking youtube classes and coursera classes on creating javascript you know three-layer neural networks just so i can have an understanding because as an entrepreneur and as an investor you know you've got to be able to tell what's real and what's right and and so and have a basic at least a basic understanding if not more and the same thing applied to nfts and you know i was i was i'm always a skeptic by nature until i go in there and find a reason not to be and so i went on mintable.app because i read that it was the cheapest place for a newbie to get in and try to admit things and when i did my first nft as i was going through filling out everything for this little file that i was in this picture i was doing um it showed me royalties and it showed me all these other features that were part of the smart contracts and i was like oh my goodness you mean for the first time ever i can take a digital file and mint it turn it into an nft put it on the blank blockchain and earn royalties post you know earn income post for sale because that never had happened before with any digital file not mp3s not just photos not videos not anything and to me that was just like okay that turned the light bulb on and it was like okay now i got to learn about smart contracts and with smart contracts i did my solidity just like i did with ai did my solidity tutorials and understood you know how the variables worked and what clearly couldn't happen and you know the the different features that were there and weren't there and extensions that carried and didn't all those things and so but it was literally the fact that you could earn royalties and that was a standard um that should be not always is but should be that should carry across all layer two and higher um applications on the blockchain i i just i love this because i mean so for me as a creator the royalties thing also the second i understood that i was like wow like i would love to see it's a game changer yes yeah and i was curious um so obviously you have a huge you know long background in technology and all kinds of things but i also thought well maybe um your perspective as the owner of the dallas mavericks which is a completely different type of industry from the crypto industry or just your experience as a shark on shark tank which obviously takes pictures from a variety of different industries i wondered do you think that that shaped your views in a different way from the typical crypto investor about what will be the truly big things yeah can you talk about that yeah so you got to go back to my early history like after getting fired from a software job when i was 24 i started a company called micro solutions that effectively was a systems integrator and i taught myself to program i was in my 20s and it was just like i spent the next seven years writing software that worked on first loqui networks and wide area networks and then replicated databases and so you know my whole reason for existing as a systems integrator was walking into a company and and allowing them to digitize what they were doing and to turn you know like mark andreessen said software eats the world and so help you know help software eat their businesses and then i sold that took some time off um traded stocks various things and then in late 94 early 95 i got together with a friend that was like how can we use this new thing called the internet to be able to listen to indiana basketball um while we're in dallas and it was like okay well i have a background in databases and networking and programming let me see what we can figure out and literally you know there was nobody streaming at the time and that's how i you know was like okay how do we solve this problem well let's find a solution and we started a company called audionet which was one of the first if not the first streaming companies to really get the thing going and you know obviously um we sold that um years later or five years four what was it five years later to um yahoo but you know then you know i started the first all high definition tv network and you know so my history has always been okay here's something here's new technology how can i apply it to industries and businesses to try to change the game and disrupt them and so i take the same perspective here you know looking at what's happening with layer ones whether it's blockchain i mean whether it's bitcoin um ethereum any of the other blockchain competitors how can you use them to disrupt traditional business and i look at what's happening with nfts as i said earlier just as a proof of concept it's like okay if we can do this with art and music pictures and and some video then where else could we apply them to really change industry so let's uh now talk about d5 you've talked about the difficulties in the user experience for people to use d5 what do you see as the main user experience problems that need to be resolved and then once those are resolved what do you think our future will look like trust trust is the biggest problem right because there's an inherent conflict you know d5 decentralized and historically when we've dealt with our money and our finances we've gone to people that we trust and when you look we've always been taught that it looks too good to be true it probably is and there's a lot of that in defy right now where there are a lot of places where you can you know year of farm and pool and you know get apy that looks really really really good until you really start to dig in and analyze the risk and it's not that that some can't make you a lot of money if you're careful and and really do the homework they can there's there's a lot of good companies but there's there's a lot of ponzi schemes and a lot of rug pullers out there that that really make it really difficult for newbies and people who don't have the time to invest to really do the homework to make it work and what would you advise people like that who are interested in getting into d5 that they should do in order to you know not become the victims of scams like that you just got to do your homework right i mean you can't get caught up in what you see on social media you know particularly for defy you've got to look at you know i i tell people to look at you know ave's compounds you know places that have been around for a while that have a history that you can look at because there's trust there because even in a decentralized um environment you you've got to find organizations that you can trust you've got to find um communities i guess is a better way than organization communities that you can trust because even with the dows out there you know if somebody you know if you don't understand the dial of a particular defy environment a big holder can take things in a direction completely opposite to what you expected or what you had hoped for when when you got involved with something and so you know and then there's something new popping up every single day this dex that decks you know and then there's there's different block chains this is on polka dot this is on near this is automatic you know this is on on crypto this is on this this is on that and you know as all these places search for liquidities and lp liquidity providers in order to be able to have some balance in for their exchanges that's confusing and you also see scenarios where you know as people stay there's a lot of money out there but there's not unlimited money amount of money to be able to you know lock into all these different platforms and so it's just really really confusing unless you really put in the time to know exactly what you're doing or work with people that that you can trust and and the other thing i say to people is you know the reason why it's worth putting the money in even if you build in you know a 30 loss right you know it's not when i say loss it's not that there's a rug pull but you know maybe the price that you expected with the api by the time you tried to liquidate the tokens that you were given you know the prices dropped significantly um and you weren't able to get there you know and that's the big thing and then finally the third thing i tell them is a lot of a lot of small players can't afford to do d5 because of the expenses the the gas fees that are involved and so yeah and other um on other chains there are different opportunities that don't have the gas fees but even so there's always going to be a cost somewhere none of this is for free and so you've got to be able to scale at some level or at least commit for a long long time and smaller smaller users particularly smaller new users may not have that financial flexibility and so you know particularly on ethereum-based stuff you see a ton of people that you talk to that you know they put up 500 and by the time they go to hit the you know the confirmed and they look to see that their gas fees you know are going to eat up anything they could possibly earn unless they stay in it for 17 years you know it it becomes a shock for them so you really have to do your homework so once all these issues are resolved and the transaction fees are lowered and scaling um you know is is uh resolved what do you think will happen to the banking system uh well do you imagine just everybody will start keeping their savings and yield framing tokens and giving themselves their own loans on their own crypto assets via smart contracts and yeah that's a great question it i don't know yet right it really depends on how nimble and agile the the incumbents are the legacy banks are i mean they're not stupid right but they do have a vested interest in keeping things the same way and again it's going to come down to who do people trust people who are in the crypto community don't trust banks at all but the other 95 of the country in the us at least they do trust banks and you know there's there's um federal deposit insurance there as a a backstop that increases that trust and so it really is going to come down to where the trust points are i mean in in trying to advise some of the the organizations that the communities that i've worked with excuse me i think partnering with a bank to teach them defy is going to be what happens quite a bit because a lot of the dexa is you know they've got a ton of money they're crushing it right now and they're making money hand over foot and and so i what i've advised them is go work with the bank and teach those bank tellers that we've all grown up trusting right you grew up in youngstown i grew up in pittsburgh and we all had our first bank account where we went in and maybe we're 15 maybe we're 21. i mean now the kyc rules are made a little bit more difficult but you know going in and seeing a bank teller or someone sitting at a desk in a bank location in a bank outlet and sitting and walking through all these things because we trust them and you know yeah that's just part of a narrative i'm not saying it's necessarily better if it's not but going to places that were where we already trust that have fdic behind them i think that is going to be um a most likely as it stands right now you know part of the challenge for d5 for newbies is that there's no barriers to entry for d5 and it's just like 1995 with the internet where everybody with the url popped up and had a new you know internet website business you know and people were investing in them left and right hoping that you know whether it was a private or public company the value of their investment just skyrocketed because they saw it happening all around them and there's a lot of that going on where everybody's got a scheme built around d5 and we've got to be able to get to some folks that are the winners that we trust so that people who don't fully understand it can do it and and once we get there the the technical stuff will take care of itself but we once we get there then you'll start seeing the change and then you'll start seeing you know new structured products where people can say okay i'm not going to yield farm but i'm going to make you know the 10 the the yield on the 10-year treasury is 1.75 and what they're paying for um traditional savings is 0.02 or 0.2 let's say since interest rates are up a little bit and i can make four percent in a trusted manner i think that's where it'll really take off and i know that's not crypto ethos right it's not you know and it's not as wild wild west but most people don't like the wild wild west with their money right now much of d5 works on over collateralization how do you think that affects the market and what do you think will happen as d5 moves away from that i think it's great actually i think i think it's a challenge if it starts to move away from um over collateralization at least in the next couple years because over collateralization particularly with the the volatility of pricing for um the assets that are being used is a protection point that makes it safe and trustable that's what makes a smart contract work because if there's not over collateralization in a volatile um with a volatile asset backing it then how's the smart contract going to work you know what's it going to take in in the event that whatever it is you know that loan that you took um for you know 50 of your assets you know what happens if those start to collapse right because there's a bad market turn then people lose trust in it so i think over collateralization is good i think the fact that people are trying to use real world assets irl assets to collateralize them to extend defy i think is challenging for and it will be for a long time because legally it's going to be very difficult to assign all the legal rights you need to take control of a building you know or a piece of artwork a physical piece of artwork or whatever it may be out of a smart contract it's you know i don't see someone you know all of a sudden the deed to a home being conveyed out of a smart contract because um the price of the home dropped like it did in 2006 let's say or whenever 2010 rather so that that's going to be a challenge you've talked about how things like insurance claims could have decentralized validators to determine whether or not a claim is legitimate or you've talked about how financial scandals like enron could have been prevented with decentralized networks of accountants validating general ledger entries and i wonder since these examples require access to private data how would that work would that be using like a private blockchain or is that using zero knowledge proofs or or were you just spitballing or no no no no i mean look you know you start with simple applications so i forget the name of this company but effectively they're selling insurance for real world right and so what they they use oracles that have precipitation and temperature for a specific zip code because that weather is available as an article through the national weather service or conveyed from the national weather service data and so it's it's not inconceivable that the dallas mavericks could say you know what if temperature drops to below zero fahrenheit and there's more than two inches of precipitation which means it's snowing and it's awful cold then there's a good chance that people aren't going to be able to come to a dallas mavericks game so i'm going to buy insurance that i know the smart contract to convey so you know i work it out with the insurance company we memorialize it to a smart contract that it cost me a thousand dollars and i get paid ten thousand dollars if this unlikely event happens and it's been triggered immediately you know once the um the oracle is refreshed and shows that these data thresholds have been met that's a great application now in terms of extending that to validators yes you got to deal with very um personal information but you can break up that data so it's impossible to know who the person is right so it does doesn't need to know laura or mark or you know jeff or brian or jake or alexis right it could be privacy through security through obscurity if you will it's just looking to say okay here's the claim for tonsillitis and this is what it shows on the insurance claim and this is the information that is available from the insurance smart contract saying you know here are the here are the codes here are the um hospital diagnosis codes that are in play and well i guess todd slice is a bad example let's say broken broken arm thought slice would be a dentist but but you get my point right so you would just be able to have it you know you wouldn't have any personal information first of all it would just be somebody with a broken arm it doesn't fit the the requirements of the smart contract and boom then you then you know you have x number of validators who have to agree um it's kind of like what optimism does right so optimism in the way they approach it isn't the the the kp side of it or zp or is it zp zero zero yeah but with optimism what they do is they they have enough validators and they look for the fraud right so if everybody is going through and looking to validate and then there's also people looking to see if all of any of the validators were fraudulent or however exactly they do it then you can do these types of things and now all of a sudden instead of having an insurance company who's making centralized decisions with their only real goal to maximize earnings as opposed to optimize health um and just follow the rules that they agreed to now all of a sudden with this distributed validators you can do it quickly and automatically effectively and you're going to have a lot happier customers and a lot better healthcare system great so in a moment we're going to talk about nfts but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible kyber's dynamic market maker dmm is a game changer in defy being the first protocol designed to react to market conditions to optimize fees while providing

code laura laura the link is in the description back to my conversation with mark cuban so before we get into nfts i just wanted to ask one other thing that's kind of related to d5 and the other issues we were talking about with banking and on the bankless podcast podcast you said quote usdc issued by the treasury makes perfect sense and i wondered did you mean like an actual central bank digital currency issued by the fed or are you in favor as former cftc chairman christopher giancarlo is of many private usd stable coins such as usdc that compete with each other well it really depends on how yes i'm for um a central bank coin digital coin cbdc but it really depends on the implementation right the devil's in the details and so you know if it's a typical government um product there's going to be holes and needs and problems with it and that's where the private and private sector will fill in um and so jeremy o'leary can do his thing with circle and usdc and as asking others um but the reality is it makes too much sense now to not have cbdc it really you know and one of the points i've been making is we lose money on every penny nickel diamond quarter that we manufacture you know and that that turns out to be hundreds of millions of dollars per year and you could spend you'd have to invest a little bit more up front but by by transitioning to to a gbdc you know there's so many things we can do that would make life better for our citizens you know we look at the stimulus program and there are a lot of people that don't have direct deposit into a bank account right every single citizen you know legal resident of this country should be required to have you know some form of digital account whether it's for fiat and or digital currency and in the event we need stimulus again and it'll happen again at some point now just trans transmitting uh you know gbdc to people and it's fiat you know effectively that's a good thing for the country it allows us to be a lot more agile and deal with problems that we run into then of course there's the reduction of friction just in terms of the banking system itself and being able to to move money around um in ways you know that are far easier as we get money to banks now that doesn't mean usdc and other stable coins can't do their thing right because they're going to find better ways to implement themselves and to connect with all the applications that are out there um and that doesn't mean look you know this is this is a very darwinian business and what the government does what the fed does will be probably 50 of what everybody wants it to do or suggest it should do and the market will fill in the rest and new applications you know as technology evolves who knows what quantum computing is going to do to all of this right you know we could be talking a post-crypto world 50 years from now or a hundred years from now who knows now i won't be talking about it you won't be but somebody's going to be talking about it a hundred years from now and and so you you have to start thinking in terms of you know that far into the future and so yeah there's great applications here the entrepreneurs will fill in the rest but you know you still have to always realize there's going to be something different that we don't envision that pops up yeah in a way i actually think the the central bank will be forced to innovate here because if d5 really does take off and people are holding their savings in these crypto assets then they'll need to be offering something to motivate people to hold on to their us dollars um all right so let's switch to nfts which are all the range right now that's interesting let's go back that's interesting so you think that if people are given a gbdc um cbdc oh cbdc right yeah cbd gbtc is the grayscale they're quite dry very similar yeah but you think that because well a cbdc won't necessarily be global right so because every sovereign nation is going to try to do something on their own but since we're the reserve currency you're gonna you think that the u.s federal reserve will have to compete in order to get people to use the cbdc that they issue as opposed to other stable coins or other cryptocurrencies um well it was more than i was just thinking you know like when i've talked to people about d5 just my normal friends like not not crypto people um and then they kind of poke around and then you know they'll be like oh you can earn that like they're kind of amazed by the interest right right and then i can see that light bulb moment for them and they're a little bit like these are people who otherwise have zero interest in this kind of thing and so then i could see oh they're kind of like hmm that's interesting maybe i should like put a little bit and then you know and so i just realized like oh it once things like the ease of using a crypto wallet and whatever all that gets resolved i could see a lot of people being motivated to once they believe that that the software works and they trust it to just move a lot of their money and remember see the thing about that that though is nobody gives something away for free right there's there's nobody reaching into their pocket in d5 saying you know what i want less you take four there you know right now just the the ecosystem of defy is such that as these new businesses pop up and effectively that's what they are they have to pay to to get the liquidity in order to be able to run their business but you know effectively what they do is they just push the risk further and further out gary gensler the guy who's going to be running the sec used to run the um the federal what is it the um cftc and um and he said one thing that's always stuck with me the risk doesn't leave the system and that's true for crypto as well what the new d5 protocols do and new offerings do they just move the risk to a different token or a different liquidity provider right so they're saying to a they're saying to an lp that you know they say right up front there's a chance you're going to lose what what you've staked here there's a chance that you're going to lose it and i'm using your money in order to be able to go get more of the liquidity and to get that i'm going to be paying out in my tokens that we've created and that you purchased and so if they're not able to turn it into a really a stable business you know hence you know stable coins but if they're not able to turn it into a stable business so their tokens retain their value somebody's going to lose and and that's part of the challenge you've got you know so in a lot of cases deep i is still a game of musical chairs and that's why i said earlier you have to be careful because it's not until somebody's got to create something in order for there to be a sustained return that brings new money new validated money into the system right and you're starting to see that with a lot of the business applications right i mean that's where polka dot is pretty cool right because polka dots really design for unique applications on people who want to um modify the blockchain to their specific vertical need right and and so you know that's where you you create productivity if you are going to you know whether it's ethereum you know matic you know is used for a lot of nft stuff if you're going to create new applications that create productivity over you know fintech applications so you know old banking then came fintech now there's open banking and now there's d5 banking right and they all compete and when d5 banking does a better job or um crypto with blockchain applications does a better job than fintech or traditional digital applications like a docusign as an example in our airbnb and on their software you know if crypto eats the software that was eating the world then d5 can really perform because those software applications that are being used in applications on blockchain that um are creating new productivity then those tokens will create value and get more valuable right if they don't if it's just purely a d5 play where it's like look i want your money i think i can get enough people trading money you know and making money using these trades it works until it doesn't and so i don't think anybody disagrees that a lot of these you know a significant percentage of these deep fly d5 plays are going to go out of business right it's the ones that actually have a foundation and offer some productivity over what was done before so you see it like i invested in injective protocol and there are distributed decks that uses order books as opposed to being an amm and that's a productivity enhancement where you can trade with perps a lot better than you could trade the way things are done now and if they're able to become a better place to trade the equivalent of stocks then everything their token will be worth more because they're creating value that is more value than the the incumbents are creating if that all makes sense yeah i mean i think what's interesting is like in a way i think what you're describing in terms of whether or not these things are sustainable is that model that has come from startups where um a lot of the early growth is subsidized and but what's so interesting here is that because these are decentralized networks and there isn't um yeah when you throw in the governance then then so actually but that's a question for you because you know obviously with your experience with all these different startups you've done and then uh obviously working with shark tank and investing in those when you think about this new decentralized model how are you evaluating whether or not you think something will be successful and how is that different from what you've done so far that's a great question and by the way shark takes on friday nights on abc but you know it's really really interesting because you talked about the the subsidy model that is kind of like the silicon valley weight raise a whole lot of money and subsidize the product and then make it up some other way you know you know create a sticky product that everybody has to have you know lose a lot of money on it um and then eventually you'll make money on it i've never been a big fan of that you know and and so if you watch me on shark tank you know i don't mind losing money at the beginning if you have a direct path to profitability but i'm never a fan of okay let's just get a ton of customers and we'll figure out how to make money later that that's that's never good even in the infancy of an industry um you've got to know exactly how you're going to get there so when it comes to doubts and how to deal with um governance you know it really depends on the particulars because and the type of applications that are in place because some some forms of governance are just based on who has the most tokens right and at that point in time everything can get bastardized you know you look at some of these uh what's the best way these worlds right the you know these unique worlds and the games that are part of them right now those have been around a long long time and historically what's happened is that the people who are the most active users end up gaining the most control and and massaging it to look the way that they want it and that's a challenge for all of them like you know i'm excited about actually infinity i think it's really really cool um but it's really really cool because you know there's there's a variety of different options with the governance and they're able to sell sponsorships and advertising and bring in external money so they're not only dependent on the players and because they bring in external money that means there's ways to for you know really players who don't have any money at all to start participating and actually make a little bit of an income no matter where they are in the world but the key to that all working is bringing in external money like that it's kind of like what fortnite does with v bucks right and and other games you know with the the the currencies that they create that have no place no value outside of the game well with this you know it changes it so with the tokens it has value outside the game but in terms of governance you have to be really really careful that the dominant users don't dominate governance because they're all going to conform it it's just like a shareholder owning 51 percent or owning you know controlling a board or having enough of a stake of a a company that has a lot of shareholders and not a lot of big shareholders and really you know influencing all the outcomes it's really really hard to manage over time and we don't have a long enough history to understand it so it's something that i try to be very careful about and understand completely when i get involved because just as as positive as decentralization can be versus centralized corporations and communities it can have a completely different impact where the loudest voices can change things so that the smallest players you know it's like we see in politics politics are politics right and people strive for power and power corrupts an absolute power corrupts absolutely and distributed governance isn't necessarily different because most people don't participate so it sounds like what you're saying is you feel like dows won't really be effective or solve these issues until we have blockchain based identities to prevent civil attacks well it's not even just that right um just lack of participation you know some people play the game because they like the game right some people you know get involved with the token because they just want to make money and they don't want to you know they got their real lives to deal with they don't want to be involved with you know trying to determine what to add or what not to add you know should the decks you know distribute index add this token or not add this token right so you know it's not if that's your token why won't you try to go in there and influence all the people to vote to add you you know because there's so much money at stake and so there's there's a lot of the nuanced elements of governance that traditional real-life politics um have that apply here as well because just like most people don't vote in elections in the real world most people don't use their governance tokens um in crypto communities yeah well and then but do you think delegated proof of stake or or any kind of like liquid model where you can delegate your votes do you think that resolves it or no is that still no because most people so think about your friends right that you just want to make their four percent eight percent twelve percent whatever it is and they don't care which tokens they add and they don't wanna know they don't understand because they got a job to go to you know and you know that they got their vaccine and they wanna go out and have fun and last thing what they wanna do is stay back in and read about the governance requirements of the tokens they just bought to make some money um true i i from your comments i definitely feel like yes you you understand normal people probably better than the average crypto person all right so let's let's talk about nfts um so what is your thesis when it comes to your nft investments what characteristics do you believe will separate the winners from the also brands and you can even talk about you know why you chose to invest in municipal and super rare open sea et cetera as opposed to some of the other platforms so a couple things there in terms of what nfts i buy i buy the things that i like to look at right you know so if i go through if i'm on mintable i love to go on mental boulder gaslist store because you know with and the reason i invested in miniature bull.app is i went there first because it's where you can mint things for free and it until you sell it there's no gas fees right and so it goes right into mintable's gas less store and they have it so that you can go through thousands and thousands of of nfts there and if you know because it's not right on the blockchain it's not showing up across all the different platforms and so that's where i love to buy things because i there's things i go in there and i think they're just stunning and you know they may only charge you know the equivalent of twenty five dollars you know and the gas fee might be a hundred dollars you know once it gets rid of the ethereum but at the same time it would have cost me a whole lot more than 125 dollars to buy it on openc or on you know any of the other marketplaces because that have already been where they've already been written to the ethereum blockchain um and you know mental uses zilco as well so there's some things there and just like um open c's using matic and others are using matic and others you know so i like to go there as well because the fees are are very low so you know so my my orientation is let's go find things i like because you know you know obviously maybe you know we i started this thing called lazy.com and and i have it all in my social bios now and i put it i'll tweet about it and send it around and so i want things that i pinned to the top of there that look really cool and represent me because that's my own personal gallery and so you know my my i collect as opposed to speculate and they're just so there's so much so so so much talent out there that is looking for a home that i kind of look try to look places where other people are not so lazy.com for people who don't know it is literally just a website that displays um the the person who you know their url uh all their nfts um but actually so when i asked about your nft investments i meant like in the platforms like which oh okay i'm sorry yeah i'm sorry i just wanted to get you i just wanted to get the the little plug in there for um lazy.com yeah which is a great site by the way i do think it's a very clean design so yeah i appreciate it and you built that yourself yeah well i had a programmer do it i outlined it and i i laid it out and everything and i didn't have time to decode it myself so i had one of our guys um coded but yeah it was all my design it looks great yeah it's crazy because we've only been around 10 days today and we had as of yesterday 120 000 users so it's crazy um and so anyways in terms of investing so i invested in mental um dot app for the reason i just said right there there are a lot of undiscovered artists on there that are putting up their work because it's the one place where you can go in there and mint something for free and it doesn't cost anything until you actually sell it and it's your way to then you know show off and learn and really have a chance to sell with no cost so i like that and their traffic is just exploding um i invested in open c because openc you know i looked at it initially as a marketplace but they're really the api for all marketplaces they're kind of the the be all end-all behind the scenes that makes everything work you know at lazy if you click through if you go to lazy.com mark cuban there's a couple things that i have that i put for sale and when you click through um it takes you to openc and that's because we use you know it's not an oracle it's an api that allows someone to buy and it's all managed and handled by open c so i like the fact that they're behind the scenes for all of that um i invested in super air because they get great products they get you know really great high-end and super rare nfts that are out there i invested in nifties um because they're trying to create a social network and there's some others that are working on social networking but i think they've got a really great team to put it all together um i invested in espresso um he's if you go to mark cuban.com and you'll see there's a blockchain blockchain link and you can see all the blockchain companies related companies i invested but espresso dot and with two z's instead of two s's um dot io it's kind of like an if this then that if you're familiar with that product where it just continuously reads the blockchain and allows you to set triggers that send you um reports or initiate different actions which you know for somebody who's trying to invest or somebody who's trying to understand markets and track them it's a great tool and there's a couple others that are going to be closing very shortly and so but like when when the nft revolution fully plays out like what do you think will determine which you know platforms or or other who the winners are the winners so first i think there's going to be a fair amount of winners because you know you're going to see a lot of this verticalize where they'll they'll each have their own area of expertise but i think probably within the next three five years you're gonna see a huge consolidation where there's somebody who was on the outside looking in um or somebody who got bigger that we didn't expect to get big and they buy up the others to get you know their nft base and get their their customers etc you know you see what um dapper is doing and it's interesting because dapper and actually all the competitive blockchains because it's kind of like a death war with blockchains right you know who's going to survive you know flow near wax who else you know crypto.com i mean there's just so many medic etc etc etc you know it's hard to say that all of them are going to be you know equal size and equal have equal levels of success but they're all doing fairly well right now and and because it doesn't take a lot of overhead to manage these um they're all for the most part making money and i think because of that they're in kind of a death war right now they're all starting to spend a lot to get really high-profile people and high-profile nfts on their platforms in order to be oh and i left one out bitcoin origin um jeremy bourne those guys are incredible too so if you go on wax and you look at bitcoin origin they they're an investment because they're great storytellers i don't want to leave them out to be really pissed at me but you see my point that um all i thought in the early days of the internet as well there's some businesses like blockchains that are zero-sum games you don't you know the minute that ethereum gets the 2.0 if they can handle and i'm just making a hundred thousand transactions per second then you have to ask what happens to binance and near and some of these other things when there's every reason to just start building layer two on top of on top of ethereum 2.0 now there's a lot of people don't think that that can happen but to go back to my original point all those blockchains are spending a lot of money to to really get people to use their blockchains and they're using nfts as an entry point by really trying to bring in the highest profile celebrities and creators and artists musicians etc to use their platform and to get people to to buy and sell nfts there and that they're not all going to win and that'll lead to consolidation that'll lead to some people you know going out of business and in a few years um i think ethereum and maybe two or three other blockchains will have their place and those will be the winners and then let's talk about the nfts themselves which as earlier we discussed can be built with their own little business models built right in where the creator can specify what their cut would be for any resales i've heard you um mention things like 30 50 i saw for one of your nfts your royalties would be 15 euler beats does 8 to the original lp owner what you know do you think will ultimately be the optimal kind of like business model for that or and are there any other metrics or parameters that need to be figured out to you know really it really depends on it really depends on the product itself so like a maverick season a mavericks ticket to a game right we don't want we want the people who bought the ticket to go to the game we there's there's no real great value to us to have resale you know we want fans coming in that are really excited and that are mavs fans we don't want them to sell to the fans of the opposing team you know and what happens a lot is and this happens to every team a mavs fan will buy a season ticket but they'll talk to a golden state warrior fan and say you know what you know this is a really in-demand game i'm going to sell it at a huge premium and what ends up happening is that golden state warrior fan comes to a game and cheers for the warriors right and so we don't want that to happen so for the resale market it wouldn't be inconceivable that for our highest demand gains we ask for 75 of the resale because that will you know distance people from reselling and if they decide they just want to make that 25 great we'll take our 75 and the low demand games then we might only take 10 because you know what there's not a lot of fans of this particular team and we just want people to come to the game and so we'll use a different algorithm to determine um what our royalty is going to be and it really you know and for a concert it really doesn't matter who shows up and so you know but it's going to be a fan so if it's a high demand concert you might ask for 50 because you don't want that you know you want fans buying it and by definition it's probably only going to be a fan and you want them showing up and you don't want the resellers to get in involved in it either and this applies to mavs as well because there's you know there's a whole secondary market business where brokers come in try to buy up all the tickets and then resell them and make a markup from the retail to what the supply and demand that's the the pricing at and so i can see for a concert at the american airlines center in partnership with live nation or aeg or whoever we set the the royalty at 75 percent with half of that going to the artist and half that going to us depending on whatever we can actually set because we don't want brokers to act as intermediaries we want fans to get access to the tickets yeah i i now understand better because i was you know as a creator myself who keeps looking at the nft space wondering how i'm going to take advantage of this i was like well what would i set the royalties at so it really it really depends so like you know look at um eclipse centers i got them spacey yeah yeah yeah so like cliff notes right you buy them for your class or a textbook right you buy it for your class and then you don't need them anymore it's perishable and so if you're the publisher of cliff notes or you create your own you know you're you're an entrepreneurial kid and you create your own cliff notes for your class and the class stays the same for year to year to year for the most part you know you you want to set the royalties relatively low because you want people to be able to sell it over and over again and that creates a perpetual royalty stream so if laura is doing a guide to crypto and it's an introductory guide video guide to crypto and you know that once somebody watches it the first time you know they're not going to need to watch it two or three times and there's no really reason for them to keep it forever right um and if it's just a traditional youtube video they would just watch it and go on and you would try to sell them ads well you yank it off of youtube you put it on your own nft tube right and you sell it for 4.95 or 2.95 on a you know a low transaction fee blockchain and then you can take your 10 royalty and if you're making 50 cents each you know because it you know because you know mark bought it and mark's got three friends that you know he really should think should watch this and i sent him an email because i posted it on lazy.com and there's an easy way to send it to my friends to buy it and they buy it and then their friends do the same thing and it has its own little viral impact you know perishable content like that perishable meaning that you know you just need to watch it or read it once or twice and then you don't have any need for it those types of things will have low royalties but if you get the right marketing angle can be sold again and again and again yeah i love how you describe how really unsexy industries can be transformed by um nfts and i just wondered are there any others that you kind of have your eye on that you think would be yeah i mean you know things like docusi yeah docusign i mentioned right you know so anything documentation driven where it's driven by if this than that rules you know anything that you can boil down to a very simple if this than that you can put in a smart contract and if you can put it in a smart contract you can destabilize the the incumbents you know and make it a lot easier when you say if this in that can you give an example i'm not sure what you're saying well using like the example for the insurance that i did before or no or better yet um you know a ticket if the event's over then you you know there's no additional features that are made available if the event hasn't happened yet then you might get access to a pic you know an nft that's um minted during a mavs game right and so you could so you know i could put i can have an oracle that shows the time right and so let's just say that you know you buy a ticket to a game and part of the unlock thing that happens um there's content or features that are unlocked the minute the game starts so we have an oracle that we read that shows that this dallas mavericks game is played and started and you have this nft in your wallet and we're able to say okay here's the highlights from the first quarter of the mavs game and we meant them and send them to all the wallets that have that are at the game and then now all of a sudden you've got these additional nfts that you can keep or sell or do whatever you want with and then once the game is over if the game is over then we stop sending it to you and now you have these things in the wallet and now we might make it a different type of collectible where we send you just one single nft that shows the score of the game you know um a box score of the game whatever it may be that's minted as a memorial collectible that you're able to keep herself from there i love it um you also talked about fireside chats which is like a clubhouse chat that's turned into an nft installed for five to ten bucks and it just made me think that how much like how much demand do you expect there would be for such things because in the end then wouldn't people end up with a lot of basically kind of worthless nfts lying around or is that just what you think the future will look like no it's like how many books how many how many mp3 files do you have on your phone right or how did you used to have right before streaming right how many how many pictures do you have on your phone look one of the worst days in a person's life sometimes is having to figure out what to delete from the phone because they ran out of storage you know the point being that we value digital things a lot more than we realize right now how many books do you have in your bookcase right one of the reasons you know some of us like to read physical books but i've become more of a kindle type person you know and and maybe there's a way to attack amazon by making because you can re you can buy and resell your books on amazon but it's very centralized kindle books um kindle files for resale are available but it's very centralized there's no reason that an author so if you're self-published and you want to put your book out there and you can do it as an nft and allowed for resale etc there's no limit right particularly if it if it's just you know an nft that you have in a wallet and you can have an unlimited number of wallets and you have a wallet for books you have a wallet for pictures you have a wallet for music you have a wallet for tickets you have a wallet for business applications you have a wallet for textbooks you have a wallet for whatever that comes along right family mementos right special dates in my life whatever it may be and you just create a unique wallet for each one so there's there's no place where it seems cluttered and as long as ipfs and the different um storage hubs for this all you know sustain themselves then it doesn't take a lot of space and even if it moves to the point where there are blockchains that specialize um like um the the zero knowledge the zk type stuff where it's just one single file stuff size um and i don't know how much media they can store there but where it's just all compressed to significantly kind of like zip for blockchain then all of a sudden that makes it even safer and makes it even more sustainable um if you have that choice either to store it locally or store it remotely and you've talked about how community is everything for businesses or you know for anything to succeed and yet in the bank list podcast it seemed that you were cautioning celebrities or athletes or creators from doing social tokens around themselves and i wondered why yeah because it's all about expectations because your community is important to you the last thing you want to do as a celebrity or somebody with the following is to create an expectation that with my token you can make money and then not deliver so i don't want a mark cuban token that one day is worth a thousand dollars and the next day is worth a penny because then my brand effectively is telling me that i'm worth you know the community is telling me my brand is worth a penny and i don't know what external forces have caused that to happen and you know it could well be that you know somebody bought a bunch and they just sold it all and just because they don't like me there's just so many things that can happen when these are treated as asset classes now if there's no value to it and you say they can't be traded and it's just a verification token that's different all right so um last question you've talked a lot about how the internet revolution had to do with physical developments like laying down fiber and now that that infrastructure is built i wondered how you imagine that that will change the development of crypto will just be much faster or you know how do you think that will affect crypto really isn't limited by speed you know the early days of the internet bandwidth was everything you know trying to stream when we first got started you know and it's an interesting comparison in terms of complexity when we started streaming at audio net you had to have a pc you know there was no you know maybe a laptop the laptops were enormous you had to have a 56k modem you had to have a tcp client you had to have a dial into your internet provider you had to have um a media player and then you had to go to the website we had it which had its own level of complexity in order for the other side to work and so those comparable level complexities exist now but we had the inhibitor of bandwidth i couldn't show you a movie you know on a full screen unless you had multiple megabits of bandwidth with hardly anybody had even incorporations now there's not really a bandwidth limiter there's not a processing speed limiter there's only a performance limiter limiter or delimiter on the side of the provider or the blockchain itself so i don't think technology is an issue until we get to quantum then you have to start thinking about you know what can be hacked and that that's not a question for today but that's a question for the future all right well this has been super fun where can people learn more about you and your work um you can go to markcuban.com you can see all the companies that i've invested in including all the blockchain stuff you can see my nft collection at lazy.com mcuben and you can hear me this on on shark tank friday nights on abc i'll be the one talking about blockchain and all this kind of stuff and asking companies what what their crypto solutions are going to be all right well thank you so much for coming on unchained thank you laura it's great great interview thank you thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about mark check out the show notes for this episode unshaded is produced by me laura shin with all from anthony yoon daniel ness and mark murdock thanks for listening you
