eight eighth are claimed in the deposit contract we will unpack what that means in a moment here to discuss are ryan watkins and wilson with him both senior research analysts at missouri welcome ryan and wilson hey laura thanks for having us on hi laura yeah i'm very excited to talk about this topic um yeah so thanks for having us on let's just start with a real basic question what is ethereum 2.0 yeah so uh i think ethereum 2.0 is a couple things uh most importantly for ethereum it's a kind of its most ambitious upgrade that's been seven years in the making that will scale ethereum so that it can actually serve as a globally scalable financial infrastructure and then two it would also make it more secure and then as well they will also transform about eath as an asset that's kind of like the the big picture of the use of what theorem 2.0 brings to ethereum and what problems does ethereum hope to resolve with this upgrade yeah so uh as far as like ethereum the the blockchain it's really um a couple of things and i'll divide this into uh proof of stake and then starting which are kind of the two major components of ethereum 2.0 and with proof of stake uh it's trying to solve three things uh one is uh making ethereum more secure two is ridding it of centralization risk from miners and then uh three is making sure that uh participation in the consensus process is as accessible to users as as possible um so that's that's for a proof mistake and then for my sharding that's the uh scaling solution for ethereum and basically what that entails is uh it's like splitting up the ethereum blockchain into subsets called shards and running them in parallel and the reason why you do this is because you want to keep the requirements to run a node as low as possible so that there's not a excessive burden on people who run these nodes and it is actually accessible to people uh with you know basically just like consumer hardware um and the reason why you do that is because it ensures that you can get the scalability while maintaining that core property of being decentralized yeah and i i think i'll add to that as what we've seen since ethereum launched is that it's run into a couple issues along the line um specifically during 2017 during the ico craze and then most recently uh this past summer when uh when the various d5 liquidity mining programs were up and running that under its current architecture it can get under a significant amount of load and that tends to delay transactions and also increase the transaction costs so it was recognized ethereum 2.0 was uh ethereum developers and researchers recognizing that under ethereum's current architecture that i couldn't scale to meet these um characteristics that they were truly desiring out of the platform so we're gonna dive into each of these in greater depth throughout the episode but let's do first a quick overview of the different phases of ethereum 2.0 can you name them and describe what happens in each of course yeah happy to so the first phase is the one that is eminent uh the one where users can actually start staking is called phase zero and that simply is the launch of something called the beacon chain and the beacon chain is basically your central core layer of this new network so it's separate from the existing network and uh it will be this coordination layer that gets p allows people to stake it coordinates all the different validators or stakers on on the platform and then it acts as the coordination layer for all the additional upgrades that will be added later on so all the additional shards uh it will serve as a reference point to all of those so we can actually connect information between all those other chains that eventually get added later on um the second phase phase one a little bit of a longer timeline so i think some of the early estimates are maybe late 2021 uh that will add the scalability component so phase zero nothing much more than staking and reaching consensus the phase one will be adding all these different chart layers and that will be the base scalability component um for ethereum 2.0 and um so really phase one is just kind of reaching consensus up with a whole lot of different things so you're reaching consensus not only on the beacon chain but also incorporating all those other shard chains so how do you reference the uh the block data that gets added to the entire network across all these across 65 different chains the third phase is called phase 1.5 uh and that is actually the merge of the existing network with the new network ethereum 2.0 and really it's just a simple swap of the proof-of-work consensus layer that ethereum uses right now over to the proof of stake layer that's on at the end 2.0 so how it's going to look like to um most users and applications i it's it's not going to change a whole lot it's supposed to be pretty seamless uh but a lot of it is just going to be the underlying layer where it just kind of switches over and all the blocks are being created through proof of stake instead of by miners um and then the final phase the big one is uh like phase two and that will be when you're adding execution to these different charts so during fit the first three phases they actually will not have smart contracts execution ability uh they won't have smart contract execution ability so you won't be able to actually port smart contracts onto these individual shards but there is a bit of a caveat to this whole process and it's that um you might be able to start using some of these shards for scalability means before phase two and so there is a possibility that you can get the scalability gains without having to uh add smart contract execution ability to every single one of these shards so there is a route as we're going down this road map for east 2.0 where phase two may not necessarily it may not be necessary um so even though it might be further out on the uh on the timeline um you can start seeing the advancements that e 2.0 are bringing far sooner than that we're going to spend most of the show talking about phase zero which is the most imminent change as you mentioned and listeners should know that we're recording this on monday november 23rd um because there's kind of things going on right now so by the time this comes out we don't really know where where uh things will have landed um however at this moment there we're about 75 of the way to meeting the minimum threshold um and that would trigger off like a seven day period before the network could launch uh and although also the earliest day it could launch would be on december first so it's kind of like uh tomorrow november 24th really is you know the the first day when uh people would have the opportunity to stake that minimum amount so um can you just maybe go through the technical details of of what is required to make this launch happen there's really two components uh to when this chain can launch and really there's like you mentioned a minimum deposit amount and a minimum genesis date um and so really all you really need to meet is that minimum deposit amount which is 524 288e and as soon as validators deposit that into this contract which lives on the current ethereum network um it will go into the deposit contract people can start running clients on this new ethereum 2.0 network now and as a client recogni they read the contract they'll recognize it if it's a valid deposit they'll then allow they'll tell the uh new beacon chain to mint 32 e for that validator um so they can start staking on the network uh so really just kind of a constant contact between the two chains uh all generated through that single contract the uh the other component the minimum genesis date is uh right now listed as december 1st and it must all that means is it that is the earliest date it can launch um so it can launch any time after that it just needs to meet that minimum deposit amount and uh for that deposit amount like once that deposit amount is reached there is a seven day delay between when it's reached and when it's launched so yeah like you mentioned earliest amount it could be november 24th that means that implies a december first launch date it can launch uh you can reach that minimum amount any time after that um and then seven days after it reaches that amount um then the the chain will officially launch and so do you guys want to make a bet um we can all either look really stupid or really dumb by the time this comes out because everybody will already know by this time by the time this comes out um but we at this moment in time don't do you think we're gonna get the minimum threshold by tomorrow then november 24th yeah i i do i agree i i i would put money on it yeah yeah i i have a feeling as well because just even in the time that i was researching for this show the minimum amount was going up very quickly and so today right when i uh went to write this right you know make that little change on what amount we're at right now i was surprised to find we're at 75 so um we were joking before we started recording the show that we think the whales are all back channeling right now so anyway um all right so regardless of when the launch actually occurs let's discuss one of the most fundamental changes that's happening which is this switch to proof-of-stake from proof-of-work why is ethereum moving away from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake so i touched on this a little bit in the overall design of ethereum 2.0 and it's really uh three things it is for security it is for energy efficiency and then it's to reduce the risk of centralization from i cannot dive into all three so on the security front uh you know basically the idea here is can be bited into two different categories uh one is that you want to make the cost to attack the blockchain very high and then the other one is that in the extreme case where you do get attacked like a 51 attack it's easier to uh kind of coordinate a new chain that gets rid of the uh the attacker um so the way this works and improve mistake first proof of work is well um actually i'll even rewind to gpu-based uh proof-of-work because that's that's what ethereum currently operates on now gpus are ubiquitous they're like all over the world they have a ton of different use cases um and if you really wanted to you could rent out gpus and use those gpus to attack a a proofwork blockchain and we've seen that with you um some blockchains that exist that are susceptible to these attacks um now proof of work under like with asics is a little bit different because uh asics are specifically designed to to mine the cryptocurrency uh that they've been designed for so with bitcoin you know their asics are designed to mine bitcoin that's the only thing they can be used for so it's not just about your ability to be able to rent out this hash power from some stop provider uh proof of work and first involve some you know high initial upfront investment to to actually participate in this modding process now the the difference between proof of work and proof of stake is that um with proof of stake there's this two different things with this the upfront investment it's one uh whereas with an asic nasic uh typically depreciates over say about two years and then you have to buy a new one to stay competitive uh your stake is just an internal accounting measure in ethereum and it doesn't depreciate and then uh two uh your stake uh also uh is it's not like permanently locked you can actually remove it after a withdrawal period so really like when you go to stake you only face an opportunity cost and the reason why those two things are important you know not being a appreciating asset and into uh only facing opportunity costs is that it makes uh the attractiveness of putting up more capital uh at risk a little bit um more attractive and the reason why is because you know if you can just pull out your your stake you know after withdrawal period uh if your state doesn't depreciate then you're probably more willing to accept the lower return for a given amount of capital you put up um so it raises the the kind of the cost to attack um so that's one aspect of the proof of state component the other one is like how you know it's harder to counter to or it's easier to counter coordinate uh against the 51 attack now the idea with that is that when you in granted like it's very difficult to 51 attack uh a proof-of-work blockchain like like bitcoin at this point you know talk you're talking about billions of dollars in investment and and much more but in the case that someone was able to 51 attack uh bitcoin uh there's basically a couple things you could do you could basically create a fork and then switch the mining robin mining algorithm to something else so that uh the attacker can't continue to use their a6 to uh to attack the chain but the problem when you do that is that well now you have to bootstrap bootstrap hash power for this new chain and you know probably the way you're going to do that is by switching to an algorithm that be mine using say gpus right and then what was some of the things that i mentioned previously is that you can just run hash power for gpus on the internet and then you can kind of just keep then maybe you can say like okay if this person keeps attacking well we can just keep on forking but this is kind of his never-ending cycle of keeping happens a fork and um someone being able to attack it now the difference with proof of stake is that in the event there's a 51 attack and granite you know like i said would be extremely difficult because uh you know where are you gonna buy let's say like right now there's ten percent uh participating in proof of stake and heath is worth you know sixty billion dollar market cap that's six billion dollars with the eth you need to buy i mean i don't know we're gonna buy six billion dollars with the eth but you know if you could do that the thing is like if you're watching a 51 percent attack on eath like ethereum can create a a new fork and granite you know forking is is definitely hard but they create a new fork and just delete your steak and so basically like the equivalent um you know that that you know many ethereum researchers have uh created analogy is that uh it's almost like the equivalent of burning someone's asic farm when you can you know slash someone's steak for behaving maliciously and it's a way of kind of permanently uh ending this person's ability to attack the the proof of stake blockchain um so that was a hung portion on security but the other two are much quicker on uh you know mining centralization and energy efficiency uh energy efficiency the idea the basic idea is you know bitcoin uh uses a tremendous amount of energy to uh secure itself you know as much as a small country and you know if you can debate about whether that's uh good or bad um and you know like it's it's doing something useful but end of the day it's still you're burning enormous muscle electricity to make this thing work so if you can do it more efficiently it's probably a good thing uh and then last one on reducing my centralization risk that's reducing the risk from um across a couple different dimensions i mean one is just geographical so if you think about uh in threat it's not some conspiracy theory against bitcoin but uh you know 65 of hash power is in china um so that's kind of like you know one risk you can get rid of uh with proof mistake uh there's also the risk that um of like manufacturer centralization so uh let's say like about 90 of all asics are manufactured amongst four firms in asia so there's kind of that risk there another thing with proof of work or asics is that there's economies of scale so the the larger you become the more cheap it comes for you to to mine with bitcoin because you can negotiate bulk orders for asics and it's just you know easier to skill it whereas with proof mistake in theory anyone who is 32 eth can quite easily participate in the consensus process um using commodity hardware um so that's the basic idea with mining centralization risk is just kind of getting rid of those uh those risks although you know maybe not that likely just getting rid of the the fact that they they exist yeah i like one thing i want to dive into a little bit is how staking works exactly because i just wonder is it going to be one of those situations where yeah okay like you know more everyday people can become stick validators but then you know i don't i don't know what it takes to um be running a validating note and and keeping it keeping the uptime such that you won't get penalized or slashed so you know i just wonder will a lot of these end up being on centralized services anyway where you know they're kind of paying somebody else to do that part for them yeah um so as far as like how can you stake uh there's probably three different ways uh one would be doing it through a centralized provider like in exchange or staking as a service provider who will just do all the work for you and the benefit of that is not only convenience but the fact that you can do it with less than 32 each so if you hold one eighth you can now participate in this uh the second way is to do it yourself and if you're doing it yourself um it's actually not that difficult you can you can do it on you know a pretty standard laptop and the way that the uh incentive systems of kind of rewards and penalties was designed is that so it's like very forgiving uh so you know if even if you are you're down your computer is down uh 20 of the year uh you'll likely still be able to be profitable um so that's what i mean like it was designed to be uh forgiving so that you know even if you're you know just it's not good and you don't buy up time you can still be uh profitable uh or at the very least like not not lose your money um and then uh kind of third would be these kind of like decentralized staking pools that are almost like two-sided marketplaces where on one end you have people who want a stake who submit their need to this contract and this contract then goes and allocates that stake to different validators in this ecosystem and that's another way of participating and sticking all right and then um we're going to talk a little bit about kind of the opportunity cost between staking and doing other things but let's just make one thing clear once people move their ethereum to ethereum 2.0 in order to stake they're not able to use it anymore why is that um so you kind of at this point there are two different chains uh and so you don't want to have two different chains that represent the same native asset having assets that can be tradable and running on each because then you start getting some price deviation between the two um it can and it can complicate matters in case any issues do pop up as um e 2.0 starts to evolve um so for instance a bug runs out maybe maybe they need to find a way to resolve any uh differences between the uh staking amount and uh what's being read on ethereum because they wanna they wanna make sure though the current ethereum network to make sure like those are completely uh equal because you start running any sort of differences between the two that's going to make it far more complicated when they do finally merge right now keeping them separate is and keeping and making sure everything on ethereum 2.0 isn't transactable can prevent um any sort of issues like that running down the road but once they do merge then essentially ethereum 1.0 and 2.0 become the same network uh it's essentially ethereum at that point and all the accounts and balances will be transferred onto ethereum 2.0 and they can be read the same as everything that's on the beacon chain which would allow ever to start removing the the staked amount that they have as well as the any rewards that they may have earned during that time so it's more it's more of like a safety measure at this point um which makes sense um because going forward you're only going to be able to use it ethereum 2.0 uh to a limited extent um so really you're just looking forward to when that functionality starts to unlock that's when you'll be able to access everything so because obviously people realize that or or the designers of ethereum 2.0 2.0 realize that there's a lot of things people could be doing with their ether and so they probably need to incentivize them in some way to uh you know move the eth over to ethereum 2.0 without losing too much opportunity cost so what are some of the examples out there of new services that have popped up that still enable people to you know use eth on one once they have started staking one of one of the biggest hesitancies many people have is that there's going to be this you know kind of like lock-up period on your heath it will be unlocked by you know phase 1.5 but who knows really when that comes it could be you know uh 12 months from now could be 36 months from now uh for all practical purposes it's indefinite so in the meantime like you need to be able to access some liquidity on your on your eat and there's basically like two major classes of solutions uh one would be uh kind of like what liquid steak is doing so basically allow you to do is if you stake through them uh they will allow you to borrow usdc on your on your heath so just get like a kind of collateralized loan um and there's kind of this larger class solution called like um mistaking derivatives these classes solutions are kind of a little bit you know less developed at this time than i would say the former but the basic idea is that um you have either a a centralized service provider like an exchange or you'll have a decentralized protocol say like uh like rock pool or sapphire and uh you will be able to deposit your teeth with them to stake and then in exchange it'll give you a kind of like an eath uh derivative which was called like deeth for now instead of death and and the idea is that is that um you can use this like teeth uh on ethereum um to access i mean everything in ethereum so uh you know in theory you could you know send it to compound and borrow die against it you could uh die against it in maker or you know whatever opportunities you want to do when in ethereum and theory you'll be able to do with this kind of derivative well one thing um despite you know all these developments and you know allowing people to both stake and um and do other things with their ethereum there is this concern that because there's a lot of financially appealing opportunities in d5 on ethereum that people won't be super interested in staking how much of a threat or concern do you think the um appeal of defy is to staking on ethereum 2.0 uh i don't actually i actually don't think it's a it's a major concern i think the the biggest thing with between staking and and d5 uh just boils down to how validated returns are designed so if if there was this event where uh say you know yields and d5 are very high and then some people who are staking and granted like this this is actually uh significantly more important in uh phase 1.5 beyond when you can actually withdraw your heat and you know use it in in d5 although i will touch on phase zero kind of after this thought but uh you know if if there was a case where you know eth was uh being withdrawn from uh proof staking to go for use in d5 uh well the way that the the return to validators are designed is that uh if there's less people staking the rewards will be higher if there's more people staking there will be uh the rules will be lower so at a certain point uh the rewards would become like more attractive again uh so that there's kind of like a minimum amount that um on you know how much people would would want to like leave for d5 or staking um and then kind of another related point is that uh staking and and kind of d fire is two different products like uh staking is you're just getting a kind of like a native yield on your teeth for providing ethereum security and uh you know basically the the two main risks that you assume are uh well one the theory and blockchain failing which is just you know systemic risk that uh you get from holding any ass on ethereum and then two is uh like validated risk uh the the risk that your validator uh just doesn't perform or that you behave maliciously and even that can actually be diversified away if you were to go through kind of like a decentralized uh staking protocol that kind of diversifies their validation across multiple validators um but can you just lay out what those penalties or or you know what happens if you get slashed just so people know high level idea is that if you uh behave maliciously let's say like you double sign uh blocks uh you can lose uh some of if not all of your stake for for for doing so uh and basically what that means is that like you know that 32 heat that you posted as you know basically collateral to steak gets deleted okay yeah that's um that's a little bit harsh but i guess um there have been plenty of people in d5 this summer who got totally wiped out by various things that happened so um and so one other thing that i want to talk about is this incident that happened on the test net where one particular client for ethereum 2.0 had a design flaw and that caused participation on the network to go from 80 down to 5 because uh pretty much all those validators got wiped out so how was client diversity which is like a principle really that is important to ethereum and weirdly not at all to bitcoin or or rather they just have like completely different perspectives on it which is super interesting to watch um but klein diversity is something that ethereum really values and yet here we have like certain clients that are really just becoming the most popular out of the gate how is the theory working to mitigate the risks around that i have you brought that up it's it's kind of very interesting to look at the two different philosophies so right now you have bitcoin where over 98 of clients run on bitcoin run bitcoin core uh on the other side you have ethereum uh where eight about eighty percent are running geth at the moment but there is a bit of a diversity into that 20 of what clients are people running there and so there's definitely a push to move towards a more um diverse client base uh so that you don't have one client that's overreaching or having too much control over the network um yeah but actually one thing i'd say is that they've been trying to do this since the time that they launched and it's always been that there's been one dominant one which is also very interesting but anyway keep going i i completely agree and i think they blame a lot of or or they i don't want to say blame but i think a lot of the reason behind that was they didn't really have too many clients to start with when they first launched the chain so you have this first mover advantage where geth becomes the popular um client to use it gains a lot of traction gains a lot of trust and all of a sudden it's kind of hard to eat into that market share um so this that's why for ethereum 2.0 the ethereum found foundation put a lot of money into via grants into building out this a variety of clients and i know they at one point were working on eight to ten different clients and at the moment right now you have four viable ones going into the beacon chain even with that said there has been one client named prism that has become the favorite amongst most validators and like you said on on the test net it had a bug and that issue reared its ugly head that one bug caused the entire network not to go down but to drop to a very low percentage of validators actually working on the client so that means they couldn't finalize blocks they could keep building and adding blocks to the network but they couldn't finalize them which just means that at some point it's possible that those could be reverted um so how do you prevent that uh so there's a pretty unique design within ethereum that if more than 33 percent if you can't finalize so you need 66 of validators actively valid uh working and voting on blocks to finalize the chain if you can't do that then ethereum will automatically start penalizing validators that are not online and so it's called an inactivity leak and if you're inactive it'll start gradually and then actually exponentially uh reducing your staked amount either to get you to a point where you're dropped off the network or to actually incentivize people to come back and join the network and do what they're supposed to do and so eventually it gets back to that 66 percent minimum um what that means in in the terms of client diversity is if you're running a majority client and say that is somewhere between 40 60 of the network and it has a bug you are automatically under risk if all of a sudden those clients go under so you are in some sense incentivized to run a minority client and run one that may not make up 33 or more of the network because then you're not at risk for those types of uh those bugs yeah it's almost like surge pricing or something but applied in a completely different context exactly yeah all right so in a moment we're going to talk about eth about how eth the asset will change but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible crypto.com the crypto super app that lets you buy earn and spend crypto all in one place earn up to 8.5 per

pays you up to eight percent cashback instantly reserve yours now in the crypto.com app back to my conversation with ryan watkins and wilson lithium yields for staking start at thirty percent if the number of eath staked is around the 524 000 necessary to launch the beacon chain but if it ever reaches 16 million eighth state the max yield would be about four percent a year and if it goes higher like to 100 million then it would drop below two percent so in general when you look at this does it feel like this is a good monetary policy that would keep the chains secure et cetera or are there any concerns that you have about it i think this is like a good opportunity to talk about like kind of the philosophy of ethereum's monetary policy so uh my ethereum's monetary policy uh can be defined as minimum necessary issuance and the basic idea is that uh ethereum will always issue an amount of eth that will keep the network secure over time and the difference between you know this philosophy and say uh bitcoins which is a deterministic issuance in fixed supply is that uh whereas with bitcoin it's kind of optimizing for uh kind of like monetary idealism in the sense that you had people that created this that wanted to create this extremely scarce you know fixed applied currency that was resistant to uh debasement whereas ethereum says hey well yes we want our uh our currency to be scarce but what's more important is that ethereum blockchain uh stays secure so that's kind of like the uh the monetary like policy for ethereum vs versus bitcoin uh optimized for security over kind of like you know this monetary idealism uh each has to do on trade-offs uh for uh bitcoin the trade-off is that in a sense you kind of set your security budget uh arbitrarily in the beginning because you just said hey we're just gonna have halvings every four years in the run of a fixed supply and uh this fee market for block space is supposed to pick up and that's what's supposed to secure uh bitcoin in the long term and then tradeoff for ethereum is that while ethereum's monetary policy i mean sure you can say that it's uh it's midnight minimum necessary issuance but uh who determines that and then what does it actually mean practically speaking uh because with bitcoin it's very easy to understand yeah like every every year there's gonna be x amount issued uh this is this is this can be the total supply in 2056 it's just all deterministic it's easy to understand but whereas with the theory which is like okay i kind of i get that it's supposed to be a minimum that's there to be secure but it's a little bit hard to to wrap your head around uh you know what that means and how it works so uh there's downsides to both but you know i think there's room for experimentation and uh and you know they they each have their own their own benefits that each community believes are important one of the most interesting parts of your analysis around ethereum 2.0 was about eth the asset and how that will change you said that under ethereum 2.0 eth will become a store of value a capital asset and a commodity and that this is an unprecedented combination so how does it fit the definition of all three and how do you know that this is the first time in history that this has happened it's like uh chris bruniski i think back in 2017 uh introduced uh these this kind of uh this this paper from uh you know an academic called this thing was like robert greer about the three super classes of assets that the idea is that every asset in the world uh that has ever existed can be classified into these three different categories uh one being stores of value with the idea being that these are assets that maintain their purchasing power uh throughout time uh two being capital asset with the idea being that these are assets that produce an inter-generated income and then three being commodities um which are assets that can are can be consumed or they're transformable into something else so examples of those would be you know for a capital asset would be you know a stock or a bond in apple this is kind of this like income producing uh asset an example of commodity would be like oil uh you know you can use oil for a ton of different things to power your car you can turn it into different um you know end products and then for a store value uh you know it could be debatably the u.s dollar although some people would kind of scoff at that in the space or uh or gold which actually is both a commodity and a historic value um so that's kind of the high level idea of like these these assay classes now ethereum and ethereum 1.0 is a commodity and a store of value it's a commodity because it's used as uh as gas to pay for transactions um and i think this relationship will be or this analogy would be especially powerful when a new erp is introduced called erp 1559 uh where uh the majority of transaction fees uh will actually be burned instead of being paid for miners so quite literally be like you know consumed by the theory of blockchain uh for a store of value like that's ethereum's use as a asset in you know d5 to store value to send transactions like that's the idea so that's theorist that's it takes today now the theorem 2.0 uh it introduces uh staking and what staking allows you to do is you can post your eth as collateral to become a validator on ethereum 2.0 and now you can actually start generating uh yields on your on your heath and the amount of yield you'll get varies on the amount of uh eat that's being staked so at 524 thousand uh 288 uh uh you know that kind of like you said before like the the the rate that you'll be getting is is very high i'll be about say like 23 24 and then at about like 10 million or 16 million each state that'll be somewhere between like four and six percent uh but this idea is that uh now you're getting a yield on like a native yield on each uh so when you combine those those three things it's like well you have all these different sources of demand for eat the asset uh and ethan's being you know used for all these different things and then uh you know i'm like a little bit hesitant to say that it's unprecedented um because i've not literally explored every asset in history um but from what from what i what i have seen uh is this there's nothing really like this um you know something that is a non-sovereign store value you know just like bitcoin uh that is also used to you know power this you know globally scalable a computer and also offers a native yields almost similar to a kind of like sovereign bond in a sense um and the combination of the three just makes these uh super interesting um as an asset and when you mentioned eip1559 and about how the fees will be burned so how do you think that will affect the issuance of eth or the net issuance i should say and you know what it will look like in terms of a store of value yeah um so i think uh some some helpful context as well is that when the beacon chain launches uh hopefully you know eight days from now on december 1st all the issuance from the beacon chain will actually be incremental to the issuance on ethereum 1.0 so over the next uh year and a half saying uh ethereum uh will issue about you know 3.8 percent worth or it's like it's an annual inflation rate will be about 3. like 83.9 percent and then on the beacon chain you'll get an incremental uh issuance depending on how much you distinct of anywhere from you know point ten percent to point eight percent in the most aggressive uh scenarios where there's like you know 30 30 million needs taking so in total like if they're in monetary policy likely between four and five four percent uh over the next you know one to two years now where this changes is that uh if eip1559 gets implemented uh you know on eth1 where the majority transaction will be taking place until the eth1 e2 merger is that you will actually be able to reduce the issuance in the in the meantime well yeah so i'll actually back up again so so that's kind of like what the monster policy looks like for the next uh you know year and a half and i think where is particularly interesting is once the eth1 merger happens and eth1 is now merged into e2 as a shard well that once incremental issuance from the beacon chain uh like i said of you know 0.1 to 0.8 percent is now the only issuance for ethereum and this is actually where it gets interesting because i believe it's uh a 20 million e states per day uh ethereum and this is in ethereum 2.0 at a 20 million estate per day ethereum will be issuing about 2 000 eth per day to pay to validators and uh if you look at like how much each per day people were paying over the summer in d5 on average it was about uh five thousand each right so if if like ethereum 2.0 was launched today and people are playing the same transaction fees like net issuance would be uh like way negative now of course there's like uh there's some nuance here and the big nuance is that uh ethereum 2.0 is going to increase transaction uh scalability right so in theory it will actually alleviate the fee pressure so that it's not where you have to pay like 40 to go and you know send your friend some money or exchange an asset on uni swap but uh according to some of the analysis that that we did that we based off uh you know the economic models that consensus uh put together uh it looks like the the likely issuance rate for um for ethereum 2.0 will probably be like an essay net issuance rates like net of the the burns will be you know anywhere you know from say like negative 0.5 to like 0.5 percent it really depends on like how many uh validators are participating and then you know ultimately how much heat is being burned but you know the the the big idea here is that uh issuance for a theorem 2.0 would be extremely low uh if not negative and one other thing i wanted to ask about was the death that we mentioned earlier these eighth derivatives that will be minted so that people can stake but also then continue to play around in the ethereum one ecosystem so let's say i stake my eave and i get back some teeth and then i use that to mint dye on maker dao but then my vault gets liquidated so hopefully people understood that i i think most of my listeners um have been following my d5 posts or my posts podcasts um but essentially that's like uh the money that you put up as collateral now you've lost it um but you know supposedly you own this eth on ethereum 2.0 so if that happens then who can claim the eth that i've staked on ethereum 2.0 yeah so i guess this this is like in like basically before phase 1.5 when uh you know eth1 version e2 and you have these derivatives where uh you can't actually like claim the the underlying e so yeah in this scenario where uh the maker dial system votes in kind of d e like this derivative of e that's collateral and then people are mint and die against this collateral the liquidation process would be the same you know the collateralization ratio falls below the target amount the d ease gets liquidated and then uh incorporates liquidator and now has his this is it depends on the like the staking solution that created this d but let's say it was like one of these decentralized protocols that uh you know emitted disease yes like eventually you will be able to claim uh the underlying uh eth by having this d eth derivative and basically what it is it's just like uh you know for these decentralized taking protocols is that this d eth is a right to redeem a certain amount of underlying heat so if you hold say 32 d eth and the exchange rate is one to one you'll be able to redeem the 32 heath you know once once it is redeemable so uh so this i guess the important concept here is that yes like all these derivatives uh are fungible when they're issued from the same uh provider all right so now let's talk about the fact that this whole process to moving to ethereum 2.0 is going to take years and meanwhile you know ethereum as we've been talking about has kind of been bumping up against its max capacity in particular because of d5 which is a pretty active ecosystem and one of the issues with defy is that the different protocols in d fair are composable um which is the way that people describe the fact that you can you know do a transaction that involves multiple multiple of these protocols within one block and that's why they call d5 money legos so because that would kind of want you know like all the d5 protocols but then sort of want to you know stay with each other to keep in the same ecosystem what do you think is most likely to happen in the meantime to solve this fairly urgent problem that we already have around scaling yeah um yeah absolutely right and and a lot of the ethereum researchers recognize this uh scalability is a need now and uh frankly what ethereum 2.0 can bring from a scalability perspective is years away maybe a year maybe maybe a little bit over than that um so in the in the short term the solution that a lot like vitalik and some of the other teams have been working on for years is transitioning over to a layer two solution and specifically the one everyone is talking about is called roll-ups there are various flavors of them but in general you can kind of look at them as roll-up contracts and essentially all it is is taking a lot of the transactions that we that d5 is handling today moving them to a layer that's above ethereum right now so kind of taking them off chain but having security ties back into the chain so they would periodically um actually transfer these transactions batch them together and submit them submit them to the base chain so in a way it's providing similar security guarantees so i think the uh the perspective is that even if you uh if any issues happen on these chains uh on these other layer two solutions you would still at any chance be able to claim your uh the assets on the main chain um so right now it's kind of moving towards that layer two solution and like you brought up that uh the issue is like as as a application moves from the base chain up to one of those layers it removes that those composability bonds no longer will i be able to run a transaction that calls different applications in the same block it would have to be done in an asynchronous manner or um it would have to take multiple blocks um so that one issue with rollups is that and one of the reasons why it has to be asynchronous is to ensure security there is a lengthy withdrawal period so i go up into a layer 2 protocol i can start using an application that deployed a contract there i want to get back out and use some of the other contracts it's about i've heard anywhere between three to four days to a week to get out um so there is this issue of one getting liquidity out to trying to call transactions uh between two different applications across these two chains um there aren't any limitations to composability within a single rollup so that might mean a lot of a lot of applications go and build on the same rollup and eventually that one of the issues is if that of everyone moves on to the same roll up you start um running to the same scalability issues that are present today so that that's why you kind of have like this relationship where you're trying to figure out what is the best way to scale ethereum but not lose what really makes it special which are some of these composability bonds there are some solutions in place to try and help out on the liquidity side to minimize the issues of getting out so one could potentially be a cross-chain liquidity solution like thor chain for example where you'd be able to actually move between chains without waiting for that lengthy withdrawal time that's a decentralized option you can also go through a centralized market maker to to accomplish that there isn't a great solution to completely fix the composability issues at this moment uh there are some um solutions out there one in particular called from connects network called space folds which would allow two different layer two networks to communicate and transact but um but right now it's still working towards what is that going to be solution that would allow cross-chain composability and that's definitely one of those issues going forward what's your sense do you think that they're going to address the scalability issues quickly enough or do you think that we're going to start to see significant migration over to some other blockchains like i've heard some people saying you know they're looking at polka dots solana near like what's your sense it's realistic that some applications there's gonna be some leakage uh i think a lot of what's going on on d5 right now is ethereum centric and moving off is not part of their near-term plan and if it's going to be they're gonna move up to a roll-up solution also a lot of these other networks aren't necessarily production-ready they're really on kind of like the same timeline as roll-ups so the roll-up solutions that we're talking about some of the uh bigger name ones like optimism and off-chain chain labs's um solution they might be coming out sometime within the next four to five months uh and you might see the same sort of uh maturity trajectory timelines for these other chains to uh to allow applications actually start building on some of these so i think some use cases particularly maybe non-financial use cases might move over to some of these other chains but i think when it comes to d5 applications ethereum is where the action is and that's where a lot of these platforms that are building off of uniswap building off of compound they're not going to want to move away from that and those base layer platforms aren't going to want to move from ethereum because a lot of what they are are doing is based on that and it's tied into what ethereum has been building and so if you want to really get the advantages of what ethereum 2.0 can bring down the line staying within that ecosystem is really going to be a part of their uh their road maps going forward all right well we'll have to see what happens um so we're running out of time a little bit but i do still want to um dive a little bit more into phase one phase one point and at least phase 1.5 we can discuss whether or not um how deeply to go into 2.0 but um one thing i wanted to understand about phase one was so this is where we well actually so no i should do this question all at once because um as you know vitalik uh wrote a post where he said because the movement toward rollups is kind of happening at a pretty quick pace and there seems to be some consensus around that as like a good way to scale um and frankly that if they uh make it work then that will actually provide more transactions per second than the originally planned ethereum 2.0 so he said that there's a scenario where um there would like ethereum would move to ethereum 1.5 and then be done i wanted to know you know what your thoughts were in terms of like whether or not or how likely you thought that would be to happen but then also one thing when i was um researching for the show that confused me a little bit is i read that so in phase one that's where they introduced the different shards um but then yeah i didn't really know how the shards work with the roll-ups like are we still gonna have all these little mini block chains and then also the roll-ups or yeah if you could help me understand and the listeners that would be great one of one of the benefits that can happen uh when phase one launches is that you have all these various shard chains they're acting as they call them data available data availability layers and really they can just act as kind of storage layers storage chains and uh at the moment on their own somewhat useless mainly just trying to get the network to come to consensus but there is a uh there's an option for rollups to actually use these networks that they can plug into these networks and use them as data storage layers so that would actually get if if roll if the roll-up plan works and you see applications moving up to another layer they can actually plug into one of these various 64 shard chains and use them as kind of this this data storage layer and that would actually give you the opportunity to um get use ethereum 2.0 scalability earlier than phase 1.5 or phase 2. um okay so in a way it's it's not that different from ethereum 2.0 final vision in the sense that there would be kind of like a layered or there would be a layer for execution there would be a layer for storage it's just that in ethereum 1.5 and done what would happen is that the execution would happen on rollups and then the storage would still be in the in the shards that are introduced in phase one is that is that it that's precisely correct exactly so yeah all the scalability everything that's happening on the base layer with that would all be taken care of by star chains that plug into the beacon chain all the execution where the where the applications live where users actually interact with that's gonna all happen on a roll-up player okay so what do you think the odds are that we end up with ethereum 1.5 and done versus ethereum 2.0 as originally planned so i i'm pretty i think a lot of applications are going to move up to roll-ups this is all dependent on how much adoption roll-ups get and right now you're starting to see synthetics be very bullish on the fact that roll-ups are going to lead are really going to be the near-term near-to-mid-term scaling solution for ethereum uh there's a good chance a uniswap has done some integrations with optimism as well which is a roll-up solution and uh as soon as you start to see some of these big d5 players move up i just i just expect that a lot of other applications will move up as well because they just they're very reliant on those um they plug into them and they they like we said are composable with each other if this roll-up solution works out and hands out which i think it will i think there's a very good chance that you'll either see no phase two or very limited phase two so maybe instead of putting uh execution layers on every shard chain maybe it's like four to eight of the short chains a very small percentage which kind of limits the complexity and limits development time so you can actually get there sooner but uh i think there is a very strong chance that either phase two gets dialed back or or there's really very little need to go that far so you'll be able to actually use ethereum 2.0 for its scalability needs a lot sooner than initially projected yeah and then i was going to say let's say like one thing i would add is that with sharding like phase one sharding like using these jars of data there will be availability layers um and roll-ups uh you can probably get about 100 000 uh transactions per second and the benefit of this is that you know this could potentially come in the next you know 12 to 24 months and then you have you know an ethereum 2.0 which can scale ethereum like orders of magnitude um so if you know the the ecosystem adapts to this world then we get scalability like way sooner than we would if we were to wait for phase two uh and then at that point like the prospect of uh doing phase two becomes less attractive because you don't actually get any incremental scalability from uh enabling computation on these on these shards yeah um i already know we made a bet in this episode but i think if i were to make another bed i would also bet on this assuming that everything continues going as it's been going um all right so uh we're gonna do two last quick questions one is just like a general question but one is like for people who might be interested in stinking um what do you think is the biggest risk that ethereum 2.0 faces like if you were an ethereum researcher or developer or whatever what would you be thinking about most right now or working about working on most right now you know where where do you see like potentially the biggest pitfalls um in the game plan moving forward what is around like derivatives so there is this idea that it maybe just like kind of zoom out a little bit higher level is that there's always this trade-off between like in cryptocurrency specifically uh that people care about between like decentralization and convenience and people often times are comfortable conceding their cryptocurrencies and centralized exchanges or custodians or in the case of staking is comfortable staking through a service provider rather than doing it themselves and the reason why this is important is because there could be a scenario although i don't think this is unlikely because of the existence of decentralized staking options and the fact that validating is is very accessible to the average user but there is a scenario where a lot of people end up staking with say like a coin base or abundance of the world and coinbase dividends issues their own east derivative and then that eat derivative becomes extremely liquid and secondary markets they start to get a lot of integrations in d5 maybe even c5 as well so you know you can like borrow and lend against it um and you know this kind of liquidity creates a network effect um actually dana lister wrote like a great piece on this um where you know almost comes like you know a usdt like you know tether kind of thing where you know if people want to go and stake they're probably going to go do it with this centralized service provider because uh i mean yes it's like convenient but most importantly they get liquidity and uh utility from this derivative that's not available with these other options so there's a scenario where staking could end up uh centralized for this reason but you know like i said i i i don't think this risk is likely but you know it is a it is a possibility i i was going to echo that uh i think state centralization is one of the biggest issues that that some people present as as a problem with staking um because it is a very reality it's very real people like convenient they usually pick convenience over sovereignty um so you could see a lot of people sticking with uh exchanges very easily um but i will preface this with the design around e 2.0 um somewhat disincentivizes that because like we said if a lot of the same if the validators are running the same clients and they all happen to go down at once those ones will be more likely to be the ones that get slashed um or because another one of the designs around it's one we didn't mention this is there are slashing penalties but the slashing penalties get ramped up if more validators are offline are behaving maliciously at the same time so if you're running all these validators on the same services and they're kind of doing the same thing they all fall offline at the same time they'll all get slashed uh a much higher amount so if you're staking with a single service you're at a much higher risk unless they're using some sort of decentralized um validated service on the back end yeah yeah and i was going to say like um that was like that kind of brings up what that's kind of related to the uh e derivatives as well is that um if like a centralized service provider say coinbase were to issue their own derivative uh the risk of that e derivative are not the same as the risk of a decentralized taking pool issuing its own derivative and the key difference is that with uh coinbase the the risk is that uh i mean beyond the custodial risk but the risk is that the for the derivative is that uh coinbases validators uh just don't perform or they behave maliciously whereas with you uh with like the e derivative that is centralized taking protocol issues the validated risks are spread across this entire kind of like network of validators um in this protocol um so i mean i mean actually i think one good analogy uh you know hopefully you know uh it doesn't bring you know memories of the financial crisis when you think about this but there's a difference between like an individual uh mortgage and a mortgage-backed security that kind of pulls all these individual mortgages into into one security to diversify the risk yeah yeah it's like a reverse analogy but anyway um okay so then this is the questioner for uh people who are potentially interested in participating what do you think is riskier putting your money in d5 or trying to stake on ethereum 2.0 at this point so i think it depends on what you're doing in d5 if you are putting your if so if you're putting your m basically like any time you put your money into d5 there are a bunch of different risks that you assume there is smart contract risk there is uh composability risk because of all these different protocols interacting um and then there's also like the the risk of just you know ethereum as a blockchain failing which i like i think of it as like the systemic risk of of uh of d5 uh whereas with staking there's really just two risk one being validated risks which you can diversify away with these decentralized taking solutions uh and then just kind of systemic or of ethereum like uh so those are the kind of differences in risk now within d5 there's a bunch of things you can do i mean you could deposit your funds into compound which has been you know heavily audited and you know a known and reputable team or you could go in uh go put your money into like a new yield farm that popped up yesterday that some student anonymous developers created and you risk getting like rock pool so uh there's a lot of uh uh differences here um so yeah so i would say like yes like they are competitive but like um but this this is just there's there's kind of different things this is really yeah and i you know i don't know every last person who listens to my show but i'm pretty sure if they're listening to my show then a lot of them wouldn't be um you know going into uh an unaudited defy contract by an anonymous developer and getting mug pulled so hopefully hopefully i'm sure people will write in now and be like that happened to me but anyway um and wilson do you have a take yeah um i i think obviously it comes down it's different personas are attracted to the various forms of risk um so there's gonna just can be a different user type that is willing to dive into these unaudited contracts that are proposing high yield returns uh but it's gonna depend on what applications you're gonna use and what is your investment horizon if you're looking at on a long term staking is going to be relatively safe um as long as you're doing your research on what validator provider that you end up using and what services you're going to go forward with that because like we said it is it's very difficult to not make money on the standing part so you can er you're really going to have to work hard to not be have a good uptime or use a validating service that may not be as trustworthy to not make some sort of return or lose your money on it whereas with d5 of course there are some applications that are very well audited that have done um a lot of work on that on that service and and are trustworthy within the in the whole ecosystem that would be a lot would be just as safe to work with um and then obviously there's a whole other part to it that um or that where the madness comes in where these attacks are very relevant um so it's just something to keep an eye out for that there are just more risks involved with with d5 at this point all right well this has been super fascinating to dive into this huge momentous change happening on one of the biggest blockchains um where can people learn more about each of you and masari yeah uh so you can check out uh
