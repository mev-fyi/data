hi everyone just a note before we begin after Tuesday's episode with Gabriel Shapiro and Fatima fanizadeh went out I received a message from a listener who works for the IRS during the episode we had wondered if the IRS would share information on whether you owned crypto to other government agencies and it turns out the answer is no this listener who prefers to remain anonymous said section 6103 of the Internal Revenue code prevents disclosure of taxpayer information even to other federal agencies absent specific legislation to the contrary thank you for clarifying that and now on to the show thank you hi everyone welcome to Unchained your no hype resource for all things crypto I'm your host Laura Shin author of The cryptopians I started coming crypto seven years ago and as a senior editor

Link in the description today's guest is Tim Baco head of the ethereum protocol developer calls welcome Tim hi Dora thanks for having me congratulations on executing the Shanghai and capella upgrades on ethereum Wednesday for listeners who may not be aware can you explain what these upgrades enabled on ethereum yes of course so at a high level the biggest thing that came as part of these upgrades is the ability for validators to withdraw their stakes from the beacon chain your listeners probably know this but just in case they don't ethereum launched on proof of work and wanted to move out to proof of stake but by the time we were sort of ready and had the proof of stake design there was already a ton of applications and value built on the proof of work chain so we decided to launch the proof of stake chains separately make sure that it was working that we could you know stake funds on it that's the whole kind of algorithms that run the chain worked as without issues before we transitioned the entire network over to that so because of this when people wanted to be a validator on the stake chain they had to deposit their ether in a contract on the ethereum proof of work chain and then the proof of stake chain returned that contracts that activates new validators and basically credits them the each that they've deposited on on the beacon chain so some people have been doing this since late 2020 we've had the beacon chain up uh since then and those validators sort of earn rewards in East for for their work late last year we had the merge so this was basically when we got rid of proof of work and made the proof of stake chain kind of the main uh engine or or kind of consensus algorithm for ethereum um and at that point validators were still kind of earning rewards they started to earn the transaction fees that uh you know people pay when they transact on ethereum but they still didn't have a way to get their initial stake like the the kind of 32 each that they deposited and any accrued rewards for their their work as a validator out back on the execution layer and the the main reason why we didn't do this as part of the emergency is that the merge is already like a pretty complex change so we decided to separate you know combining both the proof of work and proof of stake chains and then in the future kind of allowing validators this ability to withdraw their stakes and so this is what just happened effectively so upgrade which is shanghai's Capella together which is like this upgrade where we allowed validators to take the state that they have on the Deacon chain and either Exit the whole thing stop being a validator or simply get the rewards out and keep getting your validator and as far as I understand this is the last step of that transition to proof of stake so in a way this also ends this years-long process of that transition yeah yeah that's right and I think maybe a way to think about it is like proof of stake V1 is now fully complete and there's probably a bunch of chains that will happen you know to ethereum's consensus in the future um but the sort of initial vision of the entire chain is running on proof which they you can validate uh you can enter and exit all of that this is now live and working and from a technical perspective and a security perspective what was the development team concerned about when it came to allowing people to unstake and withdraw and when you explain that I don't know if this has something to do with it but I wondered if that was also why there's for instance like different types of withdrawals and like a delay and Etc so can you talk about what considerations you had going into this yeah yeah of course so uh maybe you could take like from the very beginning uh when kind of the beacon chain was launched it wasn't quite clear how we would get all of it there into previous stake you know back in those days there was designs that were like maybe instead of combining both networks sort of we grow a whole new chain under the proof of snake chain and like somehow migrate the proof of work stuff over so we wanted validators to have like as much flexibility as possible with regards the where their funds will ultimately end up so the initial validators when they when they kind of activated their validator they would use a a key that has a different kind of cryptographic scheme than what we use on the ethereum proof of work chain so uh it's like a BLS signature um and so they would kind of have two keys one that they use to find messages and whatnot and another one that's you know effectively like their private key and I'm simplifying on the details here but you know keep it simple so these validators basically they have like a a withdrawal key that's set to this BLS key that's not something like the ethereum proof of work chain can can uh process or you know today's execution chain later on as we sort of you know had a clearer vision of like what the merge would look like and whatnot um it became clear that you know these funds would eventually kind of end back on like the main ethereum chain that exists today so we we added the ability for validators to create a validator and just set an eth address as their withdrawal address so that you know when they could withdraw the funds would just end up there um so we we sort of have this set of validators who've like activated with this different kind of set of keys and we needed a way for them to transition to just specify The Ether address where we should send the funds and so that was like kind of the other thing that activated at the same time as withdrawals is the ability for a validator who previously had this kind of BLS key as a withdrawal credential to change this to an eth address so that the network knows where to send the funds so that was kind of one of the big concerns were just obviously there's a lot of validators who had kind of these old keys and needed to update them kind of all at the same time and that creates kind of a a huge number of messages basically that are sent over the network kind of in this one time because once they've all changed you can only change this thing once right you can't constantly change your eat address to which you withdraw so it's like we would be in the situation where we had all these messages we needed to process very quickly because everybody sort of wants to withdraw as they've been staking for years so that's definitely one of the areas we've focused on um there's a bunch of other things but yeah that's that's probably one of the bigger ones and so to come up with this plan for how the unstaking and what's drawing would work did you run like different kinds of simulation sort of like Monte Carlo style simulations to figure out how to enable people to withdraw while also maintaining the security of ethereum I don't know exactly what types of stimulations we ran but so there's a couple different like considerations one is like the credential changes and the thing that we do there is we just cap how many you can process per block um so you know I I forget what the exact number is I think it's like on the order of 16 you know give or take maybe it's eight but it's not like a hundred um so this is just like a way where you know every block we know we're not going to change more than this many credentials and the clients the clients can actually choose how they prioritize those because these messages are they're not like transactions where people pay gas fees for them clients can you know use whatever heuristic either the first ones that they see um or even there was this interesting project where people who thought their keys were compromised had a way to like verify their identity off chain and you know this project sort of curated the list that then validators could choose to run so if you wanted to like potentially help people who thought their keys were compromised you could set your node to like prioritize those if it were to propose a block so there's all these different approaches you can take I think you know from the Network's perspective it's just how many messages do you want to process by block to not like delay the the whole thing and then in the worst case assuming everybody changed their credentials like what would happen right and these are scenarios we ran on a bunch of Shadow Forks before Shadow Forks are basically where like we create a new network um like a new Beacon chain and we make we make pretend that fork happens on that Beacon chain and kind of spam it through a bunch of transactions to see what happens so we knew that like at least on the order of like 10x more like credential changes that we'd expect on mainnet the network could process even though there would be you know a couple Miss blocks and whatnot like it wouldn't be like in a critical State under that load um so I think that's you know that's like one of the aspects which we thought about I think just like the flow of withdrawals how they actually get you know debited from the beacon chain and credited on the execution layer is obviously something you want to make sure you get to write like you don't want money to kind of get lost or you know like the transaction has to like be Atomic basically so how that works um and you know part of the design there is just that the there is no like transaction for withdrawals it's a bit like the proof of work mining where you know it just sort of appears in the block um but it doesn't take up block space like a user transaction um and this means like smart contracts and what not can't like interact with that as it's happening it just reduces the risk of some weird interaction all right so in a moment we're going to talk about what has transpired since the upgrade occurred but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible ever wanted to use D5 without being tracked

app at railway.xyz to find out more back to my conversation with Tim so as of the time of recording from the last 24 hours which I guess now it's been like about 20-ish hours since the upgrade net there's been about 92 000 East that have been that are in the process of being withdrawn and I wondered how this compared to your expectations this is funny like I had I really didn't spend a lot of time thinking about like how many people would draw or like deposit like obviously you know it's known there's like a couple like entities that had this sort of withdraw everything um but I think there's like two things where it feels like it balances out one is just you know withdrawals significantly I think de-risked staking on ethereum um for a few reasons like one one is like you know that they're possible like even though I don't know like the people working on the protocol sort of knew that you know this would probably happen around this time I appreciate the skepticism of maybe others in the community who feel like okay I'm staking this thing and I have no idea when I'm going to be able to withdraw it so I think you know having it actually be live and working is like a significant de-risking factor and I think the thing that it does as well is it it reduces like the the commitment you have to make like before when you were staking on ethereum you sort of had to commit all the way until withdrawals at least but you can imagine today you know you stake in for whatever reason doesn't work out you can withdraw and you know pretty quickly get your funds back so I think you know given that like even though there's possibly a bunch of people who will withdraw either because they're forced to they you know they want to they've been doing this for a while or whatnot um I think it you know the introductions of which all sort of de-risks the network and the thing as well is like the the network rewards are kind of based on how many validators are validating um so if there's more and more people that join as validators the rewards actually go down because at some point the marginal validator is in that valuable to ethereum but similarly if a bunch of people leave then the rewards will go up and that'll you know probably attract new people who want to stake and and we'll sort of reach that equality so it's it's really hard to predict what happens in the short term like I think you know the next probably a couple weeks of pretty much noise in terms of like a bunch of people who wanted to unspeak will probably unstake a bunch of people who wanted the staple stake but I think after that we'll probably have like a better picture of just you know what does like the average grow for or yeah looks like in terms of mistake yeah nanson had a great dashboard and it's very clear that both uh with withdrawals and deposits are up so um yeah clearly there's a lot of movement in both directions at the moment so now that chappella has been executed how do you think that this ability to withdraw will affect how decentralized ethereum will be yeah yeah that's a great question so I think this is also part of the withdrawals we'll see right now is kind of a resuckling right where people who are staking with one provider might choose to move to another one for various reasons I'm so I think you know especially if you were sticking on say like a centralized exchange you sort of were locked in there you know for the most part as a user over the past few years and a lot of like these centralized exchanges started offering staking before we even have like these liquid staking on-chain uh projects um so I wouldn't be surprised to see you know a bunch of people move from say centralized exchanges to liquid staking projects just because it's more convenient as a user experience and I think you know it's also now much easier as like a solo sticker to actually try it out and see you know okay can I actually run a validator and if it doesn't work out can I you know I can get my money back in like a couple days so I think one of my hopes is that you know by having like a abounded commitment that people make were relative to like an unbounded one um we do see people kind of trying trying it out and um and also you know like you'll accrue the actual rewards on your validator which before we're sort of on the beacon chain but you couldn't quite do anything with them so hopefully we'll see more people trying that I think also you know since the merge like the merge sort of changed kind of quite significantly the software you had to run and like the interaction between the nodes even though in practice like people were supposed to run both like an execution and consensus clients since as a validator uh prior to the merge identity have to run an execution client you could sort of use infer instead and be fine so I think the merge was like a spot where like we asked a lot of like validators and node operators but now I feel like people have like better understood that setup there's like much better guides um there's a ton of like support for it so yeah hopefully we see more more solo stickers come out of this you know I guess the last thing I'll say is the ethereum network sort of has this concept of like coordinated penalties if something wrong happens so if uh basically you know your like all your validators are on AWS then uh AWS goes down the penalty is much greater than if I run a validator on like my internet apartment and I'm the only one at the network going down um so you know if when you're using like one of these these larger providers the risk that you're taking is that if there is a failure you'll be patalized much more harshly than if you have a failure that's uncoordinated from everyone else so even as like a solo sticker who has like say an imperfect performance relative to like a professional operator um you might you know have small penalties more often but in the case sort of like the tail case where like a large operator actually has an issue you would be penalized much less harshly for like those types of issues than they would given the correlations anyways I hope we'll hopefully see like kind of a reshuffling towards more decentralized alternatives and and you know when people try a product that they don't like then they'll be able to change more easily whether this is you know a centralized exchange a pool or subtle staking yeah I think that's that's quite good now that's Shanghai and this whole transition to proof of stake are completed what are ethereum developers focused on next so the the most obvious big thing is uh eip44 so um this prototank sharding um the idea there is that um ethereum's kind of path towards scaling is is via roll-up is there two networks most of the cost of the transactions is actually posting data back on ethereum layer one so the thing that keeps them secure is that effectively you know they process all your transactions off chain but they post back the data on ethereum layer one or proofs of the data for ZK rollups um and if you know there was something that went wrong on the L2 you could kind of reconstruct the transaction sequence on L1 and dispute the actual thing that went wrong so for them it's very important to be able to post the data back on a secure network and that's why you know they they often do it on ethereum um but it's expensive to do that and I think if you look now something like 90 to 99 of the cost of an L2 transaction is actually the cost of posting data on ethereum L1 and so the idea with eip4844 is that we want to offer can and think of it as like temporary storage temporary data storage on ethereum where these layer twos they don't actually need the data stored forever but right now on ethereum that's like the only way to post data but you know optimistic rollups usually after seven days will kind of consider like a transaction final and that you withdraw your funds um different Roll-Ups have like different numbers for this so they only care about the data being there for like on the order of a week um so the idea with 44 4 is we can add more kind of data storage capacity to the network because we're not storing it forever whereas like usually you know because we store data forever we can't store a ton of it and so we end up having to charge a lot for it in terms of gas fees and so 444 will basically allow just like way more data that's stored temporarily and ltus can use this instead of you know the main ethereum data and lower fees on users so that's really where I'd say most of the focus is right now and so um what you described here so often I hear people talking about implementing EIP 4844 but also proto-dink sharding yeah can you explain what this is the same thing yeah it's just a funny name for ip44 yeah okay and when do you expect that to be implemented we've been working on it for like over a year now I think the first I think the EIP was drafted in February of last year so we have had you know several test Nets and devnets running with it I'm pretty sure today all the clients have at least a prototype implementation so I think you know it's it's quite far along the biggest thing that's missing is we were implementing this sort of as prototypes in parallel to the chappella upgrade um so now there's a lot of work to do to just kind of I guess rebase all of this work on top of like the new production software that's running on my net today and people were obviously reluctant to do this like you don't want to have like two in progress upgrades that are like being iterated on on the same code base so they sort of implemented 44 on like an old version of the clients and you know slowly moved it back on top of like the current versions so in the next couple weeks I think this is what teams will be focusing on and then I think after that you know it's it's hard to predict how long these things take but you know we'll start sending yep devnets getting all the clients together seeing what bugs uh we find and fixing those in parallel we also have to discuss like are there other things we want to bring along with this upgrade um I doubt there'd be any other kind of big change because this is already quite a quite a large one but just like with you know this upgrade for withdrawals there's probably a handful of like small letter changes that make sense to combine with it so in the next like month or two I think that's what we'll be figuring out and after that it'll be easier to have it an idea of like when this thing could go live when we know it's when we have full implementations working on like the latest software plus you know we know other features that will cover alongside it and so ethereum's roadmap has um other elements on it after uh scaling so from there like what else do you see as kind of the next steps and what are you looking forward to yeah we we have a lot of stuff to do um so on the proof of stake side uh I think you know PBS is probably one of the things that has the most attention on right now proposer Builder separation correct so right now basically the the Mev Market you can think of it as like the validator is the actor who has to propose a block but it can either propose a local block you know using its public mempool but there's people who can build more profitable blocks we call those Builders and so you basically want to have sort of an auction where Builders can bids to validators saying hey you know I can I will if you make this block for me I will pay you this amount of money and then the validator can check how much they would make with their own blog how much can you know different Builders bid for their blocks and kind of choose so you know I'd like to like take this block instead doing this uh basically requires you know you can think of it as a Marketplace today this Marketplace exists outside of like the protocol rules it's like this is what NBD boost is it's like the software that connects uh Builders and infer Builders and again I'm skipping over a ton of technical details but Pine Level this is how it works and because this like auction mechanism is not part of the protocol there's just a bunch of weird trust assumptions that we have to tolerate that you know make it a bit less robust than like ethereum's like core protocol so the idea with like propose or Builder separation actually people now call it like enshrined proposal building separation because it's just bringing this like Marketplace which already exists to be governed like by protocol rules rather than like mediated by external software so that's that's a big one on the proof of stake side another thing that uh you know I think a lot of researchers like to see is just they call this like single slot finality but the idea is that right now ethereum finalizes which means you know it's very low probability of reward every like 12 minutes or so and it's kind of a binary thing it's like after 12 minutes you get a third of the steak like back in your transaction but the idea with single slot finality is most transactions you know don't need billions or dozens of billions of like Economic Security behind them you know if you're sending 100 bucks on ethereum maybe like tens or hundreds of millions of security is sufficient for you so it's could we make you know instead of making this like a binary thing where we every 12 minutes you get all the economic security could we just make this like a gradual thing where you go from like zero to a third of the stake gradually every slot so there's a lot of work that's that's being met on that and I think on the execution there there's a ton of things that's happening but I think to like uh noteworthy ones one is um moving to what we call stateless ethereum uh so one of like the big challenges with every blockchain is the more contracts there are on it the more storage that takes so ideally in the future not all nodes store all of the contracts um and to do that you basically uh when you send a transaction you need to sound like a little part of the state so imagine you know you own like MST you need to send a transaction that you know says I wanna I don't know transfer my NFP but also include a proof that's like in this contract I own this nft or whatever this is a bit weird but the way ethereum data is stored right now looks a bit like a Christmas tree so it's like the street that's like long and narrow and sending your proof is like imagine you go from the top all the way to the bottom so it's like this long kind of thing obviously you can't get a Christmas tree that way but you know there would be um and so just yeah certainly those would be expensive but and we want to like move ethereum to like a different type of tree which looks a bit more like a bush which is like long and short so like the proofs would be much smaller to send over and there's a bunch of technical work to get there um and probably the most of those worthy piece is changing self-destruct so if any of your listeners are like smart contract devs who rely on self-destruct as part of shapella that that's what live we've actually redeprecated this so you can still use it on the network like the functionality hasn't changed but likely in the next upgrade it will so obviously you know the goal is to not break any existing contracts um but if today you deployed some weird funky contract that like uses self-destruct in like a very novel way that nobody's like ever done um this is the type of use case that you know might get like bricked in in a future upgrade and I won't go into all the details like you know why we need to remove self-destruct but basically they get this future where like we don't have to store all the states on all the nodes this is kind of one of the requirements and so yeah this is something people should be aware of that consider self-destruct to be deprecated on on mainnet and and just to fill in self-destruct is what it's not the same thing is is it killing a con is that killing a contract or yeah so you can think of it it deletes the contract and it sends any money that's in the contract to the address that called it um and obviously you need it's like a privileged action not anybody can call that on any contract but for example um you know there's a bunch of contracts that allow the owner of the contract to like destroy the contract and potentially replace it with a new version or something like that so the the flow is like the self-destruct will just delete the contract delete all the data and send whatever ballot is what's left in the contract back to the owner and is that also the same thing as suiciding a contract or is that like yeah yeah so they actually change the name because you know it was a bit uh intense of the name so it's the same awkward yes got it okay all right Tim well congrats again and it's really exciting to also see what else is coming up for ethereum good luck with all that and thank you so much for coming on Unchained thank you very
