link not a dividend It's A Tale of Two con now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet generally speaking airdrops are kind of pointless anyways um my name's trading firms who are very involved Metallica D5 Protocols are the antidote to this problem hello everybody Welcome to The Chopping Block every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry insiders perspective on the crypto topics of the day so quick intros first up we got Tom the D5 Maven and master of memes next up we've got Robert crypto connoisseur and captain of compound then we've got tarun the Giga brain and Grand Puba at goblet uh and finally you got myself a naseeb the head hype man at dragonfly the all four of us are early stage investors in crypto but I want a caveat nothing we say here is investment advice legal advice or even life advice Robert tarun you guys are at a brick wall I I take it you guys are trying to hide your trying to hide your location they're in the same uh elementary school gymnasium that's what they're going live from right now this is a metaphor about the state of the industry is what it is that that is true it's been it's been a a pretty dark a pretty dark and depressing couple weeks you know normally we run the show every couple weeks we're doing another show on basically one week after we did our previous show just because the amount of news and craziness was going on with this FTX Fallout has been just absolutely incredible let me go and get into it and kind of walk through what's happened since last Monday if you recall last Monday FTX has already entered into bankruptcy proceedings uh on that Friday night before last week uh so you know Friday before last there was this midnight Massacre when FTX got hacked and we've learned much more about each of these things to understand exactly what took place in this quote-unquote unauthorized access to FTX accounts so the first thing that first and most important thing that happened was that there was an affidavit released by the new CE John Ray who's the basically the Liquidator who liquidated Enron and he essentially described the absolute pandemonium that was the books and records and corporate controls at FTX and so what he stated in the in the filing and it's absolutely incredibly incredible filing I recommend you read it it's pretty light reading if you can skim through like kind of the perfunctory stuff but the choice quote at the beginning of this filing he says never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information has occurred here from compromise systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals this situation is unprecedented so there's all these uh Revelations that we're now getting of just how horribly managed and horribly run FTX was to having all of the private keys in one shared Google spreadsheet that apparently everybody in the poor team had access to private loans being given from the company to Sam personally as well as to buy Bahamian property for employees almost negative accounting like just absolutely incredible oversights in just understanding where the money was going and keeping things running of course the we I think we alluded last time to the Mickey Mouse accounting firm that actually did their audits for 2021 and uh you know John Ray basically stated in the affidavit it's like look I do not believe that these audits should be considered to be reliable because you know these Auditors are just not serious people I don't know what's true the way he called them out was pretty hilarious he was like I um he was like FTX us was audited by armanino uh you know a firm I have heard of uh fex International was audited by whatever the name of that firm was a firm I've never heard of it whose only claim to fame is to have opened the first CPA in the metaverse something like that was like amazing like that line was there were so many zingers that were like I you know I've read some pretty stayed in boring bankruptcy filings but that one had a lot of like character in it like uh you know and like bankruptcy filings aren't exactly where you're like wow the Great American novel was written but that one actually could be yeah there's a lot more in there as well so beyond the self-dealing that was taking place on the balance sheet of FTX it was also revealed in there that Alameda was explicitly Exempted from liquidations within their risk engine so confirming what many people had suspected that there was an enshrined special relationship between element and FTX and now again we don't know the the extent of it but at the very least they had a different status in the risk engine compared to any other Market maker all I have to say is if you if you followed any Degen and on trading accounts since 2019 you would have already known that there was like there was tons of evidence and Analysis I don't know how investors who invested in it did not look into that because that was like pretty public knowledge in fact actually you know Alex Packer used to work with you actually talked about his experience investing in or not investing in Alameda uh in 2019 and I feel like a lot of the stuff there should have been stood out as diligence for like any future investor but somehow like everyone just kind of ignored it well so my assumption was that that was obviously true in the early days right I mean it was explicitly part of the strategy of FTX in the early days was that Alameda was going to be the kind of Point Market maker but the idea was that they cleaned up their act over time right and then you know if Gainey was on odd Lots the founder of winchamute and he said explicitly like yeah we kind of assumed that they had cleaned things up see you know same thing that Kyle Davey said is that the reason why three arrows was trading on FDF that they assumed that there were just corporate controls in place that prevented this after they went big so it's one thing to have this as a bootstrapping mechanism when you're a small Hong Kong exchange and you're kind of trying to get get something up and running it's another thing when you're a 40 billion dollar company you've got all these Star Wars investing on the cap table I would not be surprised if there were again misrepresentations that were made to investors about this because almost certainly is one of the most obvious things investors would have asked for and it's also almost certainly the case that they did not turn over source code to investors for diligence and you can you can tell from all the stuff that we're hearing now about how diligence went that it was it was gun to the Head it was very like look you you've got to commit now you've got to put money in now these Audits and this data room is all you're getting and if you're not in then we're gonna go to the next guy and there's many next guys that are lined up ready to put checks in I think this um narrative battle going on right now between I guess Sam and everyone else as to whether this was incompetence or whether there was there was Mouse in FTX and I think from this Vox DN leak that happened with Sam I think he's still trying to lean into and tell the story around oh we got way over levered you know we made some mistakes around how we were marking our books and ultimately you know I didn't intend to be in this situation but I want to make it whole but the more details that come out it seems very premeditated there were explicit actions taken to Grant Alameda the these these benefits obviously you're using customer or uh FTX funds to go purchase this real estate um it seems like it's very like methodically planned and done versus being an accident of you know having bad collateral and having some bad liquidations and then ending up in a hole on your balance sheet yeah so this Vox interview was absolutely incredible um so is Kelsey Piper who was uh she's a journalist at Vox works on this segment called future perfect which is actually very EA aligned portion of Vox they have like this little corner that does a lot of effective altruist reporting and investigative journalism and um so she apparently she was close with SPF or just you know somebody who SPF trusted and they started dming on Twitter and is one of the few people who is actually getting responses from from SPF and she ended up publishing the entire Twitter DM exchange very clearly something that Sam was not expecting to be reported on unlike his correspondence with the New York Times and in that you know in in those DMS basically it's just like the Joker kind of taking the mask off it's it's very very striking the way he's communicating with with Kelsey where basically he's saying like yes it was all an act yeah I don't really you [ __ ] Regulators uh I don't really you know people are uh you know it's not really about morality it's just about winning and losing it was it was just so incredibly Machiavellian the way that he was describing all of his intentions uh through his time at FTX and basically he says a couple Choice things in there one he says that it was a mistake to file for bankruptcy and now that I filed for bankruptcy I've lost control of the company I can no longer go and raise money to save the company and Kelsey was like what do you really think you can raise money at this point like the poll is massive and he's like look I up until you know three days ago I was one of the best fundraisers in the world I must be at least pretty good at this point I mean I look up maybe I'm not where I was but there are a lot of people who are willing to take a bet on somebody who's gone through a catastrophe because they might have been through it themselves and so he still believes that he can raise enough money to pull FTX out of the Grave which is an illusion here are kind of funny right you know when you think of like people who in in financial history who have been able to repeatedly raise money post losing lots of money like the poster child or that is uh is John Meriwether um who founded long-term Capital Management and you know after that blew up he's like continued to like be able to raise these billion dollar funds the difference is he doesn't just go raise them immediately right it's not like he raised raised the fund like two seconds after LTC and blew up he's like hey double or nothing right now and I think that like lack of self-awareness that that's not possible even even if it was like a better scenario suggests like I don't think he's totally been able to realize what's happened like if anything like it feels like he's living in some totally delusional world yeah I'm not a psychologist so I can't like you know say this with any medical certainty but just reading that interview like he came across as delusional sociopathic and like you know just in denial about the entire situation where like you just didn't even believe the reality like of like what was happening around him I mean so you know I I think that's part of what it takes to create a you know multi 10 billion dollar fraud I think I think all the ingredients are that have to be there I don't think you accidentally you know misplaced 10 billion dollars I don't think anyone could accidentally misplace 10 billion dollars unless you have all of those traits like running at the same time you know he did not strict me as like a normal person yeah it it's hard to tell if the shock of the last week has just untethered him and he's just has lost all frame of reference of like what the hell is actually going on or if like the that everything up till now has been like very self-consciously orchestrated to kind of make it seem as though he hasn't lost the plot but perhaps he has from the beginning I don't know it's really hard to tell right because like it's kind of like look you cannot have gotten this far without having some grounding in what isn't is not possible and how the world is perceiving you but it seems like he you're absolutely right he's stuck in this delusion of grander I do think he lived in a world of sycophants it's a little bit like Kanye right like everyone was kind of like yo you're the best you're the best you're the best at enabling it and like SPF is just crypto Kanye right now I feel like that's the that the most you can say he's crypto Kanye mixed with crypto Bernie Madoff yeah well crypto Kanye by definition has got to be a Ponzi schemer right like like I feel like the two of those together sounds like well here's the thing the thing with Madoff is that when Madoff turned himself in right first of all the feds never caught Madoff right Madoff turned himself in admitting that it was a Ponzi and that basically it was over Sam is still claiming to the people around him that it was an accounting mistake he's he's not claiming in any way that there was anything untoward that took place with respect to basically funneling customer money into his you know Affiliated Market maker it it seems like he's basically setting up now his criminal defense which is going to be that this was a this was an error it was a mistake he probably perceives that his biggest exposure is that it's gonna be very hard to prove that uh it was intentional that he moved money to FDX and he's going to keep spinning this web that it was not intentional to take customer funds and move them telemeda um his his primary exposure is going to be on public statements right statements that he made to investors and statements that he made to customer depositors and I think that's probably where most of his criminal liability is he also admitted so much stuff on Twitter and these artists like and the public Trail for this is very different than Madoff Madoff you probably actually had to like get some audited statements here it's like actually just read all the Twitter posts right half of them basically get killed so I just tweeted about this you know Elizabeth Holmes was just finally sentenced after six years after theranos finally uh after theranos the frauded thermos was first uncovered she was sentenced to 11 years and her charges were basically on like defrauding investors not defrauding users of her products but underfrotting investors much harder to prove fraud with respect to the users of your products because okay well it was a business failure like who knows it was an honest attempt at trying to build this stuff like you know other people should have done their due diligence blah blah blah I think it's it's likely that if there is a criminal prosecution and I'm not a lawyer so this is totally talking out of my ass but I would guess that the easiest thing to get Sam on would be lying to investors lying to customers lying to counterparties as opposed to actually moving funds from you know proving that it wasn't a mistake blah blah blah you know their their books and records are so bad that obviously it's hard to prove anything what about the fact that a lawyer dropped him I don't think you can read into that I mean again not a lawyer like I think the most obvious glaring issue for him is you know one of the things we haven't talked about yet which is the bank fraud so when you wired money into and out of FTX you weren't actually wiring money to FTX as advertised you're actually wiring money directly to alameda's bank account and receiving wires and achs directly from alameda's bank account this was at least for me over the last week the most shocking Revelation was that and this is like hiding in plain sight for years now that FTX didn't have a bank account they just never had one in the first place and they used alameda's bank account as the back end for the exchange which is what created this like eight billion dollar incorrectly labeled account this is the incorrectly labeled account itself is the fact that they were using Alameda as the on and off ramp to FTX and so you know you you wonder how Alameda got eight billion dollars all the wires went directly to Alameda but the Howard Banks not know this right like that is not what a market Maker's banking patterns look like people did show go ask their bank for aph confirmation and ACH confirmations did say Almeda and just because I know on track they're just kind of like we're like oh maybe it was fine which is crazy also right the root cause of how did 8 billion dollars go missing and like what is the eight billion dollar like incorrectly labeled account like is the fact that Alameda was the on and off ramp to The Exchange well so that explains why the notice that explains why the Fiat accounts were commingled from the beginning right but we've gotten confirmation now from Caroline's own admissions that uh there was a loan of customer funds that took place this year from FTX to elevator right so Alameda was you know potentially for a long time I don't know I didn't follow all the details but definitely Alameda was one of the Fiat funnels for FTX from from us depositors that alone like that that the eight billion dollar hole seems like it was a recent phenomenon right it took place this year in as a result of that loan that took place but that explains why their assets were co-mingled for a very long time I mean my read of it was that there was a net eight billion dollars of assets transferred into FTX all through Alameda and that's how the if you looked at his spreadsheet the balance sheet the one that everyone made fun of and Matt Levine made fun of like I think that was the 8 billion dollar mislabeled Fiat account in that the Fiat account was funds that should have been in an FTX account but instead write Alameda the whole time I see so like if I wired ten thousand dollars into FTX you know FTX is like you know portal would say oh you have ten thousand dollars with FTX but the money was still sitting at Alameda right I see that was my read and I could be incorrect but that was yeah yeah it's hard it's hard to get a a good sense of it I mean Sam personally pulled out so much money out of the out of FTX as well I mean he took out a 300 million private loan it was also revealed that in the um uh what was it the 420 million dollar billion dollar private loan and then 300 million dollars out of the funding there's a billion dollar loan from Alameda to Sam and then there was a 300 million dollar cash out from FTX Equity that Sam did in the 420 million round and so Sam was pulling tons and tons of cash out of this whole combined entity and um the other the other thing that's going on that's also very strange is that there's this jurisdictional battle between the Bahamas and the U.S so John Ray uh he originally filed for bankruptcy in the U.S and in the Bahamas the the bahaman SEC basically uh you know fired back and said hey this entity is in the Bahamas therefore this is subject to baham and bankruptcy and later it was revealed that supposedly and again this is still very unclear exactly what happened but supposedly the Bahamut government instructed Sam to actually take the digital assets left in FTX and move them under bahaman custody for like Muhammad the Muhammad government for some reason and it's all very vague exactly did this actually happen how did this happen is that the FTX unauthorized access FTX hacker that we were talking about on Friday night if so like what the hell were they doing why were they selling off all the all coins to get access to put everything into Ethan die it's a very very strange pattern of behavior well they were they were also doing it on like one inch and curve right like exactly how many Regulators actually know how to use the curve well the the the suggestion is that they instructed Sam to do this and so it was Sam who was actually going on chain and uh you know dumping these assets and so you know the story at least makes sense like the pattern of behavior does look like okay this is something somebody who's sophisticated about D5 who's who's doing a lot of this liquidating yeah I think I've kind of come around on this like I think there's something else going on there because I agree like if it's just a matter of moving the assets into their custody like that that's one thing but we also saw them basically eating a bunch of slippage on these like on-chain swaps and then moving That Into You Know censorship resistant assets and then I think recently they like cashed out some of their REM BTC for PTC and so they'll probably shove that through a mixer and so I think this might actually just be a vanilla hack and maybe the Bohemian like jurisdictional battle and custody battle is like a different thing that we haven't yet seen but I think the hack was maybe just that actual hack and that seems to be what Sam was implying in his uh DMS with uh with Kelsey Piper which is that uh this was either either a straight up hack or it was a disgruntled employee well I guess had access to the Google sheet where they had all the private keys so yeah it's it's hard to tell at this point they did everything in like a Google like shared good Gmail account I mean that's yeah it's such bad opsec for like how does this right for managing a small amount of money let alone a large amount of money it's just preposterous like no one encryptos that dumb besides yeah I mean this was like everything that we're learning about what was happening inside of FTX it just belies so much amateurishness right like everyone listening to this stream right now is smarter than that like that is so stupid the the other thing um so as the Fallout from FTX has continued we're getting more and more people kind of speaking out and more and more Revelations of people who either worked at FTX or worked at Alameda and one of the things that we're now seeing over and over again is that Alameda was not some brilliant kind of you know n-dimensional chess Next Level Market making firm in reality they were they were making some money doing some pretty basic Arbitrage in you know 2018-2019 but basically when the bull market came they kind of just became altcoin punters and they started going long a bunch of crazy alts and kind of you know basically trading on future listings the idea is that their Alpha started eroding after 2019 when a lot of the bigger trading firms started getting into crypto and they made uh basically their whole strategy was like okay let's just go long a bunch of [ __ ] coins and farm and dump stuff with with really bad opsec and they basically kept doing that through 2022. the story that's now being spun as a speculation let's say about how Alameda lost so much money was that because they were in this privileged position on FTX they were very often the market maker that was going to you know kind of take liquidations OTC one of the most toxic liquidations you could be stuck with was Luna and UST so you know the FTX was very very deeply intertwined with Luna and uh UST they had enormous amount of trading volume um and a lot of the order a lot of the thickest order books for those two assets were on FTS and so when this Mass liquidation spiral was taking place in Luna and in UST supposedly the story is that automatically this stuff was getting sold off to Alameda and Alameda was just stuck with so much toxic flow from the bank run on on Terra that that may be why it lost so much money and so the theory now increasingly is that actually the before we thought that maybe what's happening is that Al is monetizing FTX not through FTX having trading fees but rather Alameda being able to front-run being able to you know buy things before they get listed sort of do all the stuff to profit from their position on this exchange and potentially you'll be able to trade on God mode so you know stop out positions like do all this uh crazy stuff but it seems now actually it was the opposite that okay in a bull market sure that's what it looks like in a bear Market uh really what's happening was that all of the the liquidity like the abnormally high level of liquidity on FTX was a result of Alameda getting just you know poor tons and tons of toxic flow through all of the the crashes that we saw this year and that is perhaps what ultimately ended up to Alameda getting destroyed what do you guys think of this Theory it seems like more and more people seem to be advocating that this is what happened so I'm I would say I'm like 80 20 on it being true like I'm sure a lot of the losses came from that there is certainly a clear sense in which Almeida was always sort of a subsidy for FTX and vice versa it's like ironic right like in the beginning FTX was actually created to bail out Alameda because like that they have huge 10 million loss in Korea or whatever uh and then you know FTX kind of grew and then you know became like the play telling me to made money but I think sort of like the numbers do add up for that but the one thing I do think is weird is that SCS did de-list Luna way before binance did but in particular I remember binance was very aggressive on like the re-listing on when the chain went back up before it like crashed you know how like valid or shut off the chain that I went back online and binance was extremely aggressive in that and that was like that was probably a huge loss if you had to take the other side with the restart the restart was like incredible so I'm more I'm I could believe it but like if we just do the back of the envelope numbers let's just say you lost five billion dollars doing that um that means you you know if we if we look at the total Luna market cap drop was like 20 billion I guess like it already it was already down somewhat so you have to buy you have to basically buy 20 billion dollars of Luna and like be unable to sell 5 billion that seems sort of reasonable but I I like I can't that I can't really square away the fact that they didn't they turned off their engine matching engines earlier than Finance with their ability to realize the entire loss of Market out that's sort of the one thing that I can't square with this Theory I mean it's clear that Luna was not the only thing that ended up comparing Alameda right so I mean in addition to that there was all the Venture investing I mean that's what when Caroline stood up and gave her speech about what exactly went wrong one of the things that she specifically called out was all the Venture Investments that they made that were you know highly liquid right but the other thing too is that as serum and ftt were declining in value like basically what's happening potentially like one one explanation of what's happening is that the most toxic assets from FTX liquidations are getting gradually transferred from Traders on FTX to Alameda and of course the most toxic of those assets are serum ftt um and so as these things are getting Unwound you can just see them accumulating more and more of it on their balance sheet and so that's a in a way another explanation um I don't know if this is correct but you can imagine some some portion of the losses that ended up uh coming into uh coming into Alameda basically may have been that Traders were basically selling out of their positions in toxic assets at abnormally high prices and so where the deposit like where did the money go is one of the questions people keep asking and some of it okay some of it Sam some of it is like these Venture Investments but some of it might be traders that were getting abnormally good prices because like liquidity on FTX was too good because it was getting uh stuck on elementa's balance sheet at the expense of actual other depositors yeah I I totally agree with this actually it's like um yeah if you sold this stuff at a massively inflated valuation to Alameda like like you you made money right you were the one selling them ftt and SRM and like that's kind of where the money went it's not like they have some you know big offshore account where they're holding eight billion dollars um they just started to become underwater in this levered position and you're you're kind of stuck in it yeah so ultimately ironically the people who invested into ftt or invested into sandpoints who got liquidity they're where the money went um because there was basically a net transfer of the cash uh the you know the Bitcoin The Ether the usdc or whatever it was trading against that went to the people who originally invested in those assets and sold a big part of their portion to Alameda Alameda got the ftt Alameda got the the serum and the other people ended up with the cash that's at least a partial explanation but of course there's a lot more that was missing than can be explained with just those assets alone yeah I mean it went to a lot of places as you said like the forensic accounting on all this stuff is going to be years probably but like we do know someone into real estate like we do know it went into a lot of venture capital we do know it likely was huge trading losses because you know the irony is alameda's privileged position as the Liquidator you know on the exchange and like being immune to liquidation men themselves never got liquidated and they picked up all of the toxic flow from their customers you know it went to a lot of places but this yeah is probably one of the larger ones so we we've started to see some of the regulatory responses you know coming into coming into all this and it seems like it's pretty clear a lot of people lost face from this a lot of lawmakers are calling for for there to be an expedited Bill to address you know crypto regulation and kind of some of what's going on here I've actually been surprised that things don't seem quite as shrill as I was expecting them to I was expecting people to be you know pitchforks out extremely angry at the industry and like trying to shut this whole thing down it doesn't seem like that's the the predominant response we're seeing from Regulators or from lawmakers at least not not right now Robert among the four of us you're the closest to this what has been the temperature that you've been hearing from lawmakers Regulators about kind of the post FTX Saga yeah I mean the first thing that's happening that's like on the schedule is like multiple hearings have been scheduled right and like I think the first step you know besides what is going to go through the bankruptcy process of like you know what actually went down an FTX from like a technical and financial perspective there's also the you know I think the first step for legislators and Regulators are partially hearings right it's what went down and like having them hear it in their own words having experts you know provide testimony allowing them to hear from SBF and CZ you know multiple hearings are being scheduled and I think that's the first step and I don't think you know anyone's gonna Rush a solution for legislation until after everyone feels like they have a grasp on like what went down and how to prevent it again in the immediate aftermath people were talking about trying to pass like you know the same legislation vccpa you know but like I think that very quickly lost steam because why pass the legislation promoted by the perpetrator of a horrific crime right so you know I think in the next section of Congress there'll probably be after hearings after everyone's heard you know from the industry from those directly involved like what led to this you know they'll be able to start to craft some solutions and you know hopefully you know the right message gets through and the right message I think is that this was financial fraud perpetrated by someone that previously you know had a good reputation the scope of it is massive but it's not a failure of crypto it's a failure of the system that allowed him to commit this 10 billion dollar fraud and so we'll see like what the correct steps are to address this but it wasn't a failure of crypto it wasn't a failure of a blockchain it wasn't a failure of defy it wasn't a failure of our industry it was a crime committed by a sociopath Grant granted though I do think I do think the investors at some level probably hopefully should somehow I feel like they probably should take more responsibility than they have if we're going to be honest like some of the ways I've been talking are a little bit tone deaf of like I actually thought ironically the best uh investor update about FTX was tamasek the Singaporean someone else fun because they were they owned up to it they were like yeah we [ __ ] up and like we actually you know like and I I kind of feel like that Day of Reckoning is still to come like no like no one wants to own up to this and uh I think there will be like tons of stuff that comes out that forces people too yeah the the tamasek um letter and weirdly enough JP Morgan's standing on this we're both actually very optimistic and so you're doubling down on this fact that this was specifically FTX you know abusing this technology but it's there's still over optimistic about decentralized finance and sort of the solutions that you know we were sort of working towards so um it's sort of like isolating out these two components to the FTX story is is kind of important yeah I've been surprised at how much that's resonating like I sort of assumed that okay that's what crypto people are going to say there's a great tweet by somebody that I retweeted I can't remember their name but it was basically I think what they said was it's funny how FTX confirms whatever you already believed about crypto and so if you're a crypto person you're like oh this just proves decentralization is so important and that's why you know centralized custodians are or exchanges are terrible and if you're anti-crypto you're like oh that proves all equipped as a fraud and you can't trust any of this stuff I've been surprised to be honest I I thought that it was going to get lost in the noise this idea that like look well this is not an indictment of crypto this is an indictment of a centralized company doing things Wall Street style in an unaccountable overseas you know kind of shady operation like yes okay that's what should be indicted um not the idea of decentralized permissionless self-executing autonomous transparent blockchains uh clearly nothing about the uh like that that is not what's to blame for what happened at FTX and if anything the fact that we had you know clear forensics and we had the ability to go on chain and actually see what was going on helped us to uncover this much faster than the mainstream press did is it okay well speaking of the mainstream press that's been another angle of the story which has been just so bizarre to see the coverage that came out of the New York Times and came out of uh Washington Post which was almost just like a Bizarro World depiction of Sam as being this like you know this this uh humble entrepreneur who flew too close to the sun he was trying to do such great things for for pandemic prevention and climate change and Democratic causes and uh he's sort of like a temporarily disgraced billionaire but it's like oh he's gonna get back on his feet and he's going to try again and you know that's that that's the that's what happens when you try too hard and doesn't work out and it was it was just so striking that there was no sense of okay this person almost certainly committed fraud right at this point even you've got you know John Ray you've got the freaking Liquidator from Enron basically saying this is the worst most catastrophic situation he's ever found himself in and the New York Times is basically praising him um it's it's just absolutely bizarre to see now not every not every mainstream of publication did this most of them were very very clear that okay this is like an absolute catastrophe The Wall Street Journal in Bloomberg have been on Point At You know kind of giving the play by play and breaking a lot of news about what's been going on in The Saga but the New York Times uh in particular has just been just strikingly tone deaf not just tone deaf but almost like seemingly I don't even know what the word is for this like it's just bizarre to see I think the more interesting thing to me is like some of the Publications he invested in and I guess rugged because some of them didn't take get all their money have actually had some very good uh good stuff like semaphore which is new online publication it's like had a really good takedown of both the actual like some of the like lawyer stuff of like they were the first ones to report that like Paul Weiss uh dropped Sam and also like Nick Haskell's more elapses which you know I'm always here to to lap up but they they actually had some very good reporting on that um and and also on the early Alameda crash which led to them trying to fundraise from you guys a long time ago or your predecessors Along coming up so I I think that's been interesting to see all these like the small Publications have like way bigger Scoops and then the New York Times can't tell the difference between investment loss and fraud yeah I mean it's just shocking to me because you know the situation is being handled with like you know very soft gloves whereas you know they've never given that privilege to really anyone else in Tech anyone else in crypto anyone else ever the spin on this is just perplexing especially when it's like to see how aggressively they like excoriated like Kraken and coinbase over internal like employee issues well you know relative to this it's just like it's perplexing and it you know at the end of the day I think you know people's you know gut on this is pretty much correct which is it's because SBF and FTX were winning the game which and SPF admitted over text messages that this was a game right and this was a strategy that SBF had won the strategy of spraying money to Media organizations spraying money to Progressive causes spraying money into politics and buying a lot of favor and like essentially reputation laundering before the reputation was destroyed you know he had invested hundreds of millions of dollars into buying friends in the media in Washington I think it's hard for folks to admit that they've been had you know I think it's only now really starting to come out but it makes sense at the very first reaction from the media in Washington was like hold on you know you know this is a collapse we know it's a collapse but it's not because do you think do you think we'll end up with something that looks more like Enron where you know like I guess like the the executive team was sort of like friends with the president at that time and then like because it was such a big thing like the president had to like throw them into the fireplace because like otherwise it would like make him look bad much worse like he had to like cut off the arm because it was like too too close or do you think it'll be like Mark Rich who got pardoned on Clinton's last day because like I actually feel like there is there's non-trivial possibility of that one no there's like a very similar story right it's like some weird security is that people didn't really understand got a ton of Leverage on them blew up you know I mean glencore still exists there's and then there was some like bribing of governments and stuff but he you know he got this like very last minute pardon him I wouldn't be surprised if like something something of that in mind well the only reason that I don't think that will happen is because the public outcry will be so great and I think at the end of the day you know politicians are just trying to get reelected and they like do what the people want them to do and I think this is a very clear case of like the people in you know in Mass like don't like SBF you know Mark rich I don't think the average person had heard of right or cared about like Mark Rich didn't personally screw that you know they might okay yeah but like you know Mark Fitch did some Commodities trade that like no one has ever heard of right SPF then Rondo too right to be honest right they both did these kind of like esoteric Commodities trades that took advantage totally but SPF wrecked the lives of like 1 million like individuals okay that is so much more direct than yeah and Ron or like some Commodities thing that like yeah whatever you know a lot of individual people a lot of trading firms like a lot of like people we know have gotten like completely wrecked by this in a way that like no one ever like felt like wrecked by you know Mark rich or Enron it doesn't do not just for retail but also for institutions right I mean FTX was very institution heavy exchange and so I think there will be a lot of calls for blood not just from individuals and voters but for from people who also have you know kind of other uh influence and and how these things get decided so I I would tend to agree I think I think SPF is not confined a way to snake out of this at this point although he'll try he he will yeah yeah I at this point I mean he's so he's so unmoored that I just don't know that he will understand how to try it I mean I mean I think that my favorite text in that Vox thing was the thing where he was like the ethics was stuff was all a LARP and he like said that directly right like that was Unreal I was like wow you really you just admitted to being kind of yeah like as this Machiavellian character so directly that it's like it's impossible to find an ounce of sympathy right at that point it's impossible to unsee that now right like no matter what he says from now until the end of time it's very difficult not to have that that unveiling kind of burn into your memory actually there's another element so there's a there was a piece that was written by Arthur Hayes the co-founder of bitmax where he basically he he linked a lot of what was going on with Sam and why Sam was you know put on such a pedestal is a lot to do with race like not just race but also his status his class right you know born to these Stanford professors kind of having basically being like American aristocracy from when he was born and kind of pattern matching a lot of things that people wanted to see in somebody who was going to be kind of the hero of this crypto generation I don't know how much explanatory power that has but it's certainly true that you know both Sam and Arthur her were overseas unregulated exchange Founders who like Arthur remember Arthur faced a criminal trial for basically a few Americans you know that they knowingly allowed a few Americans to trade derivatives overseas right that was what they got caught for criminal charges on as far as I recall um it's basically not implementing an AML program and relative to what Sam did it seems just like so like just just so tiny of it of an indiscretion to okay we didn't have a good enough AML program in like 2019 relative to that you've the New York Times just writing puff pieces about Sam when you know Arthur is this like dangerous criminal who's like and a large part of this you you one has to assume a large part of this is just what they look like I agree I I didn't like her writing it was yeah it was it was very good but let us not you know whitewash history Arthur was going on Twitter and taunting regulators and like really playing up sort of this you know entire narrative around himself whereas SPF was doing the exact opposite so it's also you know not just who you are but like literally how you're presenting yourself I think sort of goes into this this bit that that's 100 true I don't want to claim that Arthur didn't like bring us some amount of pain onto himself but you know the the the actual crime of which he is Accused is of such such incredibly paltry consequence relative to the crime that Sam is being accused of totally agree technically Sam hasn't been accused of a crime yet right legally that's true yeah that's another important part to be clear he has been accused of a crime by many people not by but not not normally not not as a criminal case not by a governmental body yes there's no governmental body as far as we know that it's charging with anything um although there were reports that the doj Was preparing charges but we don't know if those are confirmed or not so yeah yeah this is actually one thing I've been wondering like if he's really gonna go speak at Congress and this hearing that's supposed to mean two weeks or three won't he just get arrested that's like I'm just I I don't know if they do file something like seems like the right time the block wrote an incredible article about these hearings with some like incredibly Choice quotes in them to your point to room so like one of them was that Brad Sherman who's unbelievably anti-crypto said I assume that SPF is on a private submarine headed to Dubai so I think it's going to be hard to get him unless Maxine has some depth charges referring to Maxine Waters who also he's crypto but like they assume he's not coming and they actually reference the fact that they assume that in his place will be the SEC or somebody else on the investigative side to speak in his place so he probably won't show up I don't think there's going to be some scene where like you know they arrest him at the airport when he flies in from the Bahamas he go testify to Congress I think they're going to invite him to speak knowing that the odds of showing up are zero to catch this video in is that not a thing that's a great question you don't just zoom in in Congressional hearings I mean they had to have in 2020 but I don't know now yeah okay I know there have been some other issues with like other committee hearings where people refuse to show up and they threatened like you know them well I mean also Bahamas has extradition treaty with the U.S right so it's like I don't it doesn't seem like there's any additional risk in him coming in person like if he actually is going to get charged with something and place under arrest I mean that's going to be a circus either way like I feel bad for everyone involved yeah well all right let's let's move on a bit from um FTX so so after FDX going down there's been a lot of fears about other contagion right so FTX is dead Alameda is dead what else is is getting caught up in the Cyclone of disaster and so there was a lot of fingers being pointed at the lenders initially and the lenders early on basically kind of all in lockstep said no no we're fine we've lost a little bit of money from what we held in deposits at FTX but other than that we're totally okay so Genesis for those who don't know they're the largest lender in crypto owned by dcg digital currency Group which is their parent company so Genesis they are you can sort of think of them they're like the bank of crypto they announced that they'd lost seven million dollars liquidating Alameda which is a very small amount of money so basically not significantly they're like yeah we have no exposure to Alameda then when FTX went under they confirmed that they had 175 million in trading balance that was stuck on FTX that was basically now obviously impaired from their training from their trading their trading on from the trading on another lending arm and so they said look where business as usual but I think it was Friday before last a bunch of people started really getting afraid a bunch of rumors are circulating the Genesis wasn't solvent and the Genesis decided that okay we got to do something about this they got dcg the parent company to do 130 million dollar infusion of capital into Genesis to basically bring bring them back up and run right and so after that they're like look we got the 130 million back in store we're now solvent everything is okay business as usual but over the weekend and going into Monday uh more and more withdrawals kept coming through Genesis basically people you know kind of pulling back their balances or or recalling loans and Genesis basically started facing effectively a bank run by Monday and Tuesday they were trying to calm the markets they apparently they were in the market trying to raise a billion dollars uh seemingly unsuccessfully and then on Wednesday Genesis announced that they were freezing withdrawals so no more withdrawals from Genesis if you have if you have an account at Genesis Lending you cannot get any money out anymore and so basically stemming the bank run and they're now as far as we understand according to reports uh they are now looking for an injection of capital uh and trying to raise money now if Genesis blows you know dies or has to has to has to file for bankruptcy this is going to be really really really bad uh there are a lot of people who are tied up with Genesis so almost every other big lender in crypto has big relationships with Genesis you know a lot of Downstream products depend on Genesis as being basically where they get yield from so they lend it onto Genesis and Genesis or lends them onto somebody else if you can't rely on Genesis a lot of things die off and so the the first an obvious example was Genesis oh sorry Gemini urn which is Gemini's yield bearing product but a bunch of other yield products use Genesis on the back end and so this is going to cause massive massive Ripple effects if Genesis does die it doesn't seem to me like that's where markets are pricing in I think markets seem to think that Genesis is going to get recapitalized but it's going to take some time that would be my guess because otherwise I feel like there'd be much much worse Carnage in the markets when people perceive the Genesis is Frozen I I would say like Sam China's eight billion dollars has zero probability Barry Silver trying to raise a billion dollars I'd probably 75th 75 to 80 percent at least that's my guess yeah I think um like our understanding is a large percentage of this this debt is really like a duration mismatch issue where as you see you were saying um a lot of these sort of consumer facing yield products like Circle urn Gemini uh earn they basically just route out those those stable coins to Genesis on the back end who then issues the loans and of course those are not dated users can just deposit withdraw whenever they want and usually there's enough float or unallocated Capital that they can do that but the loans that they then issue to uh trading firms or market makers are fixed date and so obviously even if those loans are still good you know they have appropriate collateral they can't just recall them before the loan is over and so that seems to be a large percentage of the issue not that there's a bunch of bad debt better bad loads on the balance sheet yeah in full disclosure I have assets that I can't withdraw from Genesis Capital uh so I might have slight bias in this conversation but I think it is potentially a liquidity issue not a solvency issue if their statements around liquidating you know Alameda and closing those positions is accurate um I do think it's like a traditional liquidity issue now other things like FTX or a solvency issue there's negative equity all the money's gone hahaha like they screwed everybody versus something like Gemini where people hear that they have a relationship with FTX and all the and Alameda and people start withdrawing from Gemini earn and they start withdrawing from uh Circle Blend or whatever that product was called that's also built on top of it I feel like there's a classic background scenario where everybody withdrew whatever liquidity they could and Genesis no longer has the money on hand I mean most of their addresses are extremely public you can go and ether scan and you know see how many stable coins they hold I mean they've ran out of stable coins and so they have to suspend withdrawals you know it's possible that you know if they do enter bankruptcy they have a relatively fast and simple you know restructuring where they just say okay we're going to wait for everyone to repay what they naturally owe the whole book closes organically over a period of a year and then a year you know they haven't lost anyone's money they get you know they can distribute everything but we'll see it's very clearly a situation where I don't think they have any you know dollar liquidity available yeah I think this is not a situation where you would think okay there's fraud or that Genesis is like you know that people who have money with Genesis are going to be getting Pennies on the dollar it's very clearly liquidity and and duration uh mismatch the problem though is that so many things are dependent on Genesis that it freezes up so many things Downstream right what other market makers what other lenders what other you know how does this end up cascading if this continues on for very long or they have to go through a restructuring um I think I agree with taru there's a good chance that they can raise enough Capital to unfreeze this whole system because everyone needs it right like a lot of their camera parties would honestly be you know if you could do like some kind of dominance Assurance contract type thing with all your counterparties say look if everybody puts in 10 million we can get this thing humming again and everything's good definitely assured instruction here but I do think like the one thing is the gbtc stuff like no one really knows how much they lent against gbtc like you know they they obviously took gbtc collateral a long time ago that's like how sparrows grew like a 10 million dollar fund to 100 to 100s whatever first and um clearly those loans are I mean those are not clear and they did do some very silly things I feel like being like Oh yeah we're gonna do security via obscurity and not prove to you how much Bitcoin we have and I feel like their PR on this has been kind of whimsically bad yeah so just just to sketch out here because I think for a lot of people the details are hard to follow so dcg the parent company of Genesis also owns grayscale Which is an asset management firm that runs uh gbtc and ethi which are these giant trusts exchange traded products that you know you can buy out of a brokerage account now gbtc and efe as we covered when we were talking about the three Arrow Saga they are now trading at significant discounts to nav so there's more BTC in there in the Trust In gbdc than you would you'd think from the underlying asset value for GBC the trust and so the now this discount has widened uh by a significant margin over the last week and a half and a lot of people now are starting to get afraid that the reason why the discount is widening is because there's some you know Monkey Business going on uh underneath the surface that perhaps there's not as much BTC in there as it was really claimed because blah blah blah something something so there's a lot of conspiracy theories flying around right now grayscale in response to this posted a tweet thread where they basically said look uh we all the money is there uh this is just business as usual for us however we are not going to do proof of reserves because uh we don't that's just not we're about uh but coinbase has always you know coinbase is the custodian they've always verified that the assets are all there uh and correctly accounted for uh but for security and uh do they just cite security reasons what was the reason why they said they wouldn't do proof of Reserves the security reasons okay so for security reasons uh we are not going to do proof of reserves and this caused crypto Twitter to freak out even more and say oh what's the security reason that doesn't make sense if all these changes can do it why can't you do it and so now all these people seem to be afraid that gbtc is going to have some kind of meltdown or there's fraud or there's something else ridiculous going on which um doesn't seem likely to me but you know to be honest after this whole thing with FTX I'm now like down waiting all the things that I'm like very confident on but I still think it's very very unlikely that there's any funny business going on here just that grayscale is just kind of a wall street style firm and they're kind of secretive and maybe they have other agreements with counterparties that require them not to disclose the the online addresses um so it's hard to say exactly why they're not disclosing but if coinbase is the custodian for this thing I'm fairly confident and it's an exchange rate of product I'm fairly confident custody of the actual grayscale shares ATC is the problem I think the problem is like how big are the loans against see chairs that they have and like that is not at all clear so yeah I agree but I think that should be isolated to Genesis that those are the issues right that the very popular trade in 2020 2021 was Genesis would lend um Bitcoin or eth2 funds to then go mint gbtc or e-shares while they were trading at a premium um and then they could sell on the market and so you're basically getting this this free spread obviously that has moved against most of those funds you know over the past year which it was a large part of the reason why you know someone like three Euros um sort of ended up going underwater but like that's Genesis doing those loans against gptc it's not like grayscale the product is is somewhat in in distress yeah the other thing too is like with liquidity locked up like this markets are extremely illiquid and so it's going to be a lot harder for Genesis to to you know liquidate people or to unwind a lot of these loans with liquidity being so impaired and of course the fact that Genesis itself is Frozen is part of what's contributing to that impairment of liquidity because the market makers have no money credit is credit is basically completely stopped flowing through crypto right now this is worse than what it was during the three arrows crisis yes it all goes back to the origins of crypto which I feel like you know have led to this crisis which is you know an extremely complex web of C5 has been built around digital assets and the whole reason we have crypto is so that you wouldn't get these crazy C5 financial disasters um and you know FTX and Genesis and so many different knock-on effects and gpdc are all intertwined you know crises of Finance not of crypto but of finance and it just goes all the way back full circle to like I think right now in this moment you know people see not your keys not your crypto like if you don't have the assets and they're tied up in some Financial structure like they're not yours they're someone else's and you know you're gonna have to wait for finance to unwind and that's that's what's happening and you know I I kind of think this is like this whole thing is this you know Chancellor on brink of the second bailout moment for crypto which is like the chance was on the brink of the third bailout and like it's one where we built Finance too deeply around crypto assets and you know I'm I'm saddened by this and I I hate that like the system is seizing up but like it's a really complex system that replicates the system we're meant to effects but long term I think the death of centralized lenders and The Perils of starting one hopefully will just migrate assets to like higher collateralization ratios way better sort of like monitoring of the stuff I mean most of this comes from like arguably incompetence from from Genesis is like like underwriting right they didn't really do much underwriting they were just like oh if you're using gbtc because like there's a premium we're always going to give you like a loan to value of one and like obviously the market makers abuse that then they abuse themselves then they cause this now the biggest irony of this whole thing and someone had this on Twitter which is that coindesk is it owned by dcg broke the story that caused uh FTX to fail which then caused Genesis to have this liquidity Crunch and so it's sort of like dcg cause was the beginning and the end of their own problem well so okay this is an interesting philosophical question of like how much uh so to ruin I mean you were harping on this in in our last episode and you brought it up again this idea that the lenders were really at fault the lenders kind of had such poor underwriting standards that they kind of brought this on themselves and were it not for their bad behavior um you know perhaps all this could have been avoided I I kind of take a more fatalistic view is that in a market in a market economy right there is basically no way to avoid I mean what you're describing is a credit cycle right where credit gets cheaper and cheaper and because of competition for deposits people have to start loosening underwriting standards um in order to just compete otherwise they're going to die and I kind of think like look there you could you could look at sort of idiosyncratic individual like oh well do you really have taken ftt at this collateral ratio or not like not every lender did it but but the broader thing that was happening in the overall Market whether you were lending against gptc or ft or not right this this loosening of credits credit standards I'll push back I think it's like inevitable Market Dynamic I'll push back on this in one particular way which is I now have talked to enough people who work at centralized lenders in the last few weeks to basically have learned that 90 of loans never got liquidated even when they were in deep in default because everyone wanted to keep they're like they have the same eight customers there's no other borrowers so they were like okay yeah we're just gonna like never liquidate you that is not the way a loan should work right like a loan should get liquidated when it's in default hey if you believe that tenant then these C5 lenders were just stupid as [ __ ] they should have actually tried to preserve themselves in some ways right they had no inclination to do that because they wanted to basically they they wanted their customers to like not die themselves but then they like killed themselves by supporting those it's like a you know anti-symbiotic relationship and I think this is one of the best Arguments for why D5 actually works is like you're getting liquidated no matter what so like just take it and like the liquidation thing has been the number one thing we brought up whether it was starting with FTX being forced to buy bad liquidations whether it was these centralized lenders being dumb as [ __ ] and like not being able to compute a loan to value other than less than one or being able to liquidate anyone like there's just so much incompetence that I think you don't even see in normal Finance like this just shows that like you had too many idiotic Cowboys running these organizations and like yeah sure I agree there's some tendency to for Capital costs to be in a crunch but some of the like negligence and malfeasance that these centralized lenders is ridiculous yeah I think that that's well said and I I I do agree with you there I don't know how much of it is Market structure and how much of it is just incompetence and and greed and maybe a part of this is also the fact that VCS were backing all this stuff and looking for this meteoric growth and the only way to give it to them was to continue relying on like you said the eight people who actually were able to pay yield so what's clear now though we haven't seen the end of this um there's more contagion that needs to work its way through the system and we don't know if if Genesis is going to be the end of it um and when they're going to recover but there's a lot yet to follow I really appreciate you guys jumping on and um you know trying to continue doing the play-by-play and help people understand what's going on with FTX but yeah there's more there's more coming and so we'll be back uh back again soon to keep I hope not I hope there's no more coming like there's one thing we've learned is that it took six months from Luna for this to happen I think very recently the six month anniversary of Luna uh just a few days ago so there's definitely more coming if there was any indication from Luna but it might take a while for us to understand exactly where it pops up Happy Thanksgiving Thanksgiving everybody I hope and best of luck in explaining to your family what the hell was going on hopefully this podcast can be a little help to you at the uh Thanksgiving dinner so that's it thanks everybody yep [Music]
