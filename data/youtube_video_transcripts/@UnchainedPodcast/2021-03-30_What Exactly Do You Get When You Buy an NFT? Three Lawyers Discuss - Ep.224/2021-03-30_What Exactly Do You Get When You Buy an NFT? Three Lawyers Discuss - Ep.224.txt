fintech and ip attorney at slatkin wong an adjunct professor at chicago kent college of law tanya evans visiting full professor of law at penn state dickinson law school and host of the podcast tech intersect and stuart levy co-head of the intellectual property and technology practice at skadden arps and coordinator of the firm's blockchain and digital asset practice welcome ulta tanya and stuart thank you for having us thank you let's start with the basics and since there's multiple speakers um i'll just actually call on one person to begin so we can get acquainted with your voices ulta what would you say nfts actually are in a legal sense i think that's a great question and um and it's hard i think to get a straight definition about nfts in a legal sense but first of all what do they digitally mean and for myself i think despite the fact that there are many definitions out there to me they represent just a digital asset in a serial form and the way how that serial number kind of addresses that digital assets and what is included in that code that kind of raises a lot of more legal questions that probably are going to uh to talk about in this podcast and tanya or stuart do you want to add anything to that well sure definitely i i certainly agree and when i think of nfts they are a way to prove ownership of an underlying asset and it is a record that points to the underlying asset as well and so it's helpful for people to understand that the nft in addition to evidencing ownership also points to where the content is at the time that the nft was created yeah and i think those are i totally agree those are great points and i think you know sometimes conceptualizing it the way we might ask if i had a piece of paper that indicated some sort of ownership rights and some sort of work um you know what is what is the legal piece of paper mean um is a good way to look at nfts as well even though obviously there's some some clear differences in terms of what uh rights they're attached to and so actually i did want to ask tanya about that you know this ownership idea so because i did see online that someone was saying this was on the techno llama blog and they were saying that there's a misperception that an nft is a digital title to the original like that then that's an actual claim of property but but this person was saying that actually an nft is more like a receipt that you own a signed version but maybe not the actual thing itself is that what you meant i guess it depends i hate to give you a lawyerly answer so you know by default when i think and it also in some sense depends on what the underlying asset is so i absolutely understand the uh emphasis or the nuance in ensuring that um that it's not an ownership of some original thing but it it truly does depend and you know when i think of an analog complement to that and i think with you know physical art or i've heard other rough analogies to in stuart's point some evidence of let's say real estate that my deed is not the property but it is my ability to exercise control and to exploit not in an exploitative way but to actually transact with that physical property the same way i think of some type of title of ownership to a physical piece that i might have in my home to that specific physical asset so not and we'll certainly get to this later about the underlying intellectual property the intangible aspects of ownership but literally the the representation or that unique file that unique digital asset that unique physical asset so that's in the way that i understand it so i don't know if it's necessarily a contrary point of view but but a bit of a nuance and so before we dive into the meat of today's discussion i actually also wanted to ask you tanya can you briefly describe what problems exist for creators in the internet age that nfts or blockchain technology can resolve because i i notice you've written about this before yes uh they're a host i'm really excited about so many different ways where when we think of the end of the last century and the run-up when i think of peer-to-peer technology and napster and groxster and all of the challenges to copyright intensive industries that relied on some type of ability to say if i have a copyrighted asset that someone can't duplicate and what satoshi did whoever he she or they are um you know this idea of um solving for the double spend in the cryptocurrency space is the same uh idea of protecting uh the ability of someone to not only have a perfect digital copy of something but then to allow a hundred or a thousand of their closest or not so closest friends to actually copy it as well and interestingly the same technology that was a great challenge in copyright intensive industries now because of the nature of blockchain technology and the persistence of that information and a quote-unquote immutable form that might be a way for uh creators to actually protect with the very same technology in a different form that they weren't able to do at the end of the 20th century in the ramp up of the 21st yeah as a creator myself it's something that i am personally excited about all right so um while it is true that obviously nfts could help creators with a number of these issues it's also true that right now it's kind of like a little bit of a wild west out there and it's also creating problems for uh creators or at least questions and so let's just start with like some of these basic ones that i feel like are kind of occurring a lot now that um there's all kinds of different ways that these nfts are being created so just like from the beginning what rights are required uh for any one person to create or mint an nft if any i'll jump in on that one um so it's a great question and um it's one that i think is going to take a little bit of time to shake out um in a variety of different industries so the reason for that is that for some artists be they musical digital other they have all the rights to their work so they don't have to worry about whether they have the appropriate rights they're the sole creator they hold the entire we known in the intellectual property world the entire bundle of rights but for a lot of works out there the rights have been allocated amongst a different amongst a number of different parties so it could be that some party owns the distribution rights some party owns the display right some party owns the performance right some party contractually has a right to commercialize and so if you got all those parties together and said now we want to create an nft of that work which rights holder has the appropriate rights to do that and can they do that unilaterally without the other rights holders is something that i think is is going to take a little bit of time to shake out i think what we're seeing already um and and if he's been around for a while but this wave is pretty recent is in a lot of different industries with libraries of very valuable intellectual property is already building into their contracts to make explicitly clear who has the right to mint an nft of a work and what exactly that means and i think we're going to continue to see that just as other new technologies as they've evolved people started folding them into the litany of rights that are granted or withheld and i agree with stuart i think the biggest confusion that i see right now in the space is that it's not only about the rights that creators are giving away or buyers are are buying with these nfts i think the misconception is what do these rights include and i think like the analysis gets even more complicated especially when we're talking about uh copyright ownership that let's say it includes multiple copyright authors so if you are dealing with multiple copyright authors for a single work my question is or we call this join work of authorship so i think the analysis is going to be slightly different i mean i think it's much easier when you're dealing only with one copyright owner because then you can determine whether or not i mean majority of these platforms i hope they're doing their legal work or they're putting a good uh due diligence when they build these platforms but i think it gets more complicated when we're dealing with joint uh authorships of this works and especially even when companies are are owners of these copyrights you have many companies there out there with big ip portfolios so it would be interesting to see if we see the impact of the nfds or or how they're going to kind of translate into protection of that of those ip portfolios for these companies that's a good point because when i think about certainly we have nba top shot as an example but also what has recently happened with dc comics and having their independent contractors kind of stand down while they flesh out exactly the the precise nature of what's going on with their works and so it will be very very interesting to see what these companies do because oftentimes when we have a company and an independent contractor or an employee for for that matter creating this create creating on behalf of the platform generally speaking we're always talking about work for hire but that can be very narrowly construed and what was the intention of the parties at the time of contracting these new rights are they any different or are they just a new base on what already existed or is this something that wasn't contemplated by them so and it has the potential for quite a bit of revenue so time will tell how this all shakes out yeah and just for listeners work for hire is when even if it's an independent contractor doing work for the company the company retains the copyright or intellectual property and the freelancer doesn't have any claim to those things which i as a freelancer know a lot about [Laughter] so ulta touched on this briefly but so you know at these times when nft purchasers are buying nfts what rights are they actually buying does it just depend on what platform they're on or like you know is there so something that's sort of agreed upon that is transpiring so far so i'll continue since i started this uh sort of topic so when the buyer of the nfts is buying this nfts i always like to put the analysis that we are sort of dealing with three parties so we're dealing with the author of that work we're dealing with the creator of the nft and then we're dealing with a buyer i mean probably we're gonna have more buyers even in other markets secondary markets etc which probably is going to complicate this analysis but under u.s copyright law uh the buyer of the nft is just purchasing that nfd they're not getting ownership of the underlying asset or underlying work and i have to emphasize this because i think there is a lot of misconception out there so you are just getting if you were to get the ownership of that underlying asset or work you need a license from the author of the work and one of the distinctions or probably exceptions are if you are dealing with a creative commons copyright license and under this creative common copyright license means that it's one of those several public copyright licenses that means that the owner of that work or the copyright owner they are allowing for this copyrighted work to be distributed publicly and usually a creative copyright a creative commons copyright license is used only when the author truly intends to to give away other people the right to use that particular work so for now the owners of the nfd they are not getting ownership of the underlying asset of the author's work but they're just getting the ownership of the nfd and i think it's very important for the platforms that are listing uh this uh nfts uh for for them to specify the terms under and and by the terms i mean hopefully they're going to be uh included in their smart contracts and in order to define what are those rights that nfd purchasers are getting from the nft creators yeah i think what's interesting to always think about is you're not only not getting ownership of the asset itself but you're also not getting any ownership of the intellectual property rights with that work and in this respect it's really no different from the physical art world so if i buy a painting at auction or otherwise that does not get that gives me the ownership of that physical painting to hang on my wall but i don't have the intellectual property rights in that painting unless they were separately assigned to me i can't make posters of the work that's hanging on my wall i can't create you know pictures on coffee mugs t-shirts i have no intellectual property rights in the work i just own the physical work itself and in a way that's sort of the corollary here and the other key point and this is why is also saying what what the terms of use are in the marketplace you're buying from are so critically important is that silence on the conveyance of intellectual property rights means you don't get them so if the assumption is well it didn't say anything so i'm assuming i'm getting the ip rights along with that work it's actually the contrary you don't get the intellectual property rights with the work most marketplaces are very explicit to tell you that just to eliminate any ambiguity doubt protect themselves but you really are just getting the nft rights the ownership rights of that the bragging rights that you've got some connection to that work but not a deeper intellectual property right to use that work which means not the right to copy it um distribute it perform it display it things like that and what about like if you wanted to kind of create a remix or some other derivative can you do that or no so there the the analysis would be very similar to what it would be if there wasn't an nft so there's the concept of a the fair use doctrine in the united states which gives which gives you certain rights to be able to use the work of someone else in a transformative way it's very very case specific so it's hard to set guard rails or rules as to what you can and can't do um but the nft would not give you greater or lesser rights than someone else who's making what we would call in the ip world a fair use of that work and then so these are actually pretty restrictive um i guess rights that purchasers are getting um and so this question that i had actually maybe is uh just gonna elicit the same answer but i was also wondering when you own nfts in like a very specific world such as real estate and decentraland is that even more restrictive in terms of what you own or is is it pretty much uh you know what you guys have been explaining so far the best way to describe it is there's nothing unique or specific about this measure of exercising ownership and control over some type of asset that is so radically different that we can't reasonably analogize what already exists but but that's not to uh say that the technology is not challenging as we kind of sort through these issues and the point that steward make is is really important when we talk about the various factors that a court is going to work through in order to determine um whether ordinarily when i hear the fair use factors uh apply oftentimes artists are asking me i'm appropriating something that already exists in order to create something that i intend to meant as an nft and that's more likely when at least for for me when i hear about concerns over can i appropriate this without the acquiescence of the owner of that copyrighted work and that depends and it's really really challenging for artists but that has always been the case not just in the nft space about how much is too much because certainly not all unauthorized use of some copyrighted work is going to be actionable as a matter of law even if it's technically an infringement the problem is you're not going to know until you're in court you're not going to know until after the fact someone has challenged you and you have to make a great guess with a great lawyer the ones that are on this podcast now about whether or not you've made some transformative use some and so it's really really challenging to kind of unpack the fair use factors there and so when you give that example are you talking about how maybe a creator wants to mint an artwork that has some ubiquitous cultural icon in it for instance painting a a room a child's room and then there's like a stuffed mickey mouse in there and they want to make an nft of that is that an example of that it is particularly because even if the artist is right and in your example i think that would be completely fine that you're capturing a room that happens to have a copyrighted work there but the artist is using it for what stewart said earlier about a transformative purpose and that goes to the heart of the first factor or factor analysis but that doesn't mean you won't be sued so we do want to support artists in understanding how a court might actually work through the fair use factors see what is militating towards fair use and against um and so yes artists are bringing this up a lot you know the banksy example is something that's interesting and related uh there's some distinctions uh to be sure but what happens if an artist is appropriating something that already exists um and using it for some type of creative um output i would argue that that is comment criticism some you know sometimes we see parity or satire those are certain types of purposes that the law actually prefers and just for the audience can you remind them of the banks the nft and what happened with that absolutely so some a group buys a banksy a piece of art and actually burns it down to the ground and then from that creates a new type of art that it then meant as an nft and the question is one whether they have the right to do that and that takes us to uh something that we might also talk about in terms of moral rights that are not in most instances protected in the united states in a way that they are in european nations but the reason i say is a slightly different issue is because if i have a book i have the right to burn the book i don't have the right to prepare derivative works or create copies or publicly perform or display or distribute but as to my actual ownership over that particular property i have the right to do what i want to so i don't see that as a problem unless there is uh what we call moral rights that attach to it that have basically two things one is the right to attribution that the author or the creator is always attached to the work no matter who owns it and the second part is the integrity of the work which gets to this fundamental point that no matter what you don't have the right to destroy it unless there's some other agreement to the contrary so there are stronger rights to actually protect the integrity of the work outside of the united states it's a very limited exception here in the united states for certain types of visual art but that is something that is difficult to understand as well i think that's a great point and i would like to add a little bit more about the moral rights because i think we're missing that distinction about as tanya mentioned there is a strong distinction between the way how we protect moral rights of uh authors uh here in united states and moral rights how they are protected in europe here in united states we use the visual rights artist act if i'm not mistaken and under it's called vara under vara it protects only one group of authors and here are included the visual artists and probably i have to be a little bit more accurate here because usually they protect those who create this works of visual arts and this works include the paintings they include the drawings they include sculptures etc but they exclude specifically this act excludes the posters the maps i think the globes if i'm not mistaken all electronic publications etc so there is a strong distinction even about the timeline of how we protect these rights here in the united states versus how they are protected in other countries let's say in france they are perpetual meaning that uh i mean they last forever and in united states they are protected i mean they expire upon the death of the author and then i think canada pretty much they protect these rights even 50 years after the author's death so when we're considering this decentralized platforms because we're dealing with decentralized platforms of course we have to keep in mind even the jurisdictional approach and how much this jurisdictional approach is going to impact these platforms meaning what laws are going to apply and we're not talking here only about united states copyright laws because these are definitely uh completely decentralized platforms which probably for now we're not cons considering so much the legal issues uh i mean we're concentrating mostly on the hype yeah and i think the point that elsa um just made is is really critical we sort of um you know backed into the jurisdiction issue a little bit for on the moral rights side because that's an example where the rights of an artist might differ from from country to country but it really is critically important that if you are a marketplace or a purchaser or in some cases just the creator of the nft knowing the law of the jew which was which countries laws jurisdictionally apply to that work is real really important it really could make a difference you know as also saying when you um in time as well when you go to europe moral rights which is sort of the right of an author um besides their economic rights they have sort of rights in their work is very different than here and could include very conceivably an artist saying i know that you own my work you bought my work but i don't want my work associated with an nft i just don't want that to happen i don't want my name associated with nfts i don't like you know energy consumption blockchains i don't like cryptocurrency i don't i don't just like this whole field you know there's a million things they could say and they possibly have a strong argument that their moral rights are being violated by you creating an nft of the work um that you purchased of them in ways that again might be different from country to country depending on where the artist is from absolutely so then the jurisdiction that applies is with the one where the um the original artist resides is that kind of the general way it goes or i think this is going to depend i mean uh i think uh you know from the work that i have done in the space i would say that the jurisdiction is pretty much the one that applies between the platform and the creator of the nfd but i i predict that probably we're going to see a lot of more jurisdictional issues coming up especially if we are dealing with infringing uh i mean if you have this authors of uh i mean not only paintings or musical work because we have seen nfts also in the gaming industry so if we are going to see more uh infringement actions then i i predict that these jurisdictional issues are going to come up and be a little bit more dominant in the industry and probably are going to determine even what sort of remedies of plaintiffs are going to have and do you think it would be possible in the future for an nft creator to somehow nft creator to somehow embed into the nft which jurisdiction would apply in case of a dispute i would hope so but i think that that would be a great burden on the platforms i think that's true and think about what you know the fact that you have to you have to contemplate and and kind of foreshadow all of the things that might have to happen on the front end because once you meant it it's minted and so it presents interesting concerns if you're thinking about smart contracts programmable tokens that's the beauty of the technology but the reality of once it's minted it is what it is we're likely to see and really test how smart contract code and nfts are more fully integrated with plain language contracts as well i think we're asking a lot of artists who generally speaking don't like to involve themselves at this level but i'm seeing a real sophistication emerge among artists who are kind of taking off their artist cap and really thinking through some at a bare minimum the technology issues that are driving some of the legal questions that we are are grappling with today what's also interesting on the jurisdiction front is that um all the marketplaces have a governing law there's a jurisdiction section a lot of them have arbitration sections but that probably only relates to jurisdictional issues or you know what jurisdiction would apply what governing law would apply with respect to issues that you have with the marketplace itself if there's a dispute with the marketplace it probably does not then wash over to mean well the the rights of the artists are covered by that governing law or the right to the purchaser as the nft moves around or still back to what that marketplace initially said it'd probably be interpreted to just mean issues vis-a-vis the marketplace and the buyer and the seller against the marketplace and i think it would be interesting to to also see now that i'm uh kind of thinking more about this because we do not have any precedence right now in united states so i think and i'm not wishing that we see more infringement action my point is that probably we're going to see a little bit more from the courts later on because the courts are going to determine or kind of establish probably that framework that is going to be applicable in case we have these questions about jurisdictional issues that these platforms probably should integrate into their metadata into their smart contracts and the way how they're going to structure as i said especially when it comes to the legal terms in terms of services that they would include so unless we have some precedent in regards to the nfd's maybe i mean we're just sort of brainstorming right now and it's it's a good question but it's a very hard question to answer yeah yeah i agree in a moment we're going to discuss more about the different rights associated with nfts as well as the different marketplaces but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible with over 10 million users crypto.com is the

inception in december get d5 and others such as the new nft index today at indexed.finance that's i n d e x e d dot finance back to my conversation with alta tanya and stuart so we were discussing the different rights and one thing that i'm curious about is who has the rights to the revenue stream from an nft well it's interesting i've been my research assistants and i've been pouring over i know the others on on today are also doing the same pouring over the terms of service to see how things are shaking out started kind of from a best practices point of view well i won't use the term best practices but one of the most forceful comprehensive and complete comes from nba topshop for um but it's a central purely centralized environment so you kind of roughly use that by analogy to look at the open sea and the nifty gateways of the world to see how they are categorizing the revenue split there one of the path you know the powerful components of programmable tokens is the ability to participate not just at that initial purchase but also for downstream revenue as it continues to flow automatically to various addresses and each platform is offering a different split we really first saw this in the context outside of the nifty space with i think of like imogene and what she was doing in music like joe music and some of those platforms that were testing out this idea of shared revenue both for the platform for the artists um any other artists who may participate or have the right to receive royalties uh both you know for each and every sale and so we see that now in the nft context as well and uh it's it's a powerful way to empower artists this is one of the other things to your earlier point about how to meaningfully empower artists in a way that currently is is has traditionally been missing in the in the entertainment industry so at this moment there are a number of works or a number of artists that have been finding that their works have been stolen and minted as nfts without their consent or knowledge so what recourse do artists have in a situation like that it's complicated um and it's mostly gets to their ability to to who is it that they can go after so you know the first instance if there's a marketplace that offered that the artist has recourse against you know an approach towards the marketplace to get them to take down the work so there's under the digital millennium copyright act the idea that you can go to a platform that's not vetting works that's just sort of agnostic and putting things up and say you're offering for sale my uh work and that's there's infringement out there and i want you to take it down they have an obligation to go to the other party and see really who has the rights but assume you were successful in that so the dmc dmca takedown and all the marketplaces the nft marketplace at least the mainstream ones provide you with how to go about doing that as they're required to do so that gets your work off of the marketplace so it's not then clear so what does that really mean so now you know there's there's no longer the image of your work on that marketplace it's not available they won't allow it to be available for sale but there are a couple things one is doesn't mean you necessarily have now stopped the nft holder although maybe you take some comfort in the fact that they now own an nft to a work that's been taken down so maybe there's less value there but it does not also protect you from the fact that your work might be out there in the world on different flat on different platforms and you might need to go out on a case-by-case basis and try to get it um taken down there as well the ipfs the interplanetary file system a lot of people don't realize actually also has a dmca uh take down provision so you could reach out to them and say my work on there and it's being infringed and i didn't authorize it needs to come down so enforcement in this area is going to be difficult and it's it's a great concern to the large rights holders out there who have large intellectual property and valuable intellectual property portfolios and libraries of this is yet another area they're going to have to go out and police as people try to monetize their works without permission uh i agree with stuart and um i think um it's it's they're all great points the other issue that i see right now especially when it comes to the remedies and the course of actions that potential plain plaintiffs are going to to have in the future i think the biggest issue is first of all how you are going to identify as steward mentioned but how are you going to authenticate who is the creator of the work because we're dealing here pretty much only with the blockchain address and i mean how can you determine who is the owner of that blockchain address and the other thing that kind of uh worries me is that some of these platforms they are if you read that their terms and of service you see that pretty much they are meant i mean they're stating there that you uh all the participants in these platforms they are at their own risks only some curated uh well-curated platforms i see that they're doing a great job at establishing those terms of service and probably providing for some limited liability for the participants in that platform unless we see this terms of sermon services very well structured uh i think that this is going to be a big issue when it comes to what sort of remedies or course of action plaintiffs are going to have in the future yeah can we actually dive into that because i want to just lay out for the audience what the different terms of service are in these different nft marketplaces because i do see already um just this early on that there's kind of a range so what are you know maybe just name some of the more popular ones and the ways that they're addressing these issues well you look at uh something like openc so i think it's the first and certainly the largest for first uh for user owned digital goods and collect collectibles gaming items domain names and the like and so basically they're saying that there are specific rights to royalties and they have some a laundry list of what that actually mean means when they get to the terms of service for intellectual property rights in particular where they begin is they talk about user conduct and that you agree that you will not violate any law contract intellectual property other third party right that you are solely responsible for your conduct while accessing or using the service and then it has a list of what that that means and so they've gone into great detail nifty gateway is pretty much the same as well it too has its own focus on intellectual property and it says outside of nifty gateway content all other trademarks product names logos on the site et cetera et cetera et cetera et cetera are the respect property of the respective property owners and so there's cons you know limitation of liability and indemnification language uh some platforms are not as well evolved but i think that is changing now because there's so much attention all of us know that the erc 721 and that standard is not new but it's new to so many people in a way that is forcing platforms to reassess this because everyone's being asked wearable has similar terms and again as i said earlier although indian top shot is a separate i i view that as separate because of its centralized notion and the underlying right that language that they use is interesting as well yeah and can you just say a little bit how something like nba topshop is different from the marketplaces absolutely so the marketplaces are and i hate i know we hate this word um in the blockchain and crypto space but an intermediary between or let's say of facilitating transactions right bringing buyers and sellers together we'll say it that way not intermediary very bad work um but that's very different than nba top shot that says we see a really great opportunity here and we own a lot and people really want it right and so they are leveraging the technology in a way that bridges the divide from traditional collectibles and the basketball collectible cards in their packs but their language is very specific we own all of this when you purchase a nifty in this space you are getting the right to this pack and the ability to collect you can only buy it from this platform there is no protection for you if you buy it in the secondary market they have a whole other list of things that are prohibited activities so obviously you're not going to see that for like a super rare or something like that because they just function in different spaces where super rare doesn't own any of the underlying properties they're facilitating transactions you know i was going to say i think that you know the market as we go forward because you know a lot of questions that we get are where is this all going um i think the market's going to divide between at least within the the creative work space between things like nba top shots which is owners of proprietary content opening their own store maybe they use maybe they build their own platform maybe they rely on a third-party provider like you know sort of a buy versus build analysis and then marketplaces where like assigners saying it's sort of this intermediary to match buyers and sellers and they're gonna they're gonna look very different in terms of the terms of use in terms of of what you're getting obviously the proprietary rights holders going to want to be much more restrictive in terms of it's their property and what they're allowing you to do and not do with it as opposed to the the intermediate marketplaces saying look we're kind of washing our hands as we're protecting ourselves buyer beware here's rights you're getting here's rights you're not getting but we're just um you know sort of the platform um to address that but one thing i want to just back to you on on um sort of enforcement which is interesting super rare has a provision in there that if it turns out that you're an artist and you've posted something and it turns out there is as i was referring to earlier dmca take down and that work comes down you're responsible to refund the east that you made on that sale either to the purchaser or it says and or super rare so how that works out in practice i don't think is yet clear if i hopefully have not had too many use cases like that but at least they've built in the concept that if it turned out you didn't have those rights you're giving the money back which is a little bit unusual but an interesting way that they curate a little bit what's more what's on the site so as opposed to just being an intermediary and i think that's an interesting model we might see as well yeah i think that's good for creators and i would imagine that a lot of creators probably would flock more to platforms like that that's just maybe my personal opinion as a creator myself but i i that kind of leads me to another question so um are some of these platforms doing more to verify that the mentors of these nfts actually do have the rights or are they all pretty much you know kind of like scout's honor type situations uh i think right now what we're seeing because um even working with clients in the space it's been interesting to see um how these platforms are approaching especially of course the legal questions and uh i think right now and i don't want to say that we're dealing with a bubble because probably people are not going to like this but i think we are dealing with the bubble and when while you're dealing with bubble especially in the crypto industry then i don't think anyone is paying attention to due diligence and to to to provide i'm not saying the best rights uh to the uh participants in the platform but i do see not only misconception but i do see a lot a lot of abuse of from some of these platforms and i think the more we start working all together all not only as legal professionals but even to kind of deliver a little bit more knowledge out there about this misconceptions and kind of to raise some higher standard standards for the platforms to apply i think definitely this is going to be helpful to the nfd industry because there is so much potential and as i always like to say it if there is potential then we really have to be smart to use this potential i want to also touch on two uh to my mind related issues one is the first sale doctrine can you define that and how and explain how that would apply to nfts and then i think that leads us into the topic of licensing as well so if you could maybe also describe how you know what licenses do and how they're different from rights well well when i was just we were talking about the banksy issue earlier that is a great example of the first sale doctrine uh when i used the analogy of purchasing a book and i'm not purchasing the underlying copyright to copy distribute prepare derivative works publicly perform publicly display but i am acquiring a property interest to use and enjoy the physical book that i purchased or the electronic asset that i have purchased and so i have the right to do with it what i want to do as long as i am not otherwise infringing on any underlying rights and that includes the right to just you know burn a painting or resell my my case book or something of that nature and so that is the first sale doctrine that protects my ability to exploit the copy of a work that i purchase and to further distinguish between that copy and the actual underlying rights that the copyright holder has uh what's interesting in the nft space is so what does that allow me to do so i suppose you could you know create and if you could convince someone to buy this but let's say you were a famous person and you had a physical copy of a book and you said um you know this is i don't know the first book i read on whatever and uh you know people want to buy an nft and sort of own rights in that so you know maybe you know you could do something like that what's interesting the digital space is it's not clear nfts aside whether you have a this sort of first sale concept applied to digital work so um if time you're saying you know i buy the book it's my book i can resell the book i don't go back to the author and say uk if i resell this book to my friend it's not as clear so if i have purchased a digital work i might think well same thing i bought this digital work i own it now i'll create an nft from my copy of it it's not so clear from the copyright office and from a couple of court cases whether you have the actual right to do that whether first sale applies to digital works can i create an nft because i went out and bought something and now it's it's mine to go do with it what i want yeah yeah i was wondering about that because even when tanya was describing the nf the banksy when i thought oh but then they did kind of create a derivative work right um and then they sold it so then is that is that commercial use and i um but yeah it's probably not quite clear yet i think some of the ways that some of these different platforms are kind of tackling this is to offer these licenses instead so when a user gets a license as opposed to you know getting the rights which they're generally not when they're getting an nft what are they getting when you know they have this license that license is definitely going to define the term so it's difficult to answer that question that the power is in the hands of the license or to define the terms to ensure that there are certain um uses that are within scope and that means that anything that is not i can't remember how it's specifically phrased in some of the cases the other attorneys helped me out here but anything that might be outside the scope there's some latitude for what might be recently contemplated so but clearly if you're having if you are creating a well-worded license that defines the specific terms the ideas if any they may also include language that says and anything not expressly provided for is is hereby reserved and in some way that creates perhaps a brighter line um even though we shy away from bright lines in the space um and one final thing about the point that you made before with the banksy example what immediately comes to mind and ulta and stuart i wonder if you feel the same i think of some of those cases with the annie lee cases when they were transforming and the question was and it depended on the circuit that you could have basically the same facts of someone who buys an annie lee and whether it was a mounting or whether it was a derivative work completely different jurisdiction to jurisdiction and unless and until the supreme court here in the united states says one way or another it's interesting to see how it that's why it makes it so difficult but so interesting i i agree with you and i think that probably that is going to complicate this a little bit because if we see like different interpretation from different courts when i mean uh uh it's about time to to address this legal question but um going back to the licensing i think that uh it's um i see that for people who are in the space i'm sure they understand what the license include or what rights should be included in that license but this license actually has to be in writing and uh another misconception that i see is that they think that only by recording this license on that blockchain ledger that will do it so it's not only the recordation it really is important what sort of rights the author the original author of that art of that artwork or other uh underlying work is giving away so even if you were to have this license and record recording on the blockchain you really have to understand what rights you're getting with that license yeah i was gonna say i think that when you look out at the licenses today um so generally today when you buy an nft the marketplace is defining the scope of your license through their terms of use and they tend to be pretty detailed in terms of what you're getting as an example they won't allow you to make a commercial use of the work they won't allow you to take that work and embody it in something else the dapper labs folks came out um with this nft 2.0 license which was a form of license that people could use that actually allowed commercial use up to a hundred thousand dollars just as a sample so you could do that if you chose to do that but most marketplace license grants are very specific you know you can display the work in connection with selling it you can enjoy it for yourself display it for your own personal use but then usually have a list of prohibitions to make clear what you can't do with the work you could argue that even if it was silent you wouldn't have those rights but i think to eliminate any ambiguity they're pretty clear in terms of what you're getting and then a fairly robust list of what rights license rights you're not getting with the work and for that dapper labs nft license template are a lot of people using that like do you feel like that will become pretty commonly used through the industry so it's interesting it's it's hard to say i think the limited commercial use probably concerns people because it's not clear how you'd even police that and i think there'd be a lot of concern by by creators artists right holders of large intellectual property libraries that once you open the door for some commercial use then how do you police the fact that they went up to but didn't pass whatever the dollar threshold is how are you going to count that how are you going to enforce that i think most rights holders today and creators are much more comfortable with a flat you have no commercial rights to the work at all enjoy the nft enjoy however you're going to describe the nft to people that your friends and family that what you have but you can't go make a commercial use of my work i think it's going to still be that that sort of binary for a while and i think i'm okay with that binary for now because i think definitely kind of facilitates the the industry a little better because uh i mean as stuart mentioned if we are opening that path about commercial use i would be more worried about not only policing it but even enforcement especially and i mean how do you enforce it which uh definitely it's going to raise many other questions and so at this moment in time how would you all recommend that artists protect their rights uh through you know when it comes to nfts look i think there's there's a couple of things um that are going on out there i think that antonia mentioned earlier the the dc comics example of uh you know pushing out to their creative their their creatives you don't have the right to create nfps for works that you created for us i think a lot of the big rights holders are looking out to push push statements out into the marketplace to say we have not authorized any nfps of our work if you're buying one it's infringing it's unauthorized i think you're going to see some of that in terms of of um protecting work uh the big rights holders who already have enforcement divisions you know built into their company uh for sure are looking at this space and figuring out a strategy for how they're going to go after and protect the works for the individual artists it's hard you know that they have had this issue historically with any digital work that that issue has always existed i think nfts while providing tremendous upside and benefits to artists has also unfortunately created like with everything uh piracy infringement and unauthorized use and has now created a headache for them to go out and police their works in ways where they might not have the capabilities the just the time and resources to be able to do that so i think it's going to be a little bit of a challenging time for for artists who are just working alone and not part of a large organization with that infrastructure built in uh i agree with stuart and i think it's a good word of advice uh for all the artists and especially businesses because we're going to see way more businesses and i mean other participants coming up and in this industry i think that it's very important for that not only to consider very carefully and to be mindful of the risks that are associated with nfds per se but especially the ownership of the intellectual property and i think when it comes to developing a ip strategy or incorporating that ip strategy when you're dealing with nfds definitely this requires a lot of more due diligence and a lot of more other considerations so you really have to first of all i know that everybody is in the space uh right now because of course everybody wants to monetize and uh it's this fear of missing out my point is that definitely we need to be super super careful understanding first of all that ip strategy that we would like for this uh platforms especially participants in the platform to integrate so in terms of empowering artists i really want to encourage them to take their time that fomo is real and the craze in the market is real but if this space is to have longevity and if you are to have longevity as an artist you need to take care of business this is an exciting time i think in particular uh for underestimated and traditionally marginalized artists as well and so for women and people of color when i think of the black art movement in the space and the power there's a lot of excitement around it micah johnson cory van loo so many are doing some great things in the space but you have to take your time and learn the business and the legal sides before you jump in because this isn't a world where you can't easily undo things so you have to be mindful um and protective of your art and and space yeah that's a good point all right so we're gonna like switch to one unrelated topic before circling back to this because i couldn't really figure out how to fit this into the discussion but many in the nft community such as manikovan the founder of metapurse who or you know this organization bought every day's which was um the christie's auction nft piece for 69 million so a lot of these people get excited by the fractionalization of nfts but i wondered how does that intersect with securities law i am not a securities lawyer i mean i do have a very good understanding of securities law and securities laws and um of course i mean i work with other attorneys in the space but uh my understanding is that sec has already made clear that everything fractionalized is going to be a security so i am not sure how this is going to translate uh to the nfds right now but i think that it's very much um a high risk and i think there is just a small gap as i like to say when uh nft can become from i mean can cross that line between a non-security to a security and of course there are many factors that need to be considered and especially the way how this uh platforms uh how are how the creators are marketing that these platforms and i don't want to go into details into the howie test but um this is something that is interesting about fractionalizing everything that is fractionalized i mean per the guidance so far from the sec may be a security yeah and um just just to answer that like also also not a securities lawyer um but i i think you know it sort of goes to sort of the scheme of how the nft is being sold and so just on its own breaking up an nft into um you know 10 different pieces and saying instead of having one nfc owner of the work the piece of music whatever it might be they're going to be 10. they're you know 10 10 nfc is attached to that that is in itself um probably is an issue and having for sure just a one-off nft tied to an asset is not an issue but we've literally had um people described to us and this is where you start to see how you can quite innocently trip over securities law is someone saying well how about i sell an nfp as sort of an investment and they literally use this word with us you know you sell as an investment i get different people to invest in this digital installation that i want to do and i'm going to then hype it and market it and we'll together increase the value of it and then everyone will be able to sell it as a profit you're not realizing that they're potentially describing what could be you know turning an nft uh innocently enough into a security so i think that while there's in ways too much about securities law you know tied up within the space generally i think you could as i said quite innocently create something that you'd have to get some securities law advice just thinking what i was doing was getting people to invest in my art and we were gonna hype it together or i was gonna hype it for them and try to increase the value and and let my fans make a profit uh something you have to be mindful of all right so let's wrap up with a look to the future in a column for coindesk blockchain lawyer preston byrne wrote quote my suspicion is legally enforceable copyrights and hard-coded on-chain monetization mechanisms will be a valued feature for nft platforms and the platforms with the most effective monetization schemes will attract the most in-demand content creators and therefore the best content and i wondered did you guys agree with that and do you think that enforceable copyrights will be embedded in the nfts and themselves and in general how do you think nfts will change the current business landscape for content creators i agree with preston and i think he made some great points in that article personally i remain very optimistic about nfds because i think it's a great it's a very good mix of emerging technologies and i really like the subculture of the cultural also included here but i think that non-fungible tokens definitely are very strong powerful uh i mean a form or type of tokens that are representing these non-uh fungible assets on a blockchain but when it comes to the monetizing aspects uh as i mean preston mentions in the article something that i would like to add is that for now it's kind of hard to understand the goal or the reasons why people are getting involved of course is the monetization part but for some of them maybe even a little bit more cultural or it's just the idea like why this person can be uh can buy the nfts and i see this a lot even from my clients and why can i not buy so are we here right now for the experience are we here uh for the i mean for the monetary part or are we here just because we have been going through all this quarantine and it's very much more convenient you know as we always like to say to to to to see these digital images etc because we're not getting the real life experience my point is that it depends but um definitely i think that the nfts if we are careful with addressing the legal questions are here to say but um uh probably i mean we are going to see a lot more coming up as the space kind of clears out from some projects that probably are not there yet i definitely understand preston's point i'm concerned about it though particularly because from a united states point of view this idea of the economic incentive is going to drive culturally valuable properties is concerning to me and it's because of the traditional gatekeepers in the art space predominantly white art institutions museums historians they serve as the gatekeepers and also the ones that deem something valuable and if we are only looking to the economic value that that's concerning to me but it's still the technology certainly has the potential um to allow more voices more perspectives and empowerment of those again that have traditionally been marginalized if we don't adopt the same traditional structure that assesses what value is that therefore drives um access okay and stuart go ahead great well first i'll agree with everything tanya said even though i couldn't hear what you're saying um but i also i agree with ulta is saying as well i think what's what's so interesting is i think that you know the hype and sort of the silly things that are going on out there with people just you know overpaying probably for for digital artists because they want to be sort of part of the experience i think that's going to wash away i think that the reason nfts are are here to stay and are going to be so dramatically important is the number of rights holders with significant and valuable intellectual property rights who are looking at this market incredibly seriously is is actually astonishing to me because it's happened so quickly um we kid around in our group that for a lot of these companies i'm sure back at the end of you know 2020 the you know the business plan for 2021 did not include like an nft division an nfc revenue stream and here we are in mid-march and they're all like building them out and thinking of whether they should have a platform you know by q2 to sell these and i think that's really that that's really going to happen so i don't think that's i don't think that's going to go away i think even if all the other you know people spending a lot of money on digital art that no one kind of gets why you spent money for even if all that washes away i don't think it all will but some of it will i think that's that's going to remain and what will really really be interesting to see is for years all of us in this space have talked about you know what is the moment where people start to pay more meaningful attention to blockchains and cryptocurrencies and you know maybe this is it you know the number of people who know today what a meta mask is who didn't know three months ago i would bet you this has been the event that's really changed that probably in the most dramatic way look part of it is the spike in you know bitcoin but i think a lot of it is this and uh this really could turn out to be a watershed moment with large for this space yeah i agree uh fred ursum tweeted some variation on the um notion that it was something like it turns out a lot more people care about music and culture than they do about finance and technology and i was like yeah you know yeah i think i think the dapper labs folks have said for for a while not to misquote them that you know get games and entertainment is what's going to bring bring people to this space you know exactly maybe more so than than financial instruments yeah yeah all right well this has been a fascinating
