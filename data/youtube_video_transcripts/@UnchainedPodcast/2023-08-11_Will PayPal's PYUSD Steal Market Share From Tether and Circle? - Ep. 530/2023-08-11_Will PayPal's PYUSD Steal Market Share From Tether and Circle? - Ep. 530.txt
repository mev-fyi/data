blockchain crypto and digital currencies at PayPal welcome Jose hello Laura this week PayPal launched a stablecoin on ethereum p-y-usd what is PayPal's vision for pyusd and how it will be used well we have been active in crypto now for about the last four years and the vision for the whole of PayPal has always been to be that conduit between Fiat and web 3 that can bring a mainstream adoption to a system for payments we are a payments company and we really care about the payments applications and the launch of byusd is the Natural Evolution of that journal we started with enabling that in the app with traditional crypto tokens then we will move to on-chain transfers we move to International and adding now a fully back and regulated stable instrument of value that can be used for payments is the combination of that of that first phase we do think that stable coins are the killer application for blockchains right now and they are very close to the payments Market that we care so much about and so how do you expect it will be used like which sectors do you think will I mean is it just simple payments that you see being used in like do you see it being used in for instance defy uh so we we do believe that the The Primitives of digital currency are very well is suited for payments and there are inherent advantages that have to do with with cost that have to do with programmability that have to do with settlement time interestingly many of the conversations focus on on the cost per transaction and I'm even more interested in the settlement time we tend to say that they are faster and cheaper but with your own payments faster is cheaper and that settlement time advantages is very relevant we also think that it will take time and that the revolution will not happen overnight we think that we are a few years away from a mainstream use of stable coins in day-to-day payments uh but there are sectors that are very ripe for that use right now obviously there are 122 billion in a stable coin today that mostly happen on crypto trading and web 3 use cases including D5 as you were saying and with respect that pyusd will be used there and we see some early cases like remittances which is one place where we have a ton of Interest PayPal has been active in remittances for a long time through a company that we acquired a few years ago called Zoom so we do have a right to play in in that space and the convergence between remittances and digital currencies has been already underway there is another space in B2B payments where we are seeing increasing adoption of stable coins because if you think about it it makes a ton of sense if you're a company that is exporting to a foreign country and you want to receive payments as opposed to getting receiving a wire that will take three or five days to clear that again that instant settlement time is really really powerful I'm probably the fourth segment outside of crypto that we think will adopt stable coins first is digital Goods if you think like an economies like places like Minecraft or Roblox or places to where there are about 100 billion dollars in digital Goods that get transacted every year if you're a developer selling the digital Goods in a in a game with a current payment setup it can take you 15 days to get your your money so if you can do something that is in-game digitally native and with instant settlement there are very clear advantages there again I think that we are still a few years away from mainstream use cases for a domestic e-commerce or retail but there are very large uh Commerce pools that are already available for stable cuts and so it seems like you're saying that then D5 would be even further out is that I think the defy will be part of the of the first wave in the sense that we want to go where crypto users are today using stable coins and the file is a use case for that as of today you can only get a pyusd on the PayPal wallet we are ramping up the the product but definitely the intention is that it will be available in in main exchanges and with that distribution is available then folks will be able to use it for the traditional use cases one could and the press release said that pyusd can be sent to quote compatible external wallets and I wondered just because I'm sure you're aware there's been some potential uh regulation Banning transactions to self-hosted wallets but I wanted to just check is that does that include self-hosted wallets that you know people yes they comment on compatible is uh the stable BYU is an erc20 token so it's deployed on on the ethereum blockchain and it can be sent outside to wallets that enable erc20 tokens that's the meaning of that compatible and I believe that some of the user terms say that PayPal can roll back transactions but I imagine that only applies to certain ones such as within the PayPal venmo system uh I don't know which exactly which reference you're making but there are there are transactions that there is definitely an aspect of it that has to do with being a fully back and regulated a stable coin as you know we are issued out of New York pakist is the issuer and the token is approved by New York DFS a New York has very clear and strict requirements in terms of kyc and anti-money laundering Provisions that require the ability to be able to have the right controls in place already there are a number of stable coins that are quite popular that are designed quite similarly to pyusd such as tether and usdc so how do you plan to differentiate pyusd from those and any other similarly designed stable coins yeah I think that there are a few different things there that that make a pyus the a very strong value proposition the first one is obviously the the PayPal ecosystem so pyusd is the only stable coin that is accepted in the PayPal ecosystem that includes PayPal now but will include a very soon memo as well and gives access to our two-sided Network so there are millions of consumers and Merchants that will be able to get access to it and it will be able to be used as a funding instrument for PayPal transactions meaning that if you are purchasing at millions of merchants that accept PayPal today and you have a balance of pyusd with you and you want to use posd as your funding instrument you can pay today with with your stable current balance which is something that I don't think anybody else can do the second one has to do with connectivity to Fiat by virtue of being accepted on the PayPal side it leverages the the bank connectivity that we have built over the years as you know moving from Fiat to a stablecoin is a clunky process that sometimes involves that you move from your wallet to an exchange and then you have to pay fees and then you have to withdraw and it take Days by virtue of being supported on PayPal you can move your posd balance you can sell it move it to PayPal balance and withdraw to your bank account and that's something that we think is an inner Advantage both for on-ramps and of rams and the third one I would say is is a compliance regulation so issued by a New York trust and it leveraged the 20 years of experience that we have in in addressing and preventing fraud and financial crime online yeah so speaking of Regulation at this moment stablecoin legislation has for the first time cleared the initial committee stage and the House of Representatives and I wondered is the timing of your launch coincidental or um you know did that give you some vote of confidence to launch now we have been following the legislative process for for a long while I agree with you I think it's fantastic that we're seeing traction there and that those those bills are being discussed there are obviously still differences between the the parties on on the legislation that it would see but that is the Democratic process and that is what should happen in Congress uh in general I wouldn't Point specifically to those bills being passed out of committee as a trigger for our launch the there is a macro trend of clarity around the stable coins that is happening in the world it is it was Micah in Europe a few months ago it is the UK Japan Singapore there are many markets where there are clear uh regulations around stable coins and it's fantastic to see that the US is getting there but also there is a framework in place today we we care a lot about a strict and robust Frameworks and that's the reason we went to New York because that's the most robust and strict and rigorous framework for a stable coins that is available in the land today so in a moment we're going to talk more about regulation but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible

conversation with Jose on Wednesday house representative Maxine Waters released a statement saying quote that she's deeply concerned that PayPal has chosen to launch its own stable coin while there is still no federal framework for regulation oversight and enforcement of these assets what's your response to that I I obviously saw the statement from the ranking member I understand from her letter that her main point is that she will want to see legislation with that has that gives Federal oversight over stable coins as we were just saying that is a debate that is going on in Congress there are other parties so both in Congress there are other members both Republican and Democrat that have a different view on favor State path that is part of the legislative process we are very supportive of legislation being passed we are now procreated by by New York that as I said that's the most strict framework that is that is in place we will observe and obviously we will comply with any legislation that emanates from Congress when when that happens and does PayPal have an opinion on whether they think that Federal oversight is necessary or that state regulation of stable coins is sufficient we do we are a payments company and payments are regulated in this country at the state level I think that different places do that in different ways if you look at for instance in places like like Micah Micah has a very clear definition of payment stable coins and in our sense if a stable coins are related to a payment activity it makes sense that that fit inside the payments framework which today is is regulated at the estate level back a few years ago Libra was an effort by the company then known as Facebook now meta to create a stable coin of sorts it wasn't directly tied to the value of the US dollar but I wondered how the company's failure largely for regulatory reasons influenced PayPal's approach to this launch I don't know we were of course uh closed the conversations or Libre it was 40 years ago already but I don't think that it has informed our approach in the sense that we are continuing to do a our evolution in the sector in the same way that we conduct the rest of our business we had a tech company but we are also regulated financial institution and we have been for 20 years our approach has always been regulatory first and sometimes means that we might move slower than than others but we get a lot about the Regulatory and compliance Frameworks and we care a lot about our regulatory relations we are active as we have said in the past in 200 countries and we are one of the few institutions who who do that and we always said well in our explorations of the space that we will always be doing this in coordination with Regulators so I don't think it's a consequence of Libra is just our DNA our DNA and Who We Are and you're starting the launch in the US how do you plan to roll it out to the rest of the world and if so will you be launching stable coins that are pegged to other Fiat currencies So the plan today is we are live in on the PayPal wallet they I'm looking at the next speak and the next Peak is enabling that on the Vemma wallet so still be largely a U.S us-based uh we will think about International expansion we have not put thought yet on on any other local currency denominated stable coins the priority now is just to make this launch successful and make it useful for the crypto ecosystem but I'm sure you must have a sense of whether or not you plan to launch for instance a a Euro stable coin or a British pound stable coin or we we don't have plants now we don't have in our roadmap anything that is a currency now that is different than the dollar okay and you'll be publishing a monthly reserves report what will that look like and will it also be showing proof of reserves taxes will be issuing that purchase is the issuer of of the token and they are the ones as part of the New York framework that is a requirement that there has to be a periodic at the station so it would be similar to what you can see today already for other stable coins that are issued by paxos like usdp and I know there's and basically means that you will be able to see another station that is verified by a by a third party where you can see the amount of the reserves and also the composition of those reserves but it won't be something where like there will be identifiable addresses where people can use some function to attest that their own coins are still held in reserve nothing like that I know I think that the best way to to look at that for the interesting part is go to the practice website today and those reports are available for other stable coins and you can see exactly what you're gonna yeah the scene on our side so as you mentioned earlier um PayPal wants to focus on some digitally native environments such as online gaming just to my mind I could be wrong that seems like a different user base from PayPal's existing user base and so I wondered how you planned to appeal to them so and just to qualify when we say online gaming we thought we were thinking about video games sometimes people think that that has to do with a real money gaming or something like that I'm deeply deeply interested in in the video game industry for payments if you think about video games sometimes for the external Observer they get dismissed as something that is uh just for a jungle demographic when you look at it actually the demographic of video games is very much a demographic of the general population it's a very very large industry and has very very hard and constraining Computing requirements if you think of in terms of difficult technical problems to solve millions of concurrent users on instantly render environments is a very very tricky Computing problem and many Computing Innovations happen in video games first and I think that a lot of the innovation in payments will happen in video games first when we think of payment use cases that you cannot do today and that could be enabled by the stable coins or things like streaming payments so can you be watching a video clip where you're paying by the second or paying by the minute as I suppose to paying for the for the full thing or can you buy digital Goods on running game environment and then you can take with with you I think that we have seen a very exciting experiments in which you have NPCs or not playing characters uh AI agents inside a game that can be attached to a wallet carrying a value with it and then that autonomous agent inside a game can go and buy and sell stuff inside the game those are things that you cannot think of if you're trying to figure out on a whiteboard what are the use cases you just need to put a platform product out there and then developers will build on top of it and so I think to my mind this would um be one of the reasons why PayPal decided to design pyusd as an erc20 token it sounds like there's kind of plans in the works for smart contracts like other things that enable more programmability with the money yeah at the very beginning of of the process we have we had to think hey we're gonna go to open a source protocols and and traditional permissionless environments or do we want to do something that is proprietary and we very quickly went the the open way because as we have said in the past we we believe that you follow developers you don't tell developers what to do they tell you what to do and and it was a very clear decision to go to ethereum because the developer Community was already there the way that pyusd was the scientist to be a multi-chain so there is absolutely no reason why we would not do other protocols later or other layers on the same protocols later ethereum has many advantages also has obviously higher fees than some of the protocols that for some use cases like we said in terms of micropayments or high speed high throughput could be expensive so we will definitely expand from there but ethereum was the clearly First Choice to deploy and this this revenue for PayPal first of all obviously PayPal could make money from the deposits especially if you're holding it in something like treasuries um and then there's also the fees which I believe are is it 1.5 percent for depositing or transacting so there are several ways a traditionally the monetization mechanism or for stable coins has been monetized in the yield of the of the reserves that's that has been historically there and obviously in this interest rate environment it has been accessible a size of excitable source of profit for the industry and that's fine we don't think that we should foresee that that's going to be the only monetization mechanism or that any interesting environments might might change is so we are what we are betting is that when there is adoption for this stable coins that we will monetize that with the instruments that are closer to the traditional payment business meaning that when there are Merchants who want to accept settlement in stable coin then there would be a merchant discount rate that that they will pay that people might move from a stable coins in one currency to other types and then there might be a fee Associated to to that today to your question on fees we don't charge fees for the for the purchase of a piousd on the PayPal app and we don't charge fees for the sale of posd so you can buy one dollar to a dollar and there are no fees involved you can sell a one dollar you receive one dollar in your PayPal balance there is no fees you can transfer them out the only fee that you pay is the is the network fee is what ethereum protocol will require you to to pay we are not charged any PayPal fees on those transfers either oh okay okay I misheard something then somewhere we do charts for the other crypto that you can buy on the PayPal ecosystem we do charge a transaction fee but not for a stable coin okay and so just going back to you know when I asked about the lines of revenue for PayPal you know how big does PayPal see this potential line of business be coming we we think that it can be in the very long term uh in the long term very relevant but but our expectations for the next year are moderate it's interesting because the these tends to be a very polarizing environment there is proof of existence right so there is 120 billion of stablecoin out there and we expect that we will capture a market share there but we also expect that we will help enlarge the the pie it's interesting because I saw a report I think it was an analyst report a couple of days ago that we're saying that stable coins will go from 122 billion today to 2.8 trillion in five years that is a lot so there is a 22x increase in in five years obviously if that happens this becomes very very relevant but if you ask me I believe that this is a multi-year play uh we want to walk before we we run it is important that we get adoption in the right way in these use cases and the growth I believe it will happen but we're in this for the for the long game and it's going to be a multi-year journey and in the app how will it be presented or how is it being presented to people um is it just another option amongst all their payment options or is there any kind of incentive for them to try to use it or to try to you know obtain some so it is shown in two different places the first one is when you go to the app there is a crypto section of the app and you will see that as one additional token so you will see on the tokens that we support you will see Bitcoin and ethereum like on and Bitcoin cash and you will see POI USD as well and you can buy it and sell it and transfer to external wallets from there and then when you are in a checkout transaction we are big Believers in choice for our consumers so we are not predefining how we're we're not stealing them toward any specific payment method so we will it will appear as another payment option option but it will not be even more proponent as a checkout if you have decided that you want to use PayPal and pay with your credit card then your credit card will be shown first and the others will be shown after that uh with byusd being one of those all right well this has been a very fasting discussion is there anything I didn't ask you about pyusd that you'd like to mention I think that as I said the beginning we do believe that the stable coins are are the killer app for these that the advantages in terms of settlement time and and cost and speed are very important I believe that it's going to take a while for mainstream adoption in payments so we are we are taking a a crypto first approach and then starting to explore some of the retail cases and I do believe we were talking about competition I do believe that we will definitely be taking some market share there but I also believe that there is a ton of appetite in the market for additional stable coins that are fully back and regulated and pro and hopefully this is a good move for the industry in general all right well thank you so much for coming on Unchained thank you so much Laura thank you

that time I'm so grateful to Michael that he could do this and I'm sure you'll love him now over to Michael hello and thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap this week the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission announced its intention to appeal a partial defeat in its ongoing case against Ripple Labs the regulator will seek an interlocutory appeal meaning the rest of the case will continue as planned specifically targeting the part of the decision related to the sales of xrp on exchanges and other distributions including offers and sales of xrp using algorithms also known as programmatic sales in July judge Annalisa Torres ruled that some of Ripple's programmatic sales did not violate Securities laws while direct sales to institutional investors were in fact Securities in a letter to the judge overseeing the case SEC Deputy Chief of crypto assets Jorge tenrero argued that the review happening at the same time as the case would quote Advance determination of this litigation in an efficient manner which is lawyer speak for not not waste any time tenrero proposed that Ripple should have until August 16 to respond with the SEC filing an opening brief two days later Gary DeWall senior counsel at the catton law firm told crypto news site the block that it quote would not be surprising if Ripple makes a similar request and quote regarding institutional sales the appeal process requires approval from the United States District Court southern district of New York and the court of appeals followed by permission from the second circuit in a week filled with legal developments surrounding the crypto exchange FTX former co-ceo Ryan Salome is negotiating a guilty plea with Federal prosecutors for alleged offenses including campaign Finance law violations according to a Bloomberg report it's unclear whether or not salome's plea could involve testimony against former FTX CEO Sam bankman freed whose criminal trial is set for October bankman freed himself faces legal challenges in a letter on August 8 the Department of Justice confirmed bankman freed will face campaign Finance related charges and sino-global capital A crypto VC has filed a 67 million dollar claim against FTX and sister company Alameda a federal judge has set a hearing for August 11 to consider revoking bankman Freed's bail potentially moving him from house arrest to jail in New York adding to the complexity the New York Times and separately Harvard Law Professor Lawrence tribe have argued that Sam bankman Freed's gag order should be lifted according to a report by the block over the weekend in an affidavit dated August 1 tried argued that bankman freed has a constitutional right to speak to the media stating quote the order effectively precludes Mr bankman freed from saying anything that might influence the Public's perception of him in ways that could help make the presumption of his innocence more than a slogan end quote in an August 2 letter the deputy general counsel for the Times David McGraw also opposed the gag order citing public interest and First Amendment rights the crypto Community is closely watching the SEC as it reviews applications for spot Bitcoin exchange traded funds or ETFs CEO of Galaxy digital Mike novogratz reportedly expressed optimism on an earning call stating that approval is a question of quote when not if and quote and that he expects a decision within six months investment managers BlackRock and Invesco have amended their filings to include surveillance sharing agreements with coinbase a move seen as crucial for approval meanwhile CEO of Arc invest Kathy Wood anticipates another delay for ark's proposed spot Bitcoin ETF optimistically suggesting that the SEC May approve multiple ETFs simultaneously though of course another possibility is the latest batch of Bitcoin spot ETF applications gets shot down just like all the others globalx has also refiled its application marking the ninth Act active spot Bitcoin application the anticipation has triggered cautions excitement and speculation with decisions expected as soon as this week however non-profit markets Watchdog better markets urged the SEC to reject spot Bitcoin ETF applications citing ongoing concerns about investor harm and potential criminal activities elsewhere the U.S federal reserve has unveiled a new supervision program to oversee Banks engaged with crypto assets and any of a variety of distributed Ledger Technologies including blockchain according to a statement from the central bank's Board of Governors the program will be integrated into the existing supervisory process with experts designated to work with banks involved in these quote novel activities the degree of supervision will be risk-based presumably meaning the more contact with crypto the more requirements and certain banks will be routinely monitored depending on their engagement level State Banks wishing to venture into dollar token or stable coin activity must received written non-objection from the Federal Reserve the central bank's guidance emphasizes the need for appropriate risk management including systems to identify and monitor potential risks such as cyber security and illicit Finance threats while some on social media have portrayed the program as quote legitimizing the technology by now it should be clear to anyone who has been paying attention to similar programs announced by the SEC over the years that having a path to compliance is no guarantee of approval maker Dow's decentralized die liquidity Market spark protocol has restricted access to us-based users and just in case anyone else using a virtual private Network or VPN to cover their tracks sparking criticism from privacy Advocates the move coincides with the implementation of an enhanced die savings rate or edsr temporarily raising the die savings rate DSR to 8 percent in order to incentivize higher participation maker Dow found Aruna Christensen has since proposed reducing the edsr to maximum value of only five percent though still higher than the original amount citing unintended consequences of the rate being exploited by large-scale ethereum whales The Proposal also aims to ensure the edsr benefits regular dye users rather than just the richest investors the changes in the die savings rate and the VPN blockade have ignited debates on sustained ability of such an offer concerns about the decentralization of the matter and the balance between profit and principle within the crypto community [Music] World coin the eyeball

a laugh today something a little on the lighter side should tune in to hear stand-up comedian Jenny Hogan elucidate Elon Musk confirming there will be no cryptocurrency for X formerly known as Twitter that's all for this week looking forward to seeing you next week mint Dogecoin accounts are warning people to be wary of news that Twitter X is launching its own cryptocurrency Elon has said he's never going to launch one so these stories are all fake which should be obvious from the fact that they have about 50 000 likes on x.com actually though Elon didn't say all never launch an X token he said we'll never launch an X token which is really inspiring I didn't realize there were still people working in X honestly I also think the news of no X token itself is promising maybe Elon plans on shutting down the whole site why doesn't Elon want X to have its own cryptocurrency well not to brag but the website formerly known as Twitter actually doesn't need to get into crypto to lose a ton of money Elon is also enmeshed in a multi-million dollar insider trading lawsuit over the time that he changed the Twitter logo to the Dogecoin Shiba Inu dog investors have accused musk of doing it deliberately to drive up the price of Dogecoin 36 000 and then let it crash well he has a real pattern that's exactly what he did with Twitter except for the part where he drove the price up thanks so
