and then going further down I mean FDX other than like today's big announcement people were scratching their head what is the denouement and what does the numerator look like what does the denominator look like I have no clue is it 10 billion of claims and 12 billion of claims is it 15 billion of claims and also on the numerator like well who's owning what like what is in the liquid portfolio what about the Venture stuff there's not a lot of Solana projects that gives us a lot of dead now like I'm not saying it is I'm just saying these are the questions that get asked within the stress firms and they start saying okay we need an even bigger discount and then there's wallets moving around you hear about stuff on Twitter like while it's moving around and so again now not only the new we don't know what's going to happen but the numerator and denominator are very fuzzy and so you need bigger differences between what you pay and what you have the opportunity of making
