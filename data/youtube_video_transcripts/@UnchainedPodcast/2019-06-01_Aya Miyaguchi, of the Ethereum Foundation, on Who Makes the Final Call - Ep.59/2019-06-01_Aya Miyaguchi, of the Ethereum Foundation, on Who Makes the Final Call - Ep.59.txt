director of the etherium foundation will Kamiya hi thank you for having me it's a pleasure to be here tell me about your background and how you got into crypto sure my back on Oxford my first professional career started as a high school teacher in Japan and my mission was to tell my students the importance of going outside of the country once in their life and then but also I myself as a teacher I thought it was very wrong that teachers did not go out there to see the world or did not try other professional experiences I just cooked my job and then came to the US and then I was actually I wanted to first I wanted to get a job and then for that I need to go to graduate school and then while I was studying I heard about Bitcoin first aaaand in 2011 and that was my first encounter with anything about baktun and it took me a while to understand is what bitcoin was as there were no any good materials to learn for non-technical people like me and however after I learned about the major benefits of Bitcoin I thought it'd be very helpful for financial inclusion and social impact and then yeah my focus when I was working on my MBA was sustainable business and I personally was specifically interested in microfinance to make women financially independent in developing countries and I thought big going to be very helpful for that although now a firm can do a lot more but back then it was Bitcoin that I first always very interested in and then in early 2013 I got an opportunity to join croc in exchange when clocking just started hiring and there were only a few people in the team back then and we did not even have an office and yeah so but the team was based in San Francisco and I was fortunate to have amazing experience that were honored by the people who studied the crypto industry that's how I got into the space first and what did you do a Kraken exactly so I was I was managing Krakens Japan operations over URI and then I became managing director for a croc in Japan after I studied it in today and then be with the team there but before even doing that right after I started doing things in Japan Hmong collapse they just happened to be in Japan and then there there wasn't any any market there barking 2014 early 2014 it was and then more than 90% of people users of magog's were outside of Japan so the whole country was kind of shocked by hearing first like hearing the name Bitcoin originally because people did not know anything about it and then also how it affected a lot of people and then lost a lot of money and there so it all started with a very negative image there in Japan and so I thought I needed to do something before even starting a business there I reached out to the government group who was in charge of doing some research on Bitcoin and also potentially regulate the space but since they had no knowledge about the technology I reached out to them and asked well first explained who I was and then that that I had experienced in the space but also I also had experience like working with a self-regulatory organization bachlin like in the u.s. there was a Google code data digital asset transfer Authority which was founded by early industry people or co-ceos of like from on the startup sequence startup yeah so I reached out to them and then I asked if they needed help I can help and then they said how can you just meet with us right away and so that was the beginning of the conversation where the government actually decided not to regulate the space buckland and then which I thought was a smart idea because the market was too small but also they instead they asked us to on create a serf regulatory organization in Japan so I founded that with some other members but kracken was the only experienced company there so I ended up heavily being involved in all of regulatory conversations which led to the existing regulations now that started in 2017 and is that digital currency trade organization the Japan authority of digital asset yes okay and so what were those conversations like I mean they happened over a number of years it looks like and if in the beginning you were advocating not to issue regulations in the beginning how did the regulations last year come about and why did you think that that if you thought that was the right time why did you think that was very time yeah so reasonably like I said there was no market people did not know anything about technology and then it just started with the magog's unfortunate a case so in the media was talking only negative about negative stories in the before regulating like it's just like including the regulators including the people at the government including people who were writing about the story they needed to know learn about the technology and what that can do so in the beginning it was it was a smart idea not to regulate the space but like we kind of formed this group and then created this server for every flight l years for mainly exchanges like like Clarkin and what they need to do for kyc or security and then all the lists of thing that was mostly based on what we were doing in the US but tried to make a little bit more flexible and that was in 2014 and then after that glossary the country recovered was recovering from the shock from Mongols and the market started to grow with other players and then the industry as industry were growing I think there were other issues such as financial institutions we're not comfortable enough to work with crypto companies because they it wasn't regulated and but there were a lot of opportunities are a lot of interest there that big companies wanted to work with the technology in some way and and then around that time the regulator's decided to regulate the space but they were still talking to the industry group or what would be the best way not that they listened to all the requests that we made but at least them we provided information they listened and then it was around the time that the if without the regulations the space would miss a lot of opportunities and then and then so that the original draft was created at the end of 2016 and then it went if that in 2017 in April so I only really know those regulations and broad strokes like I know that bitcoin was named a legal currency I know that later the some of the crypto exchanges were licensed can you just draw out for me what those regulations were and what the significance was and what you thought were the pros and cons of the different regulations sure so that that regulation over that specifically that was created and out started last year in 2017 was for exchanges and and their payment processors and then the mainly that was for to provide again the list of thing that required to excuse it so that there won't be any money money laundering or security hacking or the similar thing that the US was doing and then mainly the list of thing that is required to get the license both what we call it in English its license it was supposed it wasn't supposed to be a license they called it as their registration but it turned out to be a little more difficult than anyone thought would be to finish the registration because most of the quiet areas all most of the requirements were still created based on the conventional financial regulations that were that existed before okay and to go back to what you were saying earlier about gun I know that Kraken was appointed to help mount Cox investigate what happened to the lost or stolen bitcoins and also to help them pay back the creditors what it was correct and able to accomplish with that role so yes first of all it was kind of like requested by the founder of Clark in this fishery because he cared about the community more than even just the business out of this but so in the night since it happened in Japan I reached out to the trustee magog's bankruptcy proceeding case and then explained who you are and what the technology can do for to make that immunity because it happened because of the this because of it conduct at the same time it didn't really happen because of the technology of a con it's it it could what happened with anything and so I explained that but I was so explained what we could do how we could help them because they have no idea what to do with this case especially because a huge amount of asset a huge amount of lost asset were was Bitcoin in them and then I'm so cloggin was able to sign on the ugly man to be a supporting company of this man Cox bankruptcy proceeding case and then very requested us to support them help any technical questions they might have but also especially investigating that last Bitcoin where it went and then it was impossible for them to do everything on their own even if they hire some consulting technology company and so they knew that they needed some expert from the industry so we were there to kind of support their work and not just us doing everything it's more like a real supporter to instruct them like how to do the investigation and and also it was decided for the first time in the industry to do the payout with Bitcoin and originally it was supposed to be also beneficial for clock-in but because of a lot of complexity and then some existing lawsuits which hasn't happened yet unfortunately and it's still ongoing and then during that time things have changed and a lot of things have happened so it o'clock and didn't do it for her the business benefit only although it did have a lot of like um you know reputation positive reputation impact you mean helping cracking or hurting the Bitcoin community or what do you mean right now what about both of them I mean like a clock and try to help the community try to save the creditors who were a victim mom the magog's which was which was also part of the industry no it was sort of like a community effort that Clarkin tried to do okay I wanted to go back to something you said which was you said something about how the payment or the payout was supposed to be in Bitcoin but I think I don't know what you're referring to basically I think the big controversy is that they're actually paying back their creditors in dollars and not refunding them the amount that they had lost in bitcoins so what do you mean by that I know so originally it was decided that way that the Bitcoin was if you think about the cost of wiring money to the all over the world because night more than 90% of users were outside Japan but the bankruptcy case was in Japan so the asset was in Japan and then if you were to send do to pay out using fiat currency by using regular bank wires and then back then that the cost of doing that was too much considering the whole amount of asset that was there and then after that that Bitcoin Clause Pleiss went really high and the trustee started to worry if they didn't sell Bitcoin they might get blamed and yeah or something like that and we blamed for what blamed for not making more asset but but there are a lot of like other little things that are they were yeah that is very controversial I wasn't really involving that this part of discussion okay so at some point he he'd the we're talking about the trustee no nobuaki kobayashi is his name he changed his mind and decided to reimburse them in dollars is that what happened it's more like her if they sell Bitcoin they can make huge amount of money and and then that was yeah that was what they thought yeah I think the price of Bitcoin about there again like I wasn't really involved in this discussion but okay yeah to me it doesn't make any sense just I mean I know that's not that wasn't your decision but it's a little bit like if you had bitcoins you would want the bitcoins back like especially cuz the price is so volatile but anyway let's move on to discuss the etherion foundation what is the theorem foundation and what is its mission and what does the foundation do yes so the a-tearin foundation is is a foundation and then other owners and the organization's to support the development and research of the 3m technology atrium that also support the community activities and effort which also support the development research obviously a.m. and in the mission is to basically make they make lyrium as best as possible in by supporting community by facilitating research and development effort and what do you do in your role as executive director so that's I just joined the foundation of Fisheries instability this year and I yes I so I basically coordinate and organize that the Foundation's activities within like internally but also the foundation has even bigger is all working with the community members and so doing education during glance and and then those are I think that our main focuses of our activities and then making communication better so there are a couple of things that we want to do better by hearing what people thought about the Foundation's activities before but also I personally did not know if I had the interim foundation was before in detail before joining the foundation so I want to make it more transparent and clear to the word what the foundation is what we're doing but also how we can work together with the community members because the team has very amazing community which is really the great thing about a theme and what were those things that you said that the community has asked from the foundation I think what it wasn't maybe clear which we are planning to make it more clear but also make better at communicating is that it wasn't really clear what the Foundation's focus was compared to what the community is what other members in the community is doing basically like why the foundation exists when the theorem technology is there and then other community members are building other stuff and then some of them are actually working on some solutions that the foundation is working on too so why why we are here what is the what is you know what what are the main focuses of the foundation so that is one of the requests is to make it more transparent and then communicate that better yeah and how do you plan to do that because I do know and this might be something that you're only obliquely referring to but I know that the former executive director Ming Chan was widely criticized and complained about in the theorem community for being controlling for not being communicative for not building out an infrastructure for the organization so how do you plan to manage the foundation and prevent these issues from coming up again yeah so well I I do think she did a lot of important things too and just to make it clear because there are a lot of difficulties and then challenges that a term had before I joined but but it is too since the industry is going and in the ether in community is growing the demand is higher but the foundation has to grow in a way that I don't think that necessary means the foundation has to become bigger in terms like that the number of people we having a team or it's more about this is very but I they it's great about the community and also it's a challenge it's very decentralized and in order to solve them call them or one one challenge like we work together with the community like it's not the foundation to control everything or solve everything in-house when that has to stay that way because the technology itself is also decentralized and in order to do that instead of us trying to do everything in the house we already we have been working with the community members and then it is make everything as a community effort you don't really care food as what job we do care at the end how much easier you can means improve as a whole so we want to make everything as a community effort and then the foundation is a facilitator but also in a coordinator we're not the manager or we're not controlling anything so that kind of message we have to send and then in order to do that we're trying to get more guns and then work on more education on board and then and then also again like making the communication better and when you talk about the community who exactly were you talking about like who are the people that you end up talking to or or the other foundation members to end up talking to it's basically anyone who is doing anything resistant that's kind of a simple way to say either it's individuals or an organization and an organization like EA or other community members it can be individual who is just contributing to the ethernet acknowledge e because it's open source and then some of them just Brandt already started contributing to the technology and then but we can see that because it's open and if they are contributing a lot like we try to we should acknowledge them more or better then that's what we want to do by giving a glance and whether it's an individual or it's an organization or its team or company and that yeah so whoever that is that it's part of the community and also any decision maker making like ideally we want to talk to as many groups as possible okay and earlier when you reference ei just for people who don't know that's the etherium Enterprise Alliance which is a whole bunch of big multinationals around the world that are building things on the etherium source code I I think though that a lot of them are using it for private blockchain projects am i right yes okay so it was something that I wanted to ask you was about some big questions that the etherium community has been mulling recently one is whether or not to unfreeze some funds that were accidentally locked up this has generated some really passionate debate there was i I should have looked up the dollar amount but a huge amount of ether I think got locked up by some bug in a smart contract where somebody accidentally hit what is sort of like a kill button in a way that locked up these funds another one that came about sort of with an April Fool's joke that I avital ik posted online was a blog post where he raised the question of whether or not to cap the supply of ether or to inflate the money supply in perpetuity although has generated some serious discussion so how do these kinds of questions get decided and what role does the etherium Foundation play in making those decisions so again like I think I I'm not supposed to make a really public comment or something like this because I'm like other developers like if I do it it makes it look like I'm representing the foundation but as the foundation I think like I said it's the community who should decide on important decisions and and yes batalik sometimes an apple is a my dear but he's not really forcing that to be picked by the community but he's suggesting the idea was his is like a as an individual and he doesn't mean to control the although he he does have been friends of people try to know what his intention is but his intention is never to control the decision-making and and there yeah like all the governance discussions that with I think it's still very like it it's very it's it's discussed in an open way and then we also had this discussion at a big event in Paris ECC in in a month ago and then that was there was for the community and an opportunity for the community discussed to discuss what other challenge that that we have with the current governance structure and what can be what should we discussed and then also what can be improved it wasn't really like there wasn't really a good conclusion to that because isn't that it's not an easy answer there is not an easy answer for that but but the foundation can facilitate these discussions but at the same time the foundation should never be the one to make the decision we're gonna keep discussing this issue and other issues around the etherium foundation but first I'd like I'd take a quick break to tell you about our fabulous sponsors

I was speaking with IME Iguchi the executive director of the etherium foundation so dakota back to the topic of what it is that the community wants how do you decide that do you have good ways of measuring which option has more support one way or another amongst token holders and how do you account for the fact that maybe there might be some like let's say Bitcoin maximalists or people from a competing smart contract platform that try to sway the decisions within the etherion community how do how do you account for those things again the foundation doesn't have to decide I don't think the foundation has to decide which opinion that the atrium should pick or to select as the answer because it's supposed to be the community and there we need to I think we need to provide more opportunity for the community to be able to have better communication or better discussions and that it's it is is it is a technology III means the technology and then also it involves discussion about the technology but most of the time it's it's it's very human and then it involves some ethic questions and like legal questions and then put it it requires a lot of different experts to for the discussion itself but also the foundation is only the facilitator of the discussions and we don't need to pick which decisions should be used so the laws the final call come down to Vitalik himself and nobody else because some some entity whether it's a person or a group needs to make the final decision right and to say okay discussions over we're going to move forward with this action the finer this is infer that for the decision for how the organization work or about what the foundation is supposed to do or that should be of course discussed internally but how the technology is used or how the governance should be is not by the foundation or not by the bit allocator I mean he also has his own opinion as an individual who contributes Allah to defame photos but again like it's it shouldn't be anyone from the foundations or could be like anyone from the foundation also can possess the idea or be an individual who wants to be who prefers one way or another but it doesn't like the decisions when you say decisions anything related to the governance or anything that this room that you just pointed or not it should not be done by the foundation is what I meant sue then who but who does make that final call for final call for what any kind of decision like about you know whether or not to unfreeze those frozen funds or whether or not to cap the supply things like that oh well it is the community and then it has to make it official yeah the final call meaning like if the of course there should be a way to find a way to what is the final call of the fun of the community which we can do better about like providing an opportunity to discuss have a discussion between the community community but again the the final call for that it can be suggested by anyone in the community and then the community has to come to the consensus okay and do you have a process for for that at the moment we mean like not we at the only the foundation but we were working with the community members again like we had this discussion last month and then other more discussions are kind of being planned to being planned to happen at the next big event and so that's like we were we were trying to be out what are the best way to get there and I think something that I've been wondering and I think a lot of people are wondering is what was the application process and screening process you underwent to be chosen as the executive director that's her a good question I think I was so after especially since last year over a couple years ago I started exploring different products in social impact drafting space and then I was actually planning to start my own social impact studio and then so basically I was I unfortunately I received a lot of offers but and then when I decided to pursue the next thing especially toward social impact every year yes and I when I decided to leave Clark and I started exploring that area and then I said and no to all different offers but this one was kind of like too important for me because oh my oh the idea that I had or the product that I was supporting but not a thing of the day they did not succeed without with him so it was just my party it was offered to me yes and like you didn't even apply for it they just came to you I didn't apply for it but I'm pretty sure they were talking to other people there are people too I didn't really ask other I mean the process itself because I'm I was the one who joined but yes I didn't I didn't apply for it but I was I was asked by yes people in the community what was there even an open application process I don't well I don't know well I don't think it was open because I didn't see it and then you probably didn't say it no no I didn't see ya soon yeah the pursuit for decentralized project do you think the process should be done in this fashion that's a very question I did I think it's sure of all it maybe whoa that's my V I'm a big question to ask yeah but well I think it's a good question or I think it can be grabbing of course open and then the community could have decided if if any community members think that's the best way and then when that is proposed at some point but I think it's story okay to be that way but at the same time I think it was it involved a lot of things that are it's it's not just community and then it's about the Foundation's organization and then so they needed someone who had experience working globally and long experience in the crypto space in which I was told but there was an open process yes and then I think it's like that's a good idea right like yeah and if you who interviewed you who decided who should be the next executive director I talked to a lot of members in the team which team with like the existing foundation members or existing foundation members yes like Ming and vitalik those were the only two I was aware of yes that's a good question no it was Vitalik but also other people like researchers and developers in the team so you mentioned earlier that you are working on the Foundation's top priorities what are those right now so mainly three focuses and then one is grunt and which is which we already talked and given grants did a community project or individual who are contributing to these damn solutions and together with the foundation or individually the second is community development and supporting new regional community to launch which like the communities are going and then a lot of likely new meetups are happening in the world and then if they need support we're happy to support us and speakers or if they need financial support like we can discuss and also working with universities or creating it educational materials and also facilitate the initiative of Education and also that includes some like a regulatory discussions sometimes we are asked to give advice to regulators and the last one is yes the research and development that that would be a theory that you you can see that the core development and research work that the foundation is taking the initiative but some of them are actually not just done by the foundation members and then through the Community Grants and also educational or a community development effort we can facilitate in the airport in a better way not not just doing that in-house and you know as you can tell from what you have said but also from some of my questions I think there is a big question around how best to govern an open source project are there any models of open source governance that you look to for guidance not many specific but by talking to a lot of people it's it's about any any open source project but also like something like like Linux Foundation but I think what we are trying to accomplish is something very new because this is very decentralized and it's not not just the technology is open-source so we've been discussing the new way of organizing everything which we just started doing this like that they're having a lot of discussions in turnery but also hiring more people on the operation side because that was something the foundation didn't have before me joining and what what worth I can't speak what would those roles be well we don't maybe set like very specific titles but something like grant a grant more and more operations members for the grant team and the more operation members for the education team and then because those are very important to work with the community yeah well how many foundation members are there currently so it is roughly about 50 developers and then also 15 researchers if be call it like researchers and developers and then there are really only like a few less than a few operations people including myself okay and so is that what the a theory how nation budget is largely going toward right now it's like their salaries but then also these grants that you guys are giving out yes okay so um to go to some of the priorities that you mentioned and I'll see your background because you studied microfinance and we're talking about how you are drawn to blockchain because of its potential for fostering Financial Inclusion do you have plans now for the ethereum foundation to help promote financial inclusion and some fashion if so what are those plans most of their our of course like I will personally support those products that protoid projects or yeah it could be product for sure keep doing that but as as the other foundation we will focus on that the core infrastructure development first so that all the applications that are built on top of his name can perform better such as like the scale scaling issue need to be solved and then and then that sort of focus now and in directory that I believe is going to support those financial inclusion products or part project and what are some examples of Financial Inclusion projects that you think are promising well there like it will it's something like microfinance can be just just to solve the payment part that's useful but at the same time is a theme you can use spunk or smart contract to use the technology for like identifications or loan takers background or like a like how you actually manage the loan process you can use smart contract but that that can actually be very useful and then other Financial Inclusion therefore it's like you simply just give financial independence by using crypto currencies is also another thing and because the crypto currencies can do a lot of things more than like a lot more than fiat currencies and but also it is not really controlled by one single country in which and sometimes it's a problem and you can trust the country or you and you can trust the government or the bank or if they don't have the act when they don't have the access to banks that even more so and to go back to regulation which he mentioned is one of the priorities I noticed in December you had tweeted the most important role of a self-regulatory body is not just to regulate the space but also to educate regulators to find the best solution for the long-term success of both the industry in the country no point of having an industry org if they cannot argue with regulators what regulations right now in which countries do you think are reasonable and work well for the crypt of ecosystem in which regulations do you think are not productive I personally things that though any the ones that are not too aggressive being me quick decision yet or that could so far the best one or the smarter ones if you if they move too quick or make decisions to click without really deeply discussing the potential outcomes or app identity because the industry moves very quick that this happens in Japan this happened in Japan too like when the regulation was first drafted and it went effective a few months later and then it it's it's just a it takes a long time for them to even like before the after they decided to read away and then coming up with the draft and then making an effective it almost took a year which is very long time for this space and then a lot of things pub cheese and then it's so they have to I could see that vigor it aside were kind of getting pressured with the new thing that keep happening in the industry and then something like ICO and and was not really part of the discussion when they first drafted that regulation so but I think it's it's important not to take too too aggressive decision on like if they can come up is the regulation but not me not to make it to unflexible so that they can not be be you know act flexibly later and when you said that a cerium wants to have this role in education as well when it comes to regulators how do you do that when there's is somewhere in the ballpark of 200 countries around the world how would you have many conversations going on so so we an add the lobbying organization so that's not our intention but sometimes we are asked to give advice from different different jurisdictions just because I think it's big we are a nonprofit that doesn't have business incentive and and then also the foundation does have history and technical background so that if they are missing any knowledge about the technology or if they don't but all the time that the regulator's do not have enough time to actually catch up with everything that happening in industry but also yeah they they they often look for advice from an expert but they don't know who to ask when any expert can have business intensives or money incentive and as a foundation since we are nonprofit but also our goal is to maintain that space as healthy as possible so we can just provide some advice and then they can use it or not but we are happy to give advices our our approach but we yeah like you said we can really travel to each country - I don't like convince them like this is the way that you should - it's more like err when there we are asked to give advice we try to do our best interesting I mean I totally get your point about how they might have a little bit more comfort with a non-profit but given how closely the foundation is tied to Vitalik and the fact that obviously he has a lot of ether himself I don't know if the the analogy is like exactly perfect but to keep talking about regulation I wanted to ask also about if there are any new regulatory developments we'll see coming out of Japan because I think some people thought that it was pretty forward-looking that Japan you know made Bitcoin illegal currency and that it had these licensed exchanges but are there any other new regulations in the works the only thing I'm aware although I I talked to them very often not but they don't maybe I don't think they tell me everything that they're having their mind but they have been talking or yeah we have been talking about some I feel a best practices the but I don't know whether they're planning to provide any regulations very soon or not and something else I want to ask you about which you may not know entirely because you don't work there anymore is I did see that crack and recently pulled out of Japan do you have any insight into how conditions there have changed for exchanges and why crackin might have decided to close its operations in Japan yeah so I don't think I should speak for them because I know no I'm not representing them anymore but I think things things in Japan have become a little tighter and a tense after the hack hacking at a coin check which was one of the biggest exchanges there and a huge amount of nem coin was hacked at the exchange and then since then things have become very very more like I would think um like ten cents tighter is that I know okay and it's something else I want to ask about was that you tweeted about how when you started working in crypto in 2013 they were very few women I was wondering if you have had any experiences in crypto that you think you wouldn't have had if you were a man what lives are there mmm interesting I actually did not really feel any huge disadvantage or advantage as the women it seems like other people did but it is true I just stated the fact that there since it was I think someone was mentioning of all a woman in blockchain and then trying to encourage more women in the space and I do agree it's always better to have diversity whether it's a gender or a race or like I think it's better to have diversity to have different opinions to have more balanced ideas I don't think it necessary that means that we need to definitely have more women but when I joined I was it is true that when I went to first Bitcoin conference back in 2013 may in 2013 in San Jose that was there we cloggin had a couple women but they were I didn't we didn't see any human women in other companies or at the event so I felt awkward that way for sure not that I had any like this ton advantage or anything though it is it is great that we have more women because just just because I believe in diversity yeah and in your role as executive director that theorem foundation you probably deal with a lot of men and probably men who don't often work with other women does that present any challenge or or not I personally do not feel any challenges because of that I do believe that we would love to have more diversity in terms of the gender difference gender balance but no I don't really have any difficulties but I was so maybe because I was a teacher before my mom I think I'm used to yeah being with young gentlemen I think it's it's yeah it's I don't you know they're very gentle and then very a pure and and also very passion or a aid oriented which which is not just because they're a man but yeah I just feel fortunate to be with very smart generating people and do you have any ideas on how to get more women involved in crypto I guess we just have to inspire more women like we do have a couple women in researchers and developers though I think it's just to show that they are working with us is inspiring and then actually I was asking Chao away in the research group like she's researcher as user developer in in Taiwan I was telling her to be got more events in Asian countries where gender there is more gender gap and then I thought that would be inspiring for women there to feel that oh they can also learn and then join the group on an organization like the Athan foundation well
