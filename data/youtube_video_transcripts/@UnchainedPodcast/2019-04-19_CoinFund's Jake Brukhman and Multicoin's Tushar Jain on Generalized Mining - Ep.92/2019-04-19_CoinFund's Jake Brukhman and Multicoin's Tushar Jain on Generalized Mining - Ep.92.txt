trend that some people are calling it generalized mining others calling it mining 2.0 here to discuss our Jake bruckman founder CEO and managing director of coin fund and to Shara Jane managing partner of multi : Capital welcome Jake and - char hi Laura thank you thank you for having me hi Laura hi Jake really excited to talk about this with you guys today this is going to be a fun conversation thanks for having me on Laura big fan of the podcast Jake since you haven't been on the show before let's start with you what's your background and what does coin fund do sure my background is in mathematics and computer science spent about five years in the hedge fund world in New York on the financial technology side I was then a technical product manager and engineer at Amazon for about two years working on ad tech products and then CTO of FinTech startup called triton research where we did a lot of very interesting financial analysis on private technology companies I learned about Bitcoin in 2011 and have been sort of into space ever since and when I saw you know the etherium white paper that really made a lot of sense to me and coin fund was formed around the concept of building portfolios to diversify digital assets so coin fund launched in July of 2015 as one of the first crypto asset focused funds in the US and Tushar although you were previously on the show with your partner Kyle Somani why don't you briefly tell us how you got in a crypto and what multi coin does absolutely so multi coin is a thesis-driven crypto fund I got into crypto actually through a similar story to Jake where cerium was really what drew me in to the crypto world I had seen Bitcoin before and Bitcoin was interesting to me but the scope of Bitcoin was just so limited and etherium to me was a much more ambitious vision and I saw new ways to coordinate human economic activity that weren't possible before and I knew that I had to be in this space once I fully understood the implications of what this technology could enable so back in 2017 early 2017 my partner Kyle and I decided to launch multi core capital and we went live last year a slew of crypto hedge funds launched in 2017 but I know several of them are now just calling themselves crypto funds since they don't really act like traditional hedge funds and Jake I noticed you've been using that phrase crypto fund as well why like what what's the job of being a partner die cooked have fun really like and how does that differ from managing a traditional hedge fund yeah thanks Laura I mean I think that running a crypto fund is actually quite a bit different than you know running a hedge fund or running a VC fund I think crypto funds you know tend to be sort of structured and the vocation that that one participates and when when working at a crypto fund it has to be tailored to the asset class and you have a really interesting asset class here you have an asset class of digital assets for for most their liquidity profiles are quite different than what you would see in in you know venture capital private equity kind of markets and more than anything else the technology you know around digital assets and things like aetherium and and a Bitcoin and decentralized networks in general it's pretty advanced and requires some you know probably pretty deep knowledge so the approach that we have you know taken a coin fund is that we're pretty multidisciplinary team we bring together computer science math as well as financial experience and experience on Wall Street and investing to try to make sense of the space and then when the fund manages assets I think it's a bit of a hybrid between you know typically what people do and in venture capital where they evaluate early-stage teams and kind of make long-term bets on the products that they're building and then you know also managing a portfolio of highly liquid assets that trade on 24-hour markets so I think you know crypto funds kind of combine those two two disciplines and really require a lot of different skills to to make sense of the space and to shard what is what how would you compare and contrast them yeah I think Jake's completely right here crypto fund has caught on as a term because I think this is a new type of asset management firm we are combining venture capital type diligence and venture capital type effort and work you know we're working with the teams to help make them successful which is more akin to a VC firm than a traditional hedge fund however we do operate in public markets and we need to be able to leverage liquidity in order to earn the best returns possible so we are also somewhat like a hedge fund in that regard and then there are other aspects of what we do which are something brand-new which are very crypto native which i think is what we're going to talk about today around how we can help the portfolio teams in this very blockchain native or crypto native way with these different tactics and I think all of those combined together is what makes us a crypto fund and not just a VC fund or not just a hedge fund yeah that is the perfect segue to talking about generalized mining why don't you guys describe for me all the ways in which crypto funds can support to centralize projects and then explain what generalized mining is and how that fits in this larger universe you know just stepping back for a second and just thinking about this concept of what does generalize mining mean let me just say the following so I think over time what we're seeing is more and more decentralized networks being built in the world right so around 2015 the decentralized networks that we were very familiar with were cryptocurrency networks like Bitcoin maybe asset issuance networks like counterparty or NXT or bitshares and then etherium came along and created a decentralized network which enabled turing-complete smart contracts and kind of subsumed you know the previous to the world that we live in in in 2018 is a little bit more advanced right so we see a proliferation of decentralized networks and it feels like they're poised to proliferate further and the applications of those networks are actually quite diverse right so today we not only see smart contract platforms and crypto currencies we also see decentralized networks for storage for computation we see social media networks implemented as decentralized networks such as in the case of steam it we see different decentralized networks for various kinds of computational services like live peer which does video transcoding we see financial services like lending protocols and exchange protocols and the picture that begins to emerge is that you know in this world of very decentralized networks that have very specific applications and very specific domains it turns out they're not companies they don't you know typically have a management team these are public networks and yet they need you know a variety of supply-side kind of services to function right so in in Bitcoin those services are provided by miners and the service that they're providing is transaction validation right say ministerium when you go over to a social media network like Steam it you have people creating content and then you have other people or even BOTS curating that content when you're in a storage network you have people providing storage and that could be from their laptop it could be from from a data center when you're in a some kind of you know decentralized finance network like a like a lending network then you need parties to come into that network and provide capital and so on and so forth and so the number of roles in decentralized network seems to be growing over time you know we used to have miners and users but then in proof of stake we have validators and users and now a new kind of role called a delegator which could be a user but could be a speculator or investor or just someone interested in securing the network you know when you go to a network like live peer out of the gate you have five roles you know and that includes kind of miners it includes transcoders it might include software nodes that are orchestrators for the hardware nodes to support the scalability of that network and so on and so forth and so when we get to this concept of generalized mining the way that I think about it is there is a world of opportunities there in decentralized networks that would allow third parties to come in and provide these kinds of vital you know supply-side services in exchange for compensation that's allocated by the network and those are financial opportunities they're an opportunities to make a return I think they're slightly different return opportunities than if you were just investing in a blockchain startup or some kind of decentralized network token because they have different economics in this space of generalized mining opportunities is also you know it's very diverse and different kind of players in the space fit better into different areas of you know of that set of opportunities yeah just dive a little bit deeper there the way that I like to explain this generalized mining role is that we are investors in these crypto networks these are early-stage projects and by being participants in these networks either on the supply or the demand side and occasionally acting in ways that may not seem economically rational for in a vacuum but are economically rational if you consider the entirety of the portfolio we are able to help increase the chances that our portfolio companies network effects actually catch on right so Jake talks a bit about live peer and I think live peer is a fantastic example all right would live here as a decentralized video transcoding network it has a classic chicken or egg problem and if we as investors can bring the chicken then that can help solve the chicken or egg problem and that's what I think at least from multi coin is the intention behind generalized mining or this evolving role of crypto investors is to use not only our capital but our technical know-how and our other resources in order to accelerate the network effects of these projects that were invested in so I agree with I agree with Tushar and it's it's in the context of this world it's really interesting to think about you know what is the role of specifically funds kind of within the set of these opportunities so so one thing that becomes you know really apparent is that a lot of staking networks today are coming out onto the market and they create an opportunity to help secure the network in exchange for sort of a return stream right and as a fund you know if you're holding digital assets and there's an opportunity to kind of make a turn that's that's there it's a very compelling opportunity for funds and it also comes with some competitive pressure right so so if like some fund adopts that strategy as a you know competitive way of making returns that might create some pressure on other funds to do the same and there there's probably a lot of other reasons why you know a fund might want to participate here you know they're you know if you're a good crypto fund you should be invested as Tushar alludes to and in the long-term success of your portfolio companies and if there's a way that you as an investor can can add value to the network that your portfolio company is building then that seems to be a compelling reason to engage that network and I'll give you a quick example you know if you look at layer 2 networks layer 2 payment networks kind of work on hubs today right and the the capitalization of a hub also determines the throughput of that network and so the more hubs you have the more capital is locked up in those hubs providing throughput kind of the more successful your your network is poised to be because you're helping to build the network effects of those payments right and if you as a fund who's invested in one of these projects can can add that value that becomes incredibly valuable for you know and measurable for the portfolio company yeah I think something that interests me is earlier you are also mentioning that some of the other ways you guys can invest in these projects are through equity or investing in the tokens directly so how do you compare with this kind of service with those types of support so Laura that's a really interesting question it's something that we we think a lot about both from the investor perspective in terms of you know where should we allocate capital and also from the perspective of how can we best support our investments we believe that most of the value that's created using this technology will be captured in tokens not in the equity of corporations there is a significant opportunity for these companies to emerge that build services on top of this technology however given how the value capture works and where the customer relationship really is and you know we're talking a little bit about aggregation theory here we expect that almost all of the value ends up being captured in the in the protocol itself or the token of the protocol itself so this actually presents another opportunity for good crypto investors because in order to help increase the chances of the protocol being successful it can be a good decision to actually invest in a company that's building on that protocol even if all things considered the protocol token itself presents a better risk adjusted return than the equity of that company and it would in many cases do so because if the company is successful it just drives most of the value back right into the protocol but once again we have a chicken or egg type problem the protocol can only be successful if many companies build on top of it and so it can be worth it to fund those companies kind of like a VC would save capital for a follow-on investment in future rounds I think you know it makes sense for crypto investors to reserve capital in the same way to invest in companies or other projects within that ecosystem that helps support their initial investment yeah I just realized that actually what this is is it's investing in tokens and then putting work into the network and it's sort of tracks I guess traditional VC where well depending on which firm you're talking about they would invest and then do a lot of work to help that startup but here it's more measurable and it's like actually and it's more technical is that a good way to think of it yeah I think so I would say so yeah and actually just a quick question I wanted to know how did you come up with this term general mining I think some others call it mining 2.0 are there any other terms yeah there's you know there's a bunch of people kind of discussing this idea I think you know for in the forefront of most people's minds today are staking networks like cosmos and tezo's and so a lot of companies tend to think of this vocation as we're gonna stake tokens and we're gonna make a return to me it's a little bit of a you know the opportunity set is a little bit more broad than that right so you have some opportunities that are very Hardware intensive right this is like classical mining this is providing storage is providing computation or building out data centers for various computational services these opportunities are very hardware intensive and you know that they need that economies of scale and they need that large capital I think in the in the middle of the opportunity space is a lot of these staking opportunities right and this is where a new network comes up the team provides some software that third parties can run such as node software and then that node comprises the network right in exchange and compensating those third parties with digital assets from the network and I think on the other side of the spectrum you have things that are you know a little bit more interesting in the sense that they are a little bit more proprietary so these are things like market making algorithms trading algorithms these are things like maybe creating a machine learning algorithm to curate content on a social media network like steam it and then performing better than others because your algorithm happens to be more advanced or something like that or if you think about the kind of services they're required by you know maker Dow when they liquidate CDP's right they need third parties to sort of make a you know an arbitrage decision about whether it would make sense to bid for a CDP and and get it liquidated and then make a little bit of a return on that and so what you're telling me is it sounds like generalized mining does not it's not limited to only proof of stake systems you can have this with a proof-of-work system or any type of consensus algorithm and it includes not only hardware plays but also software is that a good summary yeah III definitely I definitely agree with that you know people have called this also supply-side services or where network service provision in in generally you know I define this space as kind of any supply-side service provided by a third party to a decentralized network in exchange for kind of compensation usually but not always in digital assets allocated you know by the by the network to that third party so this is you know most of the time a sort of on protocol activity it's available globally because these networks are globally available in public you know and they present a variety of of different return opportunities so then because one question I was gonna ask you is whether the goal was to accumulate more tokens or earn a return or simply grow the value of each token but it sounds like it's kind of all three well I think you know if you if you take a look at what let's take staking is an example right if you you know if you take a look at most staking opportunities today this is an opportunity to take some tokens to you know usually lock them up in some way in a in a decentralized network there may be risks associated with that you know there's technology risk there's obsolescence risk and of course there's also sometimes risks on the protocol itself in terms of slashing but in return what you get is a you know a rate of return on your tokens in a token denominated way right so you might make 5% a year in tokens you might make about 20% of year I think most of the opportunities there you know tend to fall into that range and you know and then you ask yourself as an investor well am i lying on the kind of token denominated return to say whether this was a was this a good opportunity or am I really looking at the fiat denominated return of my tokens right and I think today you know the still the the Fiat denominated volatility of tokens is much much higher than the five to twenty percent token denominated return of these opportunities and so when someone goes into a staking opportunity I think today what they're saying is that we're still betting on the success and growth of this network this is still an investment decision for me but by participating in this staking opportunity I'm actually increasing and maximizing my exposure to this investment opportunity that I have decided upon so then with the returns from generalized mining how how do you think they would compare to either a traditional VC or just passively investing in tokens yeah well I think again so the staking opportunity is you know they have a certain profile where they have a certain rate of return there may be a certain set of risks if you go over into kind of other opportunities and one one that comes to mind is you know the live Pierre Merkel mine for example the life here in Merkel mine was essentially a decentralized airdrop where mmm you know software miners were incentivized to redeem an airdrop LPT which is life pure tokens to 2.6 million aetherium addresses and when participating in that kind of opportunity what you're doing as a miner is that you're helping the live peer network in a very early stage of its life cycle you're you're basically you're helping the you know the the distribution of the token and in doing so you're earning LPT and so you're taking a position in a token that really isn't isn't quite out on the market today there's there's very few venues where where trades today and there's very little liquidity and that's fine because this is an you know an early stage of the network but the return opportunity there you know is similar to what you would get if you were an early stage investor in live peer right like in the sense that if the token goes 10x then you have acquired ownership of the token you know in a similar way to to those early investors but instead of participating in the round you have used technology to gain network ownership interesting oh yeah sure I think these examples really help illustrate some of the generalized mining opportunities but I think this can be expanded beyond that to not only include these opportunities where there are in protocol rewards and so you know something like the live peer Merkel mine that was economically rational in a vacuum like it was reasonable for someone to go and participate in that process regardless of what their opinion of life here was or if they were trying to you know help support the network I really think of another example to illustrate where investors can use this generalized mining tactic as part of a broader strategy of supporting their investments and these you want is thinking of something like file coin where file coin once again has a chicken or egg problem upon launch and there are some in protocol ways to reward suppliers of bandwidth or suppliers of storage on the network even if that storage isn't being used but it can be very economically rational for an investor who owns a large amount of file coin to go and bring a lot of storage to the network in the early days even when there isn't enough demand for it to be utilized even if provisioning that storage of network at that point in time costs the investor money because if they can then help increase the chances that a new customer will come on to life here and really kickstart those network effects I think it's it's worth it even if it's not economically rational and so I do think it's worth differentiating between those two categories of generalized mining one where you know there's an in protocol incentive and like if you're not doing it you're leaving money on the table if you're not staking your Tazo so you are literally leaving money on the table that is yours by rights however something like this follow an example isn't something where you're leaving money on the table it's where you're going above and beyond to help your investment yeah and to char you know published a great post on this you know using that kind of loss leading example I think the other example you guys had to char was like maker CDP's right so we can talk a little bit about that maybe to introduce the concept you know maker CDP's or I should say dye doesn't have any particular reason why you know third parties issue it right so if there's a lot of demand for for dye stable coin for whatever reason there's kind of like no immediate economic reason for people to lock up collateral at risk in the CDP in order to issue dye but in the same way that you know as Tushar points out like you know fund can kind of lost lead and participate in a network at an initial loss sort of looking at the long-term view you know in that same way like funds can go in and for example create more more dye supply to support that demand is that a correct assessment of that too sure absolutely I actually think the maker example is absolutely perfect because of exactly the dynamics that you've described and an investor in the maker system has a huge incentive to go and actually create more dye so they'd have to lock up ether they'd have to pay the interest rate to create dye so they're going out of pocket to create this table coin that they don't actually need in that scenario but if they then release that stable coin on to the market now there's more dye available and that makes it more likely that exchanges will offer trading pairs against dye I mean right now dye has something like sixty million in market cap and tether has something like two billion it's going to be really difficult for any exchanges to support meaningful trading pairs against dye if there's only sixty million dollars worth of died out there there's just not enough and so for investors in maker who want to increase the probability that dye becomes the you know collateralized decentralized stable coin of choice it makes sense to go lock up a hundred million dollars in ether two hundred million dollars in either and go create more dye especially as multi collateral dye comes out and you can lock up you know different types of assets to create more dye we're gonna discuss when it makes sense for funds to offer general ease mining services and more but

coin capital so the example that you guys have been giving for the advantages that generalized mining provides tend to be around when projects are in their early stages so is that the only time that it makes sense when you you know when you want to get a portfolio project off the ground or would you continue to offer generalized mining services even for mature projects so I think this is mostly helpful for early stage projects the thing with mining is that it's supposed to be a relatively permissionless activity if not completely permissionless and that anyone can do it and that's true of actual mining like you know Bitcoin versus these generalized mining tactics that we're talking about whether you know that's supplying on file : or creating die etc anyone should be able to do them and so what that means is over time as competitors enter you know because there is literally no barrier to entry there should be no additional margins on that for the economically rational generalized mining the ones where you are you know actually earning a profit the investments into protocols that are followed by supporting the protocol that can exist longer into the protocols lifecycle but if at the you know medium stage or late stage maturity of the protocol it's still reliant on investors you know goodwill to support the protocol and make sure that you know there is enough supply or demand on the network then the protocol has failed and the economics didn't work out and so it doesn't make sense in that case either so I think in both the case where this generalized mining is driven by profit within that specific tactic or if generalized mining is driven by profit across the portfolio it really is only reasonable to do in the early days and maybe like the the middle days at the longest I agree with your share I think you know most of the opportunities that we see today in generalized mining are kind of opportunities in early stages of networks and that's partially because you know most decentralized networks are in very early stages today you know I think like as time goes on I think we'll see a lot more networks I think we'll see sort of less volatility kind of in the fiat denominated sense of these tokens I think we're gonna see a lot of opportunities like within decentralized finance to actually create portfolios and positions and these things that are you know less volatile give you a quick example right if you're a staking company and you want to maybe build an initial stake of tokens to get into a network like live pier might be an example they have 15 validators you need it to cross a certain threshold of LPT ownership in order to become an active validate or in the network today well what you might do is you might go to decentralized lending protocol that lends out LPT and you might borrow that you know borrow LPT from that protocol use that to make a token denominated return and then return the borrowed LPT and so what you've just done is you have created kind of a way to you know to neutralize your your exposure to LPT and just sort of get that token denominated return there are other strategies for example periodic liquidation of those returns that that further lowers the fiat denominated volatility and that might be you know that might be an uncorrelated kind of source of returns for your fund you know in the long term I really see people you know maybe building out different kinds of portfolios of these opportunities and I think they also have different risk profiles right if you're doing Hardware mining for example like Bitcoin you're putting out a lot of capital and it's like relatively safe you know within the space of opportunities and you're making a kind of a smaller return and then on the other side of the spectrum you might be not putting in so much capital you might be putting in some software into a network and you're betting on the success of that network but the return could be could look more like a you know VC style return or something like that and the combination of those things into a portfolio I think kind of creates a differentiator for for funds you know especially as you look at a lot of funds going long-term long on many of these opportunities or just signing equity deals or just signing staffs you know and so it's an interesting sort of direction to explore in terms of making crypto portfolios more diversified and safe one other thing I wanted to ask about was Jake your co-founder Alexander Vulcan proposed something called an initial witness offering and when I read about it it seemed to me that it kind of worked in conjunction with generalized mining would you agree and if so I described how it works and and how that connects with generalize running I'm not an expert under under witness offering there is a post by Alex there which you guys can read but I think like the motivation there is is essentially trying to understand how you know a decentralized network can be sort of brought up and put into production using decentralized tools and in a way that you know that that tends to be I guess like more compatible with with the regulatory environment that we have and and I think part of it is you know we've seen echoes of this throughout throughout blockchain right so you've seen you know fully mined assets for example like Bitcoin or steam not a lot of people know that actually steam steam never had an ICO like steam tokens have always been mine directly from the network and the witness offering you know kind of takes a similar approach to you know bringing up the lifecycle of these of these networks and getting them out and the way that it's a you know the way that I think it touches generalized mining is like is like a network that takes on this strategy creates again opportunities for third parties to come in to mine or to validate transactions and thus help to to issue the asset yeah so one thing that I'm curious about is does this kind of take this vision of peer-to-peer crypto networks and mean that it's just going to be more professionalized where it'll be more challenging for everyday people to contribute to these networks I mean I think it's actually quite the opposite right like the way the the way the technology is heading it's um you know you see you know better and better tools that enable kind of normal people to to interact with networks like you see web 3 enabled browsers that's one thing you see a blockchain sort of networks that can use you know different different kinds of technologies like like ZK Starks for example you know to make the blockchain so small mm-hmm it can fit on your phone and that actually democratizes the ability of you know normal people to just have a have a node that's that's running with them at all times and creates a much more decentralized network than what you see in you know in Bitcoin where kind of a handful of miners control the entire network and also hardware wallets I think you know still in early stages here but I kind of like looking forward a couple of years you know you can imagine waving your iPhone in front of some kind of decentralized application and being able to you know make a payment and so it becomes even easier that it is today with Hardware wallets to interact with them so overall the I think the trend is actually to put block chains in the hands of of more people I would say Tushar what do you think and and I wanted to ask actually just to add one thing for context I guess another reason I ask this is because your former research analyst Miles Snyder left multi coin to launch an EOS block producer called Aurora Aurora yose so yeah I just want to get a sense of like how much of this is more professionalization versus like actually furthering the decentralized model I think it's both I think it's more professional and I think I might disagree here slightly with Jake that I don't think that everyday people should be running a node it just like doesn't add much value and like everyone having their own full node sounds more decentralized but it's not because they're just trusting the developers of the soft we're right the centralization point just moves along that value stack somewhere else and so I think that having more professionalization actually leads to more decentralization because you have professionals who are qualified to be engaged in the network who can actually add real value to the network because they are working on the network all day every day I think the key for decentralization here is that those professionals are independent and are not all working for the same company or the same you know handful of companies that they are you know distributed around the world and are independently making their own decisions etc but I think having professionals and incentivizing professionals to add value to your network is the right path trying to win over the average layperson into adding value to you know your decentralized video transcoding network or your layer to plasma chain solution is unlikely to me I just think you're gonna have a lot of difficulty convincing them educating them and motivating them to do so however those opportunities can be extremely attractive for small professional organizations where you know you can start up something with one two maybe three people and be a generalized miner on a variety of these various networks and earn a decent return doing so but that's not necessarily a mature or a regular consumer adoption that's really you know small professional team adoption and we did talk about how early you know you this means that you guys will or anybody who's participating in generalized mining will have kind of more of an influence on the network simply because it is small so over time how would you phase that out to make the network more decentralized so I think it that's a really interesting question you know how do you phase out the influence of the early team and the early investors who own a large amount of the protocol I think there are going to be a number of experiments done on this and we're going to see the results I can speculate I have some ideas on how this might play out but I don't think you know this is proven yet we haven't seen many examples of projects go from you know the centralized launch to a decentralized governance or ownership of the project which by the way as an aside I think it's a good thing I think in the early days you want to be centralized for agility otherwise you will be out competed by someone who it by a protocol that is a little more centralized that does then further decentralized I think some of the tactics that can be used to further decentralized network are perhaps agreements by early investors or founders to actually sell some amount of their stake at some point it's not just a lock up but also some something like the opposite of a lock up saying you know if you're an early investor in this project not only you know will you hold for at least the first you know one or two years those are kind of normal lock ups that we see but also since you bought five percent of the total network you know your larger early stage investor you also promised that after five years you will start liquidating your stake according to some you know schedule and that way you can help decrease the ownership centralization of the network as it gets to the maturity stages you can also have commitments from the team ahead of time saying you know like we are going to work on this in this very centralized agile manner for the first X months or X years but after that we are going to transition governance over to this foundation that will hire you know other developers or fund other developers and other small teams in order to further the protocol and so through those types of mechanisms I think you will see the outsized influence of early insiders diminish as projects get more mature because it's just necessary it's it'll be a it'll be a good long-term selfish decision by those investors or by those founders to include these types of clauses that tie their hands because this then gives users of the network the confidence that you know there is a clear path towards decentralization something else I was wondering about was so for so long everybody was following the so-called fad protocols thesis where the theory was that value in this decentralized world would accrue at the protocol layer as opposed to the app layer and then recently I feel like you know there there's I mean because everything is theoretical obviously as time goes on the thinking around these things shifts and one good example of that is that US v Nia which had initially published the fad protocols thesis thing also recently published a new blog post about how it's not only infrastructure that needs to be built at first and that the you know development of these things goes between infrastructure and and apps become because the fad protocols this has led everybody to be like I only want to invest in infrastructure so I'm just curious how does now this theory about generalized mining how does that fit in with this of the evolution of thinking about investing in decentralized networks yeah so I actually wrote a post Laura last year called fad protocols are not an investment thesis where I tried to challenge a little bit this idea that you can use a blanket heuristic to see how value accrues and decentralized networks and tokens right and you know I think by and large it was an important post to sort of get people thinking along the lines of like well how does value actually accrue and where does it accrued what is the mechanism by which it accrues but I think because the design space of digital assets and the networks around them is so vast ultimately you need to examine opportunities case-by-case and you know in my post I kind of go through a couple of examples where you know here value may not accrue in protocol token or not completely be reflected in the value of the protocol token and there's a lot of counter examples that you can draw sort of on an individualized basis to demonstrate that it's not it's not really you know quite so simple and so kind of based on those ideas right like you might think yes if I have a protocol that gets big that you know and I own the token and the token accrues the value of that protocol that might be a good investment but then you also have to consider the fact that you know this is not the the times of tcp/ip where you essentially had tcp/ip and one other competitor this is like hundreds of competing protocols who are vying for the same or overlapping markets right and so the investment proto profile for for protocol investing is actually kind of similar to to sort of startup investing there's there certainly you know very interesting opportunities in in middleware right MIT when I say middleware I mean kind of digital assets that are poised to be Network agnostic and where we've seen the most of this I you know so far I would say is probably stable coins you see a number of stable coins launching on aetherium but also simultaneously launching their protocols on on other networks like iOS for example and finally you know I think a number of VCS and and investors in the space kind of over the last year have also come around to the idea that we wrote about of investing in in depth you know a lot of people had said well you know it's we got to build the the lower layers of the stack first and invest in depth later but it's also interesting to consider you know companies like kick or or you now who are kind of traditional companies with amazing teams with a lot of experience shipping software and hundreds of millions of users right and and taking on some kind of blockchain strategy with a token and trying to accrue value in that token with an audience of people that you know they've already kind of converted into their products and I think that's an interesting opportunity that a lot of investors have come around - and finally there's also opportunities like outside of the decentralisation stack that I think are really important to the space and these are you know fund raising platforms and banking services and secondary market platforms that help get investment capital into the decentralisation stack that help to you know enable teams to operate and create great products whereas it is generally been pretty hard for teams who are you know fundraising and crypto-currency for example to get bank accounts and things like that generalize mining I think forces the person or the the group that's evaluating that opportunity to understand how valuable works and it's sort of motivating them to be a lot more specific than just kind of this fad protocol heuristic and I think that's a good thing and in many ways that will I think it will actually support the idea that that value of crews oftentimes in these sort of like lower level you know lower level assets but not always so that's sort of my take on it and I know you also have some interesting views on how this trend fits in with the shift toward scaling via layer 2 and state channels can you talk about that sure I mean I think it's gonna be a while before we see you know a lot of layer 2 technologies out of production and actually supporting real-world apps there's just a few examples of that today you know one example is funfair another example is spank chain that actually have layer 2 products in production things like non-custodial hubs and and payment channels we're sort of still waiting for generalized state channel frameworks and things like that but I do think that we'll have some examples of that in the coming six to twelve months but as it relates to value accrual you know it's interesting to think about for example you know if you take a look if you compare lightning Network above Bitcoin and maybe a generalized state channel network above aetherium right so in Bitcoin you're going to be locking up some collateral on layer one so that you can transact in layer two and sort of the the amount that you can transact is directly proportional to the amount that you lock up and you're actually taking out you know units out of circulation and it's interesting like how does that dynamic impact kind of the Bitcoin layer underneath well it seems like you know you lower the the circulating supply so that's good for price but at the same time you're collapsing a lot of transactions that maybe would have been on chain into just too right into the the transaction that opens the the channel a payment channel and the transaction that closes it so does that result in you know a decrease in transactions in that network or does the growth achieved by you know having a layer to payment system above it Bitcoin actually outpaces that and it's an interesting question now when you go on to you know kind of state generalized state channel networks on the theory 'm then you realize that you know because you're actually instantiating smart contracts in these state channels off the main chain you're probably implementing some kind of business model using those contracts right so if you're like playing chess games for money and the you know the provider is taking a fee or something like that it turns out you're taking away all of those transactions from the layer one and you're you know you're potentially you know not sharing the same amount of value that accrues in these off chain applications with the base layer and the question really becomes on a case-by-case basis is like how does this impact let's say the price of of ether underneath if that makes sense and so generalized mining sort of solves a certain problem in the sense that you can still accrue value from the scaling of the network even if that value isn't necessarily accruing at layer one well I think I think in in the case of layer two specifically right if you sort of look at the landscape of what's happening let's say in state channel networks today you have on the order of you know 15 20 projects that are working on this stuff maybe maybe like half or most of them are open-source so you're not really getting a lot of equity opportunities to invest in those teams there are some out of those you know 15 16 projects only three of them have tokens so if you're taking a really you know sort of VC lens when you're approaching investment you're not gonna find a lot of equity there and you're probably not going to find a lot of tokens in those networks and so if a layer 2 network takes off and is really valuable but that network doesn't have a token the question is how do you get the exposure to that growth and sort of the I think the best answer to that in in today's environment is well it makes sense to run you know some kind of node on this some kind of infrastructure on this network right so if you're running a hub directly on the network then you can capture that growth by providing network effect providing the ability of many different people to transact through your hub and so of course you're taking a you know transaction fee on on that and you're making money but if you're sort of equity focused or token focused I think you'll you'll find it a lot harder to get that direct exposure to that growth and plus you'll have to contend with the fact that there is actually many competing payment networks in that layer now a lot of founders who are building these things are actually saying you know what in order to monetize this for myself I'm gonna build some applications on top and those applications are gonna have token investment opportunities or if they're gonna have equity investment opportunities and that's great I think it's just gonna come down a little bit you know down the line from now and when you're evaluating let's say an equity opportunity in I guess you would call that like layer 3 or something like that right you you not only have to evaluate like the application that's being built and on its own merits but you also have to ask yourself am I making the right underlying network investment decision because if I invest in this application on this network but then some other network becomes the DOM network you know did I make the best investment there and so it becomes like a lot trickier to reason about tokens and equity in layer two rather than just saying hey maybe I'll just run five different kinds of hubs Watchers or dispute resolvers I'm layer two and then try to get exposure that way and try to sort of diversify and you know make bets that maybe a few of these networks will become really big later Jake I think you said something really interesting earlier where you were talking about how some of these layer two solutions can go across chains and so I think that also presents you know another interesting opportunity for investors who are you know looking to invest in things other than the base layer protocol is I think this lowers the risk where if your product is really compelling and you know you built it on etherium for now but as it turns out no one of these next-gen like smart contract platforms ends up actually fulfilling the vision and becoming the dominance of our contract platform well if you can transfer over the state and the code base of the of whatever the product is whatever the adapt or smart contract is onto this other platform well then you're not really exposed to the risk as either a founder or an investor of the underlying platform and so I think that's another opportunity where you know the the risk return calculation needs to be re-examined from first principles rather than necessarily you know looking at this the same way that it has been looked at in the past yeah so exactly and thank you for bringing that up and you know one way to just characterize that is sort of products that have interoperability with their base layers right so these might be interoperability platforms like polka dot or you know in some sense like what-what cosmos is building it might be what Chris Byrne is he likes to call middleware protocols right so these might be like stable coin protocols that live kind of in the middle of the stack and then and the point here is precisely that right like these kinds of interoperable mechanisms live higher in the stack then the layer or then the base layers right and that's another reason why you know you can you can imagine a bet on sort of the middle of the stack being a little bit safer than bets on fat protocols like all the way at the bottom of the stack if that makes sense because you know if you have an interoperability platform that has a hundred networks interoperating on it but then one of those networks fails that's not going to be you know as bad as if you were like all in on that one network that failed right absolutely create diversification I think the diversification is really interesting here but then if you contrast that with the fad protocols thesis which you know I'll stand up and say I think I'm one of the few people who you know is willing to still defend the fad protocols thesis I think it's actually correct I think that the vast majority of the value that is created through this blockchain ecosystem is going to be captured in some base layer protocols and I don't know exactly how many but my guess is it's gonna be a power law type distribution and the largest one will be a smart contract platform just for security model reasons right if you have something built on top of this platform that's more valuable than the platform well now it can justify an attacker to go and attack the base layer platform in order to get value on that layer two solution or those you know whatever was built on top of the platform and so I think you know that I think the base layer protocols actually present a more concentrated riskier bet that has a potentially much higher return then he's middleware type solutions which can skate across protocols if necessary they can interoperate across protocols if necessary but they don't have the same level of potential to you know have the huge mega outcomes that a base layer protocol does yeah as she goes to that question I asked early on when I was asking you guys to compare this against things like just investing in the tokens directly because I just think you and I agree with you that I do think it seems like the ROI here might be less however what the sort of like the way in which it's not less is that because it will help the network grow then perhaps the value of the token would grow or would ensure that the investment that you made in the token would succeed something like that or help ensure um we're actually running out of time so I just want to ask you a few last quick questions when VC's began investing in tokens a lot of them had to change their LP agreements do you guys need to do that at all in order to make this work not for us we are a crypto native fund so we launched with our LT a being a minimal to us holding tokens and Jake did you guys yeah so again we you know when we were kind of bringing up coin fund you know we made sure that our agreement was sort of in balance with the kind of investments that we would make and so in general I think we're we're very very flexible in in how we can invest you know we can make equity investments we can sign staffs or safe notes or convertible notes as well as invest in tokens as of this year you know we have some additions to our corporate structure that allow us to engage networks directly as well and so with both of you now getting into generalized mining as a part of your strategy how does that affect the way that you hire or other sorts of administrative or technical or strategic decisions you guys make as a fund from from from our point of view you know with we are we have a full-time principal engineer named Jason on our staff that who's kind of in charge of looking across these sorts of opportunities both me and my co-founder Alex book and we are technologists and engineers and so we participate in that process and generally I think that you know this creates kind of an onus on funds to a little bit more technologically enabled and so I think more technical hires are are probably key to this and then in addition to just you know participating in the opportunities there's also a bunch of you know accounting considerations and tax considerations and and working through sort of the reporting of what these activities that the fund has been engaged in are and that creates you know additional sort of motivations for four four hires I would imagine actually maybe from a tax perspective it's more advantageous because if you're at least in a case where you're sort of like earning the tokens then we're not earning but like hmm no no maybe it only applies if you are mining them and they're being minted at that moment because I was just thinking about how if you purchase them and then Li you later sell them then there's two tax events but at least in the case of mining I think where they're being minted at that moment there's only one tax event which happens when you sell so can you just talk a little bit more about the differences in in taxes here yeah I I think generalize mining actually introduces some more complexities on taxes because of you BTI issues which you know some funds and LPS have some restrictions around and so what is you BTI is unrelated taxable business income so you know if you are a tax exempt investor whether that's you know some sort of foundation or trust or some other type of set up and I am NOT a tax attorney so you know that was nurse please consult an attorney but there are some restrictions around earning effectively operational income from an investment and for tax exempt investors that you know don't pay capital gains taxes you know earning ubt i can actually pierce that and cause them to have to pay taxes this is most relevant to the layperson through like investing in their IRA where you know you have some level of restriction on the amount of you BTI you're allowed to have in your IRA before you have to file tons more tax paperwork so I think generalize mining add some more complexity there but at the end of the day I think it's worth it and you know going back to my earlier point of I think generalized mining is best executed by small professional organizations and not necessarily by lay people that means that the resources to actually account for all of this in compliance with all the relevant regulatory and tax law is actually much more plausible than you know someone who's a hobbyist going and doing this on their own where you know it may not be really economically rational for them to do so once they take the accounting and tax prep work into account hmm interesting well I guess we'll see how all this plays out thank you guys both so much for coming on the show to discuss we could keep going there's just so much material here but um we're running out of time so where can people learn more about you and your companies for us we have a website coin fun do can check out that and has a description of our team and sort of broader investment thesis on the generalized mining stuff we actually just ran a very successful meetup over a Def Con in Prague where we're a multi coin capital also participated I will be releasing the video of that shortly and hopefully that gives some more material to this discussion great - sure and you can find out more about multi coin capital on our website as well it's multi coin capital and we have a good number of posts on there and actually there's one that Jake referred to earlier that I released a couple of weeks ago called the evolving role of crypto investors which specifically covers some of the topics that we've discussed today on this podcast and I think if you're still interested in want to dive deeper we will be releasing videos from the multi coin summit where we had a panel called the evolving role of crypto investors where Jake's partner Alex also participated so there's there a lot of interesting content there to dig deeper and learn more about this topic great I will link to all this in the show notes thanks you guys for coming on Unchained Thank You
