regulation and to monitor compliance my guest today is congressman Patrick McHenry the ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee welcome congressman McHenry well thank you thanks for having me on Laura one quick note before we begin there are votes in the house today and so congressman McHenry may be called away a bit abruptly which we might all hear with a buzzer hopefully that won't happen but I wanted to give you all a heads up just in case congressman McHenry you're well known in the crypto community for your support of the crypto and blockchain space you've called Bitcoin quote an unstoppable force in last summer's hearings on Libre you're also known as the houses mister FinTech and you have some news that you are announcing today the day that my podcast is being released but before we get into all that I actually just wanted to ask you first how did you hear about and become interested in Bitcoin and crypto well look I I'm interested in the world payments and I think for many the crypto space is a fascinating area of technology moving much faster than what the regulated have been able to do and so I saw this early on in Bitcoin first with a white paper and trying to understand what this meant and then the the ramp up and value of Bitcoin and then other crypto currencies trying to emulate what Satoshi brought to the world and so I've been fascinated by it and watched it from a distance and tried to make sense of what the right governmental response was and my conclusion was any action by government really up until the bat last two or three years any action by the government would be negative would impair innovation and would restrict the development of crypto currencies and their enormous value now and in the future and so it was far better to have folks slowly be informed on Capitol Hill rather than rush to go kill an idea or try to kill an idea now we're at a different phase when it comes to crypto currencies and we need to have smarter regulations so that you can have money brought to bear legitimate long-term investors brought to bear for these new innovations that are taking place so we need to have some certainty out of the CFTC and out of this here's an exchange Commission here in Washington DC as well as as a better understanding of from Treasury and the IRS about taxing authority so I think there's a real government work that still needs to be done and so that's actually a perfect segue to your news today you are reintroducing the financial services innovation Act what does this bill do and what problem are you trying to solve with it well the bill says that states that we need to have financial service innovation offices within every office of the government that deals with financial service issues and they're there ten of them actually from the Federal Reserve and the CFPB to the to the Treasury Department to the FDIC and all the other banking regulators we we we know of as well as the Securities and Exchange Commission what this bill is about is ensuring that our regulators our innovation forward innovative innovation permissioned and situated to say yes rather than the default no I want the default to be yes to innovation not the current default of no and so this would allow agencies to provide space for new innovations in the marketplace and Great Britain they call it sandboxes what I think of for us in the United States is permanent beta testing we should allow data to be collected and for us to meet societal goals in the way this Act allows for that is is by though those innovators to go to these offices and get an enforce and enforcement compliance agreement that if accepted would allow them to provide innovative products or services under an alternative compliance plan which would provide waivers or modifications to current regulations that are out of date or or unduly burdensome and I think this is a necessary step towards creating a regulatory process that that works with financial innovation rather than against it and in the announcement you actually specifically call out that the bill could have an impact on the blockchain and crypto space and you mentioned that the bill would give the SEC and the CFTC a more formalized process to collaborate with innovators and provide them with regulatory certainty you probably are aware that a lot of crypto teams in particular have been complaining or a hundred of complainings the right word but criticizing the SEC and so I was just curious to know how would this affect for instance a team that wanted to issue a coin through what you know used to be called an initial coin offering well I think this would drive this this process forward in a more aggressive way and and and I think it is a particular value to the blockchain cryptocurrency space because we're gonna have new products that are going to be layered on top of this this technology and this this new form of decentralized distributed Ledger's and what this will enable is these teams to go to the regulators and get a space to operate in provide data back to the regulate tours and say you know here here's what's working and here's how we're meeting these societal goals that are stated in law but we're doing in a different way and so you know we still have regulations on the books that are driven about the innovations of the 30s and 40s which is using a telephone or telegraph to get information provided more quickly we've got to update those things and we have to force the regulators to update these things in a real in a changing environment because it's not really just about the United States anymore it's about a global competition for this innovation so when I think of this financial services innovation Act I think of the crypto currency space as being a great beneficiary of it and changing the mindset of these regulators to be permissioned to go in and want to be yes rather than desire to be no and so in recent months I guess because you know a lot of these different teams that want to build crypto networks have been worried about action from the SEC the new trend or trend doesn't even a word because this is so onerous very few people are doing it but at least one of the teams or a couple of the teams have gone the reggae + route of trying to fundraise right black stack right yeah and I think you now is another so how would this these innovation what did you call them the ECA is basically the enforcement compliance agreements as you call them in the bill how would that work with something like these JOBS Act options that people are pursuing well it would it then this act would enable the CFTC and SEC to work together on a framework on a frame and then get information back on how the Capitol raised went and how the conversion from that capital raised into the technology into a coin and the nature of that conversion and get data back right now we have these regulators making decisions without real data and I think that's quite unfortunate so but what you're saying is like it would enable these teams to do a fundraiser out having to go through the exact reggae process but maybe it wouldn't look like the initial coin offerings of 2017 is it somewhere like in the middle is that what this would look like well they would be able to petition to the SEC get an understanding and then do the race and so what this would do is give the SEC the capacity to give new forms of capital raise opportunities so what I'm saying is something new could be invented that isn't you know reggae plus a reggae offering was not designed for initial coin offerings and initial coin offerings weren't designed to meet reggae rules and now they both so you've basically had to engineer initial coin offerings into this weird box of a rule that was not contemplated for the technology or much less this type of technology right right that makes sense and one other thing I was curious about is would this apply in any way to the crypto projects that did have initial coin offerings in 2017 or is it it's not retroactive so any SEC enforcement actions could still happen against those sure it doesn't it doesn't preclude SEC enforcement action on a going-forward basis or a look-back basis we don't deal with that what we do is create a new permissioned system that didn't exist that hasn't existed in in the United States before and so your bill you know as you mentioned would essentially create these different regulatory sand boxes and I was just wondering why did you structure it so that each of these agencies has its own financial services innovation office rather than one single sandbox that's overseen by one of the departments like say the Commerce Department well the reason why I went with each one of these regulators is because they do all very specific things so if you're talking about the Commodities Futures Trading Commission they're dealing with commodities whereas the skiers Exchange Commission is dealing with securities just sort of a basic differential and the office of Comptroller of currency deals with national bank charters so we wanted to use that regulatory expertise within these agencies for their specific rules and regulations that they they enforce and get them to open these new offices for financial innovation a few of them have done offices of financial innovation but none of them have the force of law necessary to provide flexibility and regulation and what we're doing is changing that mindset the issue here in the United States is that we have a very complicated regulatory regime when it comes to financial products we have things that are regulated at the state level not at the federal level although other things that are regulate at the federal level and not the state level then once you get to the federal level it could be it could be a somebody could be a bank and be regulated by one regulator or be another bank and be regulated by two or three regulators and if you're a public company you have a whole separate set of regulation so what we've tried to do is is not get into that bigger battle about having a streamlined regulatory approach for financial products that is a bigger fight then I think what we're trying to achieve with this what we one is for financial innovation for all these regulators to be at the forefront of what they do than some backwater and we want them to be positioned to say yes not their default no and you may not know these details but I just wanted to ask these questions in case you do what does it look like for somebody to apply for one of these so-called enforceable compliance agreements and you know when you obtain one what does that allow you to do does it cost anything to apply for one how long does it take to get the approval like just walk through the process well we want we want the approval process to be pretty fast but we're still working through the details of how that would happen in terms of the cost it will be minimal cost to do this but the goal here so what you would in essence do is whether or not you're a large or small entity you could approach the regulator with your particular jurisdiction approach them and say we want we seek to do X however you haven't a regulation on your books that says that we cannot do X because we're using a piece of technology that we can't have somebody sign a physical piece of paper we'd like them to be able to take a picture of their signature rather than fax us something which is your additional your current regulation that would just be one small example of using technology not in a groundbreaking way in a very simple basic way and then you get permission through these enforcement compliance agreements to do that trial for that period of time with those new restrictions on how you use the product and the data sharing back to the regulator's so that they can fix their we have the bells for free codes okay and in for your listeners bells here on Capitol Hill sound like buzzers but that means that the house is voting now but the the approach here is to get a modification to current regulation or a waiver of current regulation in order to have a new product that's what we're trying to get and and so you can think of it this way is is madhva testing it they at the opening to explain this but the idea of beta testing means that you're not locked in for what this is you think it might work and and the experience may be that absolutely doesn't work or you want to take it to scale and so what we're trying to do is get the regulators to think of this as beta testing to think of this is a small change to see how it works and if it works then you go forward it's scale and if it doesn't work then you stop it and that's what we're trying to work through and if I'm an exchange that doesn't currently have a bit license could I use one of these compliance agreements to serve New York customers potentially potentially that still has to be worked out and and that the the way that this act will be utilized is is really broad and quite open not just for cryptocurrency but for financial technology writ large and you first try to introduce this bill in 2016 do you have any sense of what the chances are that it will be passed now well we're still working through that's very early we have interest from a number of senators on the Republican and Democratic side of the aisle to team up with us on this and and and we do have a bipartisan under a group of folks on both among Republicans and Democrats in the house that want to have clarity for crypto currencies and a wider group that perhaps are inclined around blockchain and that's just a general inclination because they don't quite understand cryptocurrency and are not willing to dive more deeply in and so there's a bipartisan group that is interested in this type of legislating around financial innovation so we're hope that we can get something done this Congress in a moment we'll discuss Libra but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible will the world follow France and advocate banning privacy coins will government backed stable coins become the new Fiat are distributed and peer to peer exchanges just a flash in the pan the answer is maybe virtual currencies can flourish and create a new private and more versatile economy but that grand vision can't happen without keeping crypto clean and that requires support of governments and accountability for bad actors

releasing its own digital currency and there was a note that some are PC analysts published where they said quote if US regulators ultimately dismiss Libre and decide not to draft regulation to encourage crypto innovation in the US China's central bank digital currency may be strategically positioned to become the de facto global digital currency in emerging economies largely through a leap a WeChat Union pay in other messaging and payment apps what do you think would be best positioned to compete with its Chinese central bank digital currency a USD central bank digital currency or an app based one such as Libra or telegrams cryptocurrency or a completely decentralized one such as Bitcoin or something else well ok let me start by saying this I think Libra has opened people's a lot of new people's eyes about the value of cryptocurrency Libra is not cryptocurrency however and we need to stop lumping it together with very real very important projects that are out there like Bitcoin and so and that's not to bash Facebook or or the Libra project but but the distinction between a a wholly new financial and event invention like Bitcoin I think that has enormous long-term value enormous long-term value and like many things Bitcoin is that it's such a very early stage relative to the rest of human invention and so how Bitcoin will be used we don't now in 20 years what bitcoin looks like I don't I'm not I don't know the capacity to predict but I do think it will be of enormous value and utility when it comes to that when it comes to the question of a US dollar a digitized US dollar I think that is a reasonable next step for our central bank your interview with the the Federal Reserve's chief economist was quite instructive because it exposes the the fact that to the public that the Federal Reserve is contemplating and is trying to understand digital currency and their appropriate role is as a dollar as a store of value and international trade so I think there's enormous value there I think as an American I would like to have a response to Ali pay and we should not allow the Chinese to write the rules of the road of international finance and we therefore have to have a more competitive mindset about ensuring that there is international commerce using a system that is not Chinese based and so when you say that we should have some kind of response what what do you think would be best for a US central bank digital currency or for something that is already tied to an app like Libre or like bitcoins that you know something completely different those aren't the only choices right I mean I I think we're talking about a they're very different things I think when you talk about a truly decentralized long-term store of value and a belief in the system not in a belief in a government or governmental entities I think true cryptocurrency has enormous value separate and aside from this conversation but as an American I would say as an American policy maker I think the US dollar and the Federal Reserve having a basically digital asset version of the US dollar is he of enormous value for for global trade and the safety of that global trade that's and so that I think that has huge value I also think that there's value and American companies creating these innovations whether it's a truly decentralized asset and capacity of trade like Bitcoin or something of that sort or something is more traditional in nature which is sort of a different derivation of PayPal whether it be sort of the Chinese version which is Ali pay or some new creation like Libra so from what you said is it correct to assume that you would then kind of encourage the launch of Libra but also maybe being supportive of a u.s. D Central Bank digital currency absolutely are you in a position to like introduce legislation to get that going that you know a USD digital dollar where we're looking into whether or not the Federal Reserve has the legal capacity currently to issue a digital currency and and until we were able to come to a serious conclusion there or proper understanding i'm not going to file legislation if they do not currently have the legal authority I will support legislation that gives the the Federal Reserve that capacity and how quickly do you think all that would tank because as far as I understand I think that Chinese digital currency is going to be released in the next few months I don't know the timeframe but I don't know the timeframe but we have to we have to change our mindset here the American government my government has add the view that we don't have to compete for things that are that are governmental meaning the value of our currency our regulatory regime we think that you know since we're a dominant economy and in on the globe large economy on the globe that we can write the rules for the rest of the world we have to change our mindset with the aware that with compete against other regimes around the globe and we have to compete with private sector innovation and so I think there's huge value in us changing the mindset from the Federal Reserve and financial regulators so that we have a competitive mindset rather than a reactionary one and you may have time for one quick question before you I think everyone in a moment okay so I was just wondering I mean you seem to be quite forward-thinking about all of these issues and to really have your finger in the pulse but I was wondering if you could describe the overall either attitude toward and/or like level of education about these issues amongst your fellow congressmen and Congresswomen we have folks that that have spent time to deeply study cryptocurrency for instance and we have a bipartisan group that that have sponsored a bill written by a colleague of mine Warren Davidson of Ohio called the token taxonomy Act which defines digital currencies and the conversion point from when you do an IC o---- to what becomes a new object in the world which is that coin offering which is wholly different in most respects from previous creations by securities regulation there's a bipartisan group that understands cryptocurrency it's not a big group I would say it's a relative of the size of the House and Senate is a very very small group but really informed and quite inclined towards cryptocurrency and this innovation that's positive we have a larger group that is distrustful of technology and I think that is problematic but since the beginning of time since it being of innovation you know there of always the Luddites have existed I mean quite frankly the word Luddite comes from innovation and textile manufacturing and the belief that that innovation would have destroyed jobs it did not destroy jobs it created more jobs in the textile industry though they were scared of the innovation at the time so we need to make sure that we have more folks that are informed and so for your listeners it is really important they engage in Washington because we need smart policymakers when it comes to cryptocurrency we need smart governmental leaders and we need regulators that are informed so that we can so that we can lead the world not be a backwater to the world when it comes to cryptocurrencies okay great well where can people learn more about you and this bill my website
