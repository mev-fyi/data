eigenlayer and Constantine lomashook co-founder of pdp.org and Lido welcomes free Rama and Constantine hi Laura pleasure to be here hi Laura we are coming off a successful completion of ethereum's transition to proof of stake and that was um through the successful Shanghai upgrade which enabled withdrawals of staked ether how would you each characterize the current staking landscape today what are the main issues and what are the next developments you think are necessary why don't we start with you sriram it's been super exciting to see both the merge and the withdrawals enabled so now ethereum is a complete system you know for all practical purposes anything you want you can do on the system um I'm quite excited about uh the both the merge and the withdrawals because now I think uh if from our point of view what it does is you can now build general purpose systems on top of ethereum because staking which allows for both positive and negative penalties to be built on top and a general purpose programming language which is the evm come together and so I think we have this Fusion of like two superpowers one is the incentive mechanism and the programming ability so that's something I'm excited about and I think there are a lot of very interesting developments happening in this taking space uh liquid staking to begin with and then DVT which enables many many validators to come together and participate in it and I'm sorry DVT a distributed validator technology which is basically the idea that many nodes can work together and act as a single unit as far as ethereum is concerned but inside that unit actually there is like many nodes which are working together in like a union so it's like taking a single validator in ethereum which requires 32 each which may be a lot of money for many people to participate and in further democratizing this the idea that many people put in maybe one Ethan 32 of them form a group and then they can all like from the ethereum's point of view they look like one node having 32 each and they all come to consensus on everything so these are like really fascinating developments both liquids taking and DVT and I think I would like to think that eigenlayer or restaking is in this category of really interesting things because now with something like eigen layer what you can do is use the security of ethereum and the power that you know these taking protocols bring to supply it to very flexibly to any kind of new protocol that can then be built on top of it so that's that's what I'm very excited about yeah first of all you know like I want her to congrats everyone you know like who participated in it it's their like developers core developers it is tools developers it's a clients developers you know like and you know like this I mean like it's took about two and a half years so like Beacon chain launch in uh December of 2020 and you don't like her and withdrawals is like finish the slope of upgrade when all flow was taken on almost all flow of taking is working right now and they're this is exciting for all ethereum community and everyone you know like who believe in like trustless virtual machines that can work in the internet but it's still your question was about challenges and also like not only like good things but also we have still a lot of issues I mean one is like a decentralization uh this is I mean like an issue it's taking care and the question how this network can be even more decentralized uh second is like white labeling you know like this is a lot of nodes who use different brands but running by the same people it's still you know like Mev issues you know like that still here one of the things that can make liquid staking better and other staking products better when these drawables can be initiated by users who staked because for now it's it's impossible and only validators can unstake but this still a lot and it's a lot of work uh but you know like what was achieved it's really great you know like and how it's happened without any like big issues so congrats everyone so I think now that we've made this full transition to this system there's a lot of thought around different things that can happen um using stake and obviously like with Lido that was you know one of the early new ideas around what could be done with that but I actually want to start this part of the discussion talking about I can layer because there has been a lot of Chad about it and so um Street around why don't you just give us an explanation of what it is yes just starting with the name eigen layer eigen in German for your own it's your own layer you can build anything on top of ethereum security so if you look at like the evolution of ethereum like when ethereum started the major like jump was the idea that anybody can build an application and tether it to a common security zone right of course the technical thing that was done in ethereum was to create a general purpose programming language but I think the fundamental Innovation is not that the fundamental Innovation is creating a Shad security Marketplace the idea that there is a common chat security pool like you know ethereum nodes can actually validate now any application that can be built on top so I like to think of this as kind of like the first modular blockchain so it basically modularized the idea of you know application as distinct from the trust Zone which is ethereum and when you see the evolution going forward you see from there successive opening up of the Innovation landscape and I think layer twos are a major Paradigm Shift there the idea is now that not only you can write an application and tether it on top of this evm virtual machine but you can have like a whole chain which you validate yourself and then prove that the chain was validated correctly back to ethereum and so this was the layer 2 landscape which broadened the scope of ethereum and I think you know the underlying ethos there is really actually you know inspiring that ethereum took this step it's a leap of faith to take because you know you come in and say oh now you know it's not ethereum running everything nothing is running natively on layer one all these layer twos are going to run it and it requires like an immense faith in the power of free markets and open Innovation to actually take that leap and many of us thought that this is a pretty crazy leap of Fate to take but actually just paid off massively because you you have these absolutely Powerhouse projects which are now built on top of this like one framework which would never have been possible if it was only ethereum and one protocol and there's an enshrined like sharding or whatever other techniques this is just much better so I think that's the second step and I think the way we with Envision eigenlayer is as an even broadening of the Innovation landscape so what cannot be built with just layer twos today can be built with eigen layer so what is the idea the idea is the root of trust of ethereum is coming from staking you're putting down stake and you're saying that you're validating ethereum blocks correctly so that is the root of trust if we can take this route of trust and Supply it to anybody who wants to build let's say a new consensus protocol I want to build a new consensus protocol I want to build a new Oracle I want to build a new data availability I want to build a new bridge I want to build a new Mev management system anything and then say that hey already I have a root of trust here like people are staking and then making commitments that they are going to make ethereum blocks correctly and what eigenlayer does is ask the Staker if they want to opt in to eigen layer I'll explain later the technical details of how you opt in but when you're opting into eigen layer essentially what you're doing is you're saying I'm not only validating ethereum blocks now I'm validating potentially new Services built on top of eigenlayer the services could be any of the things that I mentioned new chains oracles data availability data storage anything that you can think of which requires end nodes to do the calculation so now you opt in to such a system and when you opt into eigen layer what you have to do is you have to download and run whatever other software so in addition to running your eat node software now you can run all these other node software if you're running eigen layer you are not running all the services on top you pick and choose which set of services you want to run on top it's a opt-in Marketplace and so now what it does is whenever you have a new idea for how to build a new distributed system a new chain a new Oracle any of these things you don't have to go and find your own trust Network you can just come and Avail of this massive existing cross Network ethereum and then just plug your like system on top of it so you can have you know all of these Services ecosystem services for ethereum which are powered natively by ethereum staking so that is the vision that we have it's part of why we call it eigen layer anybody can build anything they want on top of this you know Common framework and we think ethereum is the natural home for something like this because ethereum has shown again and again that it's committed to the principles that are very uh passionate about which is open Innovation credible neutrality decentralization censorship resistance all of these things so that's the uh yeah that's what eigenous would it be fair to say that it's kind of similar to the polka dot model where there's all these different pair of chains but then they share security at the base layer because that's what came to mind for me that is absolutely a reasonable comparison so there are some Dimensions about it's exactly the same in some Dimensions where it's not the same one dimension where the polka dot model is different is polka dot is not opt-in so everybody who is in in the polka dot relay chain will validate all the power chains so there is a kind of enshrined mechanism so there's no opt-in there that's that's one difference the second difference is you can because it's not opt-in you cannot opt into arbitrary like slashing things you're opting into like a very narrow scope which which itself you know you can run basically any virtual machine but you cannot run an oracle with polka dot security you cannot run a new distributed storage protocol with protocol dot security you cannot run a new consensus protocol with polka dot security so there is some constraint I would compare the polka dot parachain model much more to the layer 2 Paradigm so in layer 2's borrow exactly ethereum security but only for running new virtual machines and so that's what but it's a more enshrined mechanism for doing it whereas eigen layer is much much more flexible any distributed system you can think of you can just run it there and you could borrow aspects of ethereum security and sometimes you will borrow a subset of ethereum security but sometimes this is something insane you can borrow a super set of ethereum security and I I can come come talk about that later okay I'm gonna put a notes to myself to ask you about that later because one other comment that I want to make is I sort of feel like Lido is a way to reuse steak for the user but eigenlayer is a way to reuse steak for um developers something like that does that make sense yeah I I don't know I can't we are definitely doing complementary things and I think I I have like one point of view there but I'm sure Constantine has uh some interesting thoughts there yeah Constantine what do you think yeah first of all I should make a disclosure of the time in Western angular because sir but but I will still challenge you know like sriram to make it more interesting yeah uh first of all you know like we should not forget about risk you know like when you run ethereum it is a risk of flashing when you start to run other uh uh protocols it's also like edit the additional risk under my my ticket here that what design are doing is like Risk taking feature yeah so like some type of for example large protocols can do risk taking by themselves you know for example I don't know we can imagine that TK sync or like second where they can just use withdrawals or ask users to give withdrawals from their validation nodes to them straight and do it but for smaller protocols you know like and to and also like for big tail and also for some big one eigenware is the best solution can be the best solution why because when they make a marketplace around that so you don't need to like bring additional stake and work with their stakers you can just you know like use the marketplace and there are in case of a staked ethereum I think that it can be used inside of eigen layer so you can not use is you can use breathe your status for example and they're also you know like you can also like it can be an option that either can make any type of integration with angular you know like more deep or like it can make straight with other protocols so I what is taking is there a mechanic you know like how you can take more risk but don't forget when you get money for something like when you get rewards for example for doing job you get additional risk and nothing is free so Constantine what are some of the risks that you're thinking of for different types of projects or chains that are thinking about using re-sticking for security yeah first of all you know like our staking has I mean what is taking staking is a mechanic where person or like uh or a protocol lock Capital uh for some time and uh do some job you know like for example running a node or of ethereum protocol and then get some risk because uh and get rewards you know like and all these things are usually important yes and uh in case of ethereum the risk is flashing or losing of Rewards and there you can if you uh in some edge cases you can lose all your ease when you stake your ECS and when you mistake you add additional risk and it depends on the protocol you know for example Bridges has one type of risk uh oracles has another type of risk there are twos or like a sequencers has another risk so like and but can you give some examples of what those risks look like for those different types of projects yeah for for example if you secure some type of oracles or Bridges or I mean first of all depends how like the protocol developers will pack it for example you and what type of risk are risk taking will secure if this for example a risk a block of protocol maybe like Risk taking will not cover it and the question is who makes this that decision if it is a risk for example you want to delegate Risco for some type of bridges and Bridge is exploited by some reason for example validators did this attack then you can lose part of your Capital if you put it under the risk and so on you know like the question is when you get reward you get for some job or like for for the risk and uh if you get this rewards the question is how to participate and I mean in case of for example eigen layer the user will choose this which protocols and which or like operators who will run this nose you know like we'll work with why because uh uh and and for example they can you try to use the most safest or the most most bigger with most biggest reward so SRI Ram how would you respond to these concerns about risks no these are real uh the idea that basically you know I think constant instead already what you're doing with staking and restaking is I we think of it just as making staking more programmable so you're basically like now you know normally when you're staking you're subjecting yourself to ethereum slashing risk right which is if you don't validate your blocks correctly then you know or there was a bug in the ethereum protocol there's all of those two conditions right like then you would lose your stake right so let's take the simple scenario where the code is all correct the if under that circumstance actually the risk profile is only you lose money only if you didn't fulfill the conditions the covenants of the ethereum protocol cracking so in some sense I think while there is risk the risk profile of validation is fundamentally different from D5 risk so in D5 when you're putting a putting your like steak teeth or any other token into like an LP into uniswap or a compound or any of these things essentially you are underwriting price risk the price can fluctuate and price risk is exogenious like you have nothing to say about it you have no control on whether the price is going to go up 10x step you know or 10 like this is not something endogenius to the person who's putting the capital in whereas validation risk if you assume the protocol code is correct is endogenius like by doing more and more like by running a distributed validator Group by basically making sure you're running better and better protocols you can drastically reduce the risk so I think validation is a different class of risk and D5 is a different class of risk so that's the first thing I want to say inside validation you have like two aspects to risk one is risk due to your own you know misbehavior and the other is the risk due to protocol errors and I think but if you know how to do the operation for that protocol correctly then basically you can very much minimize the first risk and what remains is the second risk which is that the protocol has an error and so you know we try to think a lot about like how to minimize these stakers exposure to protocol errors in fact the way I think about like how liquid's taking and something like eigen layer or complementary is that you know liquid is taking the hardest thing that you know a protocol like Lido or rocket pool or any of these things have to do is to figure out how to imbue trust in the validators like that is the hard part for something like eigenlier we see the complement is the hard part the complement is how do you induce trust in a new distributed system in a new distributed protocol that is the hard part and that is our specialty in some sense is figuring out what is the protocol configuration what is the slashing and this is very very particular to like this is like a deep understanding of the distributed system and the slashing conditions that go into each of the distributed systems and you ask Constantine about like how would you think about risks in in these different examples I'll give a simple example let's say an oracle you can build a nautical so Oracle is basically like a price right let's say just you want to report PTC to USD price on ethereum and you say Okay I want to get the ethereum nodes to participate in this there are many different ways of building the Oracle each of them lead to like completely different kinds of validation risk so I'll give three examples of actually how you can build an oracle one example is you will get slashed if your price report is very different from the majority price I say Bitcoin one Bitcoin is like you know or one one USD whereas most people are saying one Bitcoin is 30 000 USD then like of course like you know I'll get slashed right so this is one example of Slash deviation for majority is one kind of Slash another kind of slashing is you know when you all vote on something then you bring in like a much more trusted group you know which may be a Dao or like reputed people in the community whatever like some other thing and if they say something different then you could get slashed so that's another kind of slashing a third kind of system would have no slashing it'll just take them aggregate as many distinct opinions as possible and then just present the majority opinion as like a price article so these three systems have very very different risk profiles for example in the first system the risk profile is if you disagree with the majority you would get slashed what if a majority quoted one Bitcoin is one USD and you quoted one Bitcoin is 30 000 USD you are right but you may still lose your fund so the trust model is you are taking a risk on the majority opinion the second model is you're taking a risk on the Tao opinion like the Dao says something and you're you disagree with the Dow you may be right then the dog may be lying out of their teeth like and you may lose your funds so that's the second model the the third model there is no no slashing so actually so this exposes like what I think uh Constantine was talking about earlier which is risk is very nuanced when you're operating into new kinds of distributed systems and calibrating and understanding this is one of the main roles we see for eigenlayer is understanding how to build new distributed systems with proper slashing conditions where you are not subjecting yourself to undue risk but of course it's an open market we believe in permissionless Innovation where many people can come and build these things and we try to balance you know how much openness we have with how much safety conscious we can be and there may be like two tiers where one tier is more trusted and you know has been more vetted and other tier is anybody can build anything and there'll be like different risk profiles on these these kinds of so that's absolutely how we think about it there is a large category of things where you do not need to take on duress but because you know validation risk like I pointed out is actually much more tightly constrained than something like D5 risk and we think this would be the next Frontier so when you when you look at yield stacking like well do you get additional yield you get yield from etherea what is the next level of like marginally additional risk that you can take that will actually give you like productive value I think that's where we want to place ourselves is validation and all the things and I think this is another thing we want to clarify is we are not a D5 protocol we are not a liquid token like it's what eigen layer is building is very different from what a liquid staking is building or what are D5 protocols so we do not Envision on eigen layer the core feature is people sat there withdrawal credential and then you borrow against that's not what we're envisioning eigenlayer what we're envisioning eigen layer to be is a universal validation Marketplace come here you can get you can participate and get validated for many many different things and and it's a double opt-in double opt-in is Staker has to opt into the service the service has to opt into the state and both of them have their own subjective preferences which meet and merge to actually make the market so it brings much more of a free market Dynamic than what we have today oh wait so now I understand so sorry when different projects decide that they want to use eigenlayer for their steak then they also can select specific validators and they don't have to just use all the same validators as ethereum that is correct what I meant by like where we had an aspects earlier which is sometimes you can get more security than ethereum that's a rather insane thing to say why would you think that because when one of the things that you may want is I only want like 1 000 very decentralized notes let's say this is some some special use case as an example I do Secret chatting I take a secret split it into small chunks and send it into thousand notes now I really want to know that these thousand nodes don't collude with each other otherwise the secret will be exposed so what I'm doing is I want to find like you know thousand dispersed nodes and maybe you know you select homesteakers in ethereum and I want to just send it to them because it's a very dispersed group they're not coordinated I I have a question here yeah like how you will choose Solo validators or home validators because it can be a data but if you will use it for airdrops or like for some type of utility I mean it will be maybe it's already people who are running you know like thousandth war or nodes and using different types different data centers to you know like the same with airdrops you know like people are do like couple people I mean like running or thousands of accounts you know like in our bedroom and then again this is airdrops and nobody can understand because it's really difficult and the same as these people even make kyc you know like for example in different networks like Solana for example they have a validation program and Salon is delegating to you know like uh unique validators for example and but it's no information that it is some people who run like 20 notes for Solana and use different identities and this is an issue they just use maybe like all notes or other white label service and their cheats with kyc you know like and the question is you know like how in permissionless sense resistant Network you know like choose the data you know like that you can check yeah this is a great question I think eigen layer itself does not take any position on who's more decentralized or who's less decent place eigen layer is uh we want to be a neutral platform that's what eigen layer this on top of eigen layer we expect people will build more subjective Services one of the framework that we employ a lot when designing eigen layer is a paradigm we call intersubjectivity inter-subjectivity is the idea that there are like many many subjective decisions is a consequence of many people interacting with each other rather than the subjectivity being enforced by the platform so the platform doesn't say oh Lido is more centralized or less centralized because you know in some sense it's more decentralized in some sense it's less decent list and that is not a position for eigen layer to take but what we believe is that Services building on top of eigenlayer can make that judgment each of them have their own judgment their own ideas and their own purposes somebody may say I only want kyc validators and that's up to them somebody may say I only work geographically distributed validators I don't care if it's the same guy running it all over the world one of the services coming on top of eigenlayer is called the proof of location service so approval location service lets the nodes kind of like use latency another thing to kind of figure out use the ethereum nodes to figure out the distribution like the latencies and geographic distribution of other nodes and so you can have very interesting protocols like this which can offer services that other services May then rely on there is no Universal answer to this question and the the just like each one has a subjective opinion on what is enough decentralization that's exactly what we expect and in fact there will be places where people don't want decentralization so this is another important thing we need to understand is for some of the things you want just economic trust I just want like five billion dollars off like staking that is all I care about because if that was wrong I can slash the 5 billion I don't care if it is one guy putting up five billion or like five million people putting up thousand dollars it makes no difference there are protocols like that and there will be protocols which don't care about economics which care about decentralization and there will be protocols which say that no U.S validators okay that's something that they want to use they they can use it some protocols will say I want only us validators because I want to be under the jurisdictional comprehensive I think all we want to do is to enhance the expressivity in the free market and we think of ourselves as a Marketplace for decentralized trust and when you build a Marketplace for a new thing which is not at a commodity one of the things you want to do is to grade the commodity either yourself or have other people grade it and use it subjective and as a protocol we don't take the position of grading it so we are uniform neutral we're neutral to the extent that we accept all eats taking so that's the that's the the kind of scope of how we think about it this is super interesting it's like customizable security I I really like the concept all right um so we're going to discuss um a lot more about staking and security issues but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible join over 80 million people

download the crypto.com app and get 25 with the code Laura Link in the description back to my conversation with SRI Ramen Constantine so we talked a lot about um restaking and I just want to fill out a little bit on the liquid staking side because there's different types of liquid staking as well and I wondered also now with withdrawals enabled like what else is on the horizon in the liquid staking Arena Constantine can you take that yeah first of all I think when withdrawal is available it is like first of all the market can be more competitive you know like why because it's more for new liquid stacking solution for example it's more easy to have some liquidity to withdraw from them for example and also like another thing that still you know like to build like decentralized Network to build healthy Network you need features and some features are still not here for example like I mentioned about or withdrawals that can be run by smart smart contract or by the user initiated withdrawals or and some others because you know like I think that it is a lot of great developers who want to build liquid stake and cool ready building liquids taking and they still has a lot of assumption or like issues not because they don't want to build a great product or like to be to buy to build more decentralized products or to be more are better product because it's just impossible because they depend of the protocol I mean the two levels available it's already like one we have a couple more features and it will be more simple also I think that people will try to take more leverage and their chip is landing will be uh how I mean finished you know like because if your ears is not staked or like if it's put on a landing protocol people will take loan under the take this and Loan some is and just take it again and so the The Landing price will go up and uh and it will be like almost the same you know like depends on the risk again because as I told you again when you put in any defy protocol in any like platform it's always additional risk and we still speak about risk more and uh also I think that we are staking will be available this is also like a great feature and uh yeah I think that I mean that this is a bright future to first of all why keep ethereum permissionless and censorship resistant because you know like Lido for example has a purpose and Mission to keep like ethereum permissionless and our sensor persistent if not like someone else that's great you know like the question is that what we need is like to keep ethereum like because when you stake you get I don't know depends of their uh like how much notes how much it takes and Depends of their how much transaction was done you have about like four percent reward for example per year APR and uh but that's as how to say that's good for long-term people who are really ready to commit to ethereum security but if for example you make your network centralized if you make it like permissioned and censored for example by Mev or any other partner you just disrupt the network the value in what you believe and for what you build and the link from that just State machine or like database and what I try to say here that all this development and mature of ethereum protocol make more competition more features and make it like so decentralized unbelievable you know like and so great that and Unstoppable and they're yeah so like this is what's happening and really make everyone who is contributing who is working on it happy so and then one thing that I was wondering when I was um doing some research um because also there's talk of like super fluid staking so can you just Define that so superfluids is taking is this idea that so normally the way liquid sticking works is you go to it you first go stake in ethereum and then have a liquid staking derivative issued on top right super fluid sticking was an idea introduced in uh I think to go in the reverse Direction first you stake in an application and then use that to stake in a protocol and this was kind of popularized by osmosis where you can take a liquidity provisioning token and then go and stake that in the code protocol of course we cannot do that on ethereum because you know to do this the core protocol needs to respect that particular like you know application token and of course ethereum is not going to allow like you know some uh some other uh LP token to be State into ethereum so that's not a thing that that can is possible but something like that is possible on eigen layer like you can take a steath or a steep eat like a curve or some other LP token and then take that and then deposit it potentially into eigen layer because now what happens is because you have teeth you're getting the ethereum because you have the liquidity provisioning you're getting a yield from that and then you're potentially getting a yield from like eigen layers so this is like a maximal yield Cascade like you're going through like all these three things and again things like this eigen layer does not take a position because we don't want to say what is the risk profile C3 this may be lower risk maybe it's teeth to USD C is a different kind of risk maybe some other thing is much more risk right and this is up to each of the services building on top of eigenyl to decide what kind of like you know a staking collateral to accept and so this is what would be called super fluid staking is basically the idea that you are going through like a T5 or some other protocol and take a kind of like a derivative token and then state that and the way eigenlayer is structured is all kinds of tokens in the ethereum ecosystem can be State and that's you know the vision is kind of be a security Hub like validation hub for all of the ethereum like ecosystem not um and and we we kind of talked about this when we were talking about like the trade-off with the risks but I wondered you know just hearing all this it makes me think about how kind of like every little change you make could be an attack vector and especially like in D5 we've seen the more composable things are like there's a lot of kind of unexpected ways for exploits to happen so um you know obviously eigenlayer is on testing at the moment but I'm when I'm wondering like what are some attack vectors you see there and so we'll start with that with for eigenlayer I think the kind of things I am personally most worried about are basically because to the extent that we are completely permissionless and there is completely permissionless what could happen is somebody comes and builds a protocol on top and it either has like a malicious flashing condition right that would be an attack vector or that protocol itself is just badly designed it's like a Luna or something like you know it just uses the eigenal collateral uses that issue some other like crazy stable coin and then like it has some leverage Loop these are absolutely unpredictable and I think that I would completely agree with you that just like restaking was unpredictable and then once it's that it's kind of like Mev or liquid staking that you know you don't see it and then once you see it it's like oh of course if it is needed and it is imported and you know you don't know what are all the downstream consequences of that and I think that's the same thing we feel with eigenil the way we try to mitigate this is by like I mentioned earlier having this two-tier system where one tier is more closely guarded and much lower risk and now if you want to build something on another tier which is completely permissionless but the first year will be permissioned right in in the sense of like if there is a committee and the committee has to approve these things and to convince the Staker to go to the second tier you know most takers may not take that step but you know if there's a very strong protocol very interesting protocol somebody might and so those are the kinds of risks at least we want to kind of segregate them rather than at you know everything's aggregated and it's very confusing for people and Constantine what about you what are some of the different attack vectors that you're looking out for on the liquid stinking side yeah when we look on any like smart smart contract development I think the biggest risk is smart contracts in any like application like angle there or why the any other you know like and there of course you I I mean like any or Dao or entity is try to make the biggest amount of audits you know like but still I mean this is I think the most dangerous the more complex a code base uh the more risk it is right but is there anything like similar to a 51 person attack that is kind of a known thing that you guys were trying to avoid no I mean like uh it's kind of like a just a buck like in any D5 protocol you know like that is there I I think there's a risk the second of course uh when you like uh I I think like in also like the question I mean like for three Ram here is like how they work with their uh nothing on stake attack for example yes if for someone like delegate there is take this to some operator they're running some software you know like and uh uh they don't have stake and they're how and they for example start to really big and they have for example large amount of mud or like uh they can collude so how you work with it our approach so basically the question is how does eigen layer kind of incentivize the alignment between delegator and like the person want to take it there and they're basically the operator and the sticker and yeah eigen layer takes a very purist view it's like ethereum we do not give any Assurance of any operator just like ethereum if he was taking if you're delegating it's on your head like you don't delegate to people that you don't trust right it's the same model on on eigen layer we do not give any assure answers that's why it's very different from a liquid sticking protocol a liquid saving protocol has to think through like the delegation risk and understand whether it's real world trust whether it's Insurance whether it is you know crypto Economic Security some set of like features that actually lock the the node operator into correct compliance this is not this is out of scope of the eigen layer design eigen layer allows you to specify who you're delegating to but the trust you need to trust the person you're delegating to otherwise do not delegate and we see because we want to keep this as close to the ethereum protocol as possible so so the way we think about eigen layer is is just a staking extension or programmables taking extension of the ethereum protocol so it's very tighty very very similar to the ethereum protocol in that we have no delegation in centers so any delegation incentive is either built by the free market like Lido built the kind of liquid striking protocol on top of ethereum you know protocols like that may basically just opt into eigen layer and then like essentially solve that problem for the market or you know that'll be a delegation ecosystem that emerges which which is you know which solves that but it's out of scope for the native eigenlight itself provides no Assurance on delegation and then one question that I had about Lido is um and this has been something that um people have talked about for a while but there's been concerns that Lido could like effectively almost become like a governance layer for ethereum and you know currently out of all the liquid staking tokens it does have 75 share so are there things that Lido is doing to try to mitigate that yeah first of all I I didn't finish with risk and that was the second reason that I want to mention like one of the risk of liquids taking is for example because uh the logic is of ethereum is still how to say in progress you know like and for example you don't have some features you can't uh oh I mean it's all right I mean it's really difficult to to make now are fully like classification of the protocol yes when and so you have some proxy to upgrade this protocol and now for example all the protocols not all but almost all Hazard upgraded feature of these smart contracts and then can you know like try to attack you know like in this way so uh this governance token they have this power for example online The Forum or lighter research you can read the research about a feature called dual governance and this is dual governance feature can give this proxy this or I I mean this is in my opinion big idea you know like why it's big idea because before it nobody had a solution for agent issue and and here uh lighter can gave their permission to upgrade like to theater the upgrade of smart contracts that connected with stake in confirm to stake its users and it means that if light will try to attack uh ethereum or like ethereum users just take the ethereum users who are really like has are something on stake you know like they can stop this upgrade it's not important for action it's instill in research but as I know like guys are working on it you know like actively and they're this really like powerful you can you can you know like for example think about 1970s when Nixon canceled gold standard you can imagine if other USD holders can have a better power to not make it what they would do would they like Vote or not or they were scammed and before it wasn't possible to program you know like regulation and I think what blockchain give but not a lot of G5 protocols or other protocols use it right now they give an option to make technology regulation and this is a big revolution when you can regulate something by writing smart contracts and it's even like better than better than like current regulation because in our like real regulation sometimes uh some people make hard decision like to cancel as standard uh to because they have like I mean some big reason for it yes and a lot of other people they lose value because I'm sad and in case of and this is dual governance feature it will if for example somebody will implement it for USD dollar back then it would be impossible and that's what really blockchain and make it but the question yeah it is it risky as it is yeah and one other thing um that I think is at risk with Lido is since it follows a custodial model um you know for the user that could obviously result in them losing access to their eth so are there plans to address that as I know ladies not non-custodial and it I mean it doesn't a custodial solution you know like they don't they don't retain control over their private keys yeah no I mean users deposit like I you know I mean like light is a middleware you know like what is like light is a middleware you use it at smart contract system you put this inside then uh like uh this easy staked with some of the validator on the list and then you can I mean like after the light to upgrade uh when these roles will be available you can be on stake this and get your ease in general it's self-casted dissolution so so you don't so is access yes yes of course I thought it was that they are giving it to the validator uh line or run I like I mean land around my dial and it is a smart contract system when you stake you is it's going to validators but validators need to initiate withdrawals you know like to withdrawals are is to the smart contracts uh where the user can withdraw but it's fully like self-cast no validator validation can still is that state with them they can slash it down okay interesting for some reason I thought that there was a point in time where they did not have access to their private keys so I guess I had a misunderstanding about that no in the beginning you know like when like the launched it wasn't an option when smart contract run you know like uh a canvas or can hold withdrawal keys and when like the launch it was a key that was created by 11 different founders of big defy protocols like curve maker uh uh like uh curve maker and others you know like and they make and they have a blast signature it's like a multi-second beacon chain and that holds like about 10 of all is that was there but when withdrawals were available uh these people rotated I mean they can't withdraw but I I mean they they are sign a transaction and rotated this keys to lighter smart contracts okay okay so people retain their private keys and they're just interacting with the smart contract yes okay okay thank you for clarifying that um so let's Circle back to sriram earlier you said that you could go into something called Supra staking if I remember correctly or I don't remember the term what was the term super fluid sticking or no no it was earlier than that you said oh I was saying that usually it's a subset of ethereum security that you would get from from eigenlayer but you know there are places where you could get a superset or more than ethereum security yeah okay so if you just take decentralization then it's even easier for example uh you know one of the things people say is okay you know there are uh eight thousand ten thousand distinct validators in ethereum but you know a small number of them like controller majority but you could just you know in and you could run a protocol on top of eigen layer where you only have like the more decentralized committee so if you just measure on decentralization your protocol can actually have more decentralization if you ask how many nodes are needed to get to 50 of your protocol that could be a much larger number so that's one simple way in which you could get more uh more security than ethereum or more decentralization or more effective decentralization and this is I think we think of this as an incentive for more decentralization to occur because you know the more decentralized nodes X is then they have this potential ability to earn these additional rewards but it is not easy like I think Constantine pointed out to like measure which are the more decentralized nodes and it's a subjective thing and it's not something eigen layers itself planning to do whereas other protocols may be built whose Specialties and doing it and depending on whether there is demand for decentralization versus demand for staking pure economics different people may use different things and in fact I think even ethereum itself right it's so when we talk about oh is liquids taking a risk for ethereum it's because the protocol has defined some rules which is basically you know how much each stake determines how much reward you get like that is the protocol rules everybody is just playing by the protocol rules it's not like anybody is like modifying the protocol it will say everybody's playing by the protocols but the protocol has no internal way to detect say decentralization and reward it but certain aspects of the ethereum protocol require decentralization and censorship resistance for example and because the protocol is under specifying the constraints because the protocol has not specified that it needs decentralization and because decentralization is not objectively measurable and that is what is leading to these unseen second order effects like which we do not know how to control and one way that uh something like I can play a role there is because it is adding on additional incentives that can drive like different demands for different kinds of nodes you know uh both existing protocols can existing stakers can opt to become more decentralized because there is an additional reward for being more decentralized whether that is geographic whether that is stake itself comes from listing sources there is no common Point smart contract risk whatever it is that the applications Define as decentralized that is what will end up as being an objective but also I think there is a counter Force which is some applications may want Enterprise grade validators like because they just that's what they care about they care about real world trust and the emergent set of features from a system like eigenlayer is quite interesting and unpredictable and I I don't know what what it would be but the thing that I want to say is we are letting the market value the different aspects of trust differently like the aspect of Economics the aspect of decentralization the aspect of kyc these are all different aspects of trust and they will be valued very differently by the past super interesting all right so I know eigenlayer I think expects to be live on mainnet and Q3 is that still the case that is correct so why don't we just talk a little bit about what it is that we're looking forward to when it comes to staking or like what developments you're watching in the staking slash restaking worlds for the next I don't know through the rest of the year uh you know like her first of all I think that Mev is really important you know like and purpose uh I I mean it's because for now uh it is a market you know like where people are trying to uh extract muv you know like and there are two three layers who give you know like or blocks to validators and validation Sciences blocks but it is a lot of discussion around that for example you can look on social drama that somebody like stolen is then they use uh maybe you know like and uh I mean and there are things that this is one of their like piece that should be fixed and it is a lot of work or that should be done there on protocol level and maybe even like this me this should be burnt you know like and then it will make the situation much better and uh yeah I think Justin Drake is proposing that yeah yeah I I think it should be discussions you know and yeah yeah I see I I I I'm for example think that it's a great story why because in other way if it will be like a parties who make a decision around that that can be a mess you know like so it should be done on a protocol level I mean like the regulation quality you know like because it's a lot of questions about like legal status and discussion yes that I want to touch but I think it's important and also like uh track trade treatment of taking uh that will make really adoption better and uh uh I I mean like uh what are the issues there with the tax treatment I mean like it's not clear or you know like how to tax serve for example taking rewards uh should it speed daily or like uh what type of or for example you know like you have two different type of liquids taken care uh tokens you know like that uh for example a cure value or a based and it's also like not clear Clarity right now the meta quality and but regulation will make it more available you know like for people to participate in security you know like of ethereum also and also like more developers will build more solutions and that will be better for everyone uh uh yeah so I I mean like uh it can it's also like this or uh with I mean withdrawal in initiation exits you know like by smart contracts and by users that's important I mean small features not like uh Innovations but it's just should be done um and there but in general I think that they're staking will be really how to say uh for me I of course it I mean it will be like different other uh markets uh that for example as we are mentioned like data availability maybe like it will be uh decentralized sequencer markets it will be like Mev markets oracles where it will be used but again and but I I don't see you know like in this mechanic a lot of Innovations you know like it's I mean it's not a lot of what we can do there it's just a mechanic uh but uh what are interesting is and what I really like always try to mention is risk that and when you like take more risk I mean and when it's composable you should think about different attack vectors and what I can learn and other people who use risk taking they need to make a lot of research and make a lot of Innovations you know like how to work with this composable risk how what will happen to for example your curator slashed 100 and you run and other networks I mean maybe this is edge cases but it can happen and uh and they're all like you have like a big Network set for and a lot of history staked and it's uh start to find like a lot of value because they can for example flash this network and then you slashed a lot of validators on ethereum that also can happen so this is our I mean different composition of staking with other risk taking efficiency yeah that's definitely interesting uh to look yeah this is a super interesting uh points I think uh how to understand composite addition of risk between ethereum and like other other things that could be built on top I disagree with Constantine on the premise that like things like Mev and Oracle are not that Innovative I think there's like a lot of crazy things that can be built on top of these things but the base layer needs to be safe and secure I also agree with Constantine on that that actually the uh the risk management on the base layer needs to be very sound only then you can start building other things much more uh safely on top and a basic question there is how much of Leverage that you can take and what is leverage I think is itself not Quantified for example right now on ethereum we have 35 billion dollars of staking and you have you know 500 billion dollars of assets why is this okay it's okay I think but it needs a theory for why it's okay and we need to understand why it is okay is it over leveraged is it under leveraged if it's already over leveraged maybe we should not build something more like I can and that's correct and that's that's the view we dig actually we think it's under leverage you can actually use security for more things as well as more staking is coming up I we don't think like the 35 billion of it is the stake it's going to expand massively over the coming years and the questions about how to divide like the uh risk across these different layers how to make sure that there is a common view like if something happens bad on some layer how does the other layers respond to it how to make sure that nobody assumes that they have more security than they actually have so this I think I want to separate into two minor paths like one part of eigen layer is what we call pooled security pool security is let's say there's 10 billion dollars of stake and there is 10 or 10 protocols built on top right all of them basically these 10 billion dollars is validating all of these 10 protocols so the shared security of each of these 10 protocols is 10 billion dollars why because to attack any one protocol now I need to attack the 10 billion dollars this is already like really useful and in fact this is ethereum's model today why do I say that on top of ethereum let's say there are 10 applications like each of the applications don't have attributable security unit swap doesn't get like out of the 35 billion they don't get like 10 billion just for unusual that's not how it works it's just shared across all these different Services all these tabs and there's no attributable security to each application built on top of ethereum that's the same way that eigenlayer V1 works is there's no attributable security to any one application built on top the V2 that we're already like doing research on which is you know trying to address issues like composability of risk has attributable security like if you have 10 protocols built on top each protocol can have a portion of the 10 billion depending on how much they are willing to pay for it attributable to them so when it gets slashed they get access to a portion of the slashed funds depending on how much premium they're willing to pay so understanding these markets understanding their like fundamental effects on ethereum itself these are all things we are actually quite excited about and also how ethereum's staking and rewards can itself be tuned based on an understanding of the second order consequences is something we are quite excited yeah one point I forgot what to mention you know like his DVT you know like distributed technology why because first of all I mean first of all you know like some uh professional validators are already use so they have teams for example because you know like always a question who is holding the keys you know like and to not hold the keys by one person because if for example it's a big staking company uh like for example P2P you know like and uh uh the question is and I am like a founder of it but I'm not holding all the kids by myself and the question is how to hold the keys it is like one way is to have a hardware secure model you know like that holding these keys and but it's still a lot of attacks that can be done internally you know like all like if somebody will get access to your uh machine and uh and for that you know like a large validators already use Welsh and they also like distribute the key to menu like develops for example and they are and to sign the block uh I mean this devops so sign it together and so nobody has one key you know like two uh for example uh destroy uh this validator or like it makes the double sign and this DVT technology will go to the masses you know like when mob you know like the problem of taking that like more complex the staking the more it's centralized you know like and this is a big issue of staking then for example polka dots taking is really complex why because you need I mean how it's work uh how rewards work that it's distributed to for example top 300 or like no not operators in the same amount and this means that the best strategy is to distribute to the last one and because of that the last one has the biggest APR and for example P2P because it has a good technical team build a special software that every time every book will distribute view this stake to you know like a last one and that's how P2P talk for example 10 or even bigger market share in polkadot is it bad for the centralization yes bad uh and it's really bad yes but uh is it but for like some companies they try to execute or take more revenue and the question is first of all it should be open and people should disclosure and different types of the data set notes never run and when you know like we will have for example shardin can ethereum which will be even more complex to run and out and this you know like how to say for for uh staking providers it will be more harder to run the notes and maybe it will be like examples where part of the keys will hold by professional validators like P2P program like and others and part of the kids will be run by users for example you can run uh you know it in your home and if if it's just was switched off by some reason you know like it's the note is still signing because other parties are signing and for example somebody from P2P like or call you like Laura how like what's happened you need to switch off your box back and they're paying for electricity or what else and then it starts to work again yeah and I think that innovation in DVT is still and also you should understand that you can't use one DVT solution because if it is a bug there the part of the network can go down and so it should be like different players on DVT market and the same as with clients you know like you have in ethereum you have a lot of clients and if one drop down you can move your to another client and also I want to mention that it is like great companies for example in DVT it's like oboe SSV and others who's working on it and also it either like company who are building boxes you know like for uh for users it's like depth node and some other yes and they're great because they give a person who is not has skills to run and out by themselves and I think that re to make it really like Network decentralized we need like more Innovation here maybe like we need to move funding here to I don't know you put a small server in your home put in there like in a plug and it's not just work and uh yeah I think that that is important yeah all right well um this has been a really interesting discussion there's honestly so much that we could unpack um I'm sure we'll be revisiting issues around staking and restaking in the future but in the meantime where can people learn more about each of you and your work please follow us on Twitter at eigenlayer uh there's also uh this course forum forum.eigenlayer.xyz and a Discord uh please uh you know which is linked from our Twitter so please go ahead and follow on these things my personal Twitter ID is at Shriram Canon so please follow that yeah or I think Twitter is the best place you know like where you can read and also follow and communicate or under because you know like I'm building I'm building a lot of different projects and we will do for example the centralizer PC and so on many others yes and uh uh and I think that uh yeah so like soon we will announce you know like uh General like entity like investment entity uh cyber fund uh that you know like and we'll try to make all the communication you know my communication and my focus will be there yeah okay great well it's been a pleasure having you both on Unchained thank you thank you so much Laura Constantine bless you thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about sriram Constantine eigenlayer and Lido and the state of ethereum staking check out the show notes for this episode Unchained is produced by
