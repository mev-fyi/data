hi everyone lucky the unconfirmed the podcaster reveals how the marquee names and crypto are reacting to the week's top headlines it gets the inside scoop on what they see on the horizon I'm your host Lauren in response to the challenging times crypto TOCOM is waiving the 3.5% credit card fee for all crypto purchases download the crypto comm app today today's guest is Stephen pally partner at Anderson kill and chair of the firms technology media and distributed systems practice group welcome Stephen hi how you doing Laura great glad to have you there's been a lot going on in the area of crypto and law recently let's start with the recent spate of class-action lawsuits against 42 defendants in 16 countries that all relate to icos as well as exchanges from 2017 some of the defendants include finance bloc one bank or status civic Tron bit Mex etc can you summarize what those eleven lawsuits are about in five seconds or less yes so people lost people lost money due to market fluctuations and even though the assets are at issue are described in as decentralized or distributed as one would expect when people lose money they try to find other people who are responsible that's it in a nutshell basically and who are these plaintiffs I don't know who they are personally they are people who you know owned crypto and you know some of them own substantial amounts and they allegedly suffered substantial losses they're represented by the same at least one of the firm's that's involved is a firm that represents the plaintiff in a lawsuit against craig right in a florida federal court and you know they're people who they are these are what are known as I believe these were filed as putative class actions which means they hope to represent others who they allege were similarly rocked and is it just that they lost money because you know if I buy a stock and lose money on the stock obviously I can't bring a lawsuit so you know what is it about the situation here that has that you know that gives them grounds to bring a lawsuit will they claim that there is a culpability market manipulation that the various defendants had a role in causing or contributing assets to their assets the value of their assets to diminish and that's it I'm sort of over generalizing but that's sort of the nubbin of it and this has always been something that people who watched lawyers who watch this market expected i SPECT you're gonna be asking me about the maker Dao lawsuit as well but what we see generally in in all of the crypto lawsuits is traditional legal principles being applied to newish technology and old-fashioned causes of actions and claims whether federal securities law claims or common law tort claims being applied regardless of the the names or titles given to the the assets in question or frankly for that matter regardless of the location of the defendants because many of the defendants in the lawsuits that you asked about are actually not in the United States yeah this was something we'll get to that in a moment but I also wanted to ask since a lot of the icos named in these lawsuits are from 2017 which is you know about three years ago and a lot of them also are from the period before the SE C's Dow Report which was kind of their first foray into the world of I see what do you why do you think these lawsuits are happening now because of recent recent substantial losses flash crashes and so forth the argument there will be like one of the defenses that will be raised absolutely is statute of limitations right and so skimming through the some of the lawsuits you can see that the plaintiffs are using the SEC the SEC sees digital framework a document which came out I want to say about a year ago I don't have the exact data maybe it was in May of last year they're using that as a sort of a threshold date as when when it became known according to the plaintiffs that many of these things were actually securities now whether or not that argument will win the day remains to be seen but we can certainly expect many of the defendants to argue that these cases are claims or stale and many of them will argue that at the very least people who invested in pre report icos should have known as of the time those reports were issued they'll also make the plaintiffs will also make arguments that the statute of limitations wouldn't apply to exchanges particularly in cases where the exchanges were not registered as national exchanges or as broker dealers and where they were engaged in a continuing sale of the assets at issue so it's that was a long-winded answer which is basically the TLDR is it's complicated time is definitely going to be an issue it's not entirely clear to me who's going to win it's mistake to on the one hand say it's a slam dunk for the plaintiffs it's not it's a challenge on the other hand would be a mistake to to underestimate either the merits of the lawsuit the lawsuits the resources that these lawyers are bringing to it or the quality of those lawyers there if you look at the Craig Wright litigation they're actually the Roch Freedman firm with which I'm familiar they've got skills so I wouldn't rule out some success so yeah before we talk about that law firm I actually also wanted to dive into the claims against the exchanges so you know I've been asking about the icy OS but what about the exchanges what what do these lawsuits tend to say so I don't actually have the complaints in front of me I should have done that but there are allegations that they were acting as unregistered broker dealers as unregistered exchanges and as a consequence were acting in violation of federal securities laws that they were selling unregistered securities and in addition to that that they were that they were perhaps negligent in the way that they maintained their exchanges so there those are some of the claims so basically that the the basic idea is that if you were acting as an exchange as that term is defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 you have to register unless you're subject to an exemption or if you are acting if you are acting as a broker or a dealer of securities and the allegation is that these digital assets we're securities you have to register as such and the failure to do so can expose you to fairly significant liability and you mentioned you know about this law firm that it is the same one that's brought suits against Craig right and BitFenix and I wondered is there any significance to that about it being the same law firm or is it just you know they're familiar with this territory well they're good lawyers they've also because they have I mean the way it works is in law there's a certain amount of marketing that you do in name building and brand building so I don't know how they got their clients but it's certainly possible that you know people sent them direct messages on Twitter or emailed them someone who lost money might have gone to them and said hey I saw what you did and the Craig Wright litigation can you represent me in this case they might have also done some sort of marketing or advertising or outreach I don't know but part of it is sort of a definitely an interest some expertise in the space which they've gained through that litigation and another litigation some of it would be people recognizing their name because of that involvement it does happen another piece of it is they probably I don't have any personal knowledge of this but I'm assuming that they have a decent amount decent financial cushion it took a fair lis significant amount of time to put those lawsuits together to write them people have got to eat and pay rent or mortgage as well they do so and a class action can take years to resolve the when was the tezo's class-action filed was that filed initially in 2017 it just settled and yeah it's settled in 2020 in the spring I mean these things take time and that didn't even get to class certification so in order to successfully prosecute a class action you have to have money that's an investment because the lawyers aren't being paid hourly presumably unless they've got litigation funding or finance so all right so in a moment we'll discuss more of the details about these lawsuits plus get into the maker Dow one but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible in response to the challenging times crypto TOCOM is introducing three measures to help the community first the 3.5% credit card fee for all crypto purchases will be waived for the next three months second you can now get up to ten percent back by using the MCO Visa card on food and grocery shopping lastly you could buy gift cards on the crypto comm F from merchants like Whole Foods Safeway Burger King and more and get 20% back on food and 10% back on groceries download the crypto dot-com app today back to my conversation with Stephen pally so the lawsuits also specifically named some individuals such as Chen ping Jie Zhao also known as ez the CEO of Finance also Brendon bloomer the CEO of Locke one but Mexico founder and CEO Arthur Hayes as well as other people the claims against them are under something called control theory liability control person control person yeah can you explain more what that means and then whether or not you should actually think that applies in these lawsuits yes so the basic idea that's was at section 20 it's a section 20 a claim under the US under the Securities Act the basic idea is that if you are if you have management control or authority over the sale of security or securities related transaction you can have derivative or secondary liability for that what does that mean it's it's a way typically speaking corporate executives directors officers and employees are typically protected from liability for claims against the corporation by the corporate shield that's why you form a corporation right or an LLC one of the reasons is for limited liability under American securities laws someone who who has control person role can be deemed personally responsible or personally liable for securities law violations undertaken by the company so it's a you know it's something that involved in litigating now outside of the securities context yeah it's real and yeah I mean if do you think that will apply in these lawsuits I am sure that they will argue that they don't have control person liability but you know a CEO of a corporation founder somebody involved in selling an unregistered security if that's what it is this is what a control person liability theory is made for so yes I know I don't think these are trivial arguments yes it's a real thing and it's sort of the bread and butter of Securities Litigation you see these in all kinds of securities related lawsuits so you're saying like essentially there is a possibility that somebody would find that it does apply in this case but it's not a definite it's not it's a slam-dunk well so if the plaintiffs get past what's here's what's gonna happen there will be motions to dismiss there will be motions to dismiss on jurisdictional grounds they may raise time as an issue so statute of limitations may be an issue and it's and they're also gonna have to serve people overseas via The Hague Convention and all of that procedural stuff is gonna take some time but if they managed to get past that yes if they can state a claim against the entities the claims against the CEOs and founders under akun section 20 controlled person theory those will remain and they will have secondary or derivative liability potentially yeah the question the first instance is the question in the first instance in order for that to be control person liability there has to be underlying fault so you have to you have to find fault in something that the business did in the first instance I think that's a correct statement of the law if not I'm sure somebody listening almost but you know without that without the underlying liability you don't have the secondary liability to the control person liability and frankly the entities are fairly deep pocketed so you know it's not like I don't think that there's going to be a collection issue a problem okay but one other potential hurdle is the fact that the 11 class-action lawsuits span 16 jurisdictions I don't know so how does that work like do you need to work out jurisdiction with with each different jurisdiction is it like case-by-case or is it a blanket thing or how how do they assert that it's possible that I wonder if these lawsuits will be I guess there's possibility they'll be consolidated but the answer is every defendant is entitled to raise jurisdictional objections and is entitled to if their overseas require service via and where it's applicable to hague convention so for example if you sue someone and let's say you sue defendant in france what you'd have to do is you need to get the lawsuit translated into french and then you typically would have to get it done I haven't done this with France recently I've done it working on something with the UK right now you have to serve it there's something called a central authority which might be a court it takes a while it can take you know several months six months in some countries now because of Kovan central authorities aren't actually working so that's another factor that's gonna slow things down some courts aren't you can file lawsuits but courts aren't issuing a summons which is a necessary something you need in order to serve a lawsuit so I kind of diverged a little bit but the basic answer is it's every single defendant is going to be allowed to raise their own jurisdictional argument hmm okay and it sounds like that will also be how it goes for the actual securities claims that again it will be the facts and circumstances of each one is that what you think or do you think that we'll see kind of like the same judgment across all eleven no I mean what could happen is all of these cases can end up being assigned to the same judge or the same set of judges that might make sense because there will be common legal issues but look I mean they're different they're different parties the jurisdictional questions will be addressed with each stuff like if people remember amendment you followed this if you remember the Tesla litigation there were motions to dismiss that were filed by a variety of defendants and some of the European defendants actually got out what was in a Bitcoin Suisse I believe they were dismissed the other defendants so the foundation the individual defendants they remained in there their jurisdictional motions were not allowed so it it's going to be a defendant by defendant inquiry each of them will have to be served and each of them will be able to say no there's no jurisdiction over me in New York wait and sorry my question wasn't about the jurisdiction but just about the actual outcome of the case about whether or not it's securities laws are violated sure sure sure so you know each of the ICS was different if you're asking whether decision in one case will be influential in another you know my my view is yes it will be if one judge is making these determinations then how they how they decide on how they decide what Civic is and how they decide what you know block one is or what it's what that offering was will certainly be influential you know they'll also the judge will also look at their recent Telegram ruling which I know is up on appeal but yes I think it will at least be persuasive so in law we've got their two concepts for authority you've got persuasive Authority and you've got binding Authority so it might be persuasive Authority for what one judge says about one ICO with respect to a ruling in another but the actual finding will not be binding on another case it wouldn't be what lawyers call them res judicata or collateral estoppel or so forth okay so we're running under time but let's quickly move on to the other big class-action lawsuit news in crypto which is the twenty eight million dollar case against the maker foundation for losses suffered on Black Thursday can you summarize what that's about and what the likelihood is that you think it has of succeeding so the allegation is that the maker foundation developed and actively promotes the use of digital currency called dye which it claims is more secure and unstable than others because dye are over collateralized by other digital currency and if the value of the collateral drops maker foundation assures investors then that triggers that liquidation event where collateral is auctioned off to pay outstanding died plus liquidation penalty otherwise the hold gets the balance of their collateral back and they say that on on March 12th 2020 which is known as Black Thursday the value of aetherium drop dramatically triggering mass liquidation events for CDP holders but instead of triggering actual auctions that would have resulted in minimal or at least mitigated losses for investors the maker Foundation's protocol triggered what they call pseudo actions and two BOTS continually operated buying up liquidated CDP's for zero dollar bids so in other words despite being promised that auction and over collateralization would mitigate damages against dramatic drops and collaterally instead lost a hundred percent of their collateral losing a total of eight point three to five million during the liquidation which is they say now worth over eleven million dollars that's a summary that I'm taking from the complaint but that's basically the nuts and bolts of it I mean and it sounds what's interesting is it sounds very much like sort of a traditional you know margin liquidation this sounds like sort of traditional finance I guess is what what I'm saying even though it's called decentralized and these things are called CDP's right and so what do you think the likelihood is that this lawsuit will succeed I don't actually have a good read on it so I don't know I'm not I'm not gonna make a prediction about this one I guess what I'd say is I personally like without getting into the merits of what whether died is going to be successful in the end or whether or not maker foundation did a good thing I was always skeptical that these things were actually decentralized in such a way that the people involved in them couldn't end up having personal liability so I think it's really interesting to say this decentralized ecosystem thing end up you know being directly responsible according to complaint for people losing you know more than according according to complaint more than 10 million bucks and instead of it being hard to figure out who to blame for it you know they're corporate entities that are named right that to me is the really interesting thing about this and it also you know whatever one thinks a Bitcoin or doesn't think a Bitcoin it also perhaps shows the wisdom of Satoshi in remaining anonymous you know the only security against getting sued for problems with digital assets is really for nobody knowing who the heck you are um one other thing I wanted to ask about the maker lawsuit is something that just was so incredibly fascinating to me which is that the maker community had a vote on whether or not to compensate victims and most people were in favor but there was another part that really caught my attention which is that they agreed that quote to withdraw vault holders will need to browse to a web page where they agree to indemnify maker and affiliates against any potential legal claims for their loss do you think that's enforceable forceable I mean it's crazy that all of this decentralization theater and you're getting traditional and you're somebody's demanding and indemnity I don't I don't know I'd have to read it to tell you whether or not it's enforceable the the reason why you asked for things like this is because you're you're worried that somebody's going to come after you right right so it's the indemnity is would it be contrary to public policy I don't know I haven't actually read it so I'd be I'd be speculating it's fascinating to me that someone asked for that though yeah well I guess we'll have to see how that plays out well I was gonna ask you about the little crypto Twitter storm around her tweet this week but we're sort of out of time so I think I'll just have to recommend that people read the essay that you wrote or the responses to your tweet which most of them seem to all be saying the same thing which was some variation of you're wrong well I mean you know you play on Twitter you have to expect people to you know say facepalm boomer well but that's okay it's it's you know it's working really I will say this I know we're running out of time it sparked a really interesting conversation and I've gotten some wonderful feedback and it's helped me it's helped refine my views so I I welcome all of it even the people who said I'm an idiot yes I agree I agree it was actually a really interesting thing to follow and I liked you had a muted actually that's so funny I totally got it sometimes you're just like I'm over this conversation I'm not but I was like I'm not I have like 12 hours of work to do like I didn't do any work responding one day and the next day I had to work until like midnight so so yeah that's actually why I don't spend a lot of time on Twitter cuz I have to do so anyway all right well it's been so great having you on the show thanks for coming in and confirmed thank you so much that was a ton of fun okay now it's time for everyone's favorite news recap first headline in depth China's soon to launch national blockchain platform lots of blockchain news out of China this week China's blockchain service network or BNs launched domestically on Wednesday and is set to launch globally on April 25th it is designed to make it easy for companies and software developers to plug and play to build blockchain applications coin desk quotes James Cooper a law professor at California Western School of Law who says quote the move is very much like the one belt one Road initiative in which China provides other countries with infrastructure and gains some first mover advantage coin desk also says the BSN is not a blockchain protocol but quote a centralized platform that has done the hefty living for lifting for developers so they can plug in and code choosing from several enterprise blockchain protocols or public chains the goal is to reduce their operational costs improve flexibility and provide better regulatory oversight according to the white paper so far the permissioned blockchain protocols included our hyper ledger Baidu's super chain and fisk o which is from a consortium of china's a shenzhen government agencies and local tech companies such as $0.10 we bank and huawei the white paper says that the BS n will also include public public blockchains aetherium and AOS next headline dcep Wallet application revealed screenshots from a test of a dcep wallet application from the Agricultural Bank of China made the rounds on Twitter this week in a tweet storm last week's unconfirmed guest Matthew Graham said that it shows the four test cities which are Shen Zhen Zhong on Chengdu and Sujal which he called tier 1 or tier two cities that are home to tech talent one especially notable feature is touch / offline payment which enables users to transact via near-field communication or NFC when users are offline he also notes that the system for issuing dcep follows a two-tier system in which the People's Bank of China connects to commercial banks and other financial intermediaries which in turn connect with retail customers the issuance of cash adds as dcep is more like a conversion event and that is a bottom-up approach he says quote starting from the users own bank wallet as opposed to top down from the PBOC Mali from hashkee wrote a twee storm about it and said quote if China decides to fully regulate the crypto exchanges using dcep might become the only well only way to buy or sell crypto to Fiat next headline Libre reissues white paper as single currency stable coins while China's central bank digital currency plans get underway Libra is

these single currency stable coins the approach is similar to the IMF Special Drawing rights or SDR the system which they initially said would begin permissioned but over time transition to permission lists well now instead move to what David Marcus the head of Libra or Calibra actually at Facebook described in a tweet as quote a market-driven open and competitive network one in which the participants will always remain known to each other as for what people think of the changes one Silicon Valley investor told coin desk governments could be interested in outsourcing the transition of their currencies to digital to an organization like Libre but he'd questioned whether or not partners will remain interested in a project whose business model features such low returns next headline

inception on a related note the Financial Times reports that andreessen horowitz is raising a second fund for a 16z crypto and they are eyeing a 450 million dollar raise alright time for fun bits I have two fun bits this week the first is human IPOs is this gonna be a thing this week crypto entrepreneur Alex Maz match and if he's listening excuse me if I just mingled your name I hope not it Alex announced that he'd sold twenty thousand dollars worth of personal tokens called you guessed it Alex has 15 participants Alex holders will receive 15% of his income in the next three years capped at $100,000 plus they receive one-on-one sessions with Maz much access to his network and possible participation in the seed round of this next startup he's going to work on building a new defy savings startup the $20,000 will fund his relocation from Paris to San Francisco so am i the only one who heard this and immediately whipped out the calculator to figure out how the hell then that works out for him on this because either he's underestimated how far the $20,000 will go in San Francisco or his idea of how much money he's going to make is kinda low but then also on top of all that he has these Kickstarter like bonuses he's going to give out some of which are time consuming and as we all know time is the most precious resource so maybe I'm wrong we'll see I guess yeah we'll just have to wait to see how this pans out all right second fun bits another crypto community coronavirus effort covet earth on last week I mentioned some cryptic community efforts to fight kovat 19 and I forgot to mention one called covet Athan which is a hackathon working on building privacy centric solutions for kovat 19 using a IM blockchain technologies is put on by the decentralized AI alliance under the leadership of singularity net and ocean protocol the first phase runs until April 30th which is the deadline to submit so if you have an idea you still have a bit less than two weeks to do
