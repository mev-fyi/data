in the philippines welcome leah hi laura thanks for having me you made a documentary about filipinos who are earning money playing axey infinity what did you find in making the film yeah so we launched this documentary in may 2021 but it was actually filmed in january and uh the story goes back before that time it it originated from a coindesk article that i wrote in august 2020 about a community in a place called kabanatowan city uh it's a very provincial place in the philippines uh it's known for its rice fields and thousands of trike drivers which is kind of like the filipino equivalent of a taxi driver except they drive a motorbike and um you know i got wind of this story of about 100 people on a street in this rural area that was playing this incredibly complex blockchain game amid the covert 19 lockdowns and the money that they earned from it they were using to put food on the table i thought it kind of sounded too good to be true so i had to investigate and uh it turned out to be very true wrote this story published it on coindesk in august and you know i've actually seen lots of really interesting trends about crypto adoption in the philippines i've written about libra and remittances all sorts of stuff but this axi infinity story really took off and i think it was people in emerging economies that kind of share similar sorts of demographics in terms of what was happening in the philippines amid the lockdowns um they they were stuck at home they had no income they were struggling to support their families and yet they had a mobile phone and an internet connection so yeah wrote this story um it it sort of started to take off and it wasn't until december later that year that i got a call from um gabby dies on at yield guild games and he said you know this story that you wrote it's kind of really hit a nerve what if we turned it into a video and look i've never made a documentary before but i was kind of thinking how hard could it be yeah let's do that so the the whole point of the documentary was that we actually went out to nuevo asia where these people live tracked them down visited them at their homes learned their backstories and we wanted to give them a platform to be able to share to the rest of the world this amazing experience that they'd had with a acute blockchain game with digital pets how did such a rural area stumble upon this game and why was it that one street yeah so i think it's important to kind of understand the context of the philippines like um so in fastest consulting we're really interested in southeast asia and how a lot of growth can come from here in terms of leapfrog innovation and new technologies but in the philippines it's a really perfect environment for that sort of stuff because you've got a population that is english speaking they're super tech savvy they spend more time on social media than anyone else in the entire world and they love games so i don't think it's any surprise that this population kind of gravitated toward this idea of a cute fun game that could make money i guess it starts to take off during the lockdown through word of mouth really and through community network effects which i guess a lot of people talk about in crypto in terms of you know educating each other and uh you know bringing each other along the journey but i'd never really seen it you know in effect like this so yeah it was literally just friends and family helping each other learn how to play this game learn how to earn these tokens and eventually cash out and turn it into food on the table and so when you say that what kind of money were they earning um in terms of what they could earn through normal jobs it's that's a really important question to kind of be contextualized in terms of the growth of the game i think um so slp which is small love potion the token that can be earned within the game the price of it is super volatile so you know earlier this year it was uh like one cent um and recently it was spiking you know well over 20 cents i think it even went over 30 cents at some point so there's a huge spectrum there in terms of what people can earn and early on in the days too there were very few caps uh in terms of how much slp you could earn in the game so you literally had people who were taking it in shifts playing around the clock kind of looking like bots on the system just to earn as much slp as possible because it was a better earning opportunity than what they had here in the philippines on the ground um but in effect uh so what i saw was that um in the early days this was like mid-2020 people were earning sort of around 10 000 pesos a week if they were top players that's sort of around 400 usd a month back then um i think a lot of people in western economies might sort of think oh that's not really that much like 400 a month but over here it's well above minimum wage and often for a lot of people a lot more than they were earning even before they went into the lockdown oh wow okay so if they're earning more than they could with a regular job that makes total sense why wouldn't you just play video game instead so they earned this a small love potion or i think now it's called smooth love potion yeah how do they then turn those game earnings into cash so back then it was quite difficult um you would need to uh swap your slp for ethereum on a decentralized exchange such as uni swap and then in the philippines there's actually a really sophisticated uh on an off-ramps network so over here if you want to buy bitcoin for example you could actually go to a local 7-eleven or your supermarket and deposit cash to be able to get crypto out so that kind of facilitated the ability to be able to swap your slp for say ethereum and then send it to another exchange which would provide this off-ramps ability a lot of people in the early days were using coins.ph is a very well known exchange it's very popular with consumers and and often a place that people go to first when they're new to crypto but it's it's actually moved on from there so we're seeing so much demand now for trade volume in terms of this token in the philippines that some exchanges are actually offering a direct slp to philippine peso trading pair so yeah like it's insane like this this in-game token is it is so in demand that you've got a central bank licensed exchanges in the philippines that will do direct swap um examples are um so bloom x they do an otc deal they really know their customers so they actually do it via facebook messenger um pretty much every filipino is on facebook so that's a great option for them there but just recently finance p2p started doing a direct swap as well so i think that's kind of a reflection in terms of how much this is taking off here and so if in the beginning it was just that one street in that small rural town how big would you say x infinity is in the philippines now so i do actually know the stats for that um so i recently checked in with jiho who's the head of growth at axi infinity to ask him exactly this because i wanted to know how much it had grown since i wrote that very first article in august last year and what i didn't know was that back then axi had less than 500 daily active users and today it's well over half a million and we're not even one year later now in terms of where they're coming from um they do have a global audience but it's expected that at least sort of 50 to 60 percent of them are from the philippines so it certainly has a huge player base here and i guess like in terms of impact you know this is kind of a segue but um if you look at something like el salvador which has just uh taken on bitcoin in terms of legal tender that originated from a rural community in el salvador bitcoin beach that was using bitcoin and demonstrating its use case so i guess this is where i get really excited about the power of rural communities to really kind of control these conversations and have huge impact in terms of um decisions and actions that are taken at a very high level and but has it expanded out from the rural areas in the philippines to cities as well or is it still a role from a phenomenon yeah absolutely i think it's really popular in the rural areas uh just because it does give people access to income generation that is very hard to come by in those areas uh you know most people who are in rural areas they don't they don't have a lot of options like particularly in the fallout of the pandemic which uh you know the philippines is still very much struggling with most people have lost their jobs um overseas filipino workers have been repatriated and you know they come home to a place that didn't really have enough jobs or high enough wages uh before they left so people are looking for better ways to be able to earn money but that rhetoric i think is kind of exciting to anyone i guess what i hear is that anyone who hears what a fun game that i can make money off they're kind of interested to learn more and i guess you know i've got friends in australia who are playing it and getting excited that they made 50 bucks off playing a game this week so it definitely resonates well beyond just the philippines in terms of provincial areas all right so we're going to discuss a little bit more some of the recent developments around axiomfinity but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible did you know nearly 338 million dollars worth of the nfts were sent last year and in 2021 that number is growing faster than ever if you're looking to make your first nft check out near's fast scalable low-cost open source platform nir is investing 80 million near tokens and community-led

the data they generate and earn rewards for staking it with applications creating the first ever responsible data economy back to my conversation with leah callan butler so we were talking about how um axiomfinity has grown in terms of its users um can you give me a sense in the philippines what the demographics are of the groups that are playing you know so obviously as you said it's pretty popular in the rural areas but can you give me any other idea of who is playing yeah i think this is probably one of the most interesting things about the play to earn movement in general that it appears to be attracting a completely different um customer segment or user base than what people would expect of both crypto and gaming um so you would have seen in the play to earn mini documentary that there were two particular demographics that i think have really resonated with people firstly uh lola and lola this adorable elderly couple who because they're in the high risk category during the covert 19 lockdowns they were isolated board without an income they used to run a sari sari store which is kind of like a convenience store in the philippines but they're everywhere and uh you know they were used to making a fair living from that store but while everyone was locked down of course they weren't making anything um they learned about the game through neighbours and they became completely addicted to it what i heard from them was that they loved the idea that they could earn money from it and that was great they use it to supplement things like buying medicines they said you know we're old people we have lots of medicines but they also said that it was kind of this element of escapism like you know think about it you're a 75 year old man you're stuck at home you're missing your family you can't go to church like you used to every weekend and you don't know when this nightmare is going to end they actually told me that the lockdowns were worse than what they remembered going through in terms of the marcos here in the philippines so it was really really a tough time for them but they found this game and it gave them this joy and delight and i guess something to go to each day which the interesting thing was i said oh so what other mobile games do you play and they were like none almost like that was a ridiculous question to ask like what do you mean other games so i think you know that's one nobody expected to see an elderly couple playing a blockchain game but then there's also other ones like zabrina she's a mother of two and she lost her job she was working in a bar as her savings were dwindling she was wondering what to do and she decided to use her last money in all the world to invest in three nfts um at the time i believe there was sort of around five dollars to to get started with the team and when that's your last money in the world that's a massive risk but she earned the money back within a month and then started actually making profits off that and was able to spend it on things like digital devices and an internet connection so that her kids could do homeschooling so i think the interesting thing about this movement is that people are playing these games not for the same reasons that they would go and pick up a traditional video game in a store and perhaps they weren't even part of that market at all before so it's definitely attracting a totally new persona and so at the same time as you mentioned actually infinity has become quite popular and so the cost of getting started in the game has increased so since it is still popular amongst this rural population how have filipinos that are getting started in the game managed to you know buy in yeah so this i i kind of feel like because we're here and in the thick of it we hear of it all the time and i think it's normal but i think the rest of the world hasn't really heard about this innovation yet but there's a particular thing in axi infinity that allows you to loan your axey team to another person for for a designated period of time um and the reason is because your crypto wallet is actually separate to the gaming account whereas most nft games are inextricably linked to the crypto wallet so you're not going to give out your seed phrase to someone but you would you know provide the axi infinity qr code to allow someone to log in and use your team for a short period of time so what happened over here was that there were some sort of community ogs that just loved the game you know and they were breeding in the same way that people would breed crypto kitties they were breeding axes and some people ended up with like hundreds if not thousands of them just because they loved it and that's a lot more nfts than they could realistically play in the game so when they saw other people who were like well i want to try but i don't really want to spend any money up front they would say well why don't you just learn one of my teams see how you like it and you know if you enjoy it then we'll go from there that was actually a really popular thing uh that people started doing and i guess a lot of the people who were doing it such as um i'm sure you've heard of gabby dies on from yield guild games he was kind of doing it with his own personal collection and what he found was that after loaning his nfts to other people they would very quickly earn enough from the reward tokens within the game to be able to buy their own teams so it was almost kind of like graduating from borrowing someone else's to becoming an owner of your own nfts where you were either unable or unwilling in the first place and that has become more formalized as we've gone along i guess particularly with the demand within the market as people have found out about this game everyone wants in um and there's just not enough in-game assets to go around so the idea of a scholarship emerged where people would loan or rent their in-game assets and they split the the earnings so it's essentially i guess like an uncollateralized loan of an nft asset that people can generate yield from and you know they go from there and what we've seen is a lot of people can actually improve their economic status from being able to access that opportunity but if the community hadn't kind of come up with this new solution that is scholarships they never would have been able to get into the game in the first place due to the high cost of the nfts and what is this split typically the high cost of getting in so i mean the split between the you know axe university or whoever is lending the nfts out versus who's borrowing them that is it's a tricky question there are different splits so there's um everything from like quite formalized uh player guilds like yield guild games so their split is they provide 70 to the player so they get the biggest cut 20 goes to the community manager and the community managers are people who they recruit players and then they uh kind of invest in educating them and getting them up to speed so they can actually play the game because there's a lot to learn and then 10 goes back to yield guild and that's to cover things like the cost of managing the assets transaction fees stuff like that and full disclosure i worked directly with ygg and they funded the the mini documentary but there are other scholarships as well and everyone kind of has a different approach to it and i guess this is what's interesting it it's a market that is still developing and the business model is still kind of being sounded out there's some criticisms of some models that they don't give enough back to the player um and you know honestly in my opinion that's a bit of a problem too because there's just such high demand for scholarships right now a lot of people are willing to take you know a not so great deal in terms of the earnings they can make from their scholarship just because they're desperate to get into the game so it'll be good to see that mature a little bit and see the community kind of weed out um some of the less than ideal scholarships i think yeah well an interesting development this week was that yield guild games is original dex offering initial dex offering on sushi swaps miso platform sold out in less than a minute and it was bought up by 32 wallets so um i think perhaps some of those actually were uh wallets that represented a number of players although i'm not entirely sure about that um but what's your sense of what happened there and how that kind of situation if it really is just whales who bought those tokens how that might affect the game i think the best person to talk about that would be the founders of yield guild i work directly with them but i just manage comms so i'm not the perfect person but um you know in my independent opinion i think it's important to kind of put it into perspective yield guild really wanted to work with miso which is um the sale platform by sushi swap and they didn't have a cap on how much purchasers could could take in the public auction so um the it did sell out in 31 seconds to 32 wallets but it was only 2.5 of their total token supply so it's quite a small amount and i totally understand people's perspective on it but in the coming weeks i'd say watch it because they've got actually 45 of their token allocation earmarked for community rewards so that's their goal to actually give back to the community they'll be air-dropping existing members of the guild to reward them for their participation already and then also people who are joining now they'll be providing sort of reward systems that they'll be able to earn tokens rather than buy them so look i guess it's a bit of a different model than most people would go by and i think the criticism at the moment is that they're not community focused but i do think they have a north star that they're headed toward and this is definitely on track but definitely watch out for the community airdrop and rewards programs i think that's going to be much more interesting and is almost half of their token supply all right well this has been such a fascinating conversation i'm so glad that we were able to learn more about the real world impact of crypto on a pretty unlikely demographic um i think that's something that's often talked about you know helping people in developing countries or helping the underprivileged and um yet it rarely happens so um it was very fascinating learning about this case thank you so much thanks for taking an interest in what's
