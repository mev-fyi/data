having me on consensus made a big acquisition this week and also got some investment congratulations tell us your big news uh so consensus uh has been working with jp morgan for quite a long time more recently um to discuss how we might uh work together uh more intimately and uh sort of change the nature of the quorum project uh quorum is uh essentially a blockchain infrastructure platform that jp morgan uh created based on the ethereum go client and they use it um for their application needs so they build a bunch of applications blockchain applications on quorum a while ago they decided that it maybe didn't make sense for them to be a blockchain protocol company consensus has now acquired that project and we are essentially the stewards of that open source project merging it in terms of technical roadmap with our own enterprise ethereum activities which are based on hyper ledger basu so we are providing support for quorum we are building out the quorum roadmap and quorum now constitutes consensus's enterprise ethereum offering whether uh the client chooses hyperledger basu as the foundational element or or geth as the foundational element we're excited to offer a for the first time really a fully comprehensive uh enterprise blocks blockchain solution including developer tools security audit tools uh customer success and support sophisticated cloud configurations which are coming um and a bunch of applications that uh that sit on the quorum platform in addition jpmorgan has made a significant strategic investment and uh and jp morgan is a sizable client of consensus and for listeners who aren't aware hyperledger basu is uh an enterprise ethereum client that consensus built so if geth is kind of like a software version for the public chain then um hyper electro b su is is um similar but for enterprise software let me just add a little bit of detail without getting too much into the weeds so both of these enterprise ethereum solutions have two layers um layer one is hyperledger basu which is a java ethereum client which uh connects to mainnet uh ethereum so it's a full-fledged ethereum client and it also has enterprise ethereum augmentations um and on the formerly jpmorgan side geth is a slight modification of the go ethereum client so it doesn't it's not currently able to connect to mainnet and that's been important to us to enable hybrid solutions to be created so private permissioned uh systems and with roughly the same client also connecting into mainnet um the layer two solution for both of those platforms which are now all called quorum is called orion um that sits on top of hyperledger basu provides uh confidentiality of transactions to a subset of actors and to sarah that jp morgan built does the exact same thing on jpmorgan's side so the ultimate configuration of the quorum client uh we'll see tesera which is a java based apache 2 licensed uh confidentiality solution uh it'll sit on top of hyperledger basically which is also java based and apache 2. so maximum permissivity in terms of licensing so no no real constraints there were a small number of institutions that weren't that comfortable with the the gpl licensing of the the geth client yeah and so getting into this licensing is getting a bit into the weeds but as far as i understand apache 2 enables private companies to make contributions to these open source do whatever you want with it and yeah and keep them for themselves without having to contribute them back which is yeah sort of like being able to keep their secret sauce and um as you mentioned jp morgan will be a customer of consensuses going forward so what will and or what are they using quorum for so the publicly announced applications are their interbank information network which has north of 400 financial institutions around the world and it is it's essentially a messaging layer similar to what swift does jpmorgan i believe has around 4 000 uh financial institutions in their correspondent banking network so one could imagine that all of those organizations and perhaps more will eventually end up on iim so consensus is supporting uh that network um and consensus is also supporting jpm coin which is a a stable coin solution so that's a separate network that jp morgan has built on form jpmorgan is if you do a little research they're hiring very aggressively in blockchain they've made it very clear very public that they're doubling down on blockchain and enterprise ethereum so uh it is uh very exciting for us to be a significant part of that and it's exciting to see jp morgan uh build uh probably a whole bunch more applications on the corn platform and for the acquisition of quorum are you only acquiring the quorum open source code base or will the quorum team from jp morgan also be joining consensus so the quorum team is heavily engaged with us for at least a year to facilitate uh transition and to we're working together on on a shared roadmap that we've defined and we'll continue to define together um i can't say much more of a detailed nature about that right now but we are working intimately with those people okay so i guess we'll have to have you back or talk to somebody to find out how that will all work and so just to circle back about the basu so it uh customers will be able to choose between hyperledger hyper and ledger basu and consensus quorum is that yeah that's correct and part of part of the work that we're doing together over the next year with high intensity is to affect plug and play interoperability uh between the two versions of quorum so we've been working on that for a long time in the context of the enterpriseotherm alliance defining standards that would enable those two clients and other clients from block apps and various other organizations to essentially either sit on the same network simultaneously um or potentially enable a customer to switch from one to another if they felt that necessary and so we're just uh we remain pretty passionate about uh interoperability about building standards-based clients it's really the only uh blockchain technology in the world that it's focused heavily on standards-based uh approaches and uh we haven't uh pulled back at all from that in fact we're doubling down on that as well and so just so i'm clear and and the listeners are clear essentially the enterprise ethereum alliance is setting standards and then um it's not clear to me actually how hyperelectric basu and consensus quorum will be differentiated or like why one would choose one versus the other is it just similar to how um for instance on the public chain there's parity and geth and people sort of choose based on features is is that it it's a little bit different than that there is a pretty sizable cohort uh hundreds of organizations that use uh the geth version of quorum and a sizable cohort that used the hyperledger basu based version of quorum and we need to support both in parallel going forward during that period we are going to work to make them plug and play uh interoperable or compatible so that we can essentially substitute one for the other at some point potentially 12 months from now potentially longer we do hope to move the layer two jpmorgan piece called tessera and put that on top of hyperledger basu so that that configuration will be the long-term configuration going forward all right so in a moment we're going to discuss more about the news including aspects of the investment but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this

the block reported that jpmorgan chase is making a 20 million investment of convertible debt into consensus is that figure accurate i cannot confirm nor deny that that figure is accurate at this point but i i might have something more to say at some point in the future okay okay and it's been reported for a while that jp mor sorry that consensus is raising money um and 200 million dollars was the figure reported by the fed by the information last year is that still the target i i've seen lots of different numbers reported um if we are in fact continuing to raise i cannot confirm nor deny that any of those numbers that i've read publicly are accurate okay all right well i guess we'll have to circle back for yet another reason yeah happy to come on the on the show again in uh some period of time and discuss that okay okay yeah i mean there's there's plenty to discuss but we're gonna actually dive into some of these other things right now because obviously consensus has been going through a larger restructuring for quite a while for a couple years so how does this acquisition i think since we were born really for for five years you know we were a very different company in the first year than the second year so yes okay okay the latest incarnations of of consensus are very exciting well so given the uh i would say you know the downsizing that's been happening since december 2018 you know you've been through a series of layoffs you're now restructuring to kind of focus more on software development on one side of the business and venture activities on the other side so how does this acquisition fit into into those goals um so a short while ago uh we spun uh so the main organization all along has been consensus ag um it uh house investment activities portfolio management activities software development activities professional services activities we just recently spun out a company called consensus software consensus software houses our blockchain stack so it's a coherent integrated software product company that's what it focuses on it does a bunch of professional services largely centered around our products it consists of products like those created by our pegasus group our protocol engineering and systems group which now is the steward for quorum um it consists of infira uh our infrastructure group which handles some days uh up to 10 billion queries uh from the ecosystem from from the ipfs and filecoin ecosystem it consists of codifier cumberson decentralized finance group which has a number of products on the defy side into enterprise business process elements consists of metamask which is sitting around 500 000 monthly actives and about 1.2 million slightly less active installs and it has a we have a set of developer tools so the truffle suite of developer tools and diligence which is security audit tools and a group of brilliant people that manually secure the audit we have the ability to do quite a bit of customization work in our professional services group and actually maybe one of the most important groups that i almost didn't highlight is our customer success and support group so uh you don't often think of that as a as a star in a group like that but it's led by individual who did the same at hp enterprise it's been running for two and a half years approaching three years and it has been already supporting uh quorum on many different networks so smaller networks run by individual organizations or larger networks like the comgo commodity trade finance consortium or the covantas uh commodities trading consortium and this is all happening at a very interesting time not only in the industry but also in the world and obviously we've seen that the coronavirus pandemic has affected all kinds of businesses and it was reported that consensus received between one million and five million dollars in the payroll protection program due to kovid how has the pandemic affected your business so we saw a set of complicated discussions uh with both customers as well as some organizations that were speaking to about investment we've seen we had projections that would have seen us double our revenue this year and we have had to scale that back a little bit we're still going to uh almost certainly achieve revenue that is a good chunk larger in percentage than last year but we we've certainly seen slowing down and dropping of some projects and we've seen a lot of new interest actually some of the new interest may be related a little bit to covid so there have been some identity projects that popped up and some specifically around health passports and things like that but this news has been under the radar for a little while and uh consensus bringing this comprehensive enterprise ethereum solution with full support which is something that jp morgan as a bank wasn't really configured to do um it's already been uh circulating and so we've actually seen quite a lot of new interest around the quorum acquisition and one other piece of news that a consensus project um it kind of created a little bit of a a small outcry i would say at least on crypto twitter was that metamask was changing its licensing and from uh you know what i could see it seemed that maybe this is part of uh consensus's you know restructuring to to focus more on software development or no no do you wanna it really has nothing to do with restructuring of consensus and we've been we've been an integrated software company um increasingly integrated and really firing on all cylinders for approaching a year now um and and we just moved into a separate legal entity with with that group um metamask has been working towards uh commercialization or monetization uh it is a heavily open source project it is by far the most open project of all the wallets out there in fact all the other wallets are proprietary not even in the same category we have a handful of monetization strategies some of which are going to land extremely soon uh a number of days from now uh one very exciting one um and uh you want to tease what that is right now there's a teaser not i've been told that i'm not allowed to um but that's the extent of the tease that i can do okay all right there are upstream projects browsers um that make use of the metamask code base and strip out uh the name and modify it in other ways and strip out reference codes and essentially uh remove the ability for metamask to monetize in the context of that project and so the metamask license hasn't changed for anybody except users uh with more than ten thousand monthly actives uh who are effectively trying to commercialize uh with um the code base that we built so uh the the act of modifying that license just slightly uh has had positive impact already and and the the community had some really great ideas the community uh uh stanley of ave uh put together a great sketch of a token model and we've been thinking quite a lot about token models within metamouse for a long time and i think we're zeroing in on something that that's uh pretty exciting so it's not not going to hit any time really soon but it's almost inevitable um and uh so we we do hope to um go in that direction and enable the community to get much more involved in the governance and potential monetization of asked it sounds very interesting we'll keep my eye out for for what happens there and um one other big thing that happened obviously recently was the five-year anniversary of ethereum when you look back what are your thoughts about the journey so far and where ethereum is headed with ethereum 2.0 i guess nothing but excitement i think many of us thought that the technology was so powerful and the particular representation the particular configuration that uh that vitalik put forth initially was just so spot on that it was likely to be the programmable expressive blockchain that became very significant if not dominant so not surprised by how well it's doing it is astonishing how it's not mainstream yet but so many people have heard about bitcoin so many people have heard about ethereum and uh it's turning into a sizeable and very rapidly growing industry that i think is going to eat the world in a in a very positive way or enable the world to reconfigure itself in healthier ways and with respect to ethereum two we're really on track um and test that's showing great results we i was hoping that we'd run into some serious and ugly problems on test net and we did um i would have been very uncomfortable if we didn't discover um a handful of bugs and if we didn't have uh situations where we needed to respond in real time have the team solve problems have the teams coordinate the solution to the problem and have the network heal itself with the pushing of new code and that's exactly what happened it was a it was a pretty nasty issue uh but the the network did uh end up after a few days uh figuring out how to uh heal itself and start finalizing again so super excited about that i think we're on track uh to launch before the end of this year uh and i think uh uh data availability shards and execution environments are likely to follow relatively quickly i think faster than more skeptical people might might believe just because a lot of the complexity has been is resident in phase zero and we can put together a more simplified version of uh data availability shards uh they're going to be especially helpful initially for ethereum one for layer two roll-ups on ethereum one they will be able to use that guaranteed data availability and i do believe that we'll see some not too complicated one or more execution environments appear very quickly possibly alongside phase one very bullish ethereum one is doing great uh as it stands we're we have a number of different layer 2 scalability solutions live and coming coming online so scalability is getting addressed right now and scalability is going to get a massive shot in the arm um say 12 months from now yeah well hopefully for ethereum it will be just in the nick of time because there's um clearly a lot of demand and the fees are high and people are getting a bit antsy sure but you know throughout the history of information technology technologists have built out new hardware and software solutions and other technologists have maxed them out virtually instantly so unless we have massive utilization and you know real uncomfortable straining of the system we don't know exactly where needs the attention uh to build out with respect to scalability so it's gonna be uh as it has been with so many technologies from memory to cpus to screen size to internet connections uh it's gonna be a uh constant cycling of crater capability that gets eaten up immediately by the application developers and so um very excited to see that uh that we're bumping up against the ceiling yet again the ceiling will continue to be raised and we'll continue to try to bump up against it and raise it higher great well i look forward to seeing ethereum and consensus too on that journey thank you so much for coming on unconfirmed thanks don't forget next up is the weekly news recap [Music] hi everyone thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap first headline fidelity bets on bitcoin with new fund forbes reports that fidelity president and head of consulting peter jubber filed paperwork wednesday for a new bitcoin dedicated fund with a minimum investment of one hundred thousand dollars likely aimed at institutional and accredited investors called the wise origin bitcoin index fund it does not yet have investors it is unclear what the relationship is between fidelity digital asset and an organization called wise origin funds quality brokerage services llc is to be the fund's custodian fidelity's intellectual property vice president has filed a trademark application for the name wise origin funds frank chaparro of the block wrote that a bitcoin fund by fidelity could be the next best thing to a bitcoin etf because although the fund will not be available to retail investors it could potentially become available to investor advisors to sell to their own clients next headline shifting approach to inflation by fed could bolster bitcoin a new policy unveiled thursday by federal reserve chairman jerome powell would lead inflation rates and thus the cost of borrowing to stay low for longer the change would allow inflation to run higher than usual for certain periods to target an average inflation rate of 2 percent over time bitcoiners such as the winklevoss twins pointed to the change to bolster their contention that the us dollar is an increasingly unreliable store of value and coming inflation will devalue the dollar further allowing bitcoin with its capped supply to potentially overtake gold bixby in value after powell outlined the fed's new tolerance for higher inflation but so far there has been an otherwise muted reaction to powell's comments analysts previously speculated that powell's speech could help boost bitcoin and lead to further drops in the power of the dollar the long-term effect of the new policy remains to be seen next headline sec expands the definition credit investor the s the securities and exchange commission revised the definition of accredited investor which determines who is able to participate in private investments such as token sales now not only are income or net worth acceptable qualifications but so are certain designations or credentials based on professional knowledge or certifications for instance holders of series 7 65 and 82 licenses which have to do with private security sales and investment advising are now included however because this would not significantly increase the pool of accredited investors response to the news was mixed athena blockchain general counsel drew him tweeted that this is not meaningful at least not yet cardozo school of law professor and open law co-founder aaron wright tweeted however that the news was quote a big step in the right direction setting up a framework for technical accreditation in the future sec commissioner hester purse issued a statement calling for even greater expansion to the definition she said quote why shouldn't mom and pop retail investors be allowed to invest in private offerings why should i as a regulator decide what other americans do with their money next headline ftx acquires blockfolio for 150 million dollars crypto derivatives exchange ftx has acquired popular crypto data app block folio in a 150 million dollar attempt to expand its retail footprint the deal came out of initial discussions between the companies about how they might collaborate and is one of the largest acquisitions in crypto this year blockfolio which has six million users and receives 150 million impressions a month will receive a mix of equity ftx's native token and cash it remains unclear how blockfolio will fit into the ftx ecosystem although the firms are working on a retail trading feature and the deal is seen as akin to binance acquisition of coin market cap and that coin market cap and block folio could bring in a lot of traffic that then funnels down to their respective exchange partners next headline dcg to invest 100 million dollars in bitcoin mining digital currency group revealed a new mining subsidiary called foundry it will invest 100 million dollars in mining bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in north america foundry has been operating its own mining operations since 2019 plus offering crypto startups mining equipment and financing and it also plans to move into staking dcg founder and ceo barry silbert hopes to increase the us's share of global bitcoin production especially compared to that of china as there are currently few significant mining operations in north america however a number of failed efforts here previously could indicate it that it may be a hard road ahead the firm expects dcg's network deep experience in crypto and support from federal and local officials who may also not want to see production's production of bitcoin to china to help it succeed next headline how will copycat projects fare in d5 the yield farming craze has raised a question if it's easy to fork code and launch a project that promises advantages over the original and if it's so easy for users to move from project to project chasing the highest yield then what will survive the block's stephen chang notes that august saw a number of copycat projects that piggybacked off other projects code to launch their own tokens along with catchy memes and enticing yield farming schemes y-irn and yam are great examples of this and in the area of dexes or automated market makers moon swap and sushi swap are near clones of current heavyweight uniswap munu swap claims to improve on uniswap by preventing arbitrage from taking all the slippage and instead keeping most of it in the pool to redistribute to liquidity providers meanwhile sushi swap has a governance token sushi part of which will be set aside to fund development which at uniswap is currently funded by vcs and steven's conclusion is quote at the end of the day like the mania of 2017 these often uninspired forks of other forks will attract liquidity into the ecosystem and as a result of a sector flushed with cash we may see some truly useful projects flourish next headline fun bids arthur hayes weighs in on yield farming arthur hayes of bitmax or what is now called 100x group is always entertaining to read and his latest missive on his adventures in d5 as well as his breakdown of what drives demand in supply and crypto credit is no exception he begins quote i lack access to nightclubs and most other forms of revelry therefore i decided to become a crypto peasant after describing the main players in the crypto ecosystem miners speculators borrowers lenders exchanges etc he talks about how defy has decentralized all of it and then says that he is enjoying yield farming meme tokens however like any smart investor in crypto he fully expects to lose all his money quote in my head i like to believe i can read market sentiment and get out at the top of the bull market but in reality like most other traders i will buy high hold hold hold and sell well after the top alright well thanks for tuning
