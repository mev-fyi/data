not a dividend It's A Tale of Two fun now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet generally speaking airdrops are kind of pointless anyways um my name's trading firms who are very involved I like to have the ultimate D5 Protocols are the antidote to this problem hello everybody Welcome to The Chopping Block every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry insiders perspective on the crypto topics of the day so we're doing a special episode today because there's some crazy stuff happening in the industry so this is kind of a flash episode it might not be as long as usual I'll do really quick intros first you got Tom the D5 Maven and master memes next we've got Robert crypto connoisseur and czar super State uh tarun should be joining uh tarun is the brain and grandfather Gauntlet but he's a little a little late on the draw he had a busy day today so we're going to be a little gentler within than usual then today a special guest we have joining us Stephen Pally the luminary of Ledger law at Brown redneck uh and then you've got myself a massive the head hikeman at dragonfly I just want to say we're early stage investors in crypto but I want to caveat nothing we say here is investment advice legal advice or even life advice please see choppingblock that XYZ for more disclosures okay so Stephen we have you here today to decipher what happened today and what it all means let me first run through what happened in the Ripple case Okay so the Ripple case for those of you who are just tuning in it's been brewing for quite a while so Ripple was sued in in what was it 2020 2019 2020 24 Christmas okay so they were sued in 2020 by the SEC and this was considered to be one of the most important cases in crypto as you know a very well-funded very very strong adversary with a with a you know a strong token you know it's basically a top five token during many times in history uh that the SEC was taking on directly under the idea that the xrp it was an unregistered security so uh there was a filings for summary judgment summary judgment Stephen please correct me if I'm wrong summary judgment basically means that like hey we don't disagree on the facts let's assume that the facts are all basically correct and we don't need to like argue about it uh just given these facts as being true that we've laid out uh can we just like skip figuring out where the facts are correct and say look you're going to win uh assuming that these facts are true is that basically what a summary judgment is yeah basically one side says we believe these facts are true and are disputed their material to the case um given that you should decide this the case as a matter of law what that does too is if you get complete summary judgment in a case you don't have a trial I hear we can talk about this in a few minutes uh there's still some this is a partial summary judgment uh and the the court has indicated that portions of it will will still be tried right so there were there were several important prongs of the case that the SEC was bringing against xrp um that are quite distinct so just to just to kind of reiterate the high level story xrp they they did some sales to institutional investors so you know hedge funds uh market makers other types of folks who are buying xrp with lockups directly from the xrp foundation or whatnot then there were retail programmatic sales so xrp was automatically selling xrp on exchanges uh then they were paying their employees and xrp and the founders themselves were selling xrp that they had received presumably as compensation for setting the whole thing up so each of these was kind of individually treated as cases of Securities violations according to the SEC and what this what the judge ruled in the summary judgment was that the institutional sales were sales of Securities okay so these were deals directly with a third party money is going to the xrp foundation or whatever the Ripple of the company and uh these are you know deals with lockups and and so on so these look more like traditional security-like transactions uh and they're kind of structured as such and they're sophisticated investors who know the money is going directly to the issuer and so on uh then the retail sales which is the thing that most people in the industry really care about the retail sales were happening on exchanges the judge deemed that these were not Securities transactions so because the uh retail customers were buying the xrp they were not sending the money to Ripple they had no direct engagement with ripple they did not know who's on the other side of the trades if they were in the one percent of Trades of xrp for which uh Ripple was the counterparty they would not have known that either way so there was no reason for them to believe that they were pooling Capital to make an investment in a common Enterprise blah blah blah they were just buying xrp for you know presumably speculative reasons but that is not sufficient to establish an investment contract according to this judge also paying employees in extra P was not because there was no investment of capital and the founder sales were not because I I forget why the founder sales were not the same reason yeah because they're also basically the same arguments programmatic the people on the other side of the trade were not making Investments okay so on the back of this on the back of this so this thing is still going to trial and Stephen I'd like I'd like to understand from you what happens from here but just so people understand the consequences of this xrp is up 75 today massive massive rallying xrp just now once again a top four asset ship a bunch of all coins are massively up Matic is up 17 uh Salon is up like almost 20 coinbase is up 24 coinbase just announced it's going to release xrp uh Kraken is exploring doing the same Gemini's exploring doing the same it is basically a party today in crypto land so Stephen coming back to this case what happens from here some of these uh some of the summary judgment was uh went in the favor of Ripple some of it went in favor of the SEC there's still certain counts that you know need to be tried explain what happens from here so there are a couple of paths that this case can take from here the court said that I think it was 780 million dollars worth of institutional sales were Securities transactions they were investment contracts that met the or satisfied the Howie rubric the court as you pointed out said that programmatic sales were blind bid ask sales on digital asset platforms were not and the uh the distribution of uh tokens to employees also not but what's left then is uh there's an aiding and a betting claim as to Mr uh garlinghouse and Mr Larson it appears that that is something that would still remain to be tried the court denied summary judgment on that there's also the question of what a remedy would be for the SEC with respect to the institutional sales and I think I mean it's it's important to pause take a deep breath and look at the opinion and look at the consequences certainly a 780 million our discouragement penalty discouragement remedy plus penalty and interest would not be a good thing but the interesting piece of this is so what happens next there's a procedure in federal court in the United States where even when a case is incomplete you can take something called an interlocutory appeal so you don't have a the case itself isn't a full and final judgment you have partial judgments in order to do that you have to make a request within a particular period of time the parties would have to go to the judge convince the judge that reasons uh set forth in a statute were satisfied and then take it up to the second circuit I'm guessing I don't have any insight information here I would be surprised if this wasn't taken up to the second circuit but that's sort of where things stand right now unless somebody moves for this to be uh certified for an interlocutory appeal we'll have a trial from from here it feels like so two things that a lot of people found surprising about this judgment so one is that we've been talking for a long time about the concept of assets being Securities right is xrp a security is Bitcoin is ether security and what this judge seems to be affirming is this idea that no no no there's there's no asset that is a security um it is the nature of the contract or the nature of the sale that constitutes a investment contract or not but xrp in and of itself is not necessarily a security this really goes against all the rhetoric we've been hearing from the SEC and kind of a lot of rhetoric given people outside the SEC is this is this surprising to you to see this from a judge so what the judge did was the judge looked at cases that had um dealt with other kinds of assets orange groves in Howie whiskey et cetera et cetera and the judge said look what I'm going to look at what the case law says what the statute says I look to see whether there's a contract transaction or scheme now the the contract transaction and scheme can have as an object a thing that is not a security what you're looking at is the totality of the circumstances and what the court said was well here with the institutional sales there's clearly a contract transaction scheme there's an investment contract with the programmatic because according to the court and this is where it gets really interesting the court says because these were blind bid ask the purchasers couldn't know that Ripple was on the other side therefore there couldn't be how we like Reliance so the transaction didn't fall within the rubric of an investment contract it seems to me like the court didn't necessarily say that xrp was or wasn't the court said I don't have to look at that that's not the correct inquiry what's also really interesting is anyone who's looked at this opinion in detail you'll see footnote 16 and I'm in a bunch of lawyer crypto telegrams and everybody's talking about I know it sounds very exciting I know but footnote 16 is insulating well footnote 16 the judge says look I'm not saying that secondary Trend I'm not talking about trades on secondary trading platforms I'm not ruling on that but if you look at her ruling she says that because if you trade if if Ripple traded on a digital asset platform and the other side didn't know it was Ripple you couldn't have an investment contract it seems to necessarily follow that that would apply to all transactions using blind bid ask right because you don't the counterparty is um that's uh that was a surprising um conclusion to me and I think that's something that is likely to be appealed would it not be the case though I mean again so I I'm really asking you genuinely as a I don't understand this question um wouldn't it be the case that if we are asking the question like if xrp is a security then by definition any transaction involving it is a security transaction is this not basically confirming that xrp is not a security in and of itself such that if it were a stock that were decidedly a security in all circumstances any transaction involving a stock is a Securities transaction is that not a correct understanding that does seem to be the logical conclusion from this judge's opinion yes that that was her conclusion I mean it is to be clear I've been accused on Telegram getting in the way of people's celebration look I mean this is a great win for ripple it's a good day for ripple notwithstanding the loss of that first bucket it's probably even a better win for um holders of xrp given the fact that it's going to be relisted but it's important to remember that this case is not over and um it's definitely going to be appealed what does the appeal process look like let's say SEC is like hey I don't like this we're going to appeal how long does that take what is that process like sure so like I said there are two ways this can go on the appeal process one the SEC and Ripple by the way could ask the judge for permission to uh take an interlocutory appeal and appeal in the middle of the case to the second circuit I believe the second circuit would have to agree to take it if that happened you'd be looking at I don't know maybe a year in front of the second circuit you'd then be looking probably at what's called on Bonk review appeals um in federal court typically have three judge panels you can then ask for re-hearing in front of the entire uh circuit at that point it seems certainly possible that uh they what the losing side would uh would try to appeal to the Supreme Court and take a rid of certiorari it could be a couple of years or the judge could say no or the parties could not ask for an interlocutory PL they would then go to trial and at the conclusion of the trial uh the parties would take an appeal and again you're looking in a couple of years it's also possible and I it seems unlikely to me but who knows you know maybe a settlement can be brokered but you got to ask yourself if you have gotten a judgment that somebody engaged in 800 million dollars of unregistered Securities transactions what are you going to be willing to sell for and on the flip side what is Ripple going to be willing to settle for I don't see it again speculating it doesn't seem like it's going to settle so either you get an appeal now or you get a trial and you get an appeal later a couple of years in the meantime you know now that there has been a ruling on many of the different aspects of the case in the appeals process what's the state of the world for ripple what's the seed of the world for the SEC what's the state of the world for other token issuers like how does this affect people you know over time sure so not legal advice um not even meme advice but you're still safe space yeah it's a safe space right like on the internet so it's hard because there are parts of the ruling that are very appealing and I think it's actually there's a certain Equity of the notion that look we're going to hold you accountable but sort of innocent purchasers for Value we're not going to penalize them there's a certain whether or not it's the law it seems Equitable and fair the challenge is if you're a lawyer counseling somebody in the space and they come to you and they say we've got this opinion uh what do I do with it the response has to be equally measured responses look it's a single district court in a case that hasn't been concluded it's not presidential it's persuasive Authority at best it's not binding on any of the other judges in that federal district it's not binding on uh judges and other circuit courts of appeal and it's going to be appealed so I think um you've obviously seen I mean you know coinbase and Kraken are advised by very good lawyers they reach the conclusion it was a safe thing to list now um I suspect that we will see more of that by exchanges although my office is inside the Beltway I'm not a uh you know I'm not an inside the Beltway policy guy what I've read just like you all have read is that this will have an impact on digital asset legislation I think that that's it seems like it should be a logical conclusion because what we have now is a little bit we've got confusion and that's not good um so it certainly takes a little bit of the wind out of the SEC sales um so you know I think there's going to be a lot of it depends and I think lawyers advising clients are going to hedge a lot uh right now you know I I guess you have to ask yourself is the SEC going to go after these exchanges for um re-listing xrp and it sounds like if so the exchangers are willing to fight well I guess to that point what about I guess the the coinbase uh case like what kind of implications do you think this because like I feel like the coinbase case seems of all the cases the most impacted by this but maybe that's the wrong read but I'm curious like where you fall on that oh absolutely no doubt um coinbase has really excellent lawyers handling this I'm confident uh that they will be uh raising this opinion in their in their case with the SEC absolutely yeah it seems like this has pretty direct I mean obviously coinbase up 25 today so the market seems to agree that this is consequential for coindes a large part of it of course is that coinbase um the the part about you know the blind uh uh trading you know you don't know who your counterparty is basically making it so one of the things that I want to understand better is and you mentioned about okay this is not precedent this is not binding unless you're you know it was directly within this judge's circuit or something I don't totally understand the details um can you can you explain uh what you mean by binding versus persuasive like can you just can you walk through that for our audience sure so binding precedent is um be an opinion by the Supreme Court that would be binding on every federal court in the United States if the second circuit issued an opinion on something directly that would be binding on every trial court every district court in the second circuit uh if a district court judge is issues an opinion it's not binding on any other judge uh it's a court of first instance a trial court but it may be persuasive it's something lawyers call persuasive Authority as opposed to binding Authority it's an opinion that you would cite you'd see C judge another judge one of your peers in the southern district of New York looked at this issue and has said uh you know a token like oranges uh you have to consider it not a security but an object of a transaction and also would I would if I were them I would also be pointing out that uh blind bid ask uh digital asset transactions and digital asset platforms according to this judge there's no um there's there can't be Reliance on the efforts of third parties under the Howie test so those things are not Securities transactions I think that's all relevant uh with I don't have the list of assets that are at issue in the in the coinbase case but that's certainly uh relevant uh and a great argument to make in that case look secondary sales notwithstanding what the judge said in that footnote which doesn't really make much sense they those are not those are not the types of transactions that should be uh covered by security as well so I think they'll definitely make that argument I would what do you think of uh the implications of this for overall sort of fundraising and Market structure um for the industry like in some ways this feels very opposite to how people have sort of perceived things thus far of yeah if you're an accredited investor you can buy a staff or you know you just buy a token out right but obviously you can't like do an Ico or just like sell a bunch of tokens this in some ways feels uh kind of opposite where you would not actually want to knowingly investing into a common Enterprise um but if somebody airdrops a token and then they sell some later like it seems like it'll be kosher under under uh this opinion in less sorts of registration statement or an exemption from it so if you are selling it to institutional investors who are all accredited investors or whatever and you file at exemption you know it would still be allowed yes I I yeah I mean look um I drive a 2007 Kia Sedona so I'm probably not the best person to ask about how to moon Lambo it's and my advice is going to be it's conservative right it's one opinion from one judge hopefully somebody got that reference okay I really hope someone watching this or listening to this in the future decide to come gift you a ride in Lamborghini so you can take a picture and be like I did look I mean the the first thing I would take away is the judge is saying icos are I think you can't read this and conclude that icos are a good thing for the issuer right now query whether an Institutional purchaser who's gotten these things can't just go and sell them on a secondary market now you still have secondary underwriter concerns too right so icos I think are still problematic maybe from a defy airdrop uh if you want to be edgy maybe there's a little bit more Daylight honestly there are parts of the opinion that are um questionable enough that I think um like people are people can hate me for saying this I'm sorry it's not enough uh to execute a trading or investment strategy if it were me but again I'm just a simple country lawyer who drives a you know shitty that's a crappy car yeah yeah yeah but in the peak bull market there was a Kia Sedona nft that was very popular so I was about to what I don't know I don't know I don't know about that who's gonna make comebacks I may be referring to that so yeah I mean I I think that's the answer it's um it's one opinion and you know you know credit to Ripple and its lawyers uh for what they got uh but it's hard to take overall market and investment strategy guidance from it in my view not investment advice seriously like you should counter trade me because my trading is not good uh but from a sort of a legal standpoint it still seems like it's not enough to build a um an investment I believe it's certainly it's certainly not a done deal and it's clear that as you said SEC is going to want to appeal this like this I mean this would be kind of a death blow for the March that they've been putting on about you know more or less everything associated with an issue or being a security per se you know trying to you know basically shut down coinbase trying to shut down a lot of the US exchanges that engage in all coin trading um this is a dagger directly in the heart of what the SEC is trying to do so I agree with you it doesn't seem like the story is over and you know probably before this case plays out we're going to see legislative attempts to try to get to a you know a different answer so it's really a forcing function more than it is just positive that like hey guess what everything's okay again the the really interesting thing to me is that I I'm curious Stephen how would you contrast the details of the xrp case to the details of the telegram case uh obviously they're different judges and you know there's different moments in time how do you compare the two and why do you think this one came out differently than Telegram that's a great question so in telegram the judge and this is problematic for saps right or for safes with uh side letters or warrants the judge basically said um looked at the entire thing as one scheme and even though the token itself might not have been um the token itself was the object of the scheme and even though it was hadn't been created and was in coed the judge said that entire transaction was a Securities transaction I think the difference there was that it was still at the issue or an underwriter stage right um it was before things had been it was before there was a public market so the judge was effectively looking at the people who were involved in the issuance and saying you all are involved in an investment transaction and scheme here um the judge is saying with that initial sale those initial transactions with institutional investors those were Securities transactions but later stuff that happened in the open market and with blind ask that's not so my I think that's the difference the difference is time right if telegram if the if the tokens if the grams had been issued and were available on markets and time passed under this Court's reason and you would have had a different result in the case of program though these are all you know these are all uh I assume they sold the Sequoia and all these folks who like had lockups and institutional investors um was it just that they didn't file a particular exemption because they were all these things were only owned the grams I assume were only owned by institutional investors uh with lockups I I mean I I suspect the real ultimate concern was the ultimate secondary sales on public markets and the lack of registration for the tokens themselves I if I remember that opinion that's perhaps the difference what about to another recent case uh library or lbry um this the Ripple judgment he flicked with the Judgment in that case you know I don't think so um and I did see that in that in this judge's order she actually references that case and notes that the judge in that case declined to rule that uh transactions and secondary markets were Securities transactions so I I don't think so and again but what this also shows is different judges different slightly different facts different conclusions I also saw I don't know if you guys saw this the SEC issued a press release um you know trumpeting this is a great success and that hasn't received as much play yeah the SEC said you know we're we're heartened to see that uh the judge agreed that the initial that the sales institutional investors were Securities transactions and it rejected coinbase's uh Fair notice uh due process arguments yeah the SEC issued ish ripples issued a um uh sort of self-congratulatory press release very I feel like the SEC needs to fire their press Department because they are whatever they're doing over there is not working um I also saw on the cover of Bloomberg this morning when I first saw this like on the cover of Bloomberg was uh uh Ripple rule you know Ripple rule that sales as they were unregistered Securities and it was like oh [ __ ] it's like a really negative story and then I opened crypto Twitter and everyone's partying and then now the story has changed and now it's like oh no no the story is that Ripple you know secondary transactions are not Securities and it's like a very celebratory article so I think it's it's funny how I mean they got the story the other way around it's look I mean people see what they want to see if you are someone who holds xrp you're obviously going to be delighted because now you can trade in the United States and I think one of the most powerful arguments that was made and you know credit to John Deaton um and um you know other folks in this Camp one of the arguments was this punishes retail investors like your job is to not do that it's to protect me and the judge doesn't say anything about that but you know you wonder if that's a narrative that she picked up on um so you know good good for them yeah it does uh feel like the SEC really has to dig in here um because the other you know funny part about this case is in my opinion Ripple does seem like a particularly egregious example of a token in a sense that like it's not really decentralized like the xrp token doesn't really do anything and so it's like you know if you can argue that uh this token you know in secondary Market transactions is not a security I think like much better actors that you maybe more look look a lot more like Bitcoin or ether you know it's harder to make a case against them yeah it's clearly part of the reason why the Alta ones are are rallying is because you know the basically the facts and circumstances that the SEC trotted out in the coinbase case about Matic and about near and about Solana and all these things um it's pretty hard to not basically say like look these are basically the same facts as Ripple and for ripple clearly these were not sufficient to say ah this this is per se a security it does feel I I agree with you Tom like SEC looks really weak here and Market seems to be pricing that in more or less but there's a lot of game left to be played on these things I retweeted This Thread I don't remember the lawyer who did it there are some good clinical analyzes of uh that um would suggest that the sec's case is stronger than people on Twitter might like to believe what um and I can't say it isn't so you know yeah so like there there are some um the notion that uh there's no Reliance if you don't know who the counterparty is in a trade is probably something that can be uh disputed also the court says that um payment of uh use of crypto uh as a payment to employees didn't satisfy Howie because there was no investment of money there there is a line of authority that I mean you're familiar with concept of Sweat Equity there's a line of authority that says that uh non-financial things including work can constitute the investment of money so I it's not I think it's important I mean I'm I was glad to see the opinion I think our you know the SEC has uh been very aggressive and in this case it hurt retail investors uh but you have to be kind of cold in reading these things and analytical and understand there's a process and trial courts get reversed all the time I remember about five years ago uh the SEC had a it was an enforcement action against some Ico I think was it federal court in California and uh the SEC uh ask for tro Court said no and there was a lot of joy and a much smaller crypto Twitter then um but in the end um the SEC got an injunction you know so you have to um person carefully I think that the the most important sign at least short term is that coinbase and Kraken have relisted it you know that obviously means something yeah well I I appreciate your you your Lucidity Stephen but I'm still going to I'm still going to accept a little bit of Celebration because this is this is a substantial this is a substantial moment for the industry yeah in a year where we've had a lot of punches in the face and a lot of feeling of the industry feeling persecuted the industry feeling like they are really being driven out um from you know the government basically not liking them and not wanting them to exist in America the first the first story yeah I mean the first thing I read on Twitter this morning was about people being unbanked from Bank of America for buying Bitcoin on coinbase so yeah sure this is a little bit of good news it's an example of the rule of law coming out in favor of what everyone working in the industry has known and that you know these assets are themselves you know not illegal I think it's a Vindication for just so many Builders and so many participants I mean it's also just been a kind of bad week for the government overall like the Activision case this like there's been a lot of big L's uh and I'm not totally sure whether that will be like the fact that there were so many that were so public will change the overall strategy from like file a lawsuit ask questions later which is what it does seem like in general the current Administration uh behavior is oh it's it's it's even worse than that it's starting investigation uh turn it into an enforcement action ask for um you know force people to spend hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars in an investigation enforcement free action for years then sue them or then not sue them um so it's not it's it's it's actually um I would say substantially worse than that yeah but the agencies are definitely on the back foot especially you know not just the Activision case and this but also what's been going on from the Supreme Court it's it's pretty clear that there's a there's a broad pushback in the U.S against the administrative State the bureaucratic State um and like that or not they're you know they're probably different elements of that that I might think are good and might think are bad but it's definitely happening One Way Or Another We're going to wrap up soon but one other story that I wanted to touch on that came out the same uh within like the same hour I think strangely enough was uh Celsius so Celsius for those of you who you know might have blotted out from your memory Celsius was a big lending company um they blew up last year alongside three arrows and all these other folks blowing up uh Celsius as we learned pretty soon after the Celsius collapse Celsius was basically running a Ponzi scheme they were representing themselves as being a very safe lender that was not doing any uncollateralized lending turns out they were doing way uncollateralized Landing from the very beginning they were openly lying about their strategies uh which turns out they were doing a lot of like Leverage deal farming on chain that people actually knew about for a long time that Celsius was operating it was kind of an Open Secret on Twitter that these were Celsius addresses and that's how they were generating their yields I I think I think the problem was uh Jason 0x B1 was had very bad opsec and he basically docked Celsius in 2020 and 2021 and is mentioned in the lawsuit so yeah so we we learned that I mean we kind of knew I mean anybody who was sort of paying close enough to the industry knew that what Celsius was doing was obviously ridiculously illegal and basically bordering on fraud turns out you know everybody agrees basically the SEC the the cftc the doj and the FTC interesting enough Federal Trade Commission which usually is like the consumer protection commission not not anything to do with financial markets uh they all Levy charges against machinski the CEO uh and he's he's been arrested I believe uh he was charged with the FTC with a 4.7 billion dollar fine uh which obviously will not get paid because the company is insolvent you know so they're going through bankruptcy but I guess the symbolic you know the FTC has been doing uh some of these like really large fines that probably never gonna get paid um but uh yeah it's it's a it's a day that I think it's interesting because he was one of these Dead Men Walking in the industry where everyone kind of knew like there was no freaking way when they finally run out the the string on this guy that he's he's not going to go to jail for this but he was just kind of around you know on Twitter just like doing stuff for a good year until he was finally picked up uh today the question I have is the viability of these yield products full disclosure matter of public record my firm represents the creditors committee and the block by bankruptcy and I'm working on that as well so I can't I've got to be careful not to say anything that involves that but if you look at the criminal indictment basically what the the feds say is this guy claimed he was running a very safe investment fund that was basically like a bank but he was lying about it the entire time and I guess I would say I mean two questions that I have um one I don't know that that has anything to do with crypto it's just if the allegations are true of course they have to be proven and he's considered innocent until proven guilty it's just straight up fraud he promised he was going to do something with money Didn't Do It um and then you know the second question is and this is more for you folks and for people in the industry I'm not sure that these yield things were there are some legal problems uh legal impediments but also you know 7 8 10 12 16 18 22 percent how is that ever going to work is anybody ever going to be able to sell that again well I mean we talked about this on the show a lot last year when the lenders were all imploding and um I think we were pretty quick to call out that Celsius was obviously full of [ __ ] and that this thing was not going to stand scrutiny so it's no surprise I think to most of us that this stuff doesn't work the I mean the most Brazen stuff was them claiming that this is totally this is all secured lending this is super super safe we only pay out 80 of our Revenue this was BS for like five years it's amazing that the government wasn't able now have you ever accidentally had The Misfortune of Being a conference for moshinski spoke anytime since 2018. I want those brain cells on the time back so I actually believe it or not I did a uh I don't know if you guys remember cheddar I don't think it exists anymore I did an interview with cheddar on the New York Stock Exchange at the floor 30 years ago and uh machinski was there and I met him and he spoke before me and he used all of my time so I only got to speak for 30 seconds so yeah yeah um I don't know I I kind of feel like this is like like you said Stephen this is this was kind of obvious yeah obviously sad to see so many retail investors getting ruined by somebody basically running [ __ ] tragic but it's also it's the oldest story in the world this is nothing to do with crypto okay here's the thing I don't understand why did it take so long and why did all the cases happen on the same day right like everyone dumped on the same and like it kind of felt like I remember like during the time like last year there were like all these reports are like machinsky's getting on a private plane going out the country dot dot dot whatever like it was arrested airport and then it turned out those were false but like why did it take so long it feels like a pretty clear case compared to some of the uh like even just reading the thing today I was like wow this is just seems really obvious to you could go after him a long time ago well look I mean I would say part of it could be this and I'm speculating the company was in bankruptcy the damage had already been done I'm not sure he's been arrested yet maybe maybe not I've read conflicting reports um it just takes a while to build a case and you know unless there's an emergency you just take your time uh dude's not going anywhere so that could be the answer it would be different um perhaps if there was information about something like this and there was knowledge by the government there was a ton of money that's that's about to be lost in that sort of case you jump in right away maybe that's an answer it's not really satisfactory but you know but I don't find satisfactory about the whole situation is most of the people in our industry knew that Celsius stinked stunk get a long before it collapsed and all of this going after Celsius is a year after it's collapsed not a year prior to its collapse right and that supports is painful because you know in my opinion I think a lot of the agencies were focused on the wrong targets they weren't focused on the companies that stunk and the actors that stunk and the people with bad intentions you know they were too focused going after you know the coinbases of the world and not the actual like ponzis and like Celsius was a Ponzi at the end of the day right and almost everyone knew it like there were so many things that didn't add up I used to get in public beefs with machinsky all the time trying to call out his nonsense because nothing would add up and everyone knew that there was some like something rocking and instead they went after good actors a lot of the time I I very much underscore that is it very reminiscent of defy projects like uh yeah yeah exactly exactly it's like the story of you know with Sam I think you could argue that there was no way to have known in advance right I think I think that the government was figuring that out the same time the industry was figuring it out with Celsius anybody in the inside knew that there was something up with Celsius right like every single VC that ever kicked the tires in Celsius was like what the hell is going on here this thing is an absolute dumpster fire so that and that's why no good VC is exciting as the Ontario yeah I think cpdq that invested uh um right it was like yeah yeah it was a big big check it was a big picture Canada I think is very turned off from crypto because of the pensions yeah I mean speaking hypothetically a lawyer that I maybe know very well might have been asked to do a due diligence project on this three years ago and it What that particular lawyer heard everyone he spoke with said no do you your folks shouldn't go near but nobody could provide any information it was more like notional like basically I wouldn't give that I wouldn't give that guy a dollar bill so there's a lot of smoke but there wasn't a lot of fire and the problem you have there too is it's hard to call people out publicly if you don't have substantive facts the problem yeah yeah yes kind of but like the problem was that it was all there it's all Unchained right like we all knew they were putting a bunch of money in Anchor everybody knew that but you know apparently the feds were the last to know and it's it like you said Robert it's disappointing not because you know I think everybody in this industry agrees that there should be consumer protection every industry agrees that bad actors should be smoked out and rooted out of the industry but the way in which the you know so far the consumer protection quote unquote in this industry has been mostly uh facade right it's been it's been hey once the damage is already done we go after them before the damage is done we mostly go after good actors who are we're basically trying to carve out these kind of regulatory fault lines and say ah this one is ours this one is yours and these kind of turf wars which really don't feel like doing the job you know if we in the industry can figure out that yeah this guy is the Bernie Madoff and we're pointing it out and basically for years nobody does anything until it's all over and then they parade out the handcuffs and say great you know here's a 4.7 billion dollar judgment when the money was already lost the money's already gone so anyway I'm sure they're all doing their jobs and they have lots of stuff to do I don't you know I don't want to break any individual because I'm sure this is hard and systematic and blah blah and there are other constraints on everybody in the system but it's it's disappointing not that it doesn't work perfectly but disappointing to be kind of double spoken to you know it's like yeah I get it you guys aren't perfect but then don't pretend that the industry needs to be perfect on the other side either or you're really like this was going on and you went after ukidao that's what came to mind too I was like it's [ __ ] pointless and they were bad actors yeah yeah but it was so just significant you know exactly but it was insignificant but there were government resources I feel that way and this is a different tangent for a different time a lot of the enforcement activity focused on defy it's been an absolute misuse of enforcement resources you've got good actors who are uh doing their best to decentralize financial activity and um going after those folks who doesn't make any sense when you've got folks um like uh who are engaged in the alleged activities that Mr machinski was engaged in yeah all right so let's um we're coming up in time so let's let's wrap I just want to as we're closing this out let's put machinski aside [ __ ] that guy uh let's just take a sentence from everybody on the show of what you think for the Ripple case in particular what does this mean going forward give me a sentence Tom you start I'm starting um I mean I I definitely hear what Stephen is saying which is this is far from over but um it does seem like there is more breathing room for people issuing tokens responsibly um and I'm looking forward to seeing how the the market structure reacts well I think this is an inflection point where you know the last number of months especially in the wake of the collapse of FTX and Celsius and Genesis and three arrows capital and block five and like that whole mess you know the attitude again the industry from my perspective was hey this is scary and Regulators are just cracking the enforcement web because they don't know what else to do and you know there isn't necessarily a strong you know basis to what happens next legislation's not coming you know this industry is in trouble and today I think Marxism inflation plant where in my opinion that narrative changes and that you know the rule of law is triumphing and I think it's going to lead to legislation to actually clarify these things that were on certain and I think that this is actually the beginning of like an incredibly optimistic chapter for the Washington crypto industry in America uh I have two things one one I have to to give a shout out to my favorite uh bar owner in Brooklyn I'm gonna go go there tonight because he's an xrp fan I've got I've known him for like 12 years and the first time I ever [ __ ] heard of xrp was him telling me that he sends his family xrp in Australia which I don't even I don't even I don't even ask questions about whether it was on chain or via exchanges or whatever but I just think it's hilarious and uh you know he has a a particular cocktail on their menu That's secretly dedicated to xrp so I'm gonna have to drink a couple of those what's it called the cocktail it's called the XR Pat like expat but with an r in the middle oh that's good super secret uh so yeah and I I gotta give props to my to Andy he sent me a text message today just being like you know free drinks tonight um I'm ready for it should we do a live chopping block happy hour at his bar all right there you go can you make it that what's the name of the bar that's called blueprint blueprint all right live chopping block happy hour at blueprint tonight and uh and so yeah anyway I figured I'd give him a shot because any time I never even paid attention to the Ripple news anytime I go to that bar I would get like a full dossier update on like what had happened and like why garlinghouse was being wronged and I'm like I I would not have known anything about this case had a I would probably really really pay attention so that's the first thing I guess the second thing um I think the question about telegram was quite prescient because I do find this idea that I have a box and I can sell accredited investors the box but then somehow the Box is allowed to like you know remove the exterior of itself and now as long as it's transferred it's it's somehow like a different thing I I'm a little bit like confused and it sort of proves to me that human law is actually just like always going to be incompatible with with blockchains because one has composability as like a necessary primitive and the other one is like this exactly shows that like composability doesn't even exist in like Securities like you can't really compose Securities Law of two entities correctly this is almost like a a re-entrancy attack against security as well [Music] no more box analogies but also that is the most Tyrone take on the Ripple case is that it exposes a re-entracy attack in in law um [ __ ] love that I mean basically the problem the problem you have is that software is deterministic and law is stochastic right and it's like oil and water the two things don't don't uh don't mean I I guess I would say like my takeaway for today I think it's too late to cue you know right of the Valkyries but I don't want to look much credit to uh the Ripple lawyers and congrats to the xrp holders who can now sell their crypto there's a ways to go but um I can understand why people are happy I just I'm a little bit more cautious on what happens next yeah I mean my just to wrap up my two cents I think this was a much needed win in the US uh things have been feeling very gloomy and I think the industry was feeling cornered this at least vindicates that uh crypto has the right to exist in the US and they're in whether it's in the Judiciary or whether it's in uh you know among Congress there are allies for the industry in the U.S period so it's a good it's a good reminder of that if if nothing else that's it for today thanks everybody jumping on this is obviously a big day so we wanted to chat about it live Steven thank you for uh explaining everything for us and hope uh hope there aren't I hope hope next time we have you on we can actually play right of the Valkyries absolutely that would be fun great thanks everybody [Music]
