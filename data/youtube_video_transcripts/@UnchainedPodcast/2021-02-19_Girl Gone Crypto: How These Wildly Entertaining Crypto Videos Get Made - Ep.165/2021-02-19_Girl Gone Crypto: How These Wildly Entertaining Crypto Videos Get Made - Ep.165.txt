leah thompson also known as girl gone crypto welcome leah laura thank you so much for having me as a guest on the show i'm definitely excited to be here and chatting with you great yeah i'm so excited to talk with you so everyone by the time this show comes out i will have been on vacation for almost a week and so before i left which is at the time of this recording i was you know looking for a fun interview to do since i wouldn't be able to do a show tied to the news and leah you have some of the most fun and entertaining and smart videos on crypto that i've seen you're well known for your weekly crypto news videos called the crypto minute in which you recap the news with one liners that you shoot in a variety of different costumes and settings um but you also do a variety of different styles of interviews so why don't you give us an overview of your crypto video work yeah so um as you said i i do this kind of fun entertaining uh infotainment if you will type of um news recap from the week and just try to think of really creative ways to kind of talk about the news like you said with various costumes and shots and things like that so um it's been it's been fun to kind of evolve that i started that video series about six months ago um and then kind of two notice while i do interviews and other kind of educational uh content as well but i would say that the crypto minutes uh probably my favorite type of video that i make so why don't you walk us through what it's like to create one of your recaps and i actually picked one that i really love which is your 2020 end of your review and for listeners i'll actually play the video now on the video so you can see that if you're listening on audio you can listen to the audio but i really urge you to find the link in the show notes and actually watch the video if you can't because the full context really um really just brings to life the full experience 2020 year in review let's go bitcoin has risen from 3600 march all the way up to 28 000 in december which is over 600 percent increase bitcoin having try bitcoin tripling this year created some big institutional whales hi i'm michael saylor this went to xero happy birthday bitcoin white paper i'm a savage i'm theorem to put the fed printed nine trillion dollars this year do infinity and beyond bitcoin is the best performing asset this year and decade fifty shades of grey scale come here i got the goods nfts was a hot defy summer careful buying food tokens or else you could get sentenced to eternal yam nation let's talk about bitcoin is it all season yet no is it alt season now no is it all oh my god hi jack the bitcoin pizza would not be worth 270 million dollars well hey all you crypto cats and kittens paypal welcome 2021 is going to be smoking so leah that was amazing loved that can you tell us how you choose the different ways you'll portray these different news events like you know if we just contrast some of the scenes in this video you've got the one where you've got the glasses and cardigan outfit with the charts showing the rise in bitcoin kind of this like educator look or librarian look or something and then and the next one you're you know juggling these tequila limes to discuss bitcoin the bitcoin price tripling and then a cut to you know you pretending to be michael saylor in a whale costume so how did you come up with those different ideas and and you know piece that all together yeah so generally what i do is i'm just kind of throughout the the week i'll you know find list out different news stories and then for this one in particular obviously it was like the year in review so i was really going through the past year like what were some of the biggest stories that happened so i'll kind of list that all out and then just i guess really like sit with it and think about if there's any like interesting or or fun or creative way that i could maybe portray that whether it's a play on words or if it's uh maybe a costume like you mentioned the michael saylor like you know he's become a a big bitcoin whale with microstrategy right so i was like i could do a whale costume um you know with the limes i was talking about the price of bitcoin triplings with juggling three limes so i mean i don't know it's just sometimes it's just uh trying to be playful trying to poke a little bit of fun at things but you know make it kind of educational as well so uh so yeah i don't know i guess i just spend spend some time just kind of really thinking through each line and so how long does it take you to create these one minute videos and when i mean that i don't mean just the filming of it but from you know the brainstorming to publication so each video probably takes between six to eight hours um to produce just just depending on um you know i want to say how many costume changes there are but you know really like the process of thinking through the lines then filming and then editing and distributing um but yeah probably about six to eight hours and so for each of these shots do you have to do multiple takes are you so good that you tend to get it on the first try so um some of them take a few takes but actually my sister helps me film them which is a lot of fun because then we just get to like hang out every week and you know kind of film these videos together but um every once in a while we'll get one in the first shot and i'm like all right we got one take wonder here today so awesome so that's because sometimes there is this other person in video who actually yeah she does look a little bit like you and has the same color hair at least so is that's your sister i presume yeah yeah she's uh she's a super creative person and so i was like you know it'd be fun to have someone help film because you can get a little bit cooler shots than if it's just me with the tripod and also it's a little awkward especially if i'm filming outside to like just have me in a tripod like outside filming things and so it makes it a little more comfortable to have another person there filming as well but it's just it's just kind of a fun excuse to get to hang out as well and and also are like because i'm i'm really impressed you know let's put it this way normally with this kind of thing you have different people in all these different roles like the writer and then the actor and then the director etc but you're kind of like doing it all am i right or do you outsource different parts of this so um i do most of it myself i do have um a friend of mine that's in the crypto community that is just i think he's like super creative so i actually sometimes he helps me come up with some shot ideas like hey i haven't thought of a good one for this line yet what do you think and so i've got a friend that i can kind of bounce that off of and then sometimes while we're filming my sister might come up with an idea so i kind of feel like i've got this you know great kind of group of creative people that are helping to contribute but in terms of you know deciding on the news stories and doing the editing and all of that i do that myself and so in general what are the biggest challenges challenges that you face in creating these videos that's an interesting question i would say it's really just deciding which uh news stories to cover especially right now there's so much happening all the time that you know it seems like you know when i started this series six months ago i was like okay what else could i include i need to find five more stories and now i'm like cutting stories because there's just so many things happening every week that i i totally hear you on that i totally got it when when you do start i'm assuming so maybe you start with like 20 ideas then how do you whittle it down to which ones you're going to include and yeah what are your favorite memories of creating some of these ideas for how to portray one of the news events yeah so usually when i'm going through and kind of deciding which ones to pick it'll either be one this is such a big story like of course i have to cover it this week or two i just have a funny idea for it so sometimes that prioritizes it um and so in terms of like memories uh or favorite you know kind of moments from filming these vlogs um or these uh the crypto minute i have to say i'm glad you picked the the 2020 year in your view because that was the one i probably had the the most fun with just coming up with different things um i've also kind of started uh posting some like blooper reels here and there because it sometimes things go really really wrong on set you know when we're doing between these and um okay so um and then i was talking about sushi and sorry i had a plate of sushi and i was trying to um imitate a rug pole so i was like tripping but anyway the sushi went flying and i was trying to hang on to it and just things like that i have a one of those money printer guns whenever i'm talking about like maybe like janet yellen or the fed or you know quantitative easing or printing money um and it just makes a mess like these fake dollar bills like all over my living room and sometimes i'll find them later actually this was kind of funny i had a friend over and she found one of these fake they're fake hundred dollar bills um like somewhere and she's like look a hundred dollar bill and i was like oh it's fake and she was like why do you have fake hundred dollar bills in your couch like it was just like i had to explain the whole thing so it's just it's a lot of kind of fun moments i guess come up from that you know where did you get that uh money fake money printer oh just amazon um i think it was like 20 bucks it's uh it's been a great purchase and are you gonna i guess you'll reuse the whale costume as well yeah definitely um i've got some some good staples that i feel like will come out more often like i've got a good whale costume i've got some good bare ears now if i'm talking about bitcoin bears you know there's a few that i was like i should probably i've got an astronaut costume now to talk about going to the moon so i've been trying to think about staples a unicorn costume if i ever talk about uniswap you know those kinds of things so oh my god i love it you're like the living map uh crypto mascot all right so in a moment we're going to talk about how girl gone crypto got into crypto but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible join thousands of people from around the world who are earning bitcoin while creating a more

s-u-n-e-x-c-h-a-n-g-e dot com slash unconfirmed back to my conversation with leah thompson aka girl gone crypto so yeah tell us your crypto origin story yeah so i first heard about bitcoin actually back in 2011 i had a friend who like filled his entire apartment with mining rigs was super into mining bitcoin and so that was my first impression of of bitcoin was you know what is this super nerdy weird computer thing i mean the apartment was so hot with all these mining rigs running it was just this very kind of like odd first experience and so i i kind of thought at first like oh well i mean that's cool that you're doing this but bitcoin is maybe for people you know for nerds you know if you want to overclassify but um then i you know i kind of kept hearing about it uh this same friend was kind of poking me to buy bitcoin and i wish i had listened to him earlier um you know as i'm sure many of us do but um in kind of early mid 2017 is when i i really started getting more into crypto myself and so um i ran across um this blogging platform called steemit and i don't know if you're familiar um but it basically is where you can earn crypto for posting so anyway i started doing that and i started earning crypto and what was really interesting about that is i it caused me to really go down the rabbit hole and start asking a lot more questions once i physically had some crypto in my hands like well what gives this value can i convert it to real money air quotes for those listening which is funny now to think of it that way um you know what what is this thing called an exchange um you know what is this thing called a wallet a hardware wallet i just really started to ask all those questions and start educating myself more and learning more on crypto um and then started kind of poking around you know seeing what other coins maybe i might want to invest in and then got to experience the whole last bull run and um have just kind of been here in the crypto space you know kind of casually um between i would say you know that time and then kind of mid 2019 is when i decided to to launch gorgon crypto but the way that kind of came about even is really interesting because um because i was blogging on steemit like pretty uh you know consistently almost every day even though i wasn't blogging or making videos about crypto related things because it's a pretty big at the time you know it's a pretty big like art community so i was doing random like ukulele covers and recipes just i don't know really random things um but people started asking me to come speak at crypto conferences because a lot of people that were on that platform were obviously based within the crypto world um and i was like me like what are you talking about like i i don't talk about crypto but um they just thought my story was interesting um you know like earning crypto for playing my ukulele and you know all of these things and so i started traveling and speaking at a few crypto conferences and after about a year or so of that i was like you know i should just try launching a crypto channel it would be a great way for i'm obviously passionate about it i it's you know where i've been choosing to invest you know time and energy and funds and all of those things and so um that could be kind of a fun way for me to learn more i could interview people i could um just kind of grow my own knowledge while also making context it just kind of felt like the universe was pushing me in that direction so uh so yeah about mid 2019 i launched girl gone crypto and uh and then here we are and yeah and so how did that journey go like how has your user base grown what were some of the pivotal moments like do you feel like there was a particular video or like scene that you shot where like that really caught people's attention or yeah so when i first started uh making content i i mostly just did interviews because i'm like you know what i even though i've been in the crypto space at that point for a few years kind of educating myself i didn't feel like i really um could make videos really like speaking um and educating ghettos like i feel like i still have so much to learn so i just started interviewing a bunch of people and that was the majority of my content for probably the first year um or you know eight months to a year and um since i've kind of pivoted to get a little bit more into some more of the creative stuff which is more of what i'm doing now uh which is also i'm still doing interviews but um one of the kind of uh pivotal moments actually that i think really has given way to a lot more of this kind of more creative content i've been doing was uh jk rowling uh was tweeting about bitcoin it was this huge thing you know now obviously we've had more celebrities tweeting about bitcoin recently but that was like a really big moment you know in time and i i don't know why but i just was like oh i should i should make a response video that's like harry potter themed i don't know where the idea came from exactly but i called it the muggles guide to bitcoin and anyway i just kind of put it in harry potter terms and that's just been such a fun piece of content even to this day you know even though i posted it back in may people like the first thing they'll say to me is i love your harry potter video or i i never could get my kids to watch information about bitcoin but they love your harry potter video so it's just it's been really uh that was just a really fun uh not just a fun piece of content on its own but i think it kind of opened my eyes a little bit like wow people like this kind of sillier maybe more fun but still smart kind of content and so i think that was kind of a turning point for me too yeah yeah that is a great video it has a quarter of a million views and did she ever respond to that she didn't but that that's okay i uh i've come to terms with it well hopefully she's hopefully she's watched it because it is a really good explainer i love it and out of curiosity i when i was watching i was like wait did she have to get like copyright permission like i was just wondering how that works because there's kind of a lot of scenes from harry potter and i was like anyway i was just wondering how that part works yeah that's a really um interesting question and so all the research i had done and to be honest i'm still not 100 sure that i'm correct on this um is that footage if it's not the main purpose of the video and if i'm not using any audio from the video um is eligible for use under uh like kind of fair use kind of things but to be honest i am more cautious now as i'm going forward because even if something might technically be under fair use that doesn't mean that you might not run into issues in the future and so um as my kind of channels have continued to grow i've been more conscious of of that sort of thing and so uh so yeah i do have um for those who haven't seen it i recorded with the green screen and then put a bunch of harry potter footage behind me um and so so yeah that's actually still something i'm not 100 positive on so oh okay okay yeah well maybe we can look that up because i was wondering um you know because i think it's like a two-minute video or something but it is a bunch of different scenes it's not like one continuous piece um yeah and so you know what are all the different social media platforms that you reach people on and what do you find are the differences of the crypto audience between these different platforms yeah that's a great question so um twitter is probably the platform i'm the most active on and i feel like with twitter one thing that i love about that in terms of the audience and the people that are there is it's such a mix of kind of og cryptos and then you've got traders you've got people that are new to crypto you've got people that are kind of in this like middle section i would say where maybe they understand a certain amount but they want to learn more and there's maybe certain topics that they're like i don't totally get that yet and so that's kind of my core audience i would say that i'm really thinking about when i'm making a lot of more like educational kind of content is the people that know what the word blockchain means they know you know so what some of these things are but some of these maybe finer details they're you know wanting to kind of dive into a little more so um i like that on twitter you have such a mix um on youtube i would say it's also a mix but definitely have a little bit more of the like beginner kind of people are searching for information they're searching for you know they're trying to learn actively and so you maybe have more of that crowd uh tick tock is another platform that i'm i'm pretty active on um you know making some more of that kind of creative type content that we've talked about in a more like a tic tac uh tic toc format and those are very very beginner entry level um i would say in terms of their understanding of bitcoin and their interest in it and so that's been really actually kind of exciting for me to get to speak to to that audience of people that are truly like maybe they know what dogecoin is and that's about it and but there's more i'm seeing more and more interest in terms of learning more about bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and that kind of realm as well and so is this um like a hobby for you are you able to make income this way or you know how does this combine with your other work yeah so um i have actually just recently um only about a month ago uh quit my my day job if you will and have gone full time here in crypto which is really exciting i worked for the same company and it was a tech company i worked there for like eight years and so it was a big big decision to to leave that and kind of jump jump into this but um yeah i've been really grateful i've got some awesome sponsors that have helped to support my channels um but also it's it's kind of funny this isn't something i really set out to to do but i i joke that i have a video production company because uh crypto brands will reach out to me saying hey we need to get these tutorials made for our website about our you know our wallet or our you know project whatever it is and are you interested can we hire you to make you know videos for us and so that's been kind of an unexpected als like additional um kind of line of work if you will is um just kind of working with some of these crypto brands to help distill down their message of what they're trying to say and make educational content about their their products uh for their customer base oh that's great perfect so now that you've made the sleep what do you have planned next you know i'm just so excited for 2021 to really double down on all of this to make more content to make the content better um you know i'm always thinking about how can i up the production quality how can i make it more interesting so i'm just really excited to i don't know if this sounds cheesy but to say just kind of explore like my own curiosity and excitement and see what what people are getting stoked about and and do more of that so um so yeah i just think 2021 is going to be a really a really fun year for for making content great and before we go are there any other favorite videos that you want to urge the listeners to watch or or just maybe favorite scenes that you want to give a backstory for for some of the like i know you told us some of the bloopers but if there's any any other stories you want to add one of the things that i've been really kind of working on and like having some fun with is taking my more educational videos and adding in elements of what i do in the crypto minute to those and that's been a more recent change it's been a lot of fun where like maybe i'll do an explanation video i have like a two-minute crypto explainer video series where i try to take topics and kind of break them down in just a couple of minutes but adding in kind of costumes and kind of silly uh you know footage and b-roll and things to make them a little bit more engaging because really my my goal is to make learning about crypto feel a lot more approachable and fun um yeah i know that a lot of content can feel a little bit technical and a little overwhelming and if you're just trying to learn about something and it's all you know like these big hour long videos that might feel a little overwhelming to dive into and so um just kind of short bite size tutorials um but like for example i recently did a video on um explaining what a hardware wallet is and how to use it and you know i was kind of joking about like hackers and i like i have a ninja costume and so on screen i'm like in a ninja costume so just trying to make even educational videos a little bit more entertaining too great all right well it's been so fun having you on unconfirmed thanks for coming on the show
