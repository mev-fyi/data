legal advice today's guest is Taylor Monahan CEO of my crypto calm and co-founder of my ether wallet welcome Taylor thank you so much for having me Laura let's start talking about both my ether wallet and my crypto since you recently left my ether wallet to start my crypto what does mine ether wallet do and how does my crypto differ from my ether wallet that is an excellent question Laura so we have to kind of go back in time a little bit to sort of get the full story of how this evolution occurred and it really comes down to me as a founder just being completely unprepared for everything doing things right in in like the company structure side of things so for example setting up a company having all the paperwork done and signed none of those were priorities because we just wanted to build a product so over the past you know about six months so the end of 2016 or sorry the end of 2017 beginning of 2018 we really wanted to frankly get our [ __ ] together and make sure that you know the company the team everything was really put together in a solid manner and the reality was that nothing was set up right so a lot of the differences between my either wallet in my crypto or actually things that the end-user doesn't care about at all they are things that give us security there are things that give us the legal standing to be protected there are things like we can now have bank accounts and you know potentially do stock options for employees and have real employees and all of these things that we were limited beforehand you know in terms of from a product standpoint and the things that users might actually care about with my crypto we're really looking to just go full steam ahead and deliver not only the web interface that we have right now which is very very similar to my ether wallet but desktop apps mobile apps just enhance security enhance deploy systems a whole bunch of really fancy stuff that make the user experience better and hopefully help cut down on some of the phishing issues that we've encountered over the last two years pretty much and so just for people who aren't really even familiar with the product at all when you were talking about like the web interface and stuff so what is it that you do on my ether wallet or my crypto what is it that somebody can do on that site absolutely so we're basically this interface that interacts directly with the ethereum blockchain and so instead of you know I compared to like coinbase just because they're really well known name but when you you're using coinbase you go to coinbase comm you can login with your username and your password and then you can do things like buy Bitcoin or sell Bitcoin you can look at your balances you can look at your transaction history all of these things and so with my crypto you can do similar things but instead of using coin bases back-end or any hosted wallets back-end you're actually interacting directly with the blockchain and this is really really key because it means that you are in control so you're in control of your keys and while Queen mace is really legitimate and a you know they have a great team they have create leadership they have great vision a lot of these other exchanges that are holding your funds and holding your keys for you they may not be as reputable and we hear about these Hawks in the space all the time and it's such a disappointment and so that's really the benefit of my crypto is that you can be in control and you can control you know when you send your money you don't have a third party deciding whether or not you can send it when you can send it and then obviously there's no risk of a third party being hacked and their entire hot wallet being being drained like we've seen so many times before so then I like this comparison that your or this contrast that you do with coinbase so essentially when I create an address on my crypto what is that doing exactly because like I know for instance that I can even use my crypto or my ether wallet offline so what what is happening exactly right so the way that the blockchain works and cryptography works is you have these private keys and these public keys and together they're they're called like a key pair and every private key has this corresponding public key and the public key is your address so that's that string of characters in with aetherium it starts with 0x and then it's about 40 characters long and this is just simply how cryptography works this is how you know your SSL certs work this is how a lot of the the infrastructure of the Internet revolves around this cryptography we're just kind of putting into this financial means and so with my crypto when you go in you're creating an address what you're doing is you're deriving this key pair and the hardest part about that is just truly randomly generating this this key pair for you and then you take that and you decide to use it it's actually quite simple relative to say Facebook or Gmail or coinbase where you have a user account you have a user email you have information that's tied to that account whether it be addresses or your credit card number or your email address or whatever these pieces of information is with my Krypton you just go and we're gonna handle all the hard math and the cryptography for you and we're just gonna give you that address and that's just it's all cryptography this is all just based on really fancy math it's not based on like a server side authentication like you have with Gmail or Facebook or a coin base event and so when we say you know you can you can generate a wallet offline or you can send offline as long as you know what type of math is being used it doesn't matter if you're online or offline because you don't need to go access a server somewhere and you don't need to go check with it you just know that as long as everyone's doing the same math problem they're going to get to the same answer and so that's really it's really quite remarkable how it all works and it's just it's really different I think that's the best word for it it's really different from say you know your traditional login systems with with Gmail and Facebook and coinbase so essentially what's happening when I go on there is that the service is creating a pair of keys for me one public in one private is that correct on the etherion blockchain right exactly and then really what you're doing is you you're simply deciding that you're gonna use this key pair like you've decided this is my address and so these key pairs are totally randomly generated there's about a bazillion of them that you could choose from and you're just saying hey this is mine I'm gonna use this moving forward and that's it ok and then when I create a password on there what exactly is not doing so the password is encrypting the private key and the reason that we encrypt it for you is because this single piece of information is essentially controlling either hundreds of dollars or thousands of dollars or potentially millions of dollars and so by encrypting it we just put another layer of protection on top of the private key so that ideally let's say you store it somewhere a little bit in securely someone gets their hands on it ideally they'd also need that password and they wouldn't have it so they couldn't steal your money that's obviously in an ideal world so I also know that it's possible for me to connect my my crypto address or my my ether-wall address to say let or meta masks or some other service so what does that mean at that moment like does it mean that I have in essence sort of like two private keys to access the same funds sort of so when you're using meta mask or a ledger or treasure essentially instead of using a private key that you generated on my crypto you're actually using this private key that's stored in this external place and it's one of the reasons that we love hardware wallets so much is that they essentially have this private key on the hardware device itself and it's not it's not on your computer it's not on your cell phone it's on this dedicated device and so you still have one private key and it still has well with the in the case of ledger you have like multiple addresses but there's still like one core private key and then you can then what ends up happening is that my crypto talks to the ledger and they communicate back and forth but at no point is the actual private key this very very important piece of information ever sent to my crypto or even your computer and that's why we love hardware devices so much as I it's this worry-free device that you can just use if you go to like a phishing website or if you you know get like a key logger on your computer or something terrible like that your funds are still safe because the funds are stored on this on the blockchain and then the device is storing your access to those funds huh so the my crypto address sort of enables me to interact in a web environment but with funds that are maybe contained offline is that what you're saying yeah essentially it's it's a bit complicated because there's nothing in this world like it it's really it's quite hard to explain and I haven't gotten you know the best of it but because how do I say this so because you have this hardware device and the hardware device contains this one piece of really really important information which is your private key it can communicate with my crypto or another interface and without sending the private key itself it can send the data that you need so whether that's your account balance whether that's your address or whether that's the fact that you want to send this transaction so you know I want to send one-eighth to this address the ledger can handle all of that and then we will just communicate just the the public information out to the world so that your transactions actually broadcast and you send your funds okay so let's go back to uh when you first started my ether wallet what were the options out there for interacting with the ethereum blockchain all the way back then so back then it was just gas which is the go with areum client and then there was a C++ client and that was it and these are both command-line interfaces meaning that you had to like open terminal and type in commands in order to generate a new wallet send your funds from one place to another etc and so that's really you know the tool that we built was really just a response to the lack of graphical interfaces out there it wasn't you know we didn't plan on this becoming this huge company we didn't plan on this you know kind of taking over our lives in the way it has we've really just you know we're like hey I want buttons other people probably want buttons too let's make a simple interface with buttons and so I think that sort of gets to your personal story which is pretty interesting to me you started out in film school which isn't really the typical background for someone in your position oh so how did you end up getting into crypto and founding my ether wallet dot yeah it's definitely been a remarkable journey you know my mom has always said that I kind of find my own path in life and I never take the easy path so you know as you said I did go to film school I eventually dropped out of film school and her basically just looking for anything interesting literally anything interesting to do and this was um this was in like 2010 and so the economy just wasn't the greatest like we were still recovering from the recession especially for like a liberal arts school drop-out um the world was not I was pretty convinced I was gonna be like a broke college dropout for the rest of my life and so what I did was you know I found a job that enabled me to utilize my skills that I had learned in film school and then I just basically expanded my skills as much as I could in order to try not to be fired like when really that wasn't my mole so it was for this company called a marriage hip they do like a lot of odd tech stuff we work with a lot of like fortune 500 companies it was a really cool job with a really diverse set of projects and that's also like during that period of time is when I learned about crypto currencies just because I was soaking up all the knowledge I could and just really trying to do anything remarkable I was so like in general I was just bored and wanted to do anything that was you know about creating and telling stories and helping people that's what I've always been about so that's yeah that's how that got started well super so two questions hat white why did you drop out of film school and then how did you even learn about crypto in the first place so I dropped out of film school because as much as I enjoyed making movies a lot of film school is not actually about you know hands-on work it's about for example the semester I dropped out I was taking a class called Italian cinema in the nineteenth century it was a six hour class that you just learned about Italian cinema and I just was not I was not about that I wanted to create things so I dropped out in order to really focus on just creating rather than these classes and I honestly I assumed that I would go back at some point and then when I you know got my first job and started you know working and and seeing sort of how the real world operates because College world called his jobs college world that's a whole different you know environment to be in and so when I started working I found that okay people actually need problems being you know solved like actually being solved and people have you know different needs and different desires and you can create things whether it's film or a simple website or you know some marketing piece and that'll adjust their needs and that'll adjust their goals that all adjusts you know whether it's something that is lacking or a new product that they're launching or whatever it was and I found that really interesting and I found it satisfied my same like wanting to tell the story that I really enjoyed in film school but in a much more like real-world tangible sense so it was during that time that I really I think I was probably like a Mashable article that I read about Bitcoin and I just got intrigued and I think everyone's story is about the same from there but you fall down this rabbit hole of just like seeing the possibilities open up in front of you and seeing all the different things that you know this could change the world or these could change these in efficiencies or whatever it was and it was just I was so drawn to that I was just my imagination was completely captured I was I was down that rabbit hole pretty fast and no do you remember when you read that so I remember that we started like reading about Bitcoin and really like me and a couple close friends started sharing information as it was going up to that 1200 so that first Bitcoin bubble but we didn't buy any until it started going in town so it was definitely not the most ideal time to get into Bitcoin but it was definitely a good learning experience see what sounds like that was late 2013 or early 2014 I believe so it was yeah it was right during the initial Bitcoin bubble and so we ended up buying getting into it on the way up and then we were buying on the way down which obviously is not the ideal way to do things but was a really great learning experience and then what were you trying to do on the etherion blockchain 2015 that got you you know to start my ether wallet so we had participated in the etherion presale and so honestly we weren't trying to do anything fancy we just wanted to safely store our ether somewhere and so we created this little tool that would just allow us to do that without having to trust my personal abilities using command-line that was really the only goal was like okay we're gonna take a really simple problem we're gonna make a really simple solution that way I don't have to type in commands to move this ether around which is a good thing and then we'll go from there and honestly it was it was really that simple and it wasn't until so that was like mid 2015 it wasn't until during 2016 that everything sort of changed and things started getting a little bit more serious so the dowel happened the DAO got hacked the hard fork happened all these different things happened and we just kept iterating and responding to feedback that was just that was it it was just you know people needed stuff we built stuff that was it and so you were you keep saying we who is we so the original two of us is is his name's Cole Silla he goes by the username tbh nuke it was me and him and that's it all the way through God almost all the way to the end of 2016 and then when stuff started getting kind of really hectic my husband jumped in and started helping out as kind of like a life raft more than anything else just trying to keep us afloat and then during 2017 when stuff got really really rough that's when he VH nuke you know there's always there's always sort of a breaking point if you want to call it or a turning point and for him it was during this ICO madness that you know for one reason or another you know things started breaking down in our communication and our partnership and I really can't you know I'm not I can't really like put words into his mouth or like you know say what he was thinking or what he was feeling but I can say for me personally during these crazy ico times in mid 2017 it was probably one of the most stressful periods of my life and just you know everything was being thrown at us and we're kind of like responsible for an immense amount of money being moved around whether or not you know that was actually you know we don't we don't hold people's keys we're not actually sending the money we're just enabling people to do this but people don't see it that way so we still take the blame so there's a lot of different factors that went into it but it was about in June or July that he kind of topped out and and you'll have to you know ask him exactly why that was but it was definitely a stressful stressful time and so you sort of alluded to this but you know as we all have seen 2017 was a breakout year for crypto probably the biggest year in the history of the space and the craze took off super fast but we got some Inklings of how quickly things could take off in 2016 and my ether while it was really one of the main entities in the center of the whole storm so can you just describe for me how crypto seemed to change both across 2016 and 2017 from the vantage point that you had yeah absolutely I mean it was the best way I can describe it is just kind of like we we approached everything as whatever fire is the biggest and the closest put that one out so instead of thinking about the long-term instead of thinking about the potential of the blockchain you know in 2019 2020 in 10 years whatever it is everyone's attitudes was really short-term and ours included and I think that that's really one of the biggest shifts that we saw was just how how fast this all happened and once it gets going and once that momentum gets going there's no way that you can stop it and part of that is due to you know that there really is real potential for the blockchain right like there is remarkable things that people can build and it can enable a lot of remarkable things another part of it is that you know a lot of what we're seeing these days even today is is highly speculative and so people you know when they're speculating on things and they all get going it's hot that's called the bubble and that's sort of what we're seeing and for us you know we're not we're not big fans of the price shooting up quickly because it means that everything else used up quickly - and what do you mean by that everything else what else I mean like support ticket shoot up the servers go down and so therefore the amount of time it takes to maintain the service goes up just you know every time the price goes up I think we're like Oh God okay like what's what's going wrong we're you know how can we fix it what do we need to address who do we need to hire that kind of stuff we're not it's not super enjoyable anywhere to be honest and so um over that time period how would you say the people interested in the crypto space changed it was um I would call it more diverse I wouldn't say that the people entering the space were like any one specific type of person but what we had seen up until that point was like really highly technical people that were really interested in the technology interested in the space interested in the potential now we had this diverse set of people that were you know maybe more speculative maybe around for the short term but we also saw people like grandmother's and to this space people who you know were from the more traditional Wall Street type world who were interested in this space and the potential of it and so we definitely weren't prepared for that I think up until that point you know Weathers I was making user interface choices or copy choices I was pretty confident in my ability to do so because if I understood it chances are our users would understand it because you know we had similar traits and during 2017 that all changed I really it it pretty much hit me over the head pretty hard you know when I would make like a copy update that I would think like okay this is now more clear and we get hundreds of support tickets telling me how wrong I was and just like I would just accidentally create these this confusion and I was like okay I'm definitely not like we definitely need more people here we definitely need to analyze our users we definitely need to sit back and like figure out how we're gonna scale this to be maintainable and be a useful tool for everyone not just you know these sort of technical people who have already have crypto currencies and what were the kinds of questions you were getting um it was really broad so sometimes people have questions about like what is the blockchain or what is a private key sometimes they're more like how do I get rich or I heard about this ICO and I want to get in help me you know our favorite questions are definitely ones that we can take some time answering and it's gonna like it's because you actually care and you actually want to know what's going on with this crazy cryptography or the blockchain or whatever our least favorite ones are when they people ask us like the email support and they're asking us to speculate on the markets which happens really frequently actually like meaning asking you for which coins are the next hot coins and stuff like that yeah exactly so whether or not we think that this ICO will show the Returns at that ICO is promising or you know do you think XY and Z would be the next ether those types of questions I mean do you would you even respond to those well we have a policy that we respond to all emails so we do actually respond to them but we have for those types of questions we have a we don't actually answer the question obviously like we don't tell them like yes this is gonna be the next aetherium or something like that we we very graciously you know kind of point them to some really awesome resources that we have about investing and good choices and due diligence and those types of things and ask them to be responsible of regardless of the investment choices that they choose to make okay we're gonna finish discussing kryptos crazy year in 2017 also talk about tips for not losing your crypto and more but first I'd like to take a quick break to tell you about our fabulous sponsor start engine interested in raising capital through a regulated IC o---- start engine is your one-stop solution start engine an IC o---- platform with

not provide legal advice potential sponsors this ad spot could be yours if you or your company is interested in sponsoring unchained please send an email to Laura Shin podcast at gmail.com that's la you are a Shi n podcast at gmail.com my guest today is Taylor Monahan CEO of my crypto comm so how much in transactions was my ether wallet doing at various times over the year so we have very little analytics just because so much of our user base is really privacy minded and we frankly don't really want that information we do have some transaction counts meaning that we just like know how much how many transactions were going through our notes but one of the awesome things about my crypto is that you can actually send you can send a transaction through our nodes or other infrastructure like in fira and ether scan and giveth so essentially even if our nodes were to be offline you have these other points of infrastructure these other API endpoints that you can interact with so during ok so at the beginning of 2017 we were sending about 5,000 to 10,000 transactions a day and then June 21st which was during the status IC o---- we sent almost half a million transactions that day so that's that's that's growth for you right there that's that's why things were cessful right like that's a big number difference luckily after the status IC o---- things did cool down a little bit people were a little bit more responsible the I SEOs weren't as they just weren't filled with us much FOMO and then in about November December when crypto kitties hit we were right back up to those levels that we had seen during the status IC o---- but just more sustained and no end in sight and then that's almost more scary than an ICO right because you're like when is this gonna end is this gonna be is this the new normal you know how do we how do we learn to sustain this you know when are we going to scale atheria and those types of questions and so for a service like yours is it something where if you scale that that helps alleviate it or is it more limited to what's actually happening on the blockchain and so you're just sort of dealing with you know whatever capacity constraints your are set by that blockchain so it's definitely twofold there's definitely things that there's like a limit that the etherium blockchain can handle like then the amount of transactions held per block and the amount of blocks per second or minute or hour or whatever you know dot dot all are pretty hard limits where we can do things to improve is you know how our nodes receive traffic how they process that traffic how fast they respond to requests like what's my balance or you know what's all what what are my token balance is and so it is twofold like we were definitely going down while the ethereum blockchain was just chugging away you know in december january we started seeing the limits being hit on the ethereum blockchain itself though and so then you know now we need to talk about okay so when is proof of stake how is that going to be rolled out safely what can people like us do to assist that process etc etc etc so you know we'll see and is there something that people like companies like yours can do for that so what I'm encouraging the team to do really is be just more involved in talking more to the core sort of people that are working at the etherion foundation or doing research so at the aryan we have this VIP process which is basically these like etherion proposals of how things should work in the future and some are really high-level some of them are low-level some of them are in-between but i'm encouraging our team to just be more involved be you know things that matter to us comment on and stay positive and stay encouraging towards those who are working on solving these really really hard problems and if there is an opportunity for us to help in any way to do so because i think that you know one of the reasons i love this space so much but especially the etherium space is just how great everyone is at working together and encouraging each other and being supportive you know that's why we're here like what i don't know if we can do anything but hey we'll do our best to try and i want to go back to how you were talking about how things got super crazy for you in 2017 and just remind me again when was the status I see it was it June yeah so the status I see it was June 21st and that was really that peak like that was the graph went all the way up hockey stick style and that status ICO was that peak right there and then it kind of leveled out and chilled for a little bit okay and so what did a day in the life of Taylor Monahan look like at that time oh god it was not it was not a good life I would essentially wake up whenever one of like my emergency alarms would go off meaning if it's someone on the team called me if there was like something really bad happening or if the servers were offline and usually that was like it really just depended but it was usually about three hours after I'd gone to sleep so if that was at 9:00 a.m. I'd wake up at 9:00 I put out whatever the fire was that thought was that fire I would try to either prepare for the next IC o---- I would try to answer support tickets because we were not our support staff is like not fully up to date at that point I think we had two people working the support during the Status ICL and we would just like try to crank through as many tickets as we could we tried to update the site in as many ways we could in between I cos to inform people about the important things so they didn't have to email support and then I would like basically repeat those sorts of tasks so either updating the website updating the knowledgebase answering support tickets talking to people in the community about things that were going on we had phishing website so a lot of times I'd be setting takedowns for that or finding them and then at some point I would take a nap meaning I would just like fall fast asleep like pass out for a couple hours and then repeat that and so I was essentially sleeping maybe are sleeping like on a cycle where it's like nap just periodically whenever I could catch a couple a couple hours worth of sleep and it was not like if that's when I say like it wasn't healthy like it was not fun my husband would literally just like bring me food he was helping with support tickets it was just rough like it was just like we didn't have enough people to help there were too many people to help we were seeing people lose heaps of money it was you know whether it's the fishing sites or like not being educated about how to invest in IC or whatever it was like terrible to just be constantly inundated with emails about people who entered this base hopeful and then you know suddenly had their funds lost like that just really really sucked and I really wanted to fix it and it's not it's not an easy problem to fix and so like given this experience and all the problems that you saw people were facing what do you think are the main issues in the crypto community or around a theorem I guess specifically and what needs to be solved next for people you know for wider adoption to happen I think education is really really key and I think that you know I used to think that just educating people more and having like a better user interface would solve a lot of the problems that we're seeing but you know more and more I'm thinking about what are the practices that we allow so for example a lot only people to connect via their private key in their browser by going to a website like that's something that that people are kind of taught that is okay because we're like okay yeah go go to my crypto comm type in your private key off you go and then when they you know when they go and an ICO promises them free money or they end up on a phishing site accidentally they never have that stop moment they never have like oh hey pause is this the correct website am I in the in the in the right place is this a scam they never have those moments so I think that you know educating the user is massively important and we need to do a better job with our user interface with the language that we use with even not language things things like icons or illustrations to really get our points across and warn people about you know the dangers of crypto currencies and I also think that instilling best practices in our own website would be immensely helpful and that's one of the reasons that we're litter building as fast as we can on desktop and mobile ops so we can start reach educating people and be like okay private keys in the browser are not necessarily a good thing and you need to think twice before you do it okay so here's something that I don't understand because I actually have not actually used the service I've generated a private key but then obviously I didn't have like money attached to it or anything so I never used it again but if I go back to the site and let's say that I do have funds I in that address then how how does that work and then how does a phishing site get me to give them the money you know accidentally right so with the private key options and this is just like you'd be under your private key area or keystore file if you're on our site it just unlocks your wallet and it gives you access to it'll show you your address it'll show you your balance that'll show you your token balances etc and unfortunately like even though we don't transmit your private key at any time because it's not necessary if you're on a fake website the fake website will transmit your private key to their servers so essentially if you're on you know we're seeing very creative versions of both my crypto and my ether wallet you know we'll see three L's instead of two L's we'll see zeros instead of o's you know those types of things if you accidentally end up on one of these sites when you go and you unlock your wallet instead of everything remaining on your computer it'll send that private information out and so once they have that private key then they have access to your account and they can do whatever they want and that's obviously like incredibly detrimental to your average user yeah and I remember that there was a phishing scam with my ether wallet where instead of the two L's it was two Capitol eyes but nasaan Seraphin which is what of what you know what our browsers use you can't tell the difference so one other thing I was wondering well is how did my ether wallet make money and how is my encrypted going to make money so my crypto relies exclusively at this point on just kind of these rapture models so we have agreements with coinbase coinbase shapeshift ledger treasure and ether cards and essentially if you either purchase a hardware wallet or an ether card through our affiliate links or you buy ether with USD via coinbase or you trade ether and tokens via shape-shift we get a really small small amount back due to that transaction and so that's awesome and we do actually pretty well off of those like I I was surprised I think it's because I don't know it's because we make it easy but I also think that it's a huge our users or like really big fans of us like I'm pretty sure they're really like clicking those affiliate links with purpose and I just like I'm super grateful for that moving forward though I'm really excited to start playing with other monetization strategies that find the right balance between giving users really useful features and also monetizing so that we can have a sustainable business and some of the things that we're talking about are things like delayed transactions and that's a good example because it's it's something that you're you know you don't need it to do you don't ever have to like I don't want to just put transaction fees on things but if you you know find that feature useful so if you find the feature of hey I want to send money in in an hour or a day or a week useful you know paying a really really small transaction fee for that would be awesome and there's a lot of things that smart contracts enable us to do that hopefully will will help not only our business be sustainable but also smart contract developers and other developers in this space help them to have sustainable businesses and keep building awesome things it's sort of like scheduling payments or something like that like if you have like Bill Pay but you don't want to pay it until later right exactly so delayed transactions are they can be used for for things like bill pay they can also be used you know let's say that you're on a plane during an IC o---- that you really want to get in on you could schedule that turns not front and be like hey send this transaction during this time there's a lot of different use cases for it but to build it in a decentralized fashion that then kicks out a very small fee back to the person who helps broadcast that transaction that would be really really awesome and it almost be like a little secondary market and it's not necessarily paying out to us it could be paying out to the any people who want to make money sending these delayed transactions which is I think even more remarkable and cooler huh that's sort of like I heard an earlier story I I wrote about these quote-unquote bidding rings that enables people who were for instance like asleep during the gnosis ico to participate is that kind of what you're talking about there yeah exactly so the way that it works in and this is this is like why I love the blockchain right because everything you take this really simple concept of like hey I want someone to send my transaction later and then someone creates this like super fancy smart contract that becomes this centralized way so what these would do is is essentially you decide you want to send a transaction at a certain time you would fill in the details and send all the necessary information and then any party on the internet that was kind of watching for these types of transactions could pick that transaction up and then broadcast it at that time and this could be done like almost automatically so just like almost like mining right like this is not they don't go and like actually manually do the math themselves like the computer just does it it could be set up sort of like that an hour you know my crypto could be one of the people that send these transactions at the specified times but there's also other parties and so you're incentivizing these parties to send the transactions for these people and at the end of the day everyone wins and and it's decentralized I just think it's the coolest thing yeah yeah I thought that was an interesting detail when I reported that um you've also said in other interviews that you hate initial coin offerings why I do and you know I have to I have to like remember to like balance it because it's not that I hate the concept of them like I think that just like everything in this decentralized future land they are there they're perfect in the sense that you allow this decentralized crowdfunding mechanism to reward people who are building things the reason I hate them in their current form is that most of these projects are raising far too much money with far too little work and really the greed is overpowering but also just like the really just flat-out scammers and fraudulent icos and so while I'm a huge fan of say like the gnosis team the golem team the status team like you know these these I SEOs like I think that they have good intentions and they want the best for the ecosystem a lot of what we saw in 2017 was just flat-out scams and that's where that's where my hatred comes from it's just people taking advantage of other people for really no reason except for money yeah as a reporter I also saw how much the space changed in that fashion and it was also really disheartening and what's the word disgusting frankly but anyway you've also said and other interviews that it was quote-unquote not in the game plan to run a company ever which I thought was pretty funny and you also said you'd never been an employee before and that you don't even know what it's like to be an employee so how did you learn how to run a company and how like what principles are you using to guide yourself so I'm definitely flying by the seat of my pants I definitely look I listen to the feedback from my team more than anything else I talked to other people who've run companies but at the end of the day it's a lot easier to make decisions on what is best for my team by just asking them hey what do you guys think is best for you and it's really quite interesting because I think that in a lot of traditional businesses like my dad for example was laughing at me when I told them this because he was like he just couldn't fathom asking the people who who work for him what they think is best for like you know for the company but I really rely on the people around me and especially my team to sort of guide me and tell me tell me things like hey what benefits are valuable to you for example you know would you rather be a contractor and an employee you know how do i incentivize you how do I make you happy and they're really best suited to answer those questions and then for you know in terms of like making hard decisions and figuring out the long term right how do I make this a sustainable business how do I make this not something that is gonna fail in a couple of years how do I make this so I can rely on it for income but also everyone that's now relying on it you know the the team how can they rely on it how can we be sure that it can be relied on those types of questions I am just so fortunate to have a number of key people around me that have given me advice who've watched people do things right they watch the people think do things wrong and they're very willing to share all of those experiences with me and I would say that my dad is like one of my biggest fans and he has such an immense amount of experience that I draw from talking to my dad is such a great reminder that at the end of the day we're all humans and that regardless of all the things that were disrupting the lessons we can learn about how to be better and how to be more responsible and how to be more efficient and how to be more effective in what we're trying to do those are all Universal things it doesn't matter whether you're running a traditional company a blockchain company a decentralized company none of that matters you know we're all humans were all you know we're all kind of driven by the same sorts of things and if you get to the to the you know sort of the core of what people need and what people want whether that's people on your team or just users of your product or whatever if you can understand that you're going to be in a good position and it's just finding out how to balance those different needs and desires to make it work for everyone that's the hard part but it's it's really important to keep that in mind that you know we are all at the end of the day the same and trying to do the same sorts of things you know and incentivize those those quote good behaviors I guess and so this sort of leads us into the little controversy that occurred when you moved over to my crypto which is that I guess you changed that my ether wallet Twitter handle to my crypto and then after there was an outcry over this you reversed course and gave the Twitter handle back to my either wallet so why did you keep the Twitter handle initially and then why did you give it back and launch a new one right and this is I have to be careful here so I'm going to do the best I can but you know as I as I spoke about earlier you know key beats nuke during you know mid 2017 and ICO madness really just wasn't involved in the day-to-day anymore and so you know as we were trying to get this company situated as we were trying to figure out the best path forward we're trying to work with him we were trying to figure out really any solution we could you know I I didn't I was able to sort of let a lot of my personal and emotional attachment to the to the my ether wallet brand and the Mew like the muley go in order to make some really really tough decisions but I really just never felt comfortable giving the Twitter to someone that wasn't going to use it and that was really really impart of my greatest fear was like we tweet every single day about security issues whether it's related to aetherium or the larger blockchain space or even like the specter attacks and and what people should do to be safe about those and things like that and it was our assumption not because he had never tweeted before that would continue when he did decide that hey I am going to tweet and I am gonna be involved and I am gonna try to do things then I really had a much I really didn't have a problem with with giving it back and it was much less about the backlash although people were definitely very very upset and I definitely heard them loud and very very loud and clear you know but it was really like you know okay if you can if you can you know be dedicated to this and say that you're gonna keep these people informed you know then okay yeah like go for it keep being that my ether wallet keep doing what I've been doing for the last three years go for it you know and obviously every single day of my life is a learning experience and this has been you know one of the biggest biggest learning experiences and really just felt a lot of hard decisions and I definitely am NOT I do not delude myself into thinking I'm always right I am most certainly not right and I do not handle things right a lot of the time so I'm doing my best self so this is a question that has less to do with my crypto and my either wallet and I get asked this sort of question a lot and it can be a little bit annoying but it's also important to bring up these questions to get the perspectives of people like you and me how do you view being a woman in crypto do you think we need more women in the space and if so how do we get more women like what what's your take on on being what is perceived as a minority in the space you know I definitely how I say this I definitely there's days that I feel very sort of alone being a woman in this space and there's definitely days like the you know during the transition from my ether-wall it to my crypto some of the choices we made like the Twitter I definitely really felt my my womanís it was front and center during a lot of the comments on Reddit and Twitter and it's like really just that blatant sort of misogyny that otherwise is pretty rare or much more subtle at least so I don't want to like bring up something unpleasant but just for people to understand what that's like to be on the receiving end of that like can you give us an example of some comments oh yeah I mean it's not necessarily like any one comment but it's just like a flood I have like over 500 reddit messages I have like over 200 Twitter diems and they're just all you know you're a woman you'll never make the right decisions ever give back the flippin Twitter you know they'll use words like horror and [ __ ] and [ __ ] they'll say that I'm not as like just inherently because I am a woman not equipped to run a company or do anything really a lot of name-calling and a lot of really just like putting putting me on blast not for my choices which I actually don't have as big of a problem with if you want to say that you think that I did something wrong or I made the wrong choice but because I'm a woman that's what caused me to make that choice and that's what's wrong with me that's when I get really it hits me the hardest I think is like I'm like okay if I was a man and I made this choice like that would be the you know what you perceived to be the wrong choice that's fine tell me that like okay but don't tell me that I made that choice because I'm an emotional woman that's on my period like that's just you know it's absurd it's hateful it's it's disgusting yeah okay so to get back to the original question of how do we get more women in this space and you know don't names so I think that you know I will say that for the most part in the space I have I've experienced very little just like the outward hatred comments that are just talking about right like that's that's a pretty rare occurrence and really limited to when you're making hard controversial decisions and that's fine to get more women the space though I think that we just need to encourage more women and I think that everyone sort of needs to get on board with with acknowledging that more diversity and you know I like I like the word diversity more than just like women because it really is it's not just women it's it's everyone that's a minority in the space everyone just needs to acknowledge that there are minorities there are people whose views are not being you know heard or seen or you know being used to build products and I think one of the most important things about having diversity when building products is the you know with more diversity comes more experiences it becomes it's more perspectives it's more it's different solutions to prod to problems it's all of these different things that you know if you only have one type of person or one person's background you're limited by the potential solutions that you can come up with and you know earlier I was talking about how I you know it was really easy for me to make decisions early on because I was essentially the user of my ether wallet when I was building or making a choice as long as I understood it it was probably okay because the user would understand it today that's not that's not the case and so having more women but also having people from different like different cultures different societies different upbringings different age demographics those are all going to make every product stronger and everyone's experience better and I think that in order to get that we have to all acknowledge that first and that's one of the biggest problems I see right now is that people are saying oh it's not a problem that there's there's such a lack of diversity here you know that's the biggest problem it's not you know it's that people think that it's not an issue and it is an issue you know having only one perspective is going to limit the potential of any one product or any one solution or anyone anything - you know replace the the financial system that we all you know are fighting against right now yeah I agree with a lot of what you're saying here so I have a lot more to add on this but we're running out of time and I want to ask you another super super important and more practical or not more practical but but just I guess more nuts and bolts question what is your advice for what people should do to not lose their crypto that's an excellent question I think that my best advice is to take it slow and that means when you make the choice to invest or dive in or fall down the rabbit hole or however you want to describe it go as slow as you can and maybe start with ten dollars maybe start with fifty dollars you know and kind of go through the steps and so whether that's making the purchase on coin base and then moving to my crypto whether that's making a token transaction with shape-shift regardless of what you're trying to accomplish if you start with a little amount you can kind of go through and experience the whole thing and if something goes wrong it's not the end of the world and that's a good thing so you know I think that for me personally I wasn't really comfortable with a lot of the things on the blockchain until I had done it over and over and over again but what sucks is that you know we're seeing people that are diving in so deeply with so much money that when they do make a mistake which is is a pretty common thing I think we've all made mistakes they're doing so with a lot of money and a lot more money than they can afford to lose and I think that's the key here is is start small and don't lose more than you can afford to lose I agree with all of that advice that's great advice although nothing we say on the podcast is financial advice okay so it's been great having you as a guest Taylor where can people get in touch with you or see more of your work yeah I mean if you go to my crypto comm at the very bottom in the
