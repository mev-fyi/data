island ventures and co-founder and chairman of coinmetrics welcome nick thanks laura it's a pleasure to be here again one month ago bitcoin was at about eleven thousand five hundred dollars and today it's flirting with eighteen thousand dollars and it even went as high as eighteen thousand four hundred dollars on wednesday based on that high there have only been four days in bitcoin's history when the price was higher and yet back then that um increase was fueled by the initial coin offering craze and this breathless media coverage and this time around there's a lot less fanfare barely anyone is talking about it so what would you say makes this increase in the price different from what we saw in late 2017 and early 2018 yeah there's a few things that are completely different this time around um endogenously the markets the structure of the market is totally different and the market infrastructure has evolved and changed dramatically that's obviously our focus as a fund is financial market infrastructure and i can tell you that it is completely different this time around it's much more mature it's more sophisticated uh there's just more financial products available and there's more tools that qualified accredited and larger investors can use to get exposure so that's you know that's one side which is just uh practically and infrastructurally speaking it's easier to get exposure to the market today um and you know that looks a lot more mature and just generally speaking the financial plumbing is is more functional this time around and then of course extrinsically you have real macroeconomic tailwinds which are driving serious alligators towards allocators sorry towards the asset and alligators uh you know real names in commodity investing the hedge fund world global macro names uh who obviously we've heard them expressing a positive view of the price that latter element probably gets a little bit more attention but i'd say the former those endogenous factors also very critical i can't say that our current appreciation or rally is directly attributable to that but it certainly means that we have the capacity to onboard much more capital in a you know shorter period of time and then the other thing that i would mention as you say is that bitcoin was kind of being used as a flow-through asset for retail investors primarily to get exposure to icos onto tokens and to trade sort of long-tail assets on some of these offshore exchanges and bitcoin was their entrance into the market so a lot of the allocation of bitcoin was really transient and that's partly why i think we saw so much reflexivity in the price and its rally was not very enduring back in 2017. now of course the backdrop is different there's less mania there's fewer new tokens launching there's i think the regulators are generally discouraging people from launching new icos in the manner that they did in 2017 and so bitcoin isn't really being used in that capacity anymore so you know it's easy to look at the price chart and you know c passes prologue you know what's different today i think if you look a little bit deeper you look at the nature of the market it really is dramatically different so you did briefly mention the pandemic and i'm sure this is kind of hard to quantify but i just wondered you know how big do you think the impact of the pandemic has been on the rise of the bitcoin price this year well i wouldn't say directly affected it uh but indirectly for sure i mean first of all bitcoin is kind of a dematerialized uh natively digital asset uh like a lot of those tech companies that are very sort of capital light that did very well uh during the sort of pandemic era i'd say bitcoin also benefited from that uh in terms of it you know this physical infrastructure but it's completely distributed it doesn't really rely it's not interfered with by the pandemic directly uh and and then you know on a more direct basis i would say the reaction of central banks to the crisis is probably the big phenomenon that's fueling bitcoin here uh we're seeing and people like to say unprecedented but really unprecedented monetary action some would say the sort of degeneration of the the current sort of monetary orthodoxy m1 that measure of the money supply in the us is growing at 40 percent annualized right now so we're seeing the monetary aggregates skyrocket and more so than that because you know quantitative easing and money issuance it doesn't necessarily have an impact on cpi or prices in the real economy but we are seeing calls for more direct stimulus directly into the economy which would presumably be more inflationary in nature which would make it into the real economy which is was not the case with you know previous bounce of qe so if that is the case if we have another six or 12 months of sort of lockdown i think we could really start to see a political demand for direct issuance you know is issued in a kind of a fiscal capacity and many believe that that could be you know natively more inflationary and of course as a hard asset and an asset with no monetary discretion bitcoin is something that people look to uh as an alternative in that circumstance so it really remains to be determined whether it get inflation or not but certainly the specter of inflation is looming and i think that's part of the reason uh people are taking bitcoin seriously this time around yeah i think that was one of the exact um factors that michael saylor of microstrategy identified when he said that the company had chosen to allocate its capital into bitcoin um you know he talked about how the dollar was just losing value um sitting there so you wrote up a post this week detailing how bitcoin is at um all-time highs in certain metrics like nine different metrics um so why don't we look at some of them one of the first ones that you looked at was addresses with a balance of 10 million or more and currently i guess it's at about 18 million versus about 14 million at the peak of the bubble in 2017-2018 so what do you what does that say to you like why is this a significant metric yeah this is an on-chain metric so we're looking at the distribution of addresses on bitcoin's ledger directly and of course it's not a perfect proxy for human beings uh i can have multiple addresses on chain or you could have multiple people that are clustered around a single address because exchanges aggregate um individuals and they hold their balances in omnibus accounts uh but this metric i just defined it uh to look at the number of addresses on bitcoin with at least ten dollars worth of bitcoin and that was really it uh and it's a it's a measure of dispersion it shows you effectively the trend in terms of the distribution uh it doesn't tell you precisely how many individuals have ten dollars worth of bitcoin because you have to look at exchanges for that people treat exchanges like banks but i would say what this tells me is today as compared with 2017 fundamentally there are more people worldwide that own bitcoin and there's other less high frequency metrics that you can look to to ascertain this you know you look at the cambridge alternative finance study they did a survey methodology they asked exchanges how many kyc users they have metrics like that also show growth today so just fundamentally there's more people that own bitcoin today the addressable market is bigger and there's another on-chain metric you looked at that's pretty interesting it's called realized capitalization can you define that and tell us what you see when you look at that metric how it's changed over time yeah this is a metric i introduced in 2018 and surprisingly actually really caught on in the industry um so basically it takes advantage of bitcoin's transparency uh on the ledger and it prices every unit of bitcoin at the time when it last transacted so if it last transacted in 2009 it's gonna get a zero price right so it's kind of a liquidity adjusted market cap and i almost prefer it to market cap because it really takes into account the current trend conditions of the chain and the intuition is if we're trading and transacting bitcoin eventually one of us is going to settle that transaction on chain and now that doesn't necessarily hold for every transaction it's a rough heuristic so if you run these numbers you get something that sort of resembles the aggregate cost basis for all bitcoin holders and this is well well above the highs or the threshold that it met in 2017 in the prior bull run so what this tells me is that bitcoiners have a higher aggregate cost base than they've ever had before effectively bitcoin is more liquid at these levels than it ever was before and so this this shows you know a significant all-time high relative to late 2017. but but it also maybe indicates that there's less desire to sell at this moment than there was in the previous bubble quite possibly because you might say if someone has a very low cost basis they're inclined to sell out at any moment um whereas if you have a cost basis that's maybe closer to today's unit price you might want to be a little bit more patient wait for some more appreciation in a moment we'll also discuss derivatives in bitcoin but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible crypto.com the crypto super app that lets you buy earn and spend crypto all in one place earn up to 8.5 per year on your btc download the krypto.com app now to see the interest rates you

crypto.com app back to my conversation with nick carter so another metric you looked at was open interest on cme bitcoin futures which has averaged 330 million dollars this week but actually surpassed um but but this week surpassed 1 billion what does open interest mean and why did you think this number was significant yeah open interest just refers to the nominal value of all the outstanding unsettled futures contracts and effectively we're at all-time high or close to all-time highs for that product and it's significant for a number of reasons the cme is i believe the largest derivatives exchange in the world and it trades in all number of asset classes uh they added bitcoin at the precise peak of the last bubble the precise day i believe it was december 16th or 17th 2017 that they added support for that product and some attribute the birth of that cme bitcoin's futures product to the subsequent decline in bitcoin's price i don't have a view on that but the cme is distinct because it is innately connected into the sort of legacy or traditional financial plumbing and it's very easy to get exposure to it uh if you're sort of a more sort of regulated entity um and you really care about your counterparty risk and you maybe don't necessarily trust crypto exchanges necessarily uh so it's in exchange that for instance rentec when they did their disclosure about potentially allocating a bitcoin they said they were going to look at the cash settled cme bitcoin futures product so the more liquid it gets the better the prospects are for some of those allocators that are maybe a little bit nervous about transacting with spot bitcoin but they're they're it's much easier for them to um use cme as a counterparty effectively uh and so the more liquid it gets uh the better that is i would say for bitcoin uh the more capacity it has to take on those allocators now a lot of people say that these cash settled futures don't have any relationship to bitcoin's price i would contest that thoroughly the market makers that are taking the other sides of those trades on cme futures are also interacting with spot so there definitely is a connection to spot bitcoin price so just want to get ahead of that critique um so generally speaking uh the other thing is um the you know cme is considered to be a highly reputable exchange the more prevalence it has probably the more assuaged the scc is in terms of their critiques around the barriers to a bitcoin etf and as some of these other offshore futures exchanges or derivatives exchanges face trouble obviously we saw what happened to bit max the cme is getting more and more influential in terms of bitcoin price formation this is an onshore exchange has surveillance sharing it has all of that infrastructure that makes the sec very comfortable and so the more influential it gets i think the better the prospects look for an etf which you know clearly would be an enormous catalyst for bitcoin oh yeah definitely and i know people are talking about how now that sec chairman jay clayton is stepping down that that could also um be a green light for an eventual bitcoin etf um so just back to some of the different metrics that you looked at a related one was the bitcoin options open interest and that is currently at about 3.5 billion compared to just about 100 million at the end of 2018. um can you define what that is and explain why that growth is so significant it's a similar measure to the future as it's the nominal value of all the outstanding options contracts that are open at a single point in time and options in bitcoin are still very small uh ultimately but the fact that they exist at all is quite useful it gives traders more creative ways to express a view on bitcoin um and so it means that bitcoin can just accommodate more capital and more sort of complex opinions about the asset you know before we had secondary lending and bitcoin before we had these peer-to-peer credit marketplaces um you couldn't even short bitcoin the only opinion you could have of the asset was long and then later on that emerged but you couldn't bet on volatility now that you have options you don't have to take a directional bet on the unit price you can bet on whether you think we're going to have a high volatility epic or not so that is just something that you know broadens the addressable universe of entities that might be interested in taking a perspective on bitcoin uh so you know the other thing would be uh commodity producers of the asset the miners themselves they absolutely take advantage of options they're consumers of that financial product this is one of the reasons why these things exist it's not just for speculation they actually derive a real benefit from it they can hedge out some of their risk if you think about what an asic is an asic is a bundle of call options uh that depreciates over some given period maybe it's 24 months so they might want to hedge out some of their exposure to the sort of future cash flows that they would get from that they can do that with options so i would say just generally options um are potentially forced for stability actually in the underlying asset you also looked at bitcoin priced in turkish lira which might seem a little bit random to most people um back in 2017 2018 bitcoin hit a high of 80 000 lira and now the price um of bitcoin and lira is at 129 000. so why do you why did you decide to call out this metric yeah and you know i didn't really want to you know specifically point to turkey as a case study for bitcoin or anything um but turkey's in the midst of a currency crisis uh and there actually is a very vibrant uh bitcoin ecosystem in turkey if you look at these on the ground metrics tracking adoption treat analysis has had some really good studies on this turkey is you know typically in the top 15 countries globally in terms of aggregate crypto attention uh whether you're looking at flows on chain you can exchange volumes web visits to exchanges so turkey does have uh structurally fairly high um you know enthusiasm for bitcoin but really the point i was making here is that we all look at the bitcoin price in dollar terms but the dollar is not the savings device that actually most people globally are using most people have to save in their local currencies they don't have exposure to dollars through their local banking systems and so i wanted to point out that there's a number of currencies where bitcoin is already trading at all-time highs because those currencies are depreciating that's not just the turkish lira you have a currency crisis in lebanon bitcoin's at an all-time high in the brazilian real the argentine peso obviously the venezuelan bolivar a number of these other currencies are also depreciating which is another way of showing bitcoin's resilience and strength as an asset even if it's not yet at an all-time high in dollar terms it is in a number of currencies that hundreds and hundreds of millions of people worldwide are forced to use so this demonstrates its value proposition in a slightly different way so we're not going to get to look at every metric you covered in your post but one of the ones that was pretty interesting was how different the world looked in terms of stable coins back in 2017 2018 versus now here we have about 23 23 billion dollars worth of stable coins whereas the last time bitcoin reached these prices we only had about 1.5 billion dollars worth so what does that say to you yeah and this is one of the trickiest metrics right because certain outsiders will point to the growth in stable coins and say well those stable coins are just being issued unbacked and somehow that's causing the price of bitcoin to increase i think that's been pretty firmly rebutted by some academics that have actually looked at the question and then also rebutted by the fact that you know in 2018-19 bitcoin was effectively flat for a long period um whereas you know the supply of stable coins increased by about 10 billion uh or so so um you know if stable coins had this buoyant effect on bitcoin structurally we would have seen it in that period uh but i think generally stable coins are useful for bitcoin because they enable crypto native firms to de-risk their exposure without exiting to fiat so it kind of traps capital in the ecosystem we never really see people redeem stable coins they create stable coins so they convert commercial bank dollars into tokenized crypto dollars and then they use that as they will either for working capital and stable coin format or they use it you know to access crypto assets like bitcoin but they don't exit the system so the cap it's like hotel california the capital stays within crypto land and some of that stable coin issuance is definitely dry powder for accessing crypto it i think it just generally enhances the liquidity profile of the entire industry it makes it more integrated and so the other thing would be as more people get used to and maybe this is their first experience with a natively digital asset it's a stable coin that can then be the on-ramp for um you know state independent monetary assets like bitcoin so i think it's uh it can be sort of a gateway drug so to speak so i'm firmly in the camp of stable coins being generally mutualistic with bitcoin albeit not in this direct price accretive way and one last quick question i did see some um theories i guess one particularly purported by coindesk in an article saying that chinese miners have been having a hard time selling the bitcoin they've been mining and that's part of the reason that we've seen this rise in price i did see some other people disputing this on crypto twitter um and i wondered what you thought of that theory if you're you know seeing anything in the metrics you guys track at coinmetrix yeah it's it's a great question i did see that uh splattered all over crypto twitter as a potential explanation for the rally of course we can never know precisely what i would be skeptical of these very neat explanations for a rally i remember there were lots of convenient explanations for the rally in 2017 which didn't necessarily hold water in the end and even in 2014 with gox people ascribe that to willy bot um you know there's always gonna there's always a market for very simple convenient explanations uh for rallies um i don't know if that necessary tracks to the truth that correctly i asked the team at coinmetrix to look into this uh they showed me a chart i can't uh you know depict it for you right now maybe we can flash it up on the screen um you know tracking what mining what miners are doing what mining pools are doing um what we're really seeing is actually uh mining pools are selling progressively and there was no interruption from the okay exchange um you know uh stopping service or or borrowing withdrawals so we didn't really see a correlation in any of those metrics between ok x and minor activity it seemed it seems pretty much normal uh the other way i would caution people ascribing a lot of faith to this theory would be you know um the coinbase reward is is fairly low i think it's about one percent uh you know annualized uh if inflation or issuance um you know i would look at you know the rest of the supply that you know new mined coins are not the only coins that are available to be sold on the market you have all of the other existing coins that are on exchanges held in you know hardware wallets and so on uh you know probably about 40 to 60 percent of bitcoin's supply is liquid in a given year right so people tend to over index on what the miners are doing and sometimes forget that there's a whole other world of bitcoins that are liquid and available to market yeah yeah that makes a lot of sense and especially now with pressure from perhaps new buyers at paypal that could also be it or some of these institutional people that are getting interested finally all right well thanks so much for coming on unconfirmed thanks for having me laura don't forget next up is the weekly news recap [Music] thanks
