hi everybody welcome to the chopping block every couple weeks the usually four but currently three of us get together and give the industry insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day so quick intros first up we've got tom the d5 maven and master of memes next we've got taroun the giga brain and grand pub gauntlet there's me haseeb i'm head hype man of dragonfly and special guest today we have joining us kevin joe king of the shorts and co-founder of galway capital welcome kevin glad to have you yeah glad to be here and i you know i'm i'm actually uh pretty happy that you got me a nickname too you know i feel like this is like this is like the crypto version of like the all-in podcast or something you know everybody got a nickname you know it's great we're we're aiming for that we're waiting for the allen podcast to be the the normie version of the chopping board that's good i mean we don't have the crazy rhymes that have been happening on the all-in podcast i randomly listed it recently and they have these like haikus now for everyone they went from just like nickname to like these like long haikus how does jason come up with all this stuff i mean his staff is hard at work or something huh his staff is working hard like he must just be hiring like people from like comedies i don't know what our staff is doing they should be they should be writing intros for me why aren't you at the all-in summit yeah i thought you're gonna be taking notes and catching up with jason and uh asking for some feedback on the show but you're missing out i i i've been too busy with permissionless man i couldn't uh kind of split my time kevin just as a if there's ever a chopping block summit of course you know all guests have oh that's wonderful definitely i'm speaking on behalf of haseeb who probably never even thought about this concept until well obviously taron is going to be organizing it so i appreciate you being the one to bring it up so just quick caveat the four of us well the three of us are early stage investors and crypto kevin is not quite as early as we are he tends to do more of the public market stuff but i want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice or legal advice or even life advice so uh holy kevin you are now the uh the soothsayer of crypto i saw that your your story on bloomberg you're covered in odd lots and your story on bloomberg i saw as of uh this morning was the most viewed story on bloomberg the man who called the tara usd downfall or something like that yeah no i i definitely appreciated the the time that they gave me on on the podcast but i mean you know those are some big shoes to fill i mean it's a bit sensationalist so uh maybe we can get into all that but uh you know it's been speaking of sensational yeah okay well i i think you've managed to do a good job of building these sensationalism yourself i have a theory that you were featured in all the media because you're the only non-anon who was like really loud about this yeah i think that's the case it'd be hard to have like the picture of like some anime picture you know just uh some you know the folks on wall street they're not gonna make heads or tails of that you know it's gonna be uh too confusing for them yeah yeah so if so for those who have been uh asleep at the wheel for the last couple weeks we should probably give a recap of what happened the big news of the week has been the collapse of tara sarah for those who are unaware it's a layer one blockchain built on cosmos and the core the core asset of terra is a stable coin called ust and essentially on i think it was may 9th over the weekend and kind of going into monday the terra ust stable coins peg broke the market was more broadly declining due to some uh macro events that were going on uh fear about interest rates and as the the price of terra started declining price of luna which is the kind of core layer one asset that backs the ust started declining in price uh the usd peg broke and one thing led to another the there was basically what we call a death spiral meaning that as the peg lowered the confidence in the system lowered even further there was more and more algorithmic minting of luna and expansion and supply of luna which resulted eventually in luna hyperinflation over the period of that time uh luna ended up expanding its supply by 18 000 times it basically underwent a zimbabwe style hyperinflation event ust ended up cratering to something on like 20 cents or less on the peg um i don't know what it's trading at now it and we saw within the course of a week the first time i've ever seen this in crypto an asset dropped 100.0 percent on in terms of the unit price on coin market cap literally the price had gotten so low that from the high of 60 before the unwind tara ended up cratering to fractions of a penny such that it had to get delisted from all the major exchanges nobody no the major exchanges anymore trade terra terra is now considering rebooting the blockchain finding some way to create what they call it's now being called terra 2 or some some new version of terrace or said the old version could be called terra classic and there'll be a new version the uh dokuan has has claimed that this is going to be um a way to revive the community even if the stable coin itself is no longer viable the community that's been building on luna can still be salvaged so it's been a catastrophic event for crypto it caused a broader decline in crypto prices and um is is one of the most catastrophic events that we have seen in a single crypto asset since maybe bit connect which was uh you know a ponzi scheme that unwound in 2018. there's been a lot said already about this but you know obviously kevin part of the reason why we're bringing you on is that you were one of the early folks warning about the insolvency of ust and that the perception at the time so just to give give people a sense of what was going on at that time terra before going into all this um going into its its calamitous collapse before that point the usg was collateralized by luna and luna the market cap of luna was at the height about 30 billion um at the time of the market downtown it was maybe only about 20 billion and the total supply of ust was you know on the order of about you know i think 14 billion total ust and so the perception was and the other thing is that uh terraform labs spun up a foundation called uh the luna foundation guard which was tasked with buying up a bunch of bitcoin to use it to defend the peg so there were billions of dollars about three billion dollars worth of bitcoin at that time that was supposed to be earmarked to defend the peg the perception from the terror community was that this thing was ironclad and you under your uh your firm's name galawa capital have been basically the gadfly for crypto twitter uh one of a few gadflys we're out there saying this thing is is already insolvent this thing in the moment of a downturn this thing is going to totally collapse um so i'd love to hear from you give us your perception of of the story like what the the preamble what it was like for you seeing this thing trade down and your your reflections on uh the whole event yeah definitely um so you know i think you know when i guess to start uh we first came across tara in the like the very early days when they were just like you know raising seed funding and you know series a and they were just building the project and you know i thought it was just going to be one of these uh you know staple coins that you know probably didn't work but probably would have a quick death and you know peter out at some point um and then you know sometime around uh really late uh last year uh you know december and then early jan uh of this year you know just kind of dawned on me that wait a second like this thing's like a top ten coin like why did this thing not uh already unwind right so then i started looking more heavily into it along with the team here um you know and you know i thought you know maybe there was something that we overlooked uh maybe they made some changes to it maybe it actually does work right so you know we looked into the mechanics and it was basically exactly as as we thought it was and uh you know i just didn't think that it was solvent and i thought that you know it's crazy that it got to this kind of size because you know this was kind of on the back of the collapse of uh wonderland time right because of the whole sifu drama and that already had some minor contagion i mean the space generally survived out of it it wasn't that bad uh but you know at the end of the day there was some you know contagion over to like spell and mim and even a tiny bit of contagion over to like anchor ust and luna right and then i looked at this thing and i thought well this thing is like you know an ordered magnitude bigger maybe even bigger than that and uh you know this could cause some serious damage so i went on twitter i started trying to sound the alarm i met with a lot of uh negativity you know all these lunatics um who are in support of it you know i was you know what's funny i was trying to help them i was trying to tell them you know beware and then they're just ragging on me constantly um to be clear lunatic is the moniker of people in the lunar community uh yeah exactly and i gotta give them credit for i think it's great marketing because if you give a name to your army right which i think maybe they learned from the k-pop groups right so you know you got your you got your uh bts army you got your blinks right and now you know it's bleeding over a crypto you got your link marines xrp army and the lunatics i think it's really smart for them to have done that uh but that being said you know they they do start to display some kind of mob and uh cult-like behavior and i'm basically just getting you know just completely yelled at and you know flamed on twitter but you know fortunately for me i come from a competitive gaming background so i've literally been called a probably tens of thousands maybe hundreds of thousands of times so it doesn't really affect me so you know i just kept sounding the alarm met with a lot of resistance uh but i think you know over time uh there were a few minds that were changed maybe not too many but there were a few and there were also others you know on twitter that were also sounding the alarm and i think over time i think our faction grew and i think everybody when they really carefully studied the mechanics i think they came to the same conclusions that we did and i think you could arrive at that conclusion from many different ways you can you know look at the actual mechanics you can reason by uh you know uh deduction right you can uh look at history i mean there's so many ways to kind of arrive at the same result and i think that's kind of what happened so that finally when there was this kind of situation where there was you know this exogenous shock of the equity markets just tanking and you know crypto being correlated with equities uh then everybody was kind of trigger ready i think to make that move and you know i think some of it i mean maybe the trigger itself you know this this selling of 85 million into into three pool uh ust maybe that might have even been an accident right maybe it was just that everybody was already kind of skittish and then somebody didn't know that the liquidity migration was gonna happen between three pool and four pool so you know they saw liquidity evaporate and they were like they don't know what's going on so i'm like oh let's just get rid of it and then that just caused the stampede you know i think there's a lot of conspiracy theories out there right now about like blackrock or citadel or this was an attack i mean i don't know if it's an attack it could have just been a mistake or could have been an accident for whatever reason there was some initial trigger of fear and then there was like a fear cascade and and sort of like this you know the fear just kind of spread out and then it just it was all over for them basically yeah it's it's been disappointing to see i mean not surprising but disappointing to see the amount of conspiratorial thinking that's gone into trying to explain what happened with ust right at the end of the day we know what happened which is exactly what you described which is that people got scared and a reflexive death loop started and you know what is the particular catalyst i mean you know we were talking about this internally that like it doesn't really matter who started it doesn't matter who shot the first bullet you know what matters is that this thing was going to break out into violence and the the responsibility of making sure that doesn't happen falls to the protocol and ultimately whoever it was and you know maybe it was a group of people maybe it was a fund maybe it wasn't it was almost certainly not black rocker citadel i mean that's ridiculous like it's all it's it's never going to be like an obvious villain that you can name and identify and the whole point of crypto is it doesn't matter who it was the whole point of crypto is that we should admire whoever had the insight to realize that this thing was ready to blow and they were the ones who who uh got ahead of it right the whole point of making this stuff open source and easy to understand is that if something is not secure it's going to be broken that is the whole point of crypto that is the argument that we are making of why we're creating a more robust system and so then turn around and say oh it was somebody evil must have done this and it was a it was you know one of these evil trad five firms that didn't want us to be having any fun i just think is is against the whole spirit of crypto yeah it's a lot of the same logic people also use when they try to say oh we should ban flash loans or something like that and uh like they're used in all these different attacks i mean this is literally like the i think bloomberg had an article or the journal had an article out this week talking about how dangerous flash loans are it's like no they're just a tool a tool that is used to sort of accelerate you know the inevitable otherwise only wealthy people are able to like perform these kinds of attacks this similar argument for for you know terra and sort of what happened here well it's it's a sensorious instinct right like whenever markets go down there are calls to ban short selling you know it doesn't matter where you are in the u.s people have banned short selling kevin you're i mean part of what you're well known for is having called it out but i presume also having traded on the uh the downfall of luna i don't know how much you're comfortable sharing but i'd love to know how you played it um yeah so you know i i think um at this point what i can say because i don't want to give out the exact positions until um all of this is over and we still do have some positions open but what i will say is that we were short pretty early on but maybe this was uh may 6th i would say and this is also right after we pulled all of our ust from anchor so we were basically farming it down to the last day and then uh when it when it depends to 0.997 we paid up 30 bips got out of our ust position and then just started shorting luna now that being said in between there was a lot of activity and there were even moments that we were long on local uh bottoms and overall we actually played that uh pretty well though i'd like to joke with the traders that what's funny is that because we you know we we did some of these swing trades um you know just based on sort of like the flows and the short term supply and demand imbalances if we had just held the thing from where we started to where we ended we probably would have made about the same so it wasn't that we did worse but we just caused extra work for ourselves to like sometimes miss out on parts of the down move and then sometimes just actually you know get randomly some parts of the up move um now that being said like most of it was on the short side and we actually did play both luna and ust and there were also some other structural plays that are related tangentially uh which were also very lucrative too i'm curious on the ust part on how you played that because i think that was another one of the common refrains you hear from traders in the market which is there isn't actually a way to trade you know the ust peg and to sort of you know short ust effectively i actually like asto about this when he came on which i'm like why aren't you taking a bet against ust and it's like there's no way to hedge it uh i'm curious if you don't mind sharing how you guys sort of thought about playing ust or is it just sort of this anchor year trade that you mentioned yeah i mean there are actually ways to to trade ust i mean there's certain books out there uh with with a few exchanges where you can trade ust against other stable coins uh or you know against usd itself so you could short it what i would say is that when the depending is first happening it doesn't really make sense to short ust because they still have a lot of firepower on the reserve that they're going to burn through to defend the peg so you really only want to put on um the ust short after two things the first is that they run out of money to defend it or they just actually give up and want to save the rest of it that's a little bit harder to tell and then the second thing is that you have to pay attention to the redemption and mint mechanism and how much of that how much capacity that has right initially if it's you know 250 mil per day then as long as the outflows of ust to luna is less than that then ust should not peg and ust would only dpeg if it exceeds that kind of demand for swapping between the two now later on they started releasing this gate right and they said okay now we can do a million units of luna per minute and then eventually they release that entirely and just let it go into hyper hyperinflation there was no gate whatsoever all of those things matter and you know one of the things that i felt like we were a bit disadvantaged on uh you know even though we traded this well is that we don't know when these kinds of decisions will be made right it's all up to tfl and lfg and they're inside a war room to decide oh now we're going to change you know the limits on the redemption mint mechanism well that completely affects whether or not you actually want to short luna or ust now i don't want to also spin any conspiracy theories but what i would say is that there's at least the possibility that there were times where they were short their own asset either ust or on the luna side based on the decisions that they were going to make like if they knew that they were going to release the gate then luna is definitely going to spiral and ust is at least going to be somewhat preserved from the all the losses going to the hyperinflation of luna right so in that sense they could have just long ust and shorted luna and just made that kind of relative value play um right before making the announcement make the announcement you know everything rips or or drops and then just close out right so i think there was a lot of information asymmetry not just for us that you know we were disadvantaged a bit but on top of that the general public right like whoever was not an investor who was not part of the inside team didn't know when all of these arbitrary decisions would be made like we didn't we didn't know when they were going to start defending and when they were going to stop defending with the reserves either right and you can see that in within you know sort of on the price chart you can see where they actually uh spent money to defend and where they didn't you know you can see that on the first d-peg okay they you know they put it back to peg or mo you know very close to it and then they let it drop and then they start defending again you know all this kind of stop and go execution for the selling of bitcoin and the reserves to defend the peg i mean whoever had inside knowledge of when that was going to happen very easily could have gotten out of their own ust position they just need to just need to know when that's going to happen dump the ust and when it's not happening you know they could even buy a usd they could even go long ust to dump it later once the peg defense comes back so i just feel like this whole thing was just not very transparent and i think at the end of the day it's the insiders that benefited and it's the general public and i guess people on the other side like me that were a disadvantage so i've i've heard from someone who's very close to lfg that basically it was all dough pulling the lovers and that you know the folks who are around him are also in the dark nobody actually really knew what was happening that day again i don't i don't have a ton of details and right now there's a lot of drama and fingers being pointed about how lfg actually spent the funds and whether or not the funds were actually used to how much of the funds were used to defend the peg in the market versus as you sort of insinuated bailing out insiders who had you know their ust impaired but we don't know and it seems like a clear picture hasn't really emerged yet but it is clear that lfg no longer has the big one they now have i think about 70 million out of the three billion that they previously had on hand they definitely don't have it anymore but how it was spent there there are a lot of questions being asked now i'm pretty sure that they did spend it you know i think they did you know what they're supposed to do with the money it's just that the timing was just very arbitrary so you know whoever the market maker was that they did you know these two market makers that they did this deal with um and dough himself had access to privileged information who's to say the market maker you know i wouldn't say that they just you know otc to themselves you know to get out of ust at the peg i mean i don't think they would be that egregious right but they could still just put it through push through the books right and then you know you just know that in this minute there's just going to be a giant bid wall uh and then you just dump your ust into it you pay up a little bit on the exchange side but you mask a little bit that activity and it's a little bit of like self trading right there right so like that i wouldn't preclude now i don't want to accuse them of doing something that i don't have evidence of but i would like to see the war uh the war room chat logs i would like to see you know some of these things and now you know we don't have a right to that uh you know but at the same time i think for you know for the sake of the space i think and for the sake of their reputation i think it would be nice for them to voluntarily give this up and be willing to uh to show the public that what what had happened yeah so speaking of the space and of reputations so i also i don't i don't want this conversation to be too reductive although it's fascinating the way that you sort of the play-by-play of exactly what happened that day i have to ask kevin one question what's the highest funding rate you paid uh so um i so i'll say that uh that would kind of give away whether or not we were playing during the hyperinflation period and and and we were um but we were very also very cognizant of the funding rate and i think at some point it hit like uh quadruple or quintiple digits um so it would be very expensive now that being said the hyperinflation rate itself i think at the very peak was a doubling of the supply every 18 minutes so you know you can imagine that even extreme amounts of funding probably don't don't you know relatively a still rounding error to just how bad the hyperinflation was um so yeah i don't really want to give away exactly what we're doing during the hyperinflation period but we were definitely active in the market fair enough yeah i mean look obviously from the perspective of a trade sounds like you guys absolutely nailed it but of course you know terra has had much broader consequences through its collapse so i mean not just is it obviously a catastrophic wipeout of a lot of paper wealth that has existed in crypto um it was of course a very attractive investment for a lot of retail investors and there have been a lot of really awful stories about folks who completely lost their net worth especially people in the terror community and even folks who have committed suicide or threatened to commit suicide or who lost you know lost more than they could afford to lose so anytime that something like that happens obviously there's a lot of tragedies underneath the headline of the economic wipeout but of course the other thing that this has done is it's put crypto and defy absolutely center stage uh globally so everybody in the world was talking about this it was the front page of the wall street journal front page of bloomberg there were there were hearings in congress south korea is now talking about also hosting uh holding hearings about what happened with terra and it's pretty clear now that it's going to accelerate a response most likely a regulatory one against stable coins um so how are you guys seeing the overall reaction to the downfall of tara um i guess i can start i mean i think you know i think this was kind of expected you know whenever you have something like this uh where you know 40 50 billion just gets evaporated you know there's going to be some people on the losing end where you know it's going to be devastating for them because maybe they they put in more money than they could have afforded to lose um i would just say that you know at the very least that it happened now rather than later you know if it was um you know 100 billion market cap with 90 billion of bad debt i mean it would have been even more devastating probably more lives would be lost and that being said i would also say that you know there's always some kind of psyops that is going on i have no doubt that there would be people who um you know end their lives because of this but you know maybe not to the extent that it's made out to be because i think there's also a narrative that's been driven you know by uh you know the tfl and lfg in that they just want a little bit less pressure uh from you know the shorts they want a little bit less from you know the people who are who are against them so you know they're trying to spin this narrative that you know they should be you know this people should take it easy you know i think you know there's some there and i think on the regulatory side i think this is bound to happen um you know i think yellen was first saying that she doesn't think that stable coins possess you know some kind of systemic risk to you know the system but then now you know like the uk regulators coming out and saying that they got to regulate this thing more heavily because of what it transpired so i think the response has been a bit mixed but i think it's to be expected i mean this happens with every kind of financial crash in every market there's always this sense of why wasn't there regulation to protect us and i think really for us to be a self-regulating industry i think that entire mindset has to change it really it really comes down to the people who end up on the losing side to stand up and say that actually i want to take accountability for my own financial actions it you know it's not about the regulation that i'm taking personal responsibility right so like if if the people on that side can do that then i think we would all benefit right but i think really i think the the puck is with them now um and less with us right and we have to see what kind of fallout um comes from this i imagine there would be more regulation but i'm hoping that that's not the case yeah this does feel like a very weird scenario in that it was treated or tara was so legitimized you had big name vcs backing it up um the product that produced the stablecoin was extremely extremely attractive to a number of different or a very large number of retail investors as opposed to being concentrated in a small number of people even institutions we were talking about this these like terra spv's the anchor speeds that were floating around arrington had like a uh anchor anchor fund it was just so um pervasive and i think also the end product was supposed to be this stable coin it wasn't like you were speculating on you know uh shiba inu or something like that um it was like supposed to be this really investable product that just ended up you know blowing up um and so in my mind it's very different than a lot of the other crazy uh pumps and crazy speculation that happens in crypto and that it was so legitimized and it was supposed to be so reputable i think the other the thing that in my mind though is that i think you know generally when we talk about regulation it's because of um fraud right somebody you know claims they're going to do something they're lying about it and then we got to them and we try to make sure that that kind of fraud doesn't happen again in this scenario you know everything was very transparent it was very obvious on chain what was happening with respect to anchor ust how the system worked it's not like the lfg said they had billions of dollars in bitcoin and they didn't they did you know maybe they could be more transparent about how they used it but they were uh you know honest about what they did and and so it's it's to an extent it is like how free do you want the market to be i think it would be obviously a huge step backwards if we banned all experimentation around you know different types of financial primitives um and there was you know transparency in this scenario but i don't quite know like how you can design a regulation that protects you know retail investors here well also sort of enabling experimentation to happen that is still transparent and open yeah i definitely agree with that point yeah yeah it's a real it's a really good point you know going into the collapse of tara so you know dragonfly i think we've mentioned this before but we were seat investors into anchor and this was kind of before anchor became what it is or what it was before the collapse of terror right so like anchor just for just a quick way of background anchor was um kind of the principle sink where almost all the ust in existence lived and maybe it's worth doing a bit of exposition just to understand like the build up to the the usg collapse so anchor um got its start as basically a cross-chain staking yield protocol like that's the way that it was pitched is that it's kind of it's like lido ish um but it also has like this sort of money market component so you can put in uh yield bearing assets and you get a yield and the yield gets juiced by um anc token on the uh on the borrower side and the depositors are paid out of a yield reserve right that's the idea it's like you know it's look it's it's not rocket science not you know the the next um you know it's not the next maker now but it's something okay it was a protocol we put in a little bit of money and at the time defi yields were very high so the idea of a protocol that paid 20 yield you know this is in the days of 100 apy you know 75 apy so having 20 guaranteed apy was reasonable right in the early days tara was you know anchor was not growing like gangbusters but then d5 apys declined obviously very significantly apys on stable coins are now sitting south of two percent as this was happening we saw broader decline interest rates terra stood still anchor decided to maintain the exact same interest rate regardless of the broader market environment and what that ended up doing was it made anchor more and more attractive on a relative basis compared to the sort of the risk-free rate and that caused ust demand to balloon almost all the usc existence lived in anchor and so anchor i wrote an article kind of summarizing what happened in the terror episode and the way i described it is that anchor was the cancer at the heart of terror um were it not for anchor and is 20 apy terra would not have blown up in such a catastrophic way it would have grown so large it would it could have at least mediated its own growth in a more in a more market-oriented way so that at least people would have they wouldn't have warped incentives to try to ride this thing as close to the threshold as they possibly could and that's ultimately what anchors incentivized growth i think did the thing that i have been reflecting on this last week is that um so you know on the chopping block before we've talked a lot about terra and anchor and we've we've intimated a bunch of times that we thought it wasn't sustainable and we were worried and whatever but we also you know we brought dough on the show and we kind of you know we were we were very respectful to him and and you know i we've invested into other things on tara we've made three investments uh uh onto the terra platform in our in our front three and kind of the view as vcs and i've actually i talked to some other you know kind of marquee vcs who've told me in the past like dude the risk reward for saying bad things about their ones or about you know big communities is just not in your favor like as an investor your job is to make great investments find great founders um and if you speak negatively about something that you see that you think is not sustainable it's not gonna work one you might be wrong which i mean everybody in crypto has had that experience of thinking something wasn't gonna work and you were totally wrong and then second is that even if you're right what's the upside right even if you're right like okay maybe you get celebrated maybe you pulled on some podcast but mostly you just alienated a bunch of people um for the two things that don't break or that for the two years until ust actually explodes uh you end up looking like an and just pissing off a bunch of people and getting you know flamed and so you know it got me thinking a lot because as a you know i think about somebody like uh like eric wall or something like hasu or somebody like yourself who you know you guys are not vcs and as a result you can kind of be more transparent right if you if you see something you think is your incentives are just like why not just say this eric is a vc i'm sorry to be clear eric you you also do make uh early stage vc investments but your most of your trade is not um simping to entrepreneurs the way it is for you know a lot of a lot of the rest of us and so the question that i keep thinking about is like what could and should we have done differently because in private we talked all sorts of about usd you know and and when we when we look at what we want to invest into and we are you know we get pitches all the time for things that are built on terra and things that that touch ust pretty much everybody internally at dragonfly our internal conversations have always been that this thing is not this thing's going to collapse this thing is not sustainable we didn't go out picking fights tweeting at people blaming the doe and you know obviously doe didn't make it easy because of how aggressive he was toward anybody who would impugn him on on twitter don't forget though this show did did come up with the moniker that tied stable coins to ted kaczynski so we did we did we talked a lot of about no we we did we talked about i think i talked about basis in particular which is of course the the granddaddy of senior shares wait we didn't talk about the fact that doe invented basis or ran basis cash how much kevin how much do you believe how much do you believe this or do you think that's like sort of circumstantial reporting because i do think the evidence i think it's interesting yeah i've heard i've heard from uh employees within i've heard from employees within tfl yeah and i also want to say that i think it was on this podcast that i first heard the term that tyrone used uh to say about you know some of these algo stable coins they're just like pid controllers you know and i've never used that analogy before but i've adopted it into my own vocabulary i think it was on this show yeah yeah that was the same episode i was i was drunk and decided to call everyone who makes an algorithmic stable coin theodore kadzinsky yeah so it just shows that uh you know in order to overcome the disadvantages of being undiplomatic in the space we just need more alcohol you know and then have these podcasts where you get all the vcs drunk and let's hear what they really have to think about some of these portfolio projects of their own and of other you know of other vcs too for the record being a vc is my second job i just kind of that's why i can be more blunt i can be more blunt that's true that's true well we uh we will be your mouthpiece then uh haseeb you know just whisper me their name and i'll i'll i'll let people know you know just whispering all right so from now on everybody knows galawak capital is saying what i really think so yeah i'm just kidding i'm just kidding i wouldn't do that i think i think one one piece of public service is enough i don't want the heat anymore myself and you know like you said you know i think you don't make any friends being on the short side and if you look at all of our plays from before all of our major plays they're all on the long side um so i think someone else should do it i think i've done my service i think that should be enough hopefully people are not too mad at me you know so it was the who's who of of uh investors uh on that cap table so hopefully people not too mad i try to save everybody money i did i did the best that i could um but there was too much of an echo chamber uh what can you do what what was your favorite dunk that you read over the entire thing that turned out to be obviously maybe false like like of all the dunks in the world right because like you know i would say march through may was twitter filled with people on both sides dunking on each other nonstop i'm sure you were the recipient of 50 of those so like i'm curious like what were your favorite what are your highlights from twitter i i just got dunked on so much by the shill accounts and then you know their strategy was so good too because they would never respond with their main accounts and they would just straight up astroturf with these accounts with like such few followers that i wouldn't get the engagement you know what i mean so they're just like on one hand flaming me and flooding my comments with negativity at the same time not even giving me the engagement for it so you know there was a lot of that i mean there were some people saying like oh you know like do you guys really think you guys really think you guys really think there could be like a dead spiral like how stupid you know and uh oh well they were there there was it was a death spiral after all so you know it was like stuff like that you know i mean two seeds point about being on the short side too stuff does change over time right like you can sort of oh look at the lfg and say oh well they were sort of backing into a you know fractional reserve model and upping the reserve factor over over time um you know sort of as you know racks exist right now which is you know 80 backed by by usdc and is working okay and so it's like you know you can imagine the world they do back into a you know 80 stable coin backed version of luna um or or ust with you know some remaining float back by by their own shares and then it functions okay and then you look like you know an idiot even though maybe at the time you know what you said was actually correct well i mean there's a world of difference between backing something that's correlated with your own death spiral and backing with something that's uncorrelated with it right i mean that's that's why a death spiral is scary because the feedback loop right and that's why i'm saying hey you know things can change over time right you can imagine you know they could also put them some stable coins in the lfg and so it's sort of like your criticisms can be correct the time but market conditions and products can change that is also true and it's something that we reflect on often as entrepreneurs is that or sorry as investors and entrepreneurs is that um you know oftentimes the first pitch that you get for something and the original you know the v1 is a flaming pile of dog  that isn't going to work but they they realize that they put something on the market and it fails it fails almost immediately and they're like huh okay well that didn't work let's iterate let's like learn from that and you end up iteratively backing into a better and better model and learning in real time and that's one of the advantages of crypto is that you can learn in public and sometimes unfortunately you learn with other people's money but you know as long as there's a mutual understanding of okay hey this thing is you know it might not succeed it's fine i think the part of it that gives me the most pause is the degree to which we had very prominent members of the community basically pushing the stuff onto retail and advocating to retail like hey this thing is safe it's super robust like you know to ignore all the naysayers even though we were investors in anchor we were way too mortified to ever tell anybody put money in anchor i mean for us we i mean we didn't put our own money in acre and i think it it you know it is true and tom it's a good counterpoint that like look sometimes things start off not working and it's okay to give people room to figure things out but there was something about the the energy and the i don't know i don't know what the word is i guess the the disdain that the luna community showed for the people who were ultimately trying to critique it that um showed bad faith that resulted in making things worse for themselves and and you know to your point kevin short selling is really important you cannot have price discovery without short sellers and so short sellers although it's much harder to make money short selling than it is to going long because things of crypto obviously as luna did on the way up and down they can they can go up a lot easier than you know you can only make 2x if you short something to zero but if you um assuming you're not using leverage but if you go long you can make 100 extra money and that's why vcs in many ways our jobs is much easier than somebody who's engaged in short selling especially in a market like crypto yeah you know i would say that at least um diplomatically it's very hard to be a short seller you know i actually um you know some of the investors on on their cap table uh good friends of mine you know and i've known him for many years and i remember sometime in december and january literally hitting them up and saying oh by the way at some point i'm going to short this thing so i just want to say sorry ahead of time you know and that's kind of like you know how things are in the space you know it's just like you have when you're long you're long together when you're short you're alone you know and it's just a it's a bit of a tough it's a it's a tough lift i would say just on the social side like how many parties did i not get invited to because i was on the short side right like at least one or two right because i don't know i don't know what the counterfactual is but i imagine just by by the sense of things right just by intuition probably at least one or two right well i i suspect you're gonna be invited to a lot more parties now uh and we we will make sure that you get invited to all our parties well i appreciate that i appreciate that but uh but yeah no i agree i think there's there's a lot of this kind of like echo chamber effect and i think on top of that there is this sense of some of the investors i don't want to say all because i think a lot of them are well intentioned but some of them are in it only for a quick flip so whether they just burn retail and rug them it doesn't really matter to them right and this is something that's a little bit different than in some ways a step back from web 2 vcs where even if they were grifting with like wework they at least had to go through many many years through series d through series e through the softbank round and then through into the public markets right like even if they were doing a grip they couldn't they couldn't just do a quick flip they had to really dedicate themselves to it but i think in crypto because time to liquidity is so quick now the incentives there uh for the founders and for the vcs are really shifting and i think it really comes down to the personality of the people running it to not go the easy route and really and i think in the long run it benefits them even better to actually you know fund something that works like for example like ftx for example right something that's not a quick rift that's an actual business that one day generates great revenues uh deserves to be uh you know valued very highly rather than just you know recycle the money flip it over and over again on on these coins um but it just it really comes down to then further up the waterfall to what the lps want right so like if you were ever to try and build a vc firm where you know you're only going to invest into things that have long-term that you think has long-term value and not purely optimized for financial gain then the lps have to be on the same page that they have to understand that they could do better with their capital elsewhere but almost in a slightly altruistic way i mean i think they'll still make money but in a slightly altruistic way not pure profit maximizing and willing to you know fund a vc like that so it all falls it all you know it all rolls downhill right it all starts from the very top where the capital allocators sit and then all of that kind of culture starts to then um you know every layer down the way uh starts to seep in right so that's kind of what my thought is so so i think actually you're getting to this point that's actually like a cultural point about vc versus trading firms and and you know one of the reasons i think a lot of actually pretty smart people i knew both from tech and from quant trading we're like oh we're gonna build on luna was effectively because of jump and jump sort of pulled the sleight of hand of being trying to be both a vc and a trading firm at the same time uh and effectively that's what led them also to have to try to save uh things at the end but of course i would say like you know there was kind of this duplic duplicity of you know effectively a lot of really smart people were like jump is a place that there are a lot of smart people at they usually do well in normal markets crypto things seems like scam the jumps doing it so like i'll go do something what does jump what what where is jump saying it's a good ecosystem oh tara and maybe solana and okay cool yeah i'll just go make a a d5 protocol on on there i'll quit citadel or i'll quit millennium and like there's a lot of people like this right who like fell for this trap and at the same time jump basically at the had to effectively maintain the peg for everyone else if i if we're for being honest just from from a couple of facts one is they had to run a ton of luna validators because wormhole they had to actually be staked in luna and basically be able to stake in botswana and luna to run the wormhole validators so you know we can see their public addresses from that pretty clearly because there's not that many wormhole validators maybe like 15. and then i think the other thing that's interesting is like trading firm tries to rebrand as a vc because the market structure changed and then sort of ensnared a lot of people who then sort of now are probably out of luck you know how do you feel about that from this perspective of like that's almost even like you know you know you were talking about how lps had to be altruistic here you have actually the opposite you have like the lps which is the training for themselves is actually quite maybe anti antithetical to almost everything not just in the things they're investing in but the things building on top of the thing they're investing in right which is actually you know i think in web 2 land you never see that right there's a reason so when i worked at de shaw they like they had this vc firm that was horrible and failed two sigma not a very good vc firm you can go see and one of the one of the reasons they're not very good is like no one trusts them because they'll kind of rug you and somehow somehow there's a sleight of hand in the saloon of acts 2021 where everyone just kind of like was like oh yeah all the trading firms are great vc investors in our project so how do you feel you know being on the trading side watching that evolution uh and do you think like what do you think the like regression to the mean will be what does it mean that like the trading firms exit doing long term longer term things do you think it you know between almeida and jump i feel like it does they they sort of have both have this kind of impact on the market i think all that i want to hear kevin moses say there's a similar dynamic with ftx and alameda where you know sam is on twitter talking about oh yeah we knew luna was bad we knew it was going to blow up like yeah this thing was everywhere to work and it's like and yet you know you you listed it um and and ust and so it's like you know is there some moral hazard with like you know running an exchange uh having having some um you know say over where you actually want to leave your list on the platform yeah you know i definitely agree with both of your guys's points um maybe just to start i want to say that you know i think the reason that uh there was this slight of hand with jump because i completely agree with you i think trading firms what's there to be said about them their entire job is to make money and they're literally not in the business of losing money or you know being altruistic i mean even if you look at sam who's a very altruistic person um he's really separated that out into effective altruism and then right now earn as much as he can right like you don't ever wanna in many ways in the market handicap yourself while you know you're doing one you know both things badly rather do one thing well and then just funnel all of that into the other thing and do that well too um i think there was a sleight of hand i think it was good uh it was smart of them uh to have kanov uh you know just lead the effort they realized they needed more presence online and they needed to do um some branding and pr and for the most part that was very successful but i think it's all you know everything is just it's a butterfly effect from uh from the prior cycle you know you had 2017 where you had all these quote-unquote crypto vcs that basically rugged retail and then around that time it was when the trading firms were a lot more neutral about things and had not started their vc arms right so you had folks like you know cms you had like three arrows you had all these guys who were on the trading side and they were actually being pretty honest about stuff and you know they're calling stuff out they were not super long biased and then finally when it came to this cycle you know the vcs the crypto vcs had a bit of reputational damage the trading firms didn't they had now had enough money through that cycle to become vcs or they were managing too much money that they couldn't keep things market neutral anymore so they had to go long and then on top of that all of the um all of the newer projects were a lot more centered around defy and financial concepts and they could benefit from both the market making from these trading firms as well as the expertise that these guys had that the vcs did not right so all of a sudden the power in the influence shifted over to these trading firms and then you know through that well then they learn the exact same lessons that the vcs learn which is that it is way better to be on the long side and be together on the long side and do a quick flip and you know you live long enough to see yourself become the villain and i think that's literally what happened with all the trading firms and i think you know it's it's no it's no surprise to me that for every successful trading firm they eventually get to a size where they're managing so much capital they are no longer able to deploy mark initial and they always eventually set up vc and go long and then you can see the tone at which they talk about things shift too and i think that's just a natural consequence of managing too much capital so i think maybe the only way to avoid that is to you know just stick to one particular thing do it super well and not scale up or you know you scale up and you just try and um you know get you know the the investors uh on the same page that look we're actually not going to try and maximize i mean crazy even think because these guys it's in their dna to maximize profit but you know it's very crazy to even say but you know to get them to agree that that would be the case um but i don't really i think it's a lot of human nature i don't even think there's anybody who's particularly at fault i don't want to really point the finger at you know jump or three hours or anything like that i mean it's the natural course of being very good at what you do that you end up having too much capital that you're forced to go long into beta right and one thing i will say is like i i most necessarily refer didn't want to like single out jump necessarily as a bad actor themselves right like if you look at the code bases they've contributed a lot in fact probably more in the last year than the tfl associated entities i think if you look through the luna code base you'll be surprised at how few contributors there are uh in the last year um but but i i think like they have by and large been pretty active on the development side in a way that i think trading firms usually aren't i think the problem is the sleight of hand came in that in that they like that was used to sell a lot of very smart people who are maybe just young and not didn't know the history of this type of stuff into thinking that like oh oh we should go raise money from yc and put half of our fundraise into anchor there are so many stories like that and yc themselves was basically encouraging people i mean if you go look at the yc uh crypto list 90 of the yc crypto companies are just front ends for anchor and if you just take a little more time and dig into like what they're doing where their yield is coming from they're not just putting into compound they're they're 100 we're just putting into anchor and so i think there was kind of this extra duplicity where like jumps brand was then used to like create this whole narrative of like the smart guys think ust is the best and that thing kind of really spiraled out of control in like a way that i think we've never seen in either finance or tech yeah and i think really it's just that there should be a slight change in um the message there it's not that oh you know these smart people think that it's gonna work it's that these smart people think that they'll be able to make money by backing this thing and i think that's very different because they are very smart they are very smart i i want to actually touch on on you know tyrone's point around um yeah these teams that have raised money to build on ontario and maybe sort of just like the sort of next step or you know fallout from this there's obviously the tera2 proposal and there's teams that still have a lot of money that you know are we're building products to work on top of terra not the anchor front ends but you know other default applications and stuff like that i'm curious what you guys think about the territory proposal and then maybe in tandem what these you know teams that are in the you know terror ecosystem um are going to do next honestly um you know i was sitting down today with an entrepreneur who basically they they were building on terra and they are like okay we're obviously leaving like we're not sticking around for tattoo like what the hell is the point of terror without usd um there's going i mean tara too is going to be a hollowed-out shell of what terra was and so you know to the extent that they can salvage what they do have left and use it to try to make uh usg users whole and luna holders whole for the losses they've incurred i'm supportive of that um i haven't spent a whole lot of brain cells trying to figure out what is the best way to do that exactly but i i think it's on them to do their best to try to salvage what they can but the reality is that the vast majority of high quality entrepreneurs are not going to stick around because why would they they're such better options and tara the dream is over right like it's sort of like you know after the collapse of the soviet union if you could leave you're going to leave you know and now you still do have to have the question of like okay how do you rebuild russia how do you rebuild some of the post-soviet states um these are hard questions and there's no good answers to them uh and you have to do it you can't run away from it you're not or i should say not everyone can run away from it but the most you know the smartest the most capable the most well-known people 90 of them are going to leave and so i think that's going to result in tara being a shell of what it was so i i feel like i've talked to maybe like 10 to 15 tara projects and people i knew a terror project for the last few days and just on that sample size of say 15 i would say there's like an exodus to probably solana and avec seem to be the top two contenders um for most people and then third is sort of like polygon i feel like those three seem to be like the the most likely places where we'll go there are people who are staying although i think there's a lot of problems people are realizing from a technical implementation standpoint right so the territory proposal has this may 27th deadline but let's uh you know for instance mars protocol uh which was sort of built by delphi and people from tf formerly from tfl uh mars basically today was like we can't guarantee anything will work in tara too withdraw right now because without ust literally none of the margining code is correct because it like assumes it makes a lot of assumptions about like the relative value of like a lp pool share as a function of the usc price for ufc doesn't exist that doesn't make sense so there's gonna actually there's a huge amount of technical debt to remove ust that i think uh at least i mean obviously it's like a very chaotic situation so it's like i totally understand you don't have time to like figure out the precise technical specs but for instance you need to have some way of redeeming all of these on-chain assets like an astroport lp share for ust and another token such that people can redeem that without relying on the ust token which is going to not exist in tara too so from a just like strict like programming standpoint i think there's it's actually even if you really really are die hard there's a huge amount of basically tech debt you're going to have to have because we just turned this thing that was sort of a reliable invariant of the virtual machine into a null pointer and like that is like a very weird that that means you have to go change all your code right like it basically means everything's wrong like half of your audits are wrong now right so um i think from a very practical standpoint i actually think it's a really hard thing if you use ust anywhere in your code and that's literally every application yeah i know i definitely agree i think there's a lot of like secondary and tertiary effects there that haven't fully been thought through i'm very curious as to why they didn't just have a ust but instead of min and redeem mechanism just have it be like a make or die system where you know you just have some external collateral at least then a lot of that code can be transported over but then it begs the question where is that collateral going to come from because who in the right mind would have the confidence to actually create and mint this stuff by putting up good collateral on this new chain where we don't even know if it's going to be a complete dumb fest or there's some residual recovery value um you know i would say that you know in their in their favor at least there probably is some value residual value to the block space to this l1 chain even without ust but how much is it and whether or not there could be enough confidence restored that it can survive without being completely dumped again to xero as people's final exit liquidity uh you know as a way for people to recover some amount of value because they're already scared shitless that this even happened so really hard to say well my proposal to them was which also doe refused to take the call is that i think that they should try and favor one what's fair two the smaller holders and three the folks that are least likely to dump so whether it might be by ignorance or whether it be by true belief there were some people that just never moved their luna or never moved their ust throughout this entire thing and just held it from the point at which you depend till now and the address has never moved the coins i would say that that's pretty strong hands whether it's stupidity or whether it's just actual belief either way indistinguishable from each other you maybe you want to favor them too right and then on top of that you probably want to favor people even who are buying during the hyperinflating period but where they didn't realize there was recovery value right so even if they're buying lottery tickets maybe it's still fine but like once you announce that there's going to be a new chain or a new proposal to airdrop people well then there's a lot more speculative demand right so like what about doing some kind of time stamping on the announcement of that that there could be this new proposal and then just anybody who was buying it before that maybe gets something a little bit more than everybody who's buying it afterwards right and then there's also political questions on how to deal with the exchanges right because if they're not favoring the people who bought it during the hyperinflating period then the exchanges are unhappy because their customers aren't happy with them right so it's just like if you if you piss off the exchanges too much then they might not list your new coin anyway so you got to throw them a bone too so i think that there's a lot of political considerations now in that you know all these different factions all holding all of these different you know uh classic coins you know they all want more of the pie from this new coin and i think figuring out how to divide it is a very tricky situation but i think at least they should hear me out you know i mean i mean after all this you know but yeah all of that complexity is why bankruptcy law was invented and so i guess again going back to like speed running finance yes um we're rediscovering why some of these things are so complex yes definitely we're definitely speed running finance we're rediscovering things which layer one is going to have bankruptcy law as part of consensus rules no which one just again let's just let's just just take yeah well eos did it by forking out block one first which in theory tfl is doing to themselves here right but i'm curious like if you were to guess of the existing chains that are live and have you know greater than a certain like greater than like a billion dollars of tbl who do you think who do you think will be the first to be like our differentiator our differentiator is going to be we have bankruptcy law built in for for like settlement i i think that's a great idea yeah ust as a protocol right like yeah i i don't think i don't think that's i don't think there will be a protocol that doesn't it's too narrative breaking though it's just too narrative breaking yeah i don't i don't agree i think there is a way to do m a protocols and equally so i think there's a way to do a bankruptcy but not for the later one themselves but for like underlying application application i think it'd be too hard to understand the app semantics no way no way it's too hard to understand the semantics of an app i'll make my prediction in this bear market someone will basically build that even though it won't be called that it will be like you know it's kind of the way unisoft was not called a automated market maker event started right it was just called the swamp thing and like people didn't understand that and it's like still its exposure is kind of complicated to most people who haven't thought about it right so i think there's going to be someone who figures out some protocol that like recycles dead defy tvl uh and is able to kind of like rehypothecate it and then redistribute it to the more live products do you think it would be too narrative breaking to even have that as part of the white paper because people are going to read it and think wait a second so this thing can fail really this is why it needs branding this is why you need this is why you need the unicorn no no but this is just something where like if there's a protocol that's dead and the token holder is like we want to get rid of it instead of the tvl just saying but then what you create now is you create lobbying right like now suddenly they're interest groups of like oh we deserve the tvl like this is this is i i the protocol the protocol could literally just burn it the l1 can just take it and burn it into the l1 but how is it if if the thing is dead then it's already effectively burned isn't it [Music] not but it doesn't it doesn't reward the l1 token holders it doesn't reward the validators for for keeping that state secure right in spite of the fact that it's not generating any income so like they're what i'm saying is this will happen there will be some smart kid who does this but like it does it for a totally different reason like oh i made a memory allocator that's very not fee agnostic and it knows how to it knows how to do like malac coalescence really well oh actually oh lo and behold that actually does this tbl refresh thing i'm just saying there's going to be like lessons from this are going to reverberate and hopefully we get stuff like that which would be cool all right well speaking of reverberations the last thing that i want to i want to end on is um you know many people have said that this is the end of the cycle that the collapse of terra will be remembered as the kind of the last gasp of the 2020 to 2022 bowl cycle and that we're now going into a bear market and obviously you know lots of assets are down from their peaks bitcoin is down peak trough uh over 50 percent a lot of defy tokens are down 70 80 percent l ones are down about seventy percent uh i'll tell ones i should say um it's been a pretty brutal market and obviously a lot of it this year what's comfy tom and i milady holders okay that's true actually i heard this the ladies and the ladies are going close to all-time high and eat terms nft4 prices have been doing pretty well they've been doing pretty well i actually heard that during the um during the terra [Music] downfall that actually there was an enormous amount of trading volume in nfts ontario because of course like people couldn't get through wormhole while terra was falling apart and so you saw tons as luna was hyperinflating people just started buying up nfts whose prices were going up like crazy which is exactly what you see in a bank run as people start dumping currency to buy commodities and so the effective store of values were uh terra nfts which i i've also heard are looking for a new home so you know we'll see we'll see where that ends up but but anyway so to finish the point um you know obviously a lot of the downturn this year has been driven by macro but it seems like tara gave an extra nudge to the bearishness around crypto um so how are you guys um and kevin you know given that you're a trader i'm sure that this is you know the the uh the water you swim in um how are you thinking about where we are in terms of the cycle yeah you know i think um overall at least historically from what i've seen the more severe the drop the shorter the bear market you know lasts and i think a lot of it is because you know when everybody's kind of on the same page that this is the bear market that this is it right then it's just like there are no new pessimists to sell the price further down right as opposed to you look at very like um really long bear markets right like for example after the 2017 one or after 2013 one that was even brutal and it's because a lot of that was just the digestion of hope as long as there is hope as long as there are some bulls then you know there are still some uh some people to be convinced that it is uh that is a bear market and they will then sell at some point so i think the bear market bottom is only reached when basically there's no marginal seller left everybody is already um you know feeling like completely bleak um and there's no hope left and for the people still holding on to the coins um they're so die hard believers that they will never sell at any price so basically during every cycle you you know all these coins move from weak hands to strong hands and there are some that are so strong that they will just never sell which forms the bottom and then there's the ramp and pessimism then it eventually dissipates into optimism so i think you know for this i think it's actually good that it happened now that it happened so severely because you know i was thinking that if it happened later it'd be another nine months maybe another 18 months and it could it could even take like multiple years but now after this thing i'm thinking well maybe not not as long you know maybe like six to nine months is enough but that being said uh we're not actually controlling the markets anymore um you know in crypto ourselves because the the fed itself you know it could do whatever it wants and everything so correlated to equities um hopefully this decoupling you know we thought there was going to be decoupling we thought crypto was going to decouple up it decoupled down right but at least there was some kind of decoupling blew out all the um correlation algos so now all those guys have to rejigger their algos they're not going to hold things as tight in a ban uh to equities so hopefully the decouplings already happen we do decouple from equities even further and maybe another six months now if that's not the case and we're still trading basically fed whatever the fed wants to do um then you know it's just like we're just gonna follow the rest of equities and and uh you know that'll be until they capitulate and then it's more about macro about when you know they're gonna they think either inflation is subsided enough or the market has dropped enough because of like the you know the greenspan bernanke put if it drops a certain amount um then at some point they just capitulate and maybe we just all die by inflation so you know all those are possible so you know either the fed or hopefully very soon because i'm actually a bit more on the optimistic side but i would say at least in the near term a lot of funds blew up so their lps are going to be redeeming out of them so that's going to cause a lot of force selling you know initially there was a lot of force selling because of people defending their toxic margin positions uh by selling good assets then there was a relief rally because any time there's a lot of foreselling you know there's a bounce back and then after that uh now there's once again for selling on the longer cycle on the monthly maybe one or two month cycle where funds basically unwind and close shop and have to sell assets to redeem out investors and then after that we'll probably another relief rally and then hopefully you know hopefully then you know it'll be good by then it sounds like what you're saying is that the pessimism is cause for optimism uh yes exactly yeah i mean when everybody's uh riding the high of mania there are no new pessimists at all right and they're no new optimists at all everybody's just max long and then like then just the tiny little prick of the bubble can just completely crash everything so same thing for the bottom of the bear market when there's no new marginal sellers and all the people who hold it will never sell then you know price can only go up i mean one thing that struck me about this whole uh this whole terra collapse is that you know obviously everybody kind of knows who was exposed who was talking about it who you know owned tara on the books um everyone i have talked to says that they're okay and i'm like okay somebody must be lying to me he's like i don't know who it was i don't know where there's 14 billion dollars of usd i literally said the same thing to robert yesterday i was like every single person i asked if like they had any lunar usc exposure like no no no i stole luna for like 40 years don't worry everybody tells me that they were totally i don't believe this no way that's true no way that's true yeah i think there's no way it's true there's this collective delusion amongst a bunch of people uh and like it's a game of chicken until until we read the news story in bloomberg yeah i would say that there's no way that's true but what would be even more harrowing is that if it was true because then it really means that the insiders just dumped on retail but they got out unscathed right that would be even worse of an outcome that would be absolutely devastating for the space the retail's not coming back for like three years after that if that's the case you know yeah i mean i i think that there's definitely an element of that right like who was holding luna like who was watching curve pools probably the sophisticated investors right who really understood the death spiral it was sophisticated investors who were the first people coming out of anchor when the when the rush started for people to leave anchor who were selling out at you know 95 90 cents uh it was sophisticated investors it was not retail retail were almost certainly the most likely to have held to the bottom um so i think i think that's true although we i i did hear of one fund that did admit that they never sold ust but only one only a single fine that i heard of that that didn't that admitted to holding onto usd everybody else um it was it was an asian fund uh everybody else i've spoken to claims that they're totally fine he's like oh no we're totally okay it wasn't a big deal we're all good cece said that finance never sold they held their entire stake up and down to zero basically i mean i can believe that i mean for finance it probably wasn't they probably forgot they probably forgot game exactly it was part of a fire team that is somewhere in told stories they don't even know how to get it a couple days ago cece sits down and said wait so we actually owned this stuff like what happened like how did we get this well he did he did write that tweet that was just like i i never even heard of this thing it wasn't that's not my radar that's great he's like oh this thing is giving me so much stress now and like i never even heard of it like who cares about you he wrote something like that that was like amazing yes easy he just lost from the peak you know like a yard you know and he's like nah not a big deal you know there's plenty where that came from well amazing um well it's been a harrowing week and um i think we have uh in in part we have you to thank for the sanity that has finally come over crypto it seems like it's going to be a bear market for a while uh which means things are going to be a little quieter thankfully um and uh but we'll have a lot more chopping up to do as uh as we as we get into this next cycle so one thing i really miss uh i wish we had talked about a little bit with the stake d thief peg because like actually on this show like about two months ago i was like one of the big risks that we have to think about is the stake defeat thing i think uh the luna cascade the into that was a very amazing thing to watch on chain yeah there's there's so much to entangle about this story and obviously an hour is not enough for us to really get to the bottom of it but there yeah there were so many things and then of course there was the tether scare and there's there's there's a lot more that so maybe we'll do um yeah what was that what was that protocol that hard-coded ust as equal to a dollar they just hard-coded it there was some protocol that didn't oh oh uh yeah yeah yeah oh that's right that's right yeah it's a big face bomb on that one that's a big face bomb yeah yeah they were so confident they you should give all of luna v2 to those guys because they're really confident that the peg would have held i mean those guys uh you know those guys believe anything so give them all the luna v2 you know there's a strong hands over there i mean and they're a maker system so they they they could accept it as collateral you know okay look to be to be fair like how many on-chain protocols are prepared for global settlement for maker you know probably not like if maker triggered global settlement probably half the things that default break so that's fair that's fair everything's greater than you think though i i do think like the urine ecosystem has a bunch of things built around it and but i i agree it in the sense that like non-east-based gdp systems no one no one even cares yeah so anyway um so we do we do have to wrap uh but uh kevin thank you so much
