launched an inquiry into whether crypto exchanges have proper safeguards in place to prevent insider trading on their platforms fox reports that the sec has sent a letter to one of the major crypto exchanges requesting information on its current insider trading safeguards the sec did not immediately respond to fox's request to comment coin center is suing the irs here's why coincenter has filed a lawsuit against the treasury department arguing that a crypto tax reporting requirement from last year's infrastructure bill is unconstitutional the requirement called 6050i which goes into effect in 2024 and which some of you may recall was covered on unchained last fall would require u.s taxpayers to report the social security numbers and other personal information of anyone who sends them more than ten thousand dollars in cryptocurrency this is problematic as coin center explains in its lawsuit because the reporting mandate would force americans using cryptocurrency to share intrusive details about themselves both with each other and with the federal government coin center argues that such detailed reporting could have a negative impact on transactional privacy in the u.s the reports would give the government an unprecedented level of detail about transactions within a realm where users have taken a series of steps to protect their transactional privacy they conclude in practice the amendments reporting mandate would often be impossible to comply with because its terms do not coherently map onto the nature of the technology that it regulates major wallets patch
