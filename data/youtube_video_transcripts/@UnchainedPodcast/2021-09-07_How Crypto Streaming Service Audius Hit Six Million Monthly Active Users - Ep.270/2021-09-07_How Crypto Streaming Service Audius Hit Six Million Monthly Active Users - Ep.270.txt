tracking learn more at digital asset research dot com today's guest is roneill rumberg co-founder and ceo of audies welcome rhoniel hey laura thanks so much for having me audios has made some headlines recently having recently scored a deal to enable artists to directly upload their music to tick-tock sound kit but before we get into all the details on that let's start at the beginning what is audience audience is a digital streaming service that connects fans directly with artists and exclusive new music and we really see that direct piece of the equation being the the key differentiator here but when you use audios it looks and feels like any other music player right you can sign up make an account follow your favorite artists and start listening to their tracks uh without knowing anything about crypto anything else um but of course under the hood uh uh the way that audience operates couldn't be more different from the traditional kind of soundcloud or spotify or something like that right there's a network of third-party node operators artists and fans that together collectively and collaboratively run this network for the benefit of the community and for their own benefit i guess too in the case of the node operators but and what problem is audio solving that other music platforms have not yeah so in uh you know i guess really where where the initial inspiration for audience came from was uh my co-founder forrest and i are just big dance music fans right that was like we're not uh uh native to the music industry or from the music industry but uh we were native to crypto a little bit so we he and i started mining litecoin and dogecoin and some of the other escript coins in 2013 or so onward and we just started to see i guess in really around 2014 2015 a lot of our favorite artists choosing to leave soundcloud or getting kicked off of soundcloud in some cases and all this great music that you know we had favorited and followed over the years started disappearing so we started to ask ourselves like why that was happening was really when we started to understand you know this this broader set of issues that um at its core i would summarize as artists don't know who their fans are where their fans are or have any ability to like engage or interact directly with them like on spotify for example you as an artist can message your fans once per year there's a specific like email template that you have to follow um spotify exercises some editorial uh control over it and that's it that's like your ability to reach your fans so uh uh you know you can't like link them out to a third-party merch store for example you can't do uh you know you just very much at all with with that fan base so we we uh you know and there were all these downstream effects of of artists just not controlling or having any ownership of their distribution which included you know them getting de-platformed them uh uh you know choosing to uh to depart platforms like soundcloud and mass so yeah that's that's really the core problem we're solving is to give artists control and access to those relationships that they have with their fans and so how do you do that on audience yeah so it's it's really by decentralizing that whole stack and and tool chain so you know even the question of like what is audio is not a uh simple one to answer just because it doesn't cleanly fit into the bucket of like oh it's a you know a so-called dsp in in music parlance or a digital service provider um it's also not a distributor per se it's not it kind of has aspects of of a number of these things but what it really looks like is a set of tools that allow an artist to build an audience and engage directly with them with no intermediaries right our our company or any company included right like for the first time there's zero parties intermediating that um that interaction and it's led to like a lot of really neat emergent behavior um within the network that like we haven't really seen before in other music streaming services networks um but yeah it really does come down to us being decentralized that's that's that's why even to launch like the first version of audios in uh late 2019 which was it was not economically incentivized it was a test net but it was decentralized from from day one and that was what and and you know fully open source so that was what i think you know among the artist community allowed uh this audience network to start to build trust with them right that uh you know the rules aren't going to change on them this api that their whole workflow is dependent on is not going to get pulled out from under them um all of all of these sort of qualities that that just had never been possible in music before and if you have examples of what they are doing on the platform that they can't do on something like a spotify yeah so uh one of the coolest you know emergent behaviors that uh uh you know our our community ended up deciding to double down on with some more product features is uh this remix competition feature so uh it was actually an artist named leto was the first one to uh kind of like create this behavior but um uh he uploaded a track and then uploaded all the constituent little pieces of audio that went into creating that track um as as separate tracks that he flagged as downloadable so anyone could go download that raw audio and then he went and uh posted on instagram and told his fan base hey uh if you all remix this track using those uh stems that i uploaded and tag your track with just the you know like hashtag uh i forget exactly what he he did i think it was like the name of the track or something um he could then go search that hashtag find everything that remixed it and then he did a twitch stream like going through and listening to them live and giving feedback and then uh engaging so it's really really fun and uh and we were like this is this is so cool like there has to be a way to kind of better enable that um uh so we we kind of built out like a little bit of ui for this uh and then rac i think was the next one that that ran a remakes competition um with this but now there's actually by that time there's actually a way to formally tag a track as being a remix of another track and he actually ended up signing i think five of the tracks that remixed his track to like an official release under his label so these were like just you know fans of his that like loved uh uh you know andre's music or rac's music and uh uh wanted to like you know just get noticed by like their favorite artist right and you know some of them actually are now on on an official release of his which is like so cool right so you know when you break down all of those kind of i guess like the barriers that exist between artists and fan it finally you know it starts to become possible to just do these like weird neat things right that like had never another example that comes to mind is uh uh we we we've seen a few artists upload like works in progress of a given track so they'll like upload uh you know draft get feedback on it from the community iterate on it upload a new one see how people like it and do that a few times and then the final release like two or three months later maybe makes it to a spotify or two other other services but the super fans that are like i want to hear everything this person makes and like i want to engage with it and hang out um there's no better place to be right now wow i i love this it sounds so cool i mean it just sounds really fun it's like um a little dj mixing party on the internet or something um so something that's interesting to me about your platform is at this moment in time i feel like people typically think of anything that brings together culture and crypto as involving nfts and that's actually not the main way you're using blockchain technology um at least i i believe so based on my research so um talk a little bit more about the crypto aspects of audience totally uh no you're you're spot on there um the the only integration of nfts today in audience is uh as an artist you can run like a little uh storefront page on your profile if you'd like to so uh some artists like uh blau or rac have these uh collectibles tabs that they've turned on on their profile and they just put um you know all the nfts they've minted and that they've owned there so it's kind of like this directory that links out to you know whatever market might exist in that like on openc or super rare or where wherever it may be um but yeah no we we aren't you know a native nft platform by any means um what audience uses uh uh you know a blockchain's plural for and i i can get into like more more of the technical detail around that is effectively a coordination layer for this network so there are these off-chain nodes um that host content host metadata and kind of do the work that is required to keep the network functional and and alive right like um you know the the way that the network is is set up uh our company could go away tomorrow and and you know the vast majority of votes here would uh uh would continue to work just fine right it's because it's being operated by the community but there's what what the kind of you know ethereum at the center on the node operator side and then solana on the uh content engagement side provide are this sort of like unified source of truth for a number of questions right like who are the nodes on the network um are they in a healthy or valid state um and then on the content side like what is all the content in this network who is engaged with it who has the ability to update or modify it um so by doing that we can kind of like anchor trust with these small pieces of data on chain um that refer out to data being stored off chain on on these community operated nodes okay and so for the metadata it's just like kind of you know who who wrote this track or who performed it and does that include kind of like royalties the way that you know a spotify will pay you for streams so it's every time it gets played then like different people who participate in that song will get paid or how does that work yeah it uh uh so it includes everything from you know the title of the track and the cover art for the track and you know the name of the artist and things like that um to uh things like revenue splits as well so uh the network doesn't natively split revenue today uh although it does allow you to like define um uh those splits within the metadata um because that's that's something that you know i think our community had always uh uh planned or wanted to build towards over time right yeah like even um even in the absence of that like there is a quite a bit of like content that you know both independent labels have uploaded and a few of the larger players have have uploaded and basically they handle the splits on on their end right now so um you know there there's one address that's getting paid out royalties and then you know that company can decide hey oh i need to split this however i do or or what have you so so yeah on the metadata side it's really more just like uh uh you know all the things that go around the audio file itself to make it have meaning or you know make it interesting and then you also have the audio token so what functions does that perform in the audio system yeah that has three core functions um it secures the network uh so the people who run the nodes that actually um do all the work that makes a network functional um they stake the token to to be able to run that node and then they earn fees back from the network proportional to uh uh to the size of the stake and the number of nodes that they run so um one of the kind of strange things about uh uh audios the audio networks needs compared to like a lot of say layer one blockchains that have their own nodes is that the need for storage grows you know forever right like the more people upload the more people engage the more you need so the way that the node infrastructure is set up it's not like there's a fixed kind of processing capacity it's like the more nodes there are the more can be stored the more can be served uh etc so like the crypto economic structure has to kind of like you know incentivize a much larger amount of storage to be on the network than the network actually needs at any given time um so uh anyway yeah so secures the network uh the token also is used in governance so um you know from the time the token launched in october of 2020 um our team was uh no longer capable of making any changes to the code that powers audience both uh all the you know on chain smart contracts for like engaging with content and all all that good stuff as well as in the off chain node software so the nodes actually like monitor one another to see that they're running like the most up-to-date version and they can get slashed if they're running too far behind and things like that but um to actually accept within the network a uh new version of the code as being like canonically correct um there has to be a governance vote that that happens so so it's actually it's not one token one vote but one token staked within the network uh is is you know able to vote so if you just hold tokens passively you're not able to uh participate but if you're delegating to a node or you're running a node yourself you you get to vote on you know how this goes and then the third pillar there is feature access so as an artist you actually if you hold and stake some number of tokens you get access to additional distribution features that may consume more resources the network level so the nft feature is actually one of those so if you hold more than a hundred audio tokens on your audience account you're able to set up that uh collectibles tab and collect uh or sorry connect external wallets and and stuff um the reason for that limitation actually is that um it costs the the network resources to go index all those wallets and and keep you know basically keep track of all the uh changes to any holding of nfts or or things like that they have so so yeah those are those are the three primary functions um i think the you know the one misconception that i i always like to to clear up around this though is uh the audio tokens not used for payments within the network right so users aren't purchasing this to consume uh content or things like that um we actually you know we talked to many many many artists about this uh as we were kind of you know working through the test net and uh you know artists want food and shelter right they don't necessarily want like when they they are charging for access to their music conflating like control of the means of distribution with like their basal needs to like function as a human being in in the world uh uh i think you know is is a very dangerous uh sort of game right we we it tried to uh you know based on on all of that feedback i think our uh you know the intent with a lot of that design was to separate these things right to um to say your your ability to control your distribution should not come in direct conflict with like your ability to you know feed yourself and support yourself right um you know and and mixing them creates some some kind of you know weird dynamics right where the artists that you know are say uh uh selling what they earn to you know support themselves uh uh that you know means they're losing control of the distribution that they're making valuable right which is not their you know we felt not the right sort of incentive structure to create so then are they earning stable coins uh monetization and audiences is uh uh not fully live right now so there are folks that are earning uh in in stable coins in like very ad hoc ways so like on audios every user has a wallet they're able to uh you know receive anything uh to that wallet they might please so so there's kind of this like ad hoc economy that's that's emerged around that um just because there there are so many people now on on the network that have uh these wallets but uh no the more formal features on monetization are still i think being iterated on and worked on by the community i think the the first goal was was always to build a meaningful enough audience uh within the network that like it actually started to make sense for someone to think about monetizing it and for the first time i think in the last three or four months uh there are some accounts on on audios with tens of thousands of followers like 20 30 40 000 um that for the first time became enough that someone could think about hey if you know two or three or five percent of my audience might convert to a paid uh engagement like a paid subscription to me or or something like that um that's now like a real amount of money for them right like three 500 600 people uh engaging on something like that could really move the needle for uh uh for you know you'd be surprised how many artists actually just because of how little they they earn for the most part on uh you know traditional streaming services yeah yeah i have some friends who are musicians and um it's not pretty um one thing i wanted to ask about was for the staking um i realized that because of the price of the audio token that at the moment it would cost half a million dollars to become one of those node operators that can stake and that's i mean actually i think compared to um just trying to remember what the dollar amount was when sticking launch on the beacon chain on eth2 i think it was like 16 000 or something um but i was wondering like like is there a reason why it's so much more like are you you know going after some kind of like you know professional um operation or like what's what's the thinking behind that level or is it just like you didn't anticipate the price would go up this much or yeah so uh uh the level was um intentional although um i i think you know uh uh if if we could go back and redo history something that varied a little bit more with the current market uh dynamic rather than being a fixed number uh would likely make more sense but um the barrier to entry here was intentionally very high and and the reason for that is it actually to to run a node on the audio network and and have it be able to meet the minimum specification and requirement for for a node um is pretty expensive it's like not a not a straightforward thing to to do and it requires a level of expertise today that's not uh you know broadly accessible yet um so that's actually why there's a separation between uh you can delegate tokens and you can delegate as little as a hundred tokens um at a time so there's a much much longer tale of people delegating tokens to people who run nodes professionally but um the goal was for the uh folks operating nodes to be like you know really professional hosting businesses um the other side of this that that is worth touching upon is that because those node operators are you know professional real legitimate hosting businesses um there's there's some responsibility that comes as a node operator with respect to the content that gets stored on on your node so if someone uploads something that they uh you know don't own the rights to for example right um as a node operator uh uh you know you you are responsible for like when uh uh kind of rights holders file dmca notices and things like that to respond to them and i think that's something worth calling out is that decentralization uh uh does not need to mean like you know mass sort of uh infringement of rights right and that's why um that's why the incentives around the network were structured this way right like the the node operator archetype that is on audience right someone who has level of resources that you just mentioned to to be able to come on here you know has no interest in hosting like things that uh uh draw like uh uh the wrong kind of attention right so um that's actually why you know audience has not really had uh uh run-ins or issues like on um on on that front right like you know our our goal with designing this network was to help artists get paid more right uh not to to defraud them or to to you know take away their livelihood through like you know people putting stuff uh up that you know they uh uh that isn't paying the right person yeah so um so yeah i think that it was really those two aspects right it's like the complexity of running a node and to be able to provide a high quality of user experience and service to end users that are fetching content from those nodes um and then just the nature of like music attac attracts uh uh you know some some uh not so great behavior that um you know we we uh uh wanted we wanted the people who are running nodes to be like known named like businesses or individuals that actually like have a presence and exist in in the real world right um which uh again decentralization uh uh you know is it can both decentralization and kind of decentralized control can go hand in hand with um you know respecting uh uh the rights of content i love it um i think that's just really cool and smart um so a couple things so first of all just for listeners who don't know what dmca takedown is it's if i remember correctly it's something like digital millennium copyright act um okay thank you um which so i because i've sent these out before where like someone stole my writing and i was like you need to take that down um so i you know i think that's great that you know you are seeking these professional operators who would you know abide by the law if they were to receive a request by that a request like that um and you know it's interesting that you just raised this issue because i was going to ask you um like i noticed two years ago the verge wrote an article calling your service a copyright nightmare and said it was at that time full of pirated material um and the truth is actually when i first started learning about i was like oh it's like napster with a token um and so like is it is it just because um basically all the node operators are kind of more centralized that they're handling it or you kind of said like it's it's not even really been an issue so are you noticing that like already like you're not even or or these node operators aren't even getting people uploading pirated stuff great questions all around so uh there definitely are things uh uh getting uploaded to audios that shouldn't be in the same way that they do to youtube or to soundcloud or to you know really really anywhere right if you give users the ability to upload things like there will be some some small number of people that sort of uh misbehave um the reason it's not become an issue though more broadly is that you know whenever rights holders have approached uh operators in in the network and in the community um you know at least the feedback we've heard is that 100 of the time uh those things have been addressed in in a timely fashion so you know i i think one thing that is really uh uh really unfortunate right is is sometimes uh folks who who write and produce content on the internet don't necessarily fully uh understand like the mechanics of what they're writing about um and uh i think that that specific press piece um you know was uh you know there there were just a lot of things that unfortunately i think that reporter got a little bit wrong about uh uh the actual situation with respect to to the network right um if that narrative were true you know there would have uh been a lot more anger and you know lawsuits and who knows what else right that would have started flying around from uh uh the broader music community but i think we've been fairly warmly embraced right uh uh by by the broader music uh community and i think it's because we took this approach that i just described to you right like they're like by being decentralized uh uh but still aligning incentives around positive behavior um you can i think get get the best of of uh uh both worlds here right like you know you don't have to use uh you don't have to trust our company when using audience um but uh uh there is still you know there are laws and and rules that exist for good reason and uh uh you know allowing people to hide behind uh uh the shields of anonymity in some cases like you might be able to if the requirements were much lower or much smaller you know would i i think we felt would lead to a a misalignment around those incentives right we we want all the folks who run nodes on um the audience network which you know today they're uh uh i think um you know like 60 or 70 uh nodes last i counted like those should all be known you know quantities in the world right um okay and so um a couple other things i want to ask about this so one thing is and i think i might already know the answer to this but i did notice that the audio token is set to inflate at a rate of seven percent a year and i was wondering um as i'm sure you're well aware a lot of people in the crypto community like coins that have you know caps or not caps but but like maybe low inflation but i was curious to hear about why you know you're you're inflating at a somewhat high rate yeah so we felt uh that it made more sense to um distribute the token supply over a very long period of time to uh uh you know the the community members that were creating the most value in the ecosystem that effectively meant that rather than distributing like a very very large amount of tokens up front when the network launched um by delay you know basically having that happen over a period of you know i mean really for perpetuity um uh uh that would lead to a better kind of uh uh distribution of of um power and and control in the community so you know i think i mean a lot of like the the design around audience was sort of inspired by uh uh you know a lot of the ideals that you know karl marx and and some of those early uh philosophers around like capitalist economic structure laid out that like you know it should be possible for uh folks who just you know make uh uh use of capital to earn some of that capital back over time from the work that they do right um and for that to be possible uh there needs to be some amount of um inflation perpetually right um but the way that the staking side of audience is set up um if you stake and actively participate with your tokens you know your percentage of control of the broader network doesn't uh get diluted over time right as it stands right now you actually by staking you can grow your percentage of ownership over time just by function of of the participation and staking um and it it base what it basically means is the network uh uh heavily disincentivizes uh passive holding um and incentivizes active participation right because if you just hold those tokens and do nothing with them um you get diluted down at an aggressive rate over time right so um yeah one of the interesting things is that like uh about designing at these sort of crypto economic systems is that like you know we we could um sit in a room and try and do the best we can but ultimately once it's out in the world it is in the hands of the community right like we the decisions that our team made uh uh prior to launching the the network um are now you know only changeable by the community so all of what i just said aside there is a growing contingent within the audience ecosystem that wants to change uh that inflation rate i think for the reason that you just laid out so so it will be interesting to see how that plays out i mean i think this is the community's property and the world's property so um you know at least i personally would be supportive of whatever they uh whatever they decide here but um that that was at least the initial intent here was that uh over time the network should be controlled by the people who are actively using it not by um kind of like passive holders of that capital all right so in a moment we're going to talk a little bit more about the decentralized and centralized aspects of running crypto networks but first a quick word from the

easier and safer back to my conversation with ronil so we were just talking about how you started as a centralized service and now governance is in the hand of your token holders and so i was so curious earlier today when i had trouble logging into the app um i was wondering because apps are typically run by centralized server services and i um sent you a message saying oh hey you know i'm having a tr having trouble logging in and you said oh i'm going to ask the team so i was wondering is that a centralized company that you were referring to there and is it a centralized company that's running this app on the decentralized protocol or um is it because like you know ethereum has this foundation and the foundation um funds these different teams you know working on different clients or whatever i mean it can be outside companies too but um so it's kind of curious like what is centralized and audience and what is decentralized yeah so uh uh there is a um audio foundation that controls the uh kind of like the project's treasury and and allocates those funds uh out to companies like uh uh my company um so there are a few other companies that now uh uh exist in the audience ecosystem as well that you know get similar kind of grants from uh from the foundation um but specifically to your question uh uh you know and for uh for everyone's context this was around uh twitter oauth so there's a mechanism that audience used to to kind of you know prevent name squatters from registering and mass like verified uh usernames on other platforms the network will prevent you from registering a handle that is verified on uh twitter or instagram so uh uh when laura tried to sign up with uh her verified twitter handle the uh front end was like you can't do that or whatever right um so that is uh one aspect of the network's behavior that is centralized today um there are a couple others that i can mention but um it's not possible to authenticate with twitter in a decentralized way um however uh your wallet when using audios is still custody with with you so your account is actually controlled by you the only aspect of that flow that uh our company is is able to affect is adding that check mark next to your name um and and the only way that that happens is uh uh if um if a user either during sign up or afterwards is able to uh uh authenticate with a verified account on another platform so um so that's that's one thing that like we we haven't really um and it is a trade-off of usability versus decentralization so like there are strategies that people use around this like key base will have people tweet like a message you know like i'm setting up my key base but um i mean let's let's be let's be real here right like if uh uh you know like uh dead mouse or steve aoki signs up for audios and like both of them use audios like are they really going to tweet like you know i am setting up my audience account like proving that i'm verified like probably not right so a trade-off had to be made there but um uh and then there are a couple of other places where where uh uh kind of like day-to-day engagement with with the network touches uh uh some centralized services um so for example if you send audio tokens from your wallet even though your wallet has custody and control of those tokens and the signature around the transactions happening on on your browser we have a relay that will pay the gas for that transaction on your behalf um so you could still transact uh if you put ethereum into your wallet to send it but you know the vast majority of our users don't know or understand things about crypto so i think where we've tried to make these trade-offs is is with the goal of usability in mind um but with a hard bright line around uh the network's functionality cannot be dependent on uh uh us as a central party so you know laura like you still could sign up uh for an account you just wouldn't be verified for example like if our company was not doing uh uh that little verification service for example um similarly you could still send uh uh and engage with um you know the the tokens within the product but uh you know the usability around it would be degraded of course so um so that's kind of how we how we went about it um those are those are really the two primary things that are uh centralized right now um the remainder of the network yeah so when you said that you were gonna ask your team that was the centralized company that you were asking and then so would there be when you say there are other companies that are working on audience the protocol then would there be cases where like we might end up with more than one audio app or more than one audio website and okay so that's a great question yeah i'm i'm nodding for everyone listening yeah yes so actually you know uh uh this isn't uh uh i think as as broadly known or people are always shocked when i tell them this like the majority of listening on audience doesn't come from the audience product i think there are over 50 apps now that exist in in the ecosystem some of which are dedicated music players but many of them are just random other things like someone made this music racing game which is super fun i would recommend everyone try it what is music racing uh uh so it's you're you're in a race car following a track and there are obstacles in the track that are synchronized with the beat of the music um so you sort of like steer around them or you can get these like bonuses by by hitting them um and is it only for select songs or is it like some kind of algorithm so you can do it to any song yeah it's algorithmic so you can do it to any song there are over half a million uh tracks on on audios right so this developer was like i've always wanted to make this game but i never had enough like tracks to to do it with sounds fun yeah yeah yeah so um so yeah anyone can build uh their own audios app uh there are even some kind of um institutional players in the music ecosystem that want to build like customized streaming experiences for example right um or or some artists are wanting to build like kind of a uh uh like a fan club structure around their uh uh you know streaming kind of front on audio so so yeah it's a really really neat uh ecosystem that's kind of sprung up around this um but uh yeah the the cool thing here is because that like any um programmatic interaction that happens with the network from the core uh uh you know app that our team puts out can be replicated by or or even co-opted by any third-party product too right like there's no special permissioning or something and when you use the audios app on your phone your phone is actually going and talking directly to nodes on the network um there's no interaction happening with uh with our company for like normal use of the product right outside of uh the the couple of exceptions that i mentioned so um so uh so yeah it's like my ether wallet or my crypto yes yeah exactly right where there those apps are able to talk directly to uh ethereum and do what they need yeah well so it's funny actually that we're ending on this note because my next question is is really relatable to this you know my ether wallet session my crypto thing so when signing up the service also sends an email to the user saying audience cannot reset your password and then and so by the way like i'm sure this is ultra confusing for non-crypto people i understood what you were saying but i i should just point out right underneath that is a big button saying reset my password or reset your password or whatever so um i was curious like so i didn't click it because i was like this this is like some you know like emergency button and i'm not in an emergency so i'm not going to click this right now but i was curious like if i were to click it what what would happen um and and like yeah i i'm assuming it's not something that goes through your company well i don't i have no idea what what what goes on yeah so uh uh what you're interacting with is this kind of novel uh account management solution that our team developed called uh hedgehog which is sort of a reference or homage to uh there's this parable of the fox and and the hedgehog right and uh you know the fox is is quick and agile and can do many many different things whereas the hedgehog is only really good at like becoming a ball and then it's spiky and predators can't get it right so what we were trying to say with the parable there is like metamask is this amazing swiss army knife um but for an end user it's like very difficult to to set up and and use um whereas this hedgehog solution is like dead simple from a user's perspective but it makes a significant number of trade-offs that may or may not make it make sense in other applications but we felt around audience it made sense so long story short what it does is when you sign up for audios you put in a username and password in the app either on your phone or on desktop and then your browser is actually using that input to encrypt a locally generated uh entropy that secures your wallet basically right so there's locally generated private key encrypted locally with that data um and then that encrypted blob is actually what gets emailed to you uh uh so so uh that email that you get is actually a self-contained like ability to recover your account it's not even password reset per se because you could just re-encrypt the same wallet with a different thing but um we actually were able to set up a a mail relay service with no logs enabled and no retention of the messages that it sends so basically that mail relay is your browser at the time you sign up sends your key to this mail relay which sends it to your email and then that's effectively the backup of of your your private key is in that email so it's it's literally like embedded in the link that when you click that button could let you recover uh your account like if you forget your password uh uh basically so um so yeah you calling it password reset was a misnomer we actually have tried three or four different uh sets of verbiage on that button uh but all of them confused users more than this one which is why we kept it there even though it's not it's not resetting your password right it's like you can just set a new password on the same on the same information um yeah people just got so confused by it it's like i would suggest that the email says something like audience the company cannot you know reset your password you can reset it yourself um using this button or something because like to say we audience can't reset it and then right underneath is a button saying reset it like i think just like from user experience like i'm not mixing these things but i yeah anyway not like i'm you you don't have to know you're right you're absolutely right and uh i think it just shows how uh uh how challenging usability in crypto still is right like this is not the fact that like the basic questions of how do you access your account don't have like well accepted solutions that the whole world follows is like it's also so cool right so it means that we're all like still you know you're still super early uh to this if you're listening to this right and thinking about questions like this right um but uh uh you know we need to do better as a community right like this is not you know so audience today as uh over six million people listening every month and over a hundred thousand artists have uploaded um we do feel strongly that like it would never have been possible to get to this level of usage without making some trade-offs around uh you know like i think we can all agree that storing a private key in your email is not like a a super secure way to do that but we also go to great lengths to instruct users not to store any meaningful amount of funds in in their audience wallet and then there's also a mechanism to connect third-party wallets so you can uh connect a meta mask wallet as well you can connect uh uh you know like a number of other you know anything that's like wallet connectable right so um so yeah there's again there's there's trade-offs i think with with all of these things but you know i i i do you know i think i i am very proud of the work that like our community has done to try to make this accessible to uh to a broader audience because the majority of of users of audience today have no idea there's any crypto there uh which is pretty cool right um you know they just want to come listen to cool music and hang out with their friends yeah and i have a bunch of questions for you about building a crypto product for non-crypto people um but just because this is a crypto show i do want to ask one question because this is something i think my audience cares about for whatever reason just you know how tribal crypto can be um so obviously solana and ethereum i think you know for a lot of people are seen as somewhat competitive and you've kind of embraced both and i was curious like why that is and just as a builder what you thought ethereum was good for what solana was good for etc totally um and i i uh at a super high level like i i think this tribalism is is really damaging unfortunately you're right like these are tools right like there's no like the hammer tribe doesn't get mad at like the mallet tribe because they they you know one is slightly better at some things and one is slightly better at other things money is involved so oh i know and i wish i wish it could be that pure and straightforward as i just put it but that genuinely is how i you know as a builder in the ecosystem think about it i mean these are these are tools like uh they they are built for a purpose and you know you can use them for various purposes and you know uh uh with that uh aside you know i'll give the feedback that's you know probably gonna get me flamed by both sides uh afterwards right um i think the network effect around ethereum is is just so powerful um and that's that's you know that's even the first uh that's the first community in crypto that like i really became part of and got excited about like uh prior to audience i uh uh was a full-time investor at kleiner perkins and and what really got me excited about crypto more broadly was this ability to program like anything with it right um you know i i like bitcoin i thought it was cool but um ethereum in my mind just especially as a software engineer thinking about it just like opened up this whole world of like really cool stuff you can make right and the network effect around that persists right everything from uh you know the ecosystem around uh tokens and wallets and uh everything right like the moment that the audience network launched um it was supported by like hundreds or even thousands of third-party applications without any of them like asking us or us asking them to do anything right like just happened solana you know by contrast i think rather than trying to be everything to everyone uh took the approach of being really really really damn fast and like good at uh a specific set of use cases which you know so happens to uh overlap really really well with what audience needs as well as it overlaps with um you know some things like the serum decks and and other things right um from a usability perspective uh uh you know solana lets us confirm things to users far far faster it lets us um you know just do much more right the average audience user never actually touches ethereum right like if six million people were touching ethereum every month uh uh you know from audience right i think we would uh we would be creating a lot of problems for the ecosystem it would also probably be costing like you know tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars in gas right so you know i think what i love about solana is that um by by being focused by saying you know we're we're not gonna be uh uh you know try and be everything to everyone but we're going to be really really really great for the people who need a significant amount of scale or have usability constraints that um you know ethereum can't serve it's a fantastic solution for that right um so you know i think they they both have a place in this world as do many other uh uh tools right keep in mind these are tools right uh uh and different tools can be good at different things right like uh i i think uh that's yeah that's where i'd finish off on all right so yeah now let's talk about the user growth because you know i do think you know as you said it's not obvious at all when you go to this website or the app that it's a crypto project and i would be curious to hear you know from your perspective how did you get the community to grow to the point where you now have more than six million monthly users yeah i mean i think the credit all lies with uh with that very community right um our little project team that built the first version of of audience and now has like a much more diminished role in the ecosystem just given the the size and the scope of uh all the the various work that's going on that the foundation supports and and other things for our little team of 20 people to be uh supporting six million users just would never have been possible without the community's kind of embrace and uh support and active work being done to to do that right um i've been explaining this a lot to uh traditional tech people lately because you know as i mentioned that's like the the world that i kind of came from before before working on audience and uh people are just shocked when they hear that you know our team is so tiny and uh we're not that tiny compared to other crypto projects right like everyone here listening knows that but when the community is effectively the marketing team the hosting team and infrastructure team um they are like an extended developer team um you know they're like more community people building uh uh with audience than there are like you know people at my company um you know you can do so much more by like opening up um opening up those those uh uh floodgates right and were there like any pivotal moments where you felt like oh that is what really you know got like this yeah like were there kind of like bursts of new users that that came to the platform yeah so i can i can just talk uh quickly through like our history so you know we just uh uh the the product launched publicly in september of 2019 um and that was in like an incentivized test net uh capacity right um from 2019 to like mid 2020 or so we grew in these little fits and starts but we're mostly going sideways right the thing that was growing was the base of content uploaded to the network um because you know content doesn't go away right with people as new users come they upload more content content can grow linearly even if usage is like flat over time right and uh in retrospect uh uh you know i i don't think we realized this at the time but there was an inflection point that the network hit around uh like 80 to 100 000 tracks um uh where there was enough music here that when a random user showed up uh uh from the dance community which was really where our early bread and butter in terms of usage was they would find stuff that they liked right and then they would engage and they would stay and do more um and and there was you know around august or so of of 2020 was really when we saw those metrics all kind of shift in in lockstep and my only guess as to why that happened was because there was like enough content here um from then so that was in august of of 2020 uh they're around i think 100 to 120 000 monthly users on on audios uh today they're over six million um and uh uh you know it hasn't hasn't been that long since then right i think it's just when like a viral feedback loop around a a kind of network driven product starts to work it like it has this runaway effect right um because it's self-reinforcing like if more content increases user engagement and retention the increased user engagement and retention means more artists see that and say oh there's an audience here and i want to serve them which leads to more content which then leads so it's like this this virtuous cycle that um kind of is is self-perpetuating but it's like really hard to get started i i the analogy i like to give people is like think think about like pushing a rock up a hill and at some point you crest the hill and the rock starts rolling away and then you're just chasing it and doing the best you can to keep up with it right because it goes faster and faster as it goes down so like uh uh i think the community has been able to scale um uh the level of support and and uh work that they do for one another um in a way that like our company never could have right um and i think that's what allowed us to grow so quickly um if we if we had been like a a uh company that controlled all this infrastructure control all of this like you know even the cost of hosting all of this uh let alone the cost of like you know just basic customer support like people ask questions all the time and stuff you know we would need to be like hundreds of people the service uh uh the amount of demand that exists here so so i do think the community uh uh owned aspect of the network allowed growth to to multiply and to reinforce itself but ultimately it's just it's just the nature of a network i think that that led to this right it was just crossing over some critical mass or like a tipping point or whatever you know uh however you want to describe it at some point it just you know things clicked and started working and so for the big name artists on the platform like skrillex or deadmau5 diplo like how did that happen did they just hear about it through word of mouth or did you approach them directly or you know like how do you get these artists with this level of name recognition to join yeah so uh uh in you know i'll talk about those three and then uh talk about like artists uh more broadly so uh dead mouse was actually one of our earliest supporters um at audios we started talking to his team in like late 2018. that was like a few minutes oh you reached out yes yeah so we we got in touch with uh uh him and his team um and uh he had specifically been looking for something around this i mean actually one of the early theses like when we were thinking about audience was you know really looking at like what title did or tried to do early on which was to to say like we're going to make all of the uh artists that use title like owners of title they literally went and like issued um stock warrants to to uh those early artists um that were on that were on title um the early kind of target list that we went after because we took a lot of inspiration from that right i think uh they they fumbled a lot of things along the way um i'm hopeful that under new ownership they can uh find find their footing and find their way to you know some cool stuff but but dead mouse uh joel was one of the uh earliest supporters of of title um so when he i think when when like our little you know uh email intro like crossed over their plate they kind of had you know pattern recognized like oh we've seen this before like this is interesting we want to learn more so yeah he was an interesting case skrillex and diplo are more kind of the typical case which is uh you know a mix of like us messaging them for months and years uh or whatever and then eventually they hear about it from enough of their own community of fans as well as other artists that they follow right so um you know there's a lot of a lot of neat content has broken out on on audio or like been shared on audio exclusively or for the first time so a lot of folks were just forced to start uh uh engaging and hanging out on the platform not necessarily uploading their own stuff but just to like stay on top of what what trends are emerging um and this has always been like niche by niche and those niches aggregate and slowly roll up to larger and larger audiences like one of the earliest niches that uh got really excited about audience was this jersey club community uh which is like a specific uh they have a specific sound of music that they produce um there are a few really influential and notable folks in that community like rel and a couple of others that you know kind of anchor it and um you know a few of those really early folks just happened to come across like some press we got around the product uh launched like in 2019 and we're like oh this is cool we're to try it and that was enough to get the whole community on and uh those people retained and engaged really really well so so for a diplo or a skrillex i think the sentiment that needs to exist for them to want to engage with a new product is that enough of their peers and enough of their fans are already there right um so so uh so yeah we slowly rolled up to that um uh and uh today most uh most of our work on artist advocacy is just fielding inbound uh which you know it's just the tables like turn very dramatically right um we stopped being able to do outreach uh but you know in the early days like i would just sit in dm and cold email people and be like please try this uh you know like and you know yeah uh today things are things are you know we we just couldn't couldn't keep uh keep doing that um uh given the scale that we were at so like even starting to rely on the community more to educate one another um and and uh advocate this you know more more broadly more publicly so our artist advocacy work today is really focused on helping audience appeal to uh new and and different types of music creators and music listeners so um you know as i i mentioned like our early user bases has been mostly dance musicians there are a lot more folks in in hip-hop coming on now and latin music's the other area we've seen a ton of growth more recently a lot of that has been driven by kind of i think those communities being functionally similar in a lot of ways to the way dance communities are right like it's it's um uh it's less top-down structured organized content and much more this like grassroots like things emerge from from this like diaspora of like crazy things happening or whatever um and audience is much more well suited i think to that like kind of uh grassroots bottoms up sort of approach than uh you know like the very top down like you know like institutionalized content kind of approach right um uh yeah so it's kind of amazing we went this far without getting into the tick tock deal so we have to do that now because we're already over time so audience was selected as tick tock's partner to enable song transfers on the platform what does that mean and why is this such a big deal yeah so uh uh just just setting some some context to kick us off like um it's actually not very easy to upload audio into tiktok um you'd be surprised like the the way the ways that people do it like because how do you get like an audio file like an mp3 file or something onto your phone right um you know people will email it to themselves and then like put it into the files app on ios and then depending on your permissions tiktok may or may not be able to access it um it's actually like not not very simple to a point that like there are artists in our community that will hold their phone up to their laptop and like play the track and record it into tick tock because it's easier to do that than to go through this uh this rigger mural so what the audience integration enables is a solution to this problem so you can uh uh in audience on any track that you yourself uploaded um there's a a one-click shared a tick-tock button um and if you click that uh uh the content gets pushed into uh uh your tick tock account so if you're you basically if you're using the audio mobile app and then yep assuming that you have tick tock installed it just opens tick tock and pushes the content over so the reason that's i think you know exciting for the audience network and and community right is that it it now for the first time lets artists uh kind of draw on the audience they have on tick tock uh there are some folks uh in audience like wookie for example and dylan francis is another one i mean there are people with millions of followers on tick tock right that they haven't been able to monetize very well to date they now have a chance to to kind of start to uh draw some of that audience over to uh audience because the sound when it's in tik tok actually shows as oh it came from audience and whatnot so we actually even as a result of that you know there's been a significant kind of uptick in uh usage metrics just from people seeing those sounds starting to float around on tick tock on the tick tock side of things i think uh uh the reason you know they were excited about this was uh uh it just you know it made it easier for artists to to upload stuff um and it's also worth saying like we're not the only um application that has that functionality so like ableton and uh some other uh sort of like audio production tools have have this natively as well um but we are the first streaming service to to have it so i i think for the the kind of um average creator uh this has been a much lower kind of friction way to get content into tick tock than to like go into their you know ableton and and set up a new export and do all this sort of stuff so yeah and so you know obviously audience doesn't have the artist base or even you know the anyone here the number of songs that like a spotify or apple music has and i did read you have close contacts i guess at tik tok um but i'm sure also you must have had something in your pitch that they found compelling like or or maybe it doesn't matter to them the number of songs that are available like like do you have a sense of you know what it was that appealed to them about choosing a platform that really is you know still so much smaller than these other ones that could have been selected yeah so i think a couple of things there um i i don't think this is like a mutually exclusive sort of uh uh thing right like tick tock is is within their rights to uh enable other platforms to do it too uh however um i don't think spotify for example has the rights to redistribute content that's in spotify right so uh a lot of folks don't don't realize this for everyone listening you actually can't upload things to spotify yourself if you're a musician you have to sign up for a third-party distributor service and you give them your content and they push it into spotify um so it would actually be the distributor's kind of role to to push it into tick tock as well not uh spotify's so um you know all that said who knows maybe they will strike uh some new licensing structure that allows them to to do that um but uh in in the case of audience right um you know the the user who uh uploads and manages the account has you know the the full control of that content so if they are the ones that's that's why only the person who uploaded it is able to actually push it into tick tock um you know that's the equivalent of them like doing a drag and drop upload just directly to tick tock it just so happens that tick tock doesn't really have a a good you know a good user experience or workflow around that so um so yeah i think it was just a matter of um there aren't really a you know i kind of referenced this earlier like audios is some parts distributor some parts streaming service um there's no other like hybrid kind of approach that that covers both sides yeah it's like because it's just a flatter structure that is yeah that's fascinating actually i mean there's so many things about how crypto networks will change business funnels that i find really fascinating but this is like a prime example um okay so we're well over time but i just want to ask what's next for audience what do you have up and coming over the next several months yeah so uh uh there's so much coming up uh and so much that i don't even know is coming up because there are like just people in the community working on on cool stuff but the things that i'm personally most excited about at least are uh monetization tools being much more fleshed out over over the coming months um there there's uh a lot of interesting stuff in um uh in the pipeline that uh uh will help uh artists like better understand and segment their audience so like a lot of artists today just don't really have good answers to basic questions like who are my fans how do they find my content stuff like this so all of that raw data exists in audience right now but uh uh you know you need tools to be able to explore it and like understand it like think like bi tools for artists so really excited about that um as well um and then yeah i mean i think you're gonna continue to see more and more artists in new and different genres or areas of music onboarding and getting excited so uh so yeah i mean i think uh uh you know the best the best time is yesterday but uh the next best time is today to get started on a new platform and and building a new following so um and yeah you you don't have to be a musician uh to use audience there's actually a very robust sort of curator ecosystem as well so if you want to help make playlists if you want to um you know help curate content by reposting and engaging with it um there there's a whole kind of ecosystem of folks on on that side as well so i think we're just going to see more more of all of that i guess uh but in yeah the concrete features i mentioned are are things that i'm super excited about great well this has been so fun where can people learn more about you and audience yeah so uh you can learn more about audience at uh audience.org um or at audious.com so uh audios.org is kind of you know the information put put out by the foundation um audience.co is is the company that i work on and there's a user experience there that lets you play with the product and engage um and then uh yeah go follow uh follow the project on on twitter at it's it's just at uh audios aud ius project p-r-o-j-e-c-t um that's where all the best news and updates about the network can be found perfect well thank you so much for coming on unchained thanks for having me thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about
