liquidity providers today's topic due to the recent events that tesla would stop accepting bitcoin as payment because of its environmental impact is going to be bitcoin fiat currencies and their energy footprints here to discuss the issue are alex gladstein chief strategy officer of the human rights foundation and james mcginnis ceo and co-founder of david energy welcome alex and david thanks for having us thanks for having us so alex you've been on the show before but why don't you briefly describe what it is that you do and how you came to research and compare fiat fiat currencies in particular the petrodollar against bitcoin from a human rights and environmental impact perspective sure sure so i've been working at the human rights foundation since 2007 so uh almost 15 years in the human rights field and about five years ago i really started looking at finance and currency from a human rights point of view and really started to explore why people around the world were using bitcoin in authoritarian regimes and in emerging markets and in high inflation environments and that has driven a lot of my thinking and a lot of ahrefs work ever since as far as my article uh uncovering the hidden cost of the petrodollar it was really inspired by these like continued comparisons of bitcoin's energy use with um it and it's like kind of carbon footprint and how you know people really are are interested in looking at the negative externalities of bitcoin uh kind of without looking at the positive externalities meaning you know usually when i'm hearing stuff in the mainstream media it's heavily focused on the negative and very little on the positive which is the opposite for fiat currency so like you know the dollar system people argue about how to run it but like very few people talk about what powers it and what are the negative externalities of the of essentially dollar hegemony um you know when you make that swipe on your visa card versus making a bitcoin payment you know the bitcoin payment wears everything on its sleeve like you could literally see you know how much energy it's using essentially by making a couple calculations whereas that visa swipe is you know rests on this enormous infrastructure uh of not just that company but the entire financial and banking system and and ultimately resting on what what some people call you know the dollar or the treasury bill standard which is like the world reserve currency and there's a lot that goes into propping that up uh over the last 50 years since the us and the world went off the gold standard in 1971 and i wanted to explore that and a lot of it has to do with human rights because basically to keep the dollar in its primacy sort of status the u.s has done a lot of supporting dictators for example uh instigated foreign conflicts and then on the environmental side of course you know helped prop up the fossil fuel industry uh and and this has led to actually a lot of like domestic consequences as well with regard to inequality uh and wage stagnation so so that was my that's where i came from and why i'm interested in talking about this all right and james why don't you tell us about your background and david energy and also your interest in crypto yeah great um thanks for having me um so yeah my background actually i did uh kind of physics and math as an undergrad and was always interested in the energy transition and i guess climate and then energy within sort of the climate change movement and how um we could decarbonize our electricity system in order to uh fight fight climate change um and then that sort of culminated in a uh i went on to do my master's in mechanical engineering and while doing so got very tied up in i guess what you would call the distributed energy resource space so these new technologies like evs solar battery storage smart thermostats backup generators energy devices that go in homes and buildings the grid is becoming very distributed in a lot of ways because of these these assets and they're also digitally native which is very new compared to say a coal plant so i was looking at doing my phd in battery storage science so we could have better technologies that bring batteries down the cost curve which are important to sort of ensure that we can run a grid with lots of renewables like solar and wind because when there's no solar there's no sun out and there's no wind blowing you don't have power so we need things like batteries uh in order to make sure our lights stay on even with lots of renewables i was also working actually in local solar plus design solar plus storage design and engineering work like doing installations kind of from from the ground up and ultimately just got very obsessed with how to integrate these devices into energy markets you know energy markets because these assets are distributed are changing in a very fundamental way and i just got very interested in that problem and how to leverage a battery in someone's garage into an electricity market versus like a coal plant that's 200 miles away from that garage it's very very very different processes um so i'd say just you know if you're hearing words like distributed uh you're probably thinking crypto so as as part of that actually while i was doing my master's um i think you know around 2016 just when bitcoin started uh one of its big run-ups i i got very interested in just the sort of general idea around decentralization and distributed systems and have been sort of a follower of of the space since and as for for david energy i mean that formed we founded that out of that sort of exploration of that problem and what we do is we actually buy electricity for customer homes and buildings a lot of people think utilities do this but actually in 20 states you can be a private company that does that and we have a technology platform that integrates with these devices like smart thermostats batteries evs and we control them in real time with our software very simply we're out buying supply and we can control demand so when prices are running up in the market we can tell your ev to stop charging we can discharge a battery in your home so that your demand is lowering on the grid and so i think sort of bringing this full circle uh we're actually sort of looking to start offering a product in the market where as as you guys have probably heard bitcoin miners can stop their mining operations as as prices go up uh there's a very valuable resource to the grid in our mind and so we could effectively offer uh bitcoin miners cheaper power if they let us tell them when to turn on and off essentially so um you know i think uh some some way or another all of those uh uh interests intersected over over time in bitcoin and distributed energy resources and i'd say you know on top of that i like to say that that energy systems are not fungible meaning as we shift from this very heavily fossil fuel and oil based uh sort of institution in a lot of ways over that we've built up over the last century it's gonna have massive downstream consequences for our politics our currency systems trade uh you know who has hegemony within within you know whether it's the us and china and all these these the euro like uh european union like all these nations sort of getting on board with this energy transition uh so i spend a lot of time thinking about just what what that's going to look like and the role that things like bitcoin will play and so i loved alex's article uh on uh the the petrodollar system i've been reading a lot about that lately and um just excited to to try and uh wrap all these things together yeah actually um what you were saying about the idea of how you can easily turn on and off bitcoin miners and have them run when the electricity prices are lower this goes to that white paper that square and arc invest published which we'll cover later but first let's dive into the news last wednesday elon musk the ceo of tesla tweeted an announcement saying that tesla has suspended vehicle purchases using bitcoin and his announcement said quote we are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for bitcoin mining and transactions especially coal which has the worst emissions of any fuel cryptocurrency is a good idea in many levels and we believe it has a promising future but this cannot come at a great cost to the environment then he said tesla would not be selling any bitcoin because as you may recall it owns um more than a billion dollars worth of bitcoin on its balance sheet and so that it would use bitcoin for transactions as soon as mining transitions to more sustainable energy and then he finished with quote we are looking at other cryptocurrencies that use less than one percent of bitcoin's energy per transaction so given the fact that it's probably unlikely that bitcoin payments for tesla were you know like filling up bitcoin blocks or anything why do you think tesla really stopped accepting bitcoin as payment so for me it's pretty clear i think that elon and his team his master of coin uh correctly assessed that it would be smart from a corporate perspective uh to to have a percentage a small percentage at least of bitcoin on the balance sheet as we enter these like very unpredictable times that we're watching now where you know people are acknowledging there's going to be some level of inflation in america you know not to the extent in the you know that we see in emerging markets perhaps but but certainly you know it's it's happening and everybody's admitting it now so you know in february they said look let's let's put a couple percent of our cash in this and i think that was a correct move however i think what happened probably afterwards was a big backlash by people who believe bitcoin is bad for the environment uh pr led sort of backlash probably you know towards the corporate structure at tesla and you know to respond to that uh i think they sold a little bit of bitcoin um as well as uh made this announcement right and i think the whole dogecoin thing has just sort of been this like fun distraction for elon the whole time i mean all of it is is literally a joke i mean dogecoin was created as a joke uh but he was joking on saturday night live about it i mean it is surreal and you know now he's tweeting about the fact that they're gonna try and look into other coins for accepting payments and and you know moments later he he tweeted that they're working with dogecoin developers i mean he's he's taking the piss i mean there are no dogecoin developers so he continues to have this uh like kind of running joke which is helpful for him because it distracts from whatever drama is happening on the back end and hey everyone just a quick note here the day we recorded decrypt published an article which we did not see until after the recording saying that elon musk has indeed been working with dogecoin developers quote dogecoin developer ross nickel told decrypt by phone on friday that since musk started talking to the developers in 2019 he has quote encouraged them to improve the higher transaction throughput provided lots of advice and input and shared his vast rolodex of contacts and you know my interpretation of that is pretty simple they went into this move from a financial uh strategic perspective it was it was a good call but he's getting a lot of backlash that's i guess my take yeah i mean i i actually couldn't agree more um i i find it very hard to believe that i mean you said a small percentage but i think it was what it was like ten percent of their balance sheet it was a billion and a half dollars or you know i think it was less but yes more than a billion dollars so yeah it was still a billion dollars there's a lot you could do with that um and that took a lot of conviction and to think that you know a couple weeks later they're just reversing on that and elon hadn't properly thought through the climate implications here as someone who spends his his time in climate i mean this has been sort of all over the news for years if you've been following bitcoin so um i mean i definitely see it as when you look at them recently applying for renewable energy credits for just how much esg capital is out there and not wanting to kind of anger make yourself look less esg friendly um it definitely feel we're not even just hurting their brand in general like a sustainable brand it just really seems like it was all this political pressure and doesn't you know really have to do with how elon or tesla thinks about bitcoin and it's also worth james mentioning that the fact that you know they don't make money from selling cars right i mean they make money from this sort of credit scheme they made money from bitcoin um and then they make money from like selling credits to manufacturers like uh chrysler right and then those manufacturers may not be may not be needing to do that anymore right yeah yeah i actually have this tweet storm that you sent me earlier alex um so this woman elizabeth stein hopefully i'm pronouncing her name right um i try to reach out to her to find out what her title was um but i don't know what so i'm just going to say that her twitter bio says esg impact investing sustainable finance fintech comments and content so clearly she you know has some uh knowledge in this area she tweeted that the environmental impact of bitcoin isn't news and she said that elon musk was quote reacting to changes in the renewable energy credit market which is uh rec or rec then she said that tesla makes most of its money from rex not cars and i guess it made 1.5 billion dollars from sales effects to gas powered auto companies which those companies have to buy in order to offset their co2 emissions and she said tesla has actually never been profitable without rac sales but that's about to change because uh one of the biggest companies stelantis a multinational automotive manufacturer will meet carbon emission rules this year and so it won't need to buy rex from tesla anymore and she said that this group which includes fiat chrysler accounts for 2.4 billion dollars of tesla rec sales from 2019 until now and 55 percent of tesla sales since 2008. so her hypothesis is basically tesla now wants to switch to the renewable fuel credit market and it has an application with the epa out um for electric vehicles to qualify for these tradable credits and so her thinking is like you know environmental regulators aren't aren't big fans of bitcoin um so i you know i think there's a lot to be said for that because you know if we just look at the fact that you know tesla did buy more than a billion dollars worth of bitcoin it sure has not sold more than a billion dollars worth of tesla's using bitcoin or being paid for in bitcoin so if they really really cared about the environmental impact then like that's the part of their actions around bitcoin that they would have you know probably uh curtailed or or um you know done something about but instead they did kind of the window dressing side in my right they would have divested right exactly let's maybe just kind of zoom out a little bit because i think what we've also seen this year is like there's been um this influx of kind of what i would call normies you know not kind of die hard crypto people that were into crypto from the starter or even just from a few years ago and um we saw with that nft craze that when all these non-encrypted people kind of got interested in the technology there was a backlash against proof of work consensus algorithms at that point as well and so i just wondered um i was curious you know james like you're an energy person you are into crypto and i just wondered like how do you view this kind of like so-called environmental problem about a proof-of-work consensus algorithms why are you not saying oh you know i would only support proof-of-stake coins or you know was your take on that yeah um i mean i think you know first leading with just my uh understanding it's not as extensive either of yours of of cryptocurrencies i haven't come across a coin or a crypto uh currency that you know the energy intensity is a feature not a bug right it's what it's what creates security and if you're to start reducing energy intensity you're probably going to start reintroducing like trusted third parties so um when it comes to bitcoin i don't put out there like oh well why don't we just find a coin with uh you know less energy intensity and we can use that because i understand that from a technology standpoint that's actually what makes bitcoin so fantastic um and i you know on the other side of it uh from like the the climate aspect of this at the end of the day i don't think we should be making value judgments really on discriminating against one form of electricity consumption or another like you could get mad at pool heaters right i mean it's if bitcoin exists i don't think anyone should be out there saying go ban it so if you're in the climate community you have to understand that this is here to stay it should stay i don't think we should be censoring this so the question then is is what do we do about it and how do we make it sort of as uh value-add as as as possible what's the positive externalities here as alex had had mentioned and that's when you start looking at like what the petra dollar system looks like today uh you know if you if you compare it to the us dollars uh emissions track record um it start looks it starts looking a lot more favorable but um i think at the end of the day in that debate there's there's really only two things that matter one this comes down to whether you think bitcoin has utility or not and what i see happening in the debate is on the sort of um anti-bitcoin side they're kind of grasping at energy consumption as a way to discredit bitcoin but on the pro bitcoin side there's now like a lot of talk about how it's good for the grid as a way to combat that narrative so um as an energy person kind of sitting in the middle like i i think a lot of times it's actually people arguing about whether bitcoin has utility or not and not they're just finding things that can support an argument right um and and the second piece is we should be decarbonizing the grid anyways like that's just a fact uh or my perspective so um if bitcoin is to be using electricity well let's focus on the root problem here which is which is decarbonizing the grid um so i don't know if that's kind of you know there's a lot of uh layers there but uh ultimately i'm pro bitcoin and i'm pro uh decarbonizing the grid so i don't see those things as mutually exclusive what so whatsoever yeah and as we were discussing before the show tesla cars often plug themselves into outlets that are probably drawing from exactly yeah fossil fuel uh energy so um but alex so in a different form of zooming out let's look at the other type of currency that tesla accepts for its cars um which is obviously dollars you wrote a very extensive piece on the petrodollar and it was really an amazing deep dive can you kind of compare the impact of the petrodollar versus bitcoin yeah so i'll try to do a very abbreviated um overview uh but before i do that it's worth just uh dwelling on this point that james made which is excellent which is if you don't think bitcoin is worthwhile uh of course then you see the whole thing as a waste right so i think that's kind of where the debate should really be right now is uh informing people that it is a tremendous value to many around the world who don't have the same financial privilege that people have in you know europe or japan or the united states so you know just remember there's like 1.2 billion people out there who live in double and triple digit inflation there's 4.3 billion out out there living under authoritarianism it's not so easy for them to transact save open up a credit line uh send money to family and friends everything's a struggle and their local currency literally depreciates very quickly their time and energy and the fruits of their labors uh are disappearing in front of their eyes so let's be a little you know careful here and you know my suggestion to those who are you know who basically say bitcoin has no social value you know i'd love to see them commit to using the sudanese pound for one year for as their store of value and payment rail and then come back to me and say that bitcoin's value is overblown or doesn't exist i mean it is literally a lifeline for people out there so um where i came from on the zoom out here is that bitcoin is like you start to understand it in layers so even elon gets that at the surface level its actual value proposition is as an inflation hedge right i think a lot of people are starting to understand that even if they don't believe it that's at least the narrative that like people are beginning to understand uh largely sparked by michael saylor and and microstrategy right this sort of corporate sort of inflation edge dig down a little deeper and then you start seeing it as like this tool for individual freedom and human rights um and maybe a lot of people won't go further than that but you know when you keep digging you actually start to see that it's a it's a geopolitical disrupter um and i think the important thing here and the irony of elon saying we're not gonna take bitcoin anymore for payments but we're gonna keep taking the dollar is that bitcoin is not a competitor to visa it's not a competitor to ethereum it's not a competitor to uh paypal or or venmo or wechat bitcoin is actually a competitor to uh the world reserve currency um which i will call the petrodollar that's what its ultimate mission is is to replace the petrodollar uh and you can look at all of satoshi's early writings and you can confirm that this is what he or she was was really trying to do was like was basically create this parallel system that had a different rule set at the very base right now just real quick um as far as the history of what is the petro dollar we had the british who were dominant in the 19th century financially the british pound but after world war one uh the fate of war-torn europe was um was was difficult and the united states emerged as like the largest creditor nation right so that gave us a lot of negotiation negotiative power heading into bretton woods so at the end of world war ii uh all the allies got together and they said what are we gonna do uh with the gold standard and uh you know the british under john maynard keynes they wanted to come up with this thing called the bancor and have everybody be part of like making decisions together on a unit of account called the bancorp but the us had so much leverage because we had so much gold and we we had so much you know credit these are the other nations that we could push through our plan which was that everybody would hold dollars uh or u.s debt right as as their savings other central banks uh which would be convertible uh two gold at 35 dollars an ounce and that largely you know was the brettonwood system it lasted for decades um but after jfk was assassinated the u.s took like a very different turn with its spending uh it's commonly referred to as guns and butter right so you had both the the ramp up of the vietnam war which was the first war ever fought on credit usually wars were fought uh significantly with taxes but but um the american government didn't want to raise taxes they wanted to continue to expand this war against you know essentially was the soviets um so they kept leveraging it up um and this created a deficit issue in conjunction with lyndon b johnson's great society programs so the rest of the world was looking at this and they were saying wait a second we don't think the u.s can hold the peg to gold and the french and the british were both really upset about this de gaulle and his and his cabinet called uh you know the us as having like the exorbitant privilege essentially of being able to mint the world reserve currency they were upset by that and it came to a head in august of 71 when the french sent a battleship to new york city to try and reclaim their gold a couple days later nixon you know went on tv and ended the gold standard essentially closing the gold window and telling the american people that no other government would be able to redeem uh dollars for for gold any longer now this was a period of intense economic crisis uh high inflation um about 18 months later uh we had the yom kippur war uh obviously politically relevant to what's happening now um in the middle east and as punishment for us supporting israel the saudis and the other opec nation oil exporting nations uh dropped an embargo on the united states and oil essentially quadrupled in price um this was very bad for the u.s in many different ways and nixon president nixon at the time and kissinger who was his most powerful kind of deputy uh figure tried to figure out a solution to keeping the dollar's value up while it was no longer attached to gold right so after the after that we went off the gold standard the dollar devalued by 10 so we started entering a lot of inflation right in this decade so the creation of the petrodollar was like a solution to this issue of how do we keep everybody else wanting to continue to buy dollars in u.s debt well the solution was to tie it to the export of oil right so uh saudi arabia which had just become the world's sort of swing oil exporter the most important one in opec and they controlled 80 percent of the world's oil reserves what they were able to do uh was have this negotiation with the us the crown prince came to washington dc in june of 74. nixon went to saudi arabia a week later and the new treasury secretary simon went to jeddah later that year and they ironed out which is essentially this sort of pact where what the saudis would do was um export oil in dollars so if you want to buy oil from the saudis or opec nations you had to do it in dollars okay and number two they would they would recycle that income back into u.s debt so that's what they had to do and on our side we would sell them tons of weapons like not in a market way but like in a non-market very political way and also protect and defend them so that was like the deal and we're still in that deal today right so like the influence of the petrodollar has waned over time but it was extremely strong in the 70s extremely strong in the 80s it really helped with the fight against the soviet union soviet union had to dig oil out of the ground we could print it literally um but but there was no other bretton woods after 89 so after the soviet union fell we didn't get together as a world and say um hey uh let's let's figure out a new system no we like but the u.s pressed on with this unipolar moment right and you know what the the threat actually to the dollar was the euro right so that was like the the idea at the time was that maybe we could go into this bipolar world again like in the 1920s you kind of had the pound and the dollar right so look i mean the euro was seen as a real serious threat by u.s policymakers um and i think and my thesis in my article is that the us fought really hard to protect dollar primacy throughout the 2000s um and you know just just to state some facts and the audience you know you all can can have your own opinions on what they mean um the biggest threat to the dollar came in the form of something called the petro euro uh saddam hussein in october of 2000 uh announced he was gonna sell oil in euros by 2002 he was selling five percent of the world's oil in euros to france and germany uh march 2003 the us aided by the uk invaded iraq throughout saddam by june of 2003 iraq was selling dollars oil for dollars again so there's a lot of ways to interpret that but um look iraq war was like the fundamental thing of my life as an as an american who grew up at that time and there's no consensus on why we invaded it's kind of crazy people call it a war in search of a reason still there's no like no one everybody agrees it wasn't for human rights and it wasn't for uh wnds because those didn't exist and it wasn't because of 911 because there was no connection between saddam and and and iraq so yeah you know there's a lot of reasons but at the end of the day i think this is a compelling one um i think america had the power to protect the dollar against against the euro but i think that started to wane so in the in the in the last decade i think our influence has started to wane and 2013 was the big year when china stopped sort of buying u.s treasuries so this petrodollar system that was kicked off by the oil exporters buying all of our debt and allowing us to finance all these social programs and invasions around the world in our fight against the soviets that was they sort of handed the baton to the europeans who bought all our debt and then the japanese bought all our debt and then the chinese started buying all our debt after 2001 when they entered the wto but after 2013 everybody was like wait a second kind of like vibes from the late 60s we don't think the u.s can hold this together anymore so the world has been like unloading us treasuries since that year and now the u.s government is the major purchaser of our own debt so that brings us to today where i think the petrodollar system isn't is in like a decline but still i mean the dollar is 60 of the world's foreign exchange reserves something like forty percent of all the world's debt is issued in dollars it's down from its apex which i would say was probably anywhere from five to ten years ago um and russia and china are now starting to do a lot of trade in their own currencies and in the euro this is just going to continue to expand and the dollar is going to continue to slide so my thesis essentially in the in the paper is that we could be heading towards a bitcoin standard so it may not be you know the yuan standard it may not be the euro standard it may not even be like a multi-polar world it could very well be that you know you have this lineage essentially from the gold standard uh to the treasury bill or dollar standard to the bitcoin standard and i'm very intrigued by that from human rights point of view because you know today four percent of the world's population gets to make the decisions for everybody because we as americans control the um reserve currency and this creates like really big stressors on other countries because they have to design their economies in a way where they can accumulate dollars they also have to go like get dollars to to like advance and industrialize themselves whereas we can literally just print it um so this privilege this uh exorbitant privilege has allowed the us to do exorbitant amounts of spending on social programs and military stuff but i think that is like kind of coming to an end um it may be even good for us though because i think that the bitcoin standard it's kind of interesting this idea of like the world settling all of its balance of payments different nations on this neutral open asset what's cool about it is that dictatorships the people that i fight against in my day job they don't mix very well with open and neutral open capital markets free speech property rights that's not good for them and bitcoin literally is free speech property rights free expression uh you know open open capital markets so i think the us is actually dynamically placed really well to capitalize in a bitcoin standard without all the downsides that have come with our uh not just our privilege but also our burden of having to support the saudis the all throughout all these decades these monsters who destroy yemen torture female political prisoners murder khashoggi don't have to do that anymore we don't have to like invade other countries to to to to protect dollar primacy we don't have to prop up the fossil fuel industry and attack nuclear energy and prevent other countries from becoming energy independent and we don't have to keep pushing the financialization of the world which has led to massive inequality in the united states where defense finance real estate um services technology have exploded but the the industrial clash has completely disintegrated because when the dollar's so strong we can't export anymore so i i see actually hope in this system um and i think it's rich that people are attacking elon for uh you know taking bitcoin as payments when they should be a lot more critical of him taking the dollar for payments yeah and we're going to dive into that in a moment because you know just what you were saying about how our dollar is really so tied to energy and a fossil fuel energy you know i think it's fascinating i think it's something a lot of people don't think about aren't even aware of and um just the way that you tie it all together with the full kind of social impact you know it really goes to the heart of that um term esg which i had to google for the show but it's environmental social and governance impact and i was like oh wow so alex's thesis here about the petro dollar it kind of encompasses all of those things and so i just i find that really fascinating but first we're going to take a quick word from the sponsors who make

who's head of portfolio growth at soundventures wrote and was called think btc is a dirty business consider the carbon cost of a dollar and so she says things like quote it is important to note here that this connectivity between the dollar and oil is not an abstraction just as alex described she said the u.s dollar literally owes its continued reserve currency status and resulting global economic hegemony to oil via a series of implicit and explicit agreements that make up the petrodollar system she then goes on to explain that the us military uses more than 100 million barrels of oil per year and that that generates the equivalent 59 million tons of co2 and then she said this doesn't even begin to account for the carbon cost of the global banking system or of printing and maintaining physical currency and so um you know can you just kind of expound a little bit more on yeah this comparison between bitcoin and uh fiat currency when it comes to its environmental impact yeah you know i think what's interesting there is you know it's it's i mean even if you ask economists it like what you know what backs the us dollar if we can just print it and they're like well the us military of course which i think which i think is actually the largest user of of oil or something or one of them in in the entire world actually single largest customer single single largest customer right like the dod or something like that but you know even sort of even zooming about you know beyond um the the us petrodollar itself is like thinking about u.s hegemony in general i think is our sort of the lifeblood of our dominance has been oil sort of over the past that we've built up over the past century you know standard oil at its peak um controlled 80 of global oil supply global so not even domestic like they were exporting you know all the original oil discoveries were in the u.s and it was a massive feedstock for like boom and automobiles and our entire industrial base and then coming out of world war ii a lot of the sort of continued supply of cheap oil was done through concessions with opec nations like these were originally the u.s had all the expertise on how to get oil out of the ground all these larger companies which we still recognize today like shell and exxon and you know they all have their roots in this um sort of long history right yeah um and so you know a lot of that was done through these deals in the middle east where where we got access to uh cheap oil supply was like massive for national security reasons and stuff like that it was this sort of cheap lifeblood energy of of sort of uh american dominance for a very long time and i actually i don't remember if it's in your article actually alex or where i pulled this from but i do want to read uh vasilev smiles uh energy and civilization uh which he says energy is the only universal currency and so as i said earlier in in the um podcast you know uh energy systems are not fungible so as we as we move to an entirely new energy system which i've tried to describe in uh this article series i'm writing i'm trying to get article four out which is basically this podcast uh it's been tough to write but i call it it's forgive the name it's terrible but the the age of the electron because if you look at just transitioning electric vehicles uh to electric vehicles from internal combustion engines and residential heating and commercial heating to electric heating like heat pumps we're gonna double our consumption of electricity like in our lifetimes so right now it makes up about 38 of sort of u.s uh consumption electricity so by the time you know we're on our way out it may be more like 76 or 80 percent so we're going to be feeding off the electricity grid and so if you think of this in the context of like well oil was the most important feedstock for the u.s economy and u.s hegemony as a result as we transition to an electricity-based system that'll have implications for trade for our dominance our hegemony and and and maybe the currency system itself so if if bitcoin is like electricity money uh in the us dollar like was the was the petrodollar i think i want to do more studying even going back to like the brits uh coal was their dominant energy supply that almost like in these energy transitions in the past we've seen a reorientation and actual like global uh power structures and so alex when i read your piece and i i wouldn't go um you know i think it's too early for me to to bet on a horse i i do love bitcoin but i i'd say i'm very intrigued at this idea of this tie between bitcoin and electricity and and then thinking about that in the context of like the us petrodollar and all these systems and how that could emerge over over the next few decades and just to add on that like when we think about elon and and the pressure for him to stay esg compliant i mean can the dollar be green is a very good question i mean again like you know about this more than me but like the us and the world bank and the imf have really like fought over the decades emerging market economies from becoming energy independent we've fought uh them from becoming agriculturally independent we've wanted them to be dependent on us we have like pushed away at like uh nuclear development uh the world could be a lot more nuclear today if you know we weren't trying to protect this sort of petrodollar system uh we've also fought a lot of renewables ever since the 70s if you remember the whole carter administration thing like so i mean we've been fighting renewables and nuclear in a big way to keep this system afloat and you know we ask about could bitcoin be green well i mean you know all we have is the data we have and you know the most conservative data from cambridge says that some are something like 39 of all of bitcoin's energy is from renewables and and you know something like three quarters of all the miners have it in their mix so you know where could we go from here in a world where as you know and you can explain renewable energy tech is just getting cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper you know what i mean like could you imagine a world where bitcoin in 20 years is running like all on coal like does that make sense i don't know i mean you look at coal declining just because of solar wind and natural gas right now and i i don't see that i do you know just a slight aside on that when you look at like kentucky using this tax subsidy to uh enter you know entice bitcoin miners to um come into kentucky you could if you like look at it it looks like trying to prop up the coal uh lobby basically like keep those coal plants functioning so there's certainly like an immediate concern about yes this could absolutely help like coal plants continue to run could help nuclear too which is which is clean the way i guess i put it in in like climate uh circles is they're like well why couldn't we just transition the us dollar to to back renewables i'm like well you know technically you could but you can't it'd be naive to ignore the institutional inertia behind the how intertwined the us dollar is with petroleum to the extent that i even grow concerned that as we electrify the economy and we use more and more electricity and less and less petroleum well as demand for petroleum goes down actually demand for us dollars globally goes down you know it's not just sort of the threat of you know trading pairs between countries instead of them having to buy from opec in us dollars from opec nations it's also like well if there's less sales in general of oil uh there's less demand for us the us dollar globally and i know as you've said like that the petrodollar it's it's been waning you know a lot of people i've seen a new uh sort of emerging debate like uh in different spheres on twitter that actually it's the euro dollar now so dollars marked in you know that are in like european banks and stuff like that like the us dollar has become so ubiquitous that petroleum doesn't even really matter anymore that may very well be true but at the end of the day like the us petrodollar system started as an explicit quid pro quo between opec and u.s as in you sell for us dollars we'll back you with our navy uh and then uh now it you know and if we're transitioning like away from that it's more of this implicit you know there's definitely a higher risk of of becoming this multi-polar world and in that case you know the us dollar would suffer so i i think it's just like you know the way again i i explain it to to my climate friends is just like you know you see bitcoin miners actually wanting to go co-locate with solar and wind farms to like relieve transmission we can get into all the benefits it may or may not offer like with the square crypto paper but there's just so much inertia behind the u.s petrodollar system that i don't see us like suddenly figuring out that you know the us dollar is actually gonna emerge and be uh you know great explicitly for renewables or electricity in the way that that bitcoin could let's talk about that square in arc invest paper because i found this just incredibly fascinating and so the title was counterintuitively bitcoin is key to an abundant clean energy future and so the basic thesis was that bitcoin miners are location agnostic but they're also highly flexible energy buyers and they have an easily interruptable load meaning they can be turned on and off you know kind of at will and um basically the paper concluded that bitcoin miners have this extraordinary asset which is you know this combination of qualities and that makes them an energy buyer of last resort that can be turned on or off at a moment's notice anywhere in the world and their suggestion was essentially that because a lot of renewable energy is kind of like far from where energy is needed that um there's a lot of renewable energy that gets produced but then you know maybe isn't uh used as well or that the timing of when the energy is being produced doesn't really match up to when people are actually needing the energy and so they were saying that like bitcoin kind of bitcoin mining mining equipment could be used to kind of offset some of these like inefficiencies in the way that renewables are produced so i wanted to hear what you guys thought of this paper it sounds like james you have a positive view on it um just susan sue who wrote the petrodollar piece that we mentioned earlier she actually mentioned to me that um climate people sort of look to scans at this paper so it's you know it's kind of curious to me that you actually view it positively so if you feel comfortable kind of explaining what the skeptical view is um but then also your own view i'd be interested to hear both yep well i'd say i i've sort of mixed feelings on it and it comes from um i think a lot of the analysis and the reality and the in the um cogency with which they talk about the grid is all actually pretty great and we even dug into the model with some of my climate friends like who are project financiers who develop assets on the grid there's like an underlying model that i think arc built about kind of justifying a lot of it and we thought it was like a novel cool experience but a a experiment but um you know they ultimately viewed it as cynical in that the evidence to support the nameplate claim of it is key uh is a little thin you know like it's not the the evidence they provided was was interesting but it didn't like you can't connect it to just being like the key unlock to a renewable future so that was a lot of the pushback that i heard and honestly kind of supported you know the other piece of it is the the the analysis itself which um they they do quite well i think that that two uh there's two main values that that bitcoin miners may potentially uh bring to the grid one is uh what i like energy liquidity for stranded assets so this is i've heard it happening anecdotally in the uh in the texas market actually there's such a huge interconnection queue for more solar more wind more batteries that we're actually kind of overloading the amount that we can build uh on the grid like there's there's more available it is such a great region for cheap wind and solar because there's a lot of wind and there's a lot of sun and so people have seen bitcoin miners actually in order to get sort of interconnected into the grid the bitcoin miners will co-locate to the wind and solar and off-take a lot of that enough of that power that they can actually help these resources get interconnected so it actually leads to like net new generation of solar and wind if that's true that's that's very compelling uh on the flip side of it like i mentioned in kentucky it can also be used to prop up like stranded coal assets but um you know i think if we look at over the next decade or two i'm not as worried about the coal piece of that and sorry the the second piece is um which i find extremely interesting about um bitcoin and they do mention in the paper is this idea of it as like a capacity reserve margin or backup generator for the grid so because it's creating net new generation you know if you take that as an assumption uh when there are these so-called like tail events on the grid like you saw in texas where prices went through the roof there wasn't enough supply bitcoin miners can shut down because it's less profitable to mine when prices are going up which means that if their demand created this new supply source the solar and wind when they turn off it's around and available for the grid in these like very kind of dire moments on the grid where we need extra supply it's not like actually you know creating power itself obviously it's only a consumer of power but it is a very interesting property of bitcoin miners that i find is very positive for the grid as it'll lead to more power plants being built and so i guess just the la like just to sort of summarize um how i overall viewed the paper is um you know bless his heart uh how many articles can nick carter write on on energy consumption like debunking a new article right he's lonely out there he's doing it you know one man against the world yeah and so what i said to castle island ventures who's been on this right and keep going right so what i said to my climate friends is like you know i don't i don't support necessarily the title like bitcoin is key to the to clean energy future like there's a lot of unknowns we're probably going to build a lot of stuff anyways there's interesting properties there's a lot of nuance here i view it as like it was a it was a very effective counter narrative that they that they kind of landed on in creative because they've been getting you know the crypto community like beat to death by this energy consumption narrative for for six years and and so it just kind of makes sense to me that this counter narrative emerged like well you know what actually it's good for renewables so it's not that i necessarily like support that but i understand there's a reality here where it can be very helpful to grid and then there's also this like narrative that exists in the context of people who are bashing bitcoin so you know overall i think it's interesting that it's out there i thought they did a great job but i personally wouldn't go as far to say like it is the key to unlock a renewable energy future even though i'm very intrigued that about this idea of like uh to alex's point a bitcoin electricity standard emerging you know kind of in our lifetime yeah i just would add one other thing just for the audience um that we don't know yet like basically measuring bitcoin's energy footprint carbon footprint and mix is very hard to do uh and happens at a kind of academic level only once every year or two so there's really like i mean i think in 10 years there will be probably a dozen organizations doing this and we're gonna have tons of data and like a lot more transparency into the situation it would love that but today we there are corporate people doing it who have a really big self-interest and and then we kind of have cambridge right so the the cambridge center for alternative finances is kind of like the best we have as sort of a neutral-ish academic institution and you know they have we haven't seen a paper out of them since 2019 so and and bitcoin has changed a lot since then and as we look to the future of bitcoin and and the dollar i think it's worth looking at some trends that are happening in the last six months to 12 months with bitcoin uh you know we don't have uh very recent data on bitcoin's global energy mix but from events that just happened in western china miners have said that a it looks like a lot less mining is taking place in china than we thought uh potentially less than 50 percent uh f2 pool has mentioned that for the first time ever uh they're they're getting less than half of their of their hash rate that's pushing towards their their really really large pool from china so it looks like we're seeing a decentralization of mining out of china which is very interesting we're also seeing like a lot more renewables in these places than previously thought everybody keeps saying you know coal heavy provinces in china but the the second largest coal heavy province in china inner mongolia just you know they're banning bitcoin there so that's going to move to more renewable uh areas and then in xinjiang um miners there i spoke to one um you know i'm trying to research what's going on there and and this person told me that the the fact that they were able to close it all down uh is very bad for business and they're going to be looking to move elsewhere so i wouldn't be shocked if you saw miners get out of there and in in addition that grid is is more renewable than people thought um so i would just say that the future of the mix is changing and potentially in a way that that could be a lot more renewable and the last point i want to make for the audience is just to think about this from like a humanitarian point of view if you consider that you can turn solar and wind and hydro resources into like a very valuable asset that can benefit the local population then you start to have a different incentive structure for uh consultants and uh sort of foreign mega corps who usually participate in extractive industries and this is sort of the thesis of why nations fail a famous book that like basically countries that have these extractive industries fall into disrepair and a small group of elites control everything right but if you're actually having like halliburton or whoever who normally come in and like loot the country and leave if they're coming in to build bitcoin mining equipment for for like the the local either the people or the government to like accumulate um well all of a sudden now these other countries that are maybe like sudan or ethiopia or whatever who might be naturally rich in resources but but don't have good dollar access all of a sudden in a world where maybe bitcoin is the reserve currency they're able to be independent and that's that's a really interesting future again uh very different from the one today where you know again americans are completely privileged with having this ability to run up these massive deficits on social spending and war and for everybody to continue to want to buy our debt that's the trick normally you have the trifund dilemma type thing which this economist mentioned in the 60s that you know normally when a country has a big balance of payments issue uh essentially the currency devalues and it starts exporting more and there's like a natural balance and all the world's economies operate in this way but when you have a reserve currency that you're printing you don't have this balance and the only way you can kind of keep the system running is by printing more and more and more and more debt and eventually eventually that thing's going to collapse so that's kind of maybe what we're seeing here with the end of the petrodollar system and it's interesting to think about a future where other nations can participate in an equal way given their natural resources and it's something that that i always think about yeah you know alex i did i did just want to actually add on to one thing when you bring up the triffin dilemma which um i've started sort of injecting into the the climate conversation as much as i possibly can so when i mentioned earlier that like standard oil actually owned 80 of the global oil supply you actually look at while the u.s is creating tremendous amount of green jobs with insolar and wind installations and stuff like this and we have tremendous resources in say the panhandle and arizona and a lot of solar and wind resources actually 70 of the supply chain is or even more in certain cases is is currently dominated by china for the equipment itself so not only just solar panels but also the like silicon and sort of the the entire supply chain leading up to the panel as well as batteries i think is like 80 wind is only 30 percent i do i do sort of offer up there like in the in the in the triffen dilemma that the structure of the us dollar is actually oriented against us sort of onshoring supply chains yeah because the way you fund the u.s dollar as a reserve currency system is by running a trade deficit that was like the that is the triffen dilemma so i kind of always offer up to people like if we continue to run the system as is uh basically at any moment and i'm not saying they will or like trying to put forth an antagonistic view of china i think it's you know i'm not i'm not going there whatsoever but we do completely depend on them for our clean energy future and we should you know if they were to stop sending us solar or batteries as we try and ramp up and do things really quickly over the next 10 years we won't have another source for the the equipment itself um beyond susan sue i just wanted to make sure people here follow the work of like luke groman and lynn alden who are also really good at underlining what james is saying here and explaining it in a very academic and very clear way that um this is a vulnerability for the us that we've outsourced everything and that our supply chains are based in these like rival risk countries um and that the natural like correction to that would be to be bringing this stuff back so we can make it ourselves and possibly export it but that will mean a correction in the deficit and that will mean like a weaker dollar so you know this is these are the trade-offs we have to think about um but we've really sacrificed a lot to have this like a sort of dollar primacy that gives us the ability to finance all of these social spending and wars i mean again we've hollowed out our kind of manufacturing middle class and and put all of that infrastructure in china and other countries and all of a sudden those other countries that have been selling stuff to us for debt for the last few decades um they're not willing to reinvest that profit back into u.s debt anymore uh they're invested china's you know investing it into their own you know marshall plan the belton road i mean they've got other plans now and other countries are investing in other stuff russia's stocking up on gold and you know i think people are going to start stacking up on bitcoin in the next five years central banks so you know american policymakers have to be really careful here um but i think if they're smart and they understand what's happening with bitcoin we can be so dynamic in the bitcoin future and america as the country built on the declaration of independence and on these very values that bitcoin empowers and sort of vibrates with private property uh and free speech and freedom um we can really dominate i think in in that future and so i think that bitcoin is in many ways a way to bring us to like a more patriotic and and more reasonable american future that's i guess my argument yeah actually on that note i did just want to ask one last quick question even though we're basically at time but i was just wondering because obviously the biden administration is going to be more environmentally friendly than the trump administration was and obviously also were coming out of this pandemic so i think you know there's going to be kind of like these new initiatives already we're seeing like an infrastructure and stuff so you just wondered if you thought that that would have any particular impact on bitcoin or on um you know maybe increasing mining here in the us or the energy mix of mining etc yeah i mean i think what what the biden administration seems like they're they're definitely going to do is a lot of incentive money um towards renewables which which will obviously help i honestly am not the best person to comment on this because from like an entrepreneurial view you know someone starting a company in uh this space i try to avoid politicians as much as possible because we don't want to bet our future on policy going one way or the other we're trying to build in an environment where no matter what happens like we're going to be fine so i think what was interesting is that the trump administration for all the talk didn't do that much to actually i mean if anything the the clean energy industry accelerated during the trump administration now i'm not saying to his benefit but it just does seem to be this unstoppable movement at this point um so i think the biden administration can certainly do things to help i i like that they are starting to talk more about like supply chains and and uh onshore manufacturing and stuff like that which i do think is a really critical piece of uh the clean energy piece of this is making sure we have access secure access to clean energy technologies but again it remains to be seen because there is just so much institutional inertia against that like that's that's kind of kind of um you know if we're not going to go at the us dollar system in general which doesn't you know let us build things here as well um i i don't know how much that they're actually going to accomplish on that front and again this is coming from like a pretty uninformed view i think it's probably going to be good overall like uh i'm not i'm not saying that it's not um but i i never kind of put my hopes on on the uh narratives that that politicians are are putting out there i just i you know we'll we'll see how it uh how it goes i guess alex yeah look if they want to subsidize clean energy that they can and i think they will and i think you will see pressure on bitcoin miners in america who are using natural gas for example like green edge you saw they're they're they're they're buying offsets right um and i think you're gonna see that for any bitcoin miner they're gonna have to be like any other industry and and and you know at kind of a con they're going to have to comply with the structure of you know the society and the politics in america right now which is which is under biden pushing towards this renewable future and obviously that that advantages uh miners uh i was on the phone with a miner this morning who builds wind and solar only you know fact farms out in west texas where you get some of the cheapest energy on the planet and they're gonna do very well over the next uh few years here so i'd like to see more american mining done uh geopolitically let's put it that way to balance out china and to maybe advantage us as a country moving forward um and and of course i'd love to see that be more renewable and i think unintentional byproduct of some of the biden administration's uh language here is going to probably be to force that um even if it comes at the cost of a state subsidy which is kind of ironic that they're going to be like burning these petrodollars to help bring us to a more clean bitcoin future but maybe that's the case you know something i would love to see is is really a concerted effort to bring clean energy supply chains to to the us like i think that could be a very impactful way of even the biden administration you know spurring uh the the clean energy movement along so on top of the sort of uh national security viewpoint that you had had alex on on mining bitcoin in the us and how that could be beneficial is is also just let's not forget uh where all these clean energy technologies come from and that would be probably the the policy that i see kind of discussed but not like really you know i haven't seen a concerted effort behind it and i'd love to see it more prevalent in the conversation yeah um alex when you brought up lynn alden i think and i read this so long ago i don't remember exactly but i think she was talking about how um like because of the pandemic like it's going to bring up resiliency as a feature and she was talking about these supply chains and yeah so i i totally agree with you and when you were saying that you know it would be great to see more mining in the us i do think if that happened then it would naturally be more clean because already the cambridge studies showed that in europe and in north america the median percentage of renewables is 70 and 66 respectively but in asia and this is bitcoin mining the median is 25 so clearly you know if we had more mining here i think the mix would definitely be more shifted toward renewables all right well this has been a super comprehensive conversation i'm so glad we were able to pull this together last minute to talk about some fun news where can people learn more about each of you and your work um i would say actually check out the der task force the er taskforce.com if you're interested in kind of the distributed energy topics that i discussed here we view it as the go-to community for distributed energy enthusiasts we have meetups we have a podcast there's like a network of uh very motivated uh plugged in uh folks who you can get direct access to through our slack and then you know myself i'm on twitter uh mostly that's my platform of choice you know check out uh at james underscore mcginnis or at the david energy uh if you want to learn more about the company or just davidenergy.com great and alex yeah again thanks so much for having me i'm you know focused on the s part of the esg here at the human rights foundation you can follow us at href.org you can follow me at gladsteen on twitter uh my article that sparked a lot of this conversation it's called the hidden cost of the petro dollar on bitcoin magazine and then for further reading i'd really recommend that people uh follow five people uh definitely susan sue read her article definitely follow lynn alden and luke grumman they're very informative on this nick carter of course is worth following on on this side of things and then one other person i would bring up is michael hudson who is quoted a lot about when in david graber's book debt which is kind of a masterpiece obviously michael hudson is quoted quite a bit in in david's very very good section on the petrodollar system which everybody i think should read david of course passed away unfortunately rest in peace but michael is still around and doing some interesting work and he's been a searing critic from from the far left i would add um uh of the petrodollar system so i i think reading his stuff is is really interesting so i hope i hope that gives folks some more rabbit holes to go down great all right well thank you both so much for coming on
