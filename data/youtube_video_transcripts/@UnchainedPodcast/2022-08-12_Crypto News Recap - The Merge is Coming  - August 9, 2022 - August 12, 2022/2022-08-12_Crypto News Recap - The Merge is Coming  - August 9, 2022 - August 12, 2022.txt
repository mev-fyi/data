rates when interest rates are lower money is cheaper and there is more capital to allocate into risk on assets like cryptocurrencies however there is no consensus among investors on whether inflation has peaked or whether the fed will slow down quantitative tightening bloomberg columnist mohamed el-erian said the fed has had a couple of really good data reports which suggests to them that they can continue doing what they're doing because the underlying strength of the economy is still significant still there are others who are more positive with cpi confirmed to have peaked fed pivot is next
