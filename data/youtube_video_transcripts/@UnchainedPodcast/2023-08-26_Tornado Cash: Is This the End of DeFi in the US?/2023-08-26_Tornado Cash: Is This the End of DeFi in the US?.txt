but I do not think this is the end of D5 I think that we need to be clear about what the indictment is saying and what it is not saying it is not saying that simply running a front end is a crime it's not saying that simply writing code is a crime it's saying that according to the government that you're running a financial institution that would have to comply with the bank secrecy act and when you agree to do that thing and you don't actually comply that is the crime so I think that that is I think the indictment is just a little more specific about what they're criminalizing and I think that's a good thing for D5 right we don't want the indictment to be broader than it actually is we want it to be as specific as it possibly could be in in terms of differentiating what is going to be pursued as a crime versus what is not
