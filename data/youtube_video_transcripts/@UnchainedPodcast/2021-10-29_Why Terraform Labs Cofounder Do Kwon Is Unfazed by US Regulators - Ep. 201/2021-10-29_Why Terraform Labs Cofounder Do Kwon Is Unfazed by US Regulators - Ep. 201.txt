hi everyone welcome to unconfirmed the show that reveals how the marky names on crypto are reacting to the week's top headlines and gets the inside skip on what they say on the horizon i'm your host laura shin a journalist with over two decades of experience i started covering crypto six years ago and is the senior editor at forbes was the first mainstream media reporter to cover cryptocurrency full-time this is the october 29th episode of unconfirmed the crypto.com app pays you up to 8.5 interest on your bitcoin get 25 when you download the krypto.com app with code laura the link is in the

you could earn crypto but don't want to spend thousands on hardware just download the nodal cache app on your smartphone visit nodal dot io slash unconfirmed that's n o d l e dot io unconfirmed to start earning nodal cash today [Music] today's guest is do kwan co-founder of terraform labs welcome dough hi laura thanks for having me you and your company made a pretty bold move last week filing a lawsuit against the sec but before we get into the details on that let's just make sure our listeners are up to speed on everything that you do in the crypto phase can you tell us what terraform labs is and explain some of your crypto projects such as terra and mirror protocol so terraform labs which is a company that i founded is a core developer of tera which is uh many things it's a layer one blockchain but uh it's you know it builds a set of products centered around the decentralized stablecoin uh mainly terra usd so the differentiator of terra usd versus some of the better known stable coins in the industry such as tever and usdc is that it's decentralized and algorithmic right so while uh for something like tether there is a dollar in bank deposits uh supposedly for every unit of stable coin that's issued tara uses a set of on-chain incentives to make sure that the coin can maintain price parity with the dollar and do you also want to describe mirror protocol sure so um in the early days of terra usd we built a series of applications to enhance the utility of terra stable coins so the idea was that we tried to break down uh money as a product and then thought about what are some of the key features of money that we can improve with a decentralized version of the dollar so those were it turned out that with money you can either spend it or hold it so we decided to build a stable coin and a set of products around it that would make terra ust the easiest to spend and the most attractive to hold so in the spending component we built a number of payment apps primarily in asia so we built chai and einport and in korea and then mini pay in mongolia so um you know and these things are doing you know billions of dollars in transaction volume with retail buying anything from general purpose e-commerce to online food deliveries to movie theater tickets and things like that and then we also built mirror protocol which is a synthetics protocol that creates assets that follow the price of various different assets like for example equities or commodities or etfs such that people across the world that don't have ready or easy access to some of the most attractive markets in the world can now sort of improve their financial outcomes by getting now gaining access to those markets we also built the incro protocol which is a way for you to get you know high attractive yield on your stable points to the tune of let's say 19.5 percent per annum and these are powered by staking yields that are coming in from multiple blockchains such as terra solana and ethereum 2.0 so the sec has been conducting an investigation into mirror protocol and for the listeners who've been following things closely in the crypto space they're probably aware that this type of product that mirror protocol features is something that has caught the sec's attention before for those of you who remember settlements or enforcement actions with companies like abra i so for you doe um you know this kind of is what resulted in you uh suing the sec so tell us how that came about first off i think it's natural for regulators to want to look into things that are so new that breaks incumbent frameworks uh for how markets were regulated and people were doing financial transactions right so if you look at things like mirror or anchor they are you know pretty interesting in the sense that like if there was wide market acceptance of let's say the anchor protocol like nobody would ever use wells fargo right uh while at the same time it's not regulated in the way that a bank is regulated and there's a lot of things that don't fit in nicely even compared to existing deep by protocols or for mirror protocol there are a lot of you know valid concerns for having unregulated price exposure to stock markets right so i think it's natural that they're looking into uh things like that and it's not just the sec i think it's something that many regulators across the world are going to you know pay attention to and uh i am you know genuinely sincere when i say that um i i am happy to you know enter into a dialogue and educate uh regulators across the world this is not sort of our first dog in pony show like i i do run large regulated payments company uh in korea so you know happy to do those things but um i think it's also important that like when crypto companies are working with regulators that they do it from a position of you know strength and do it from a position of confidence yeah and so just so listeners have the full background what happened was the sec served you with subpoenas just before you were supposed to go on stage at massari's mainnet this made the rounds on twitter at that time but it wasn't clear exactly who had been served with those subpoenas and this was after uh your lawyers had kind of established with the sec that the sec did not have jurisdiction over you so stephen palley who is a lawyer in the crypto space tweeted that your lawsuit against the sec was the quote rare case of a preemptive lawsuit against a regulator making sense and his comment was quote if i were negotiating with someone and they decided to serve my client publicly the same day that they were on the phone with me about the same case i would be pretty ticked off a really really shitty way to treat people that was all stephen's comment so this incident basically fits into this kind of wider regulatory picture we have here in the u.s around crypto and um you know i would say people in the crypto industry are particularly apprehensive about the sec what's your take on the sec's approach to regulating the crypto space here in the us well so i i think the easy way to look at it is while i am happy to cooperate and work with the scc it doesn't really hit me the same way that you know somebody that's american and like really understands uh and has has has been living with some some of that reach uh most of their lives would feel about it right so like yeah i mean it's kind of interesting and you know there are parts of this that are you know educational and fun um and you know largely it doesn't really impact me all that much oh okay but i mean just as a builder do you find that there are modifications or adjustments or or just anything you know that you kind of have to think of when you're building these projects and that there's like certain risks you have to take in account because of the atmosphere here in the us so the way that i think about it is that yes there is some hostile overreach of regulators in the beginning and that's because like the industry is just fundamentally transformative right but another way of thinking about it is that people that run regulated fintech services or banking services get hit with subpoenas and get investigated and have to work with regulators on a daily basis i think the problem is that even though some of these crypto companies operate from a financial perspective at the scale of fortune 500 companies they're really at you know like from a human resources perspective they're at the size of like a seed or a series a stage startup so when um you know regulators approach them as if there would be talking to let's say the robin hoods of the world then i i think it has like a huge psychological impact but the reality of it is it's just like one of those things that you have to deal with if you're trying to start a financial revolution so one of the interesting things that i thought about is um you know like in crypto the d5 meme is that we're here to change the future of france right um and the interesting thing is the last time that they tried to change the future of france they pulled out the guillotine right and then they started executing people and they're not doing that today but like i don't think i don't think regulators are doing anything that's super crazy all their all they're doing is asking questions and yeah like there there's gonna be some some hostility about it uh usually people are hostile to things that they don't understand but it's through this process that we write educate regulators you know uh find a common ground and find compromise right so if we're really in this and this is if this is an actual revolution then i think some of the costs that we have to pair are like actually not that high it's just it's just the price we have to play to play the game okay all right so you seem to have a pretty uh almost nonchalant attitude about this but we'll we'll discuss a little bit more about this regulatory issue in a moment but first a quick word from the sponsors who make the show possible there's a new cryptocurrency made for mobile that you can earn by downloading the nodal cache app it's

what you think would be the optimal way of regulating crypto here in the us so i think right now there seems to be a pretty heavy emphasis on uh some of the landmark uh protocols in crypto um so let's say the leading lending protocols the leading taxes some leading chains but i think the initial focus needs to be on let's say weeding out the frauds and scams in the industry and i feel like in in order to because you know it brings more publicity and it's more interesting i think there's a bit more focus on what i consider to be fairly legitimate institutions in cryptocurrency uh in the crypto industry that are trying to do you know really amazing things and it really slows them down and it hurts the industry overall you know and i think if there was equal weights i i think i really think it should be the majority of the attention but i think if there's equal weight paid to you know some of the scams and frosters and rock pools in the industry i think um that would actually lead to a net positive result for everyone but you know like when there's a hack that happens and you know like 100 million dollars gets stolen that doesn't seem to get as much attention as like somebody launching like a like a novel dex algorithm huh okay okay well we can talk about that in a moment because of some of this week's news but i did want to ask like for this question about how u.s regulators should you know apply regulations here in the us do you think that the existing regulations should be applied here or do you think that there needs to be something new i i think the problem is that the regulations are too vague right so i i've thought about this for a while but i i think it's better if you have an actual legal framework that is decided by the legislative french instead of something that regulates by enforcement and precedent like it is true that a lot of the security laws are quite outdated and they're based in a world where you know there were wild cowboys and you know private banks were issuing their own notes that were supposed to replace currency i don't think that framework applies really well in a global context where uh you know everything all the value moves through the internet there's a lot of innovation that's happening so i don't think that fits really well so if there was sort of like an actual law uh that passes congress that says hey look this is a standard for a minimal viable threshold of decentralization that you need to get to and that can include things like having no pre-mine of the asset so fairly distributing the asset at launch it could be one of it or number two um i i guess like you could even do things like not having an explicit privacy there on the coins so that you can do uh you can track where the assets are going and then you can do tax reporting and things like that so uh yes i mean not that that's necessarily a good idea but i feel like it's possible to come up with a minimal viable set of really clear rules to decide what what what qualifies as a credibly decentralized asset and what constitutes a security and without that clarity i think it's it's just very difficult for builders and regulators to get on the same page yeah the the privacy company made is is pretty interesting but we will instead actually talk a little bit about stable coins because terra usd has undergone a 10x increase in supply this year it's now the fifth largest stablecoin it has a nearly three billion dollar market cap and as i'm sure you're well aware stable coins have come up here in the us as another target for regulators and it does look like the sec will likely soon have authority to regulate stable coins if that were to happen how would that affect terra usd nothing there's no underlying deposit that can be seized there's no policy of terraform labs that impacts terra usd and you know i would never do anything not that i could that are adversarial to the interests of the terror network so i actually think this is something that's going to be a huge growth driver for terra usd because uh not only are the centralized stable coins uh censorable by you know regulators but a lot of the um so-called decentralized stable coins are really just wrapped variants of these centralized stable coins so most of dye is actually issued using usdc as collateral there's a lot of fractional reserve stable coins that use you know some of these other stable coins as collateral itself so it becomes very easier by proxy to regulate most of our competitors in the space and i think uh if you know some of these centralized stablecoins turn into essentially fintech services i think a lot of that capital will rotate into uh the largest decentralized stablecoin and today that just happens to be terra usd and so for you it's sort of like um if you can come up with a project that is somewhat similar to ethereum's level of decentralization that it had obtained by 2018 which was the first time we heard an sec regulator say that ethereum was sufficiently decentralized then you feel that that's kind of a way of i don't want to say like getting around regulation because it sounds like it's sort of intentional but more just that it would be outside the purview of a regulator is that what you what you think is the way to go for a defy developer yeah well so i think the holy grail in crypto is the decentralized dollar and uh like we need to get there because all the applications that we built on top of cryptocurrency like even uh nft exchanges and d5 protocols and you know futures contracts all of those things use some sort of stable coin as the quote currency uh most of the liquidity pools and d5 are denominated in stable coin uh some of it is in each but most of it is stable coin so if we have uh sort of a structural issue with some of the stable coins that are denominating all of these different apps then d5 dies so in order to have decentralized finance you need to decentralize money right and i think the first project to be able to crack this puzzle in the sense that it's tether but everything is auditable on chain nobody controls it there's on-chain monetary policy that is credible and easy to understand then i think that's just going to make things better for almost everyone and so you hinted earlier at what you think are some of the characteristics of a decentralized protocol do you want to maybe continue filling out what those characteristics are because i'm very curious and i i was also curious why you felt that privacy could not be a feature of a decentralized protocol but but maybe i'm just curious to hear what you think are all the characteristics necessary sure so largely when it comes to financial regulation regulators care about two things right it's number one that investors don't get harmed right so they care about things like transparency they care about things like people not losing their money without you know a full understanding of the associated risks and number two they're worried about money laundering and tax division and i feel like if there's no pre-mine to the asset in the sense that the developer doesn't have an unfair advantage when the when the asset is issued then in that case it cannot be a security like if you are doing all the work in the beginning and later you build a community of the people to build alongside you you had no unfair information access to getting your hands on the asset then in that case i mean it seems like a pretty good reason why you shouldn't have any responsibility if he didn't have any unfair financial gains of course this is an independent discussion of whether it's appropriate for the developer to make money off of you know his his uh ingenuity or labor but i think at least if there's no pre-mine then like i think it's very tough to call that a security i think number two why um i think a privacy layer is a little bit challenging is because it then it becomes like very difficult to do things like tax collection right so and then you can give you know previous access to some you know government agencies and things like that but then i i feel like that would sort of defeat the purpose of privacy coins in the first place yeah i don't think you should do you should engage in tax evasion i don't think you should engage in money laundering so some sort of a middle middle ground where you sacrifice all of those properties in order to uh have regulatory clarity seems like a pretty good idea to me okay yeah well i you know obviously there are a bunch of privacy coins that have their selective viewing keys so it wouldn't be that you would only reveal it to a regulator but it could just be to any other entity that you'd like to reveal that information to um so going back to your earlier remarks uh let's touch on another news story this week a big one cream finance was hacked with a flashlight transaction for more than 130 million dollars on wednesday and that brings the total amount of funds in d5 that have been stolen this year to over half a billion dollars and cream finance itself has actually been hacked multiple times so i was curious you know if you feel that the regulators maybe aren't concentrating there what do you feel the industry can or should do about these security issues yeah so what's the saying fool me once fool me twice no but in all seriousness um i i think there should be a more structured way to uh for people to be able to gauge you know security risk across various different defy apps um and i think an important way to do that is for some of the main sort of distribution channels in crypto to offer more friendly tooling so that people can understand what the security risks are so for example if ether scan for instance had like a you know a static analyzer of the code which identifies what types of risks are possible or let's say metamask when you're about to execute a transaction shows you a set of warnings of the things that can happen if you trust this contract i think that could be something that's really helpful so one of the delightful experiences that i found when using the phantom wallet in solana is that uh right before you're about to execute a transaction it tells you what are some of the things that can happen it tells you that you are sending your tokens to another address you're giving you a special set of permissions from your wallet and things like that so that similar to how you give app permissions like sharing location services on your iphone you now have a sense of what things are possible when interacting with the solana program so i think if similar experiences uh you know move on to let's say the dominant wallet the dominant uh block explorer and um a lot of discovery tools like d5 pulse for instance that i think it becomes very easy for users to gauge different types of risk right so it's it's not possible for the average user to read through smart contracts and decide which project is uh more secure than the other nor is it appropriate for them to read like a random auto report which could be significantly outdated and decide that this contract is safe right so i think the only way to do this is have better analytics and tooling that's built around um some of the leading landmark players in the industry yeah this reminds me of a tweet thread that taylor monahan wrote and it was kind of funny because she said oh you know someone i can't remember which wallet it was but i think it actually was one on solana and they thought it was such an amazing experience because the things were automated and um then she did a bunch of little funny gifs and emojis and eventually you know she's like you know uh wide eyes and like alarm bells going off and she's like no no no it's not good because then just you know any random fisher or hacker can just take all your money out if you know there aren't these checks on it so anyway all right well this has been a super fun discussion thank you so much for coming out unconfirmed yeah thank you so much laura don't forget next up is the weekly news recap stick around for this week in crypto after this

financial action task force unveils finalized crypto guidance on thursday the financial action task force or fadaf a global anti-money laundering watchdog published its finalized guidance for regulating the crypto industry the draft of this guidance published last spring veered in the direction of expanding rules that traditionally apply to transactions involving financial intermediaries to peer-to-peer transactions and even to wallets managed by individuals or so-called self-hosted wallets several crypto lawyers and advocate groups such as coin center and jake schravinski found that the finalized guidance appears to be better in some respects than the draft but otherwise is too vague what effect this will have in practice remains to be seen since thursday's publication is merely guidance not law member countries decide whether or not they choose to implement the fat off recommended guidelines as a reminder the fat f is the organization that advocates applying the travel rule to virtual asset service providers or vasps such as crypto exchanges and money transmitters to collect and report information on parties participating in transactions last spring's draft guidance could have required such reporting from those facilitating or governing transfers such as miners and validators now the requirement applies to persons with quote control of vas or virtual assets it also does not put such obligations on crypto protocol developers most importantly it no longer applies the travel role to transactions that occur between a business and a self-hosted wallet for decentralized applications vast reporting requirements are unclear especially for developers or anyone with quote control or sufficient influence in the defy arrangements the fat off appears to believe that many heads of decentralized protocols would fall under the vast definition quote it seems quite common for defy arrangements to call themselves decentralized when they actually include a person with control or sufficient influence and jurisdictions should apply the vast definition without respect to self-description said the guidance on twitter miller whitehouse levine policy director at dfi education fund wrote quote tldr it's not great my initial read is that the fataf sees a world in which permissionless and decentralized systems are at best suppressed from the guidance it seems that the phaneuf is having trouble coping with the fact that defy eliminates those intermediaries mark boyron dydx's general counsel tweeted that the fat recommendations are quote so bad that it makes the infrastructure bill look reasonable only permission to defy is allowed an intermediary must be inserted to serve as a vasp the global impact of these recommendations is an attempted kill shot at d5 mastercard is building out crypto payment rails mastercard is partnering with backed a crypto payments firm to enable cryptocurrency services for its partners across the us through mastercard's crypto as a service platform any mastercard partner be it a merchant bank or fintech will soon have the ability to let consumers buy sell and hold digital assets through custodial wallets powered by backed mastercard is also integrating crypto into its loyalty program mastercard adding support for web 3 payment rails could lead to a significant expansion of users interacting with cryptocurrency according to cnbc mastercard has relationships with over 20 000 financial institutions and supports 2.8 billion credit cards shares of the recently listed backed which announced a similar partnership with fi serve this week jumped 234 on monday coinciding with the mastercard press release speaking of crypto adoption according to bloomberg the houston firefighters relief and retirement fund invested 25 million dollars in a bitcoin in ether becoming one of if not the first public pension plan that has done so in the us the fund holds over four billion dollars in assets on wednesday bitcoin dropped below sixty thousand dollars el salvador president nayu bukheli announced that country quote bought the dip to the tune of 420 btc two banks signed up to become the first u.s institutions to offer bitcoin trading through a platform designed by q2 holdings and new york digital investment group or nydig allowing customers to purchase hold and sell bitcoin in their banking apps and finally according to an sec filing tesla might start accepting bitcoin as payment again and even hinted that it could accept other cryptos as well the sec is not ready for a leveraged bitcoin etf the second bitcoin futures etf managed by valkyrie listed last friday bringing in 80 million dollars during its first trading day under the ticker btf on nasdaq since then valkyrie filed to offer a 1.25 x leveraged bitcoin etf however according to the wall street journal on thursday the sec instructed one etf provider not to proceed with its leveraged product indicating that it will not approve valkyrie's leveraged bitcoin futures etf direction and etf issuer also got creative with the bitcoin futures etf filing on tuesday the company filed its directxion bitcoin strategy bearer etf which will maintain short exposure to bitcoin futures contracts on cme quote the fund will generally maintain its short exposure to bitcoin futures during periods in which the value of bitcoin is flat or declining as well as during periods in which the value of bitcoin is rising the filing said while it remains to be seen whether the sec approves direxxion's etf it appears a third bitcoin futures etf is set to list the van bitcoin strategy etf is quote ready for launch according to bloomberg's eric baltunis who expects the fund to start trading friday when this podcast publishes belgium has also noted that a glut of bitcoin etfs filed for registration he tweeted quote there's still 40 plus bitcoin etfs in registration we'll probably hit 50 by thanksgiving cream finance is third exploit in less than a year cream finance a d5 money market and lending service lost 130 million dollars worth of crypto tokens on wednesday making it the third worst defy hack in history according to erect peck shield inc initially identified the exploit as a flash loan attack based on etherscan records it appears the hacker interacted with 69 different tokens and paid only 9.16 each to pull off the heist mood at gupta at blockchain security researcher posited that the hacker was two people most likely defy devs working from a shared account notably this is not the first time cream finance has suffered a flashlight attack the d5 protocol was additionally exploited for 37.5 million dollars in february and 18.8 million dollars in august based on data from the block this brings the total amount of funds stolen from d5 protocols to over 500 million dollars fdic chair thinks banks could one day hold crypto assets jelena mcwilliams chair of the federal deposit insurance corporation believes that regulators should be looking into how u.s banks might hold digital assets for themselves and their clients the fdic chair spoke at money 2020 in las vegas on monday where she explained her regulatory approach to crypto assets mcmilliam said that her job quote is to provide clear rules of the road to let crypto innovation flourish in the u.s just like it did with the internet according to her speech the fdic plans to issue a series of policy statements on how existing rules and policies apply to crypto assets in the coming months mick williams says the fdic is working with the federal reserve and the office of the controller of currency in a quote crypto sprint to best coordinate policies for banks in the crypto space the fdic chair stated that crypto assets belong on bank balance sheets as reported by reuters quote at some point in time we're going to tackle how and under what circumstances banks can hold them on their balance sheets said mcwilliams crypto trading tanked robin hood's q3 on tuesday robin hood the popular trading platform revealed its q3 earnings report which showed that crypto revenue dipped almost 200 million dollars compared to the second quarter according to the report crypto revenue fell to 51 million dollars marking a 78 collapse from its 233 million dollars in q2 the lack of crypto revenue left its mark on robin hood's total revenue which hit only 365 million dollars in q3 after topping 550 million dollars in q2 the cftc is looking into a decentralized prediction market according to bloomberg this commodity futures exchange commission or cftc is investigating polymarket a prediction market-based app that allows users to predict outcomes of future events bloomberg reports the regulator is quote investigating whether poly market is letting customers improperly trade swaps or binary options and if it should be registered with the agency as of now the dap has not been accused of wrongdoing quote polymarket is firmly committed to complying with applicable laws and regulations and to providing information and regulators that will assist them with any inquiry a polygon spokeswoman told bloomberg speaking of the cftc it appears that acting chair rosten benham is making moves to add crypto to the cftc's purview on wednesday venom asked to become the primary comp on the crypto regulatory b during an appearance before the senate agriculture committee but i'm added quote market transactions that are taking place right now are a huge part of the risk that digital assets pose he went on to request a more robust quote regulatory structure for both securities and commodities benham's words come during the same week that sec chair gary gensler who has been lobbying for more regulatory control over crypto took aim at defy there's a lot of lending going on there's a lot of trading going on and without protections i fear that it's going to end poorly said genzler in the past he has said that most of the crypto assets he's seen are securities which furthers the turf war between the cftc and the sec time for fun bits holy ship one man's meme is another man's billions shibaino which trades under
