virtual currency businesses banks and regulators themselves use cypher trees to comply with regulation and to monitor compliance today's guest is the developer of HK map dot live who goes by the alias kuma this is going to be an unusual episode because when I first reached out to HK map he responded quote thanks for the invitation but we currently do not accept voice video meetup interview only accept text interview so he and I agreed that he could send me his responses by email and I would read them aloud on the show they've been edited ever so slightly and at certain points when he referred me to links rather than giving me an answer directly I've written short summaries of that material here was my first question what does HK mapped out live do HK map is a site that support HK protests for freedom by providing real-time crowd-sourced geolocation data of groups of polices protesters deployed tear gas warning flags and more we gather data from user submissions and verify them using trusted ground crews live broadcasts telegram channels etc public can use this information to plan their activities either to join the protests or to avoid the hot zones some reporters also use our information to find point of interest at this point he referred me to a course article written by Mary Hui which I will quote from here she writes HK map dot live is quote a dynamic map of hyung of Hong Kong that users can zoom in and out of much like Google Maps but in addition to detailed Street in building names this one features various emoji to communicate information at a glance a dog for police a worker in a yellow hardhat for protesters a dinosaur for the police's black-clad special tactical squad a white speech bubble for teargas - exclamation points for danger my next question how many downloads have you gotten after you launched it / how many people are using it since our launch on August 5th we covered almost every protest everywhere in Hong Kong we peaked it over 200k unique users daily in early October we hit another peak in the last 24 hours when HK government decided to invade a local university here he referred me to an article titled Hong Kong police and protesters battle into the night on cuhk campus as University head among those tear-gassed I will link to this article in the shownotes cuhk stands for Chinese University of Hong Kong my next question why do you think the Apple Store abandoned pressure from China and they have too much to lose their sales and production lines how did you find out it was banned did Apple inform you Apple informed us they first rejected the listing and then approved it and after an editorial from China's state media we got removed again at this point he referred me to the Wikipedia page on HK mapped out life but I will summarize the events here myself on September 21st kuma submitted HK mapped out live to Apple but after five days it was rejected from its app store due to an issue regarding payment options kumari submitted the application after fixing the issue but Apple rejected the app again on October 2nd saying it quote facilitates enables or encourages an activity that is not legal and that it quote allowed users to evade law enforcement kuma initially blamed bureaucratic error for the rejection rather than censorship because as he put it that app was built to show events happening in Hong Kong and because they quote do not encourage illegal activity he sees it as being similar to apps such as ways which helps drivers avoid traffic cameras and and he says apples reasonings seem to assume that HK mapped out live users would break the law Apple then reversed its decision October 4th and made the app available in the App Store the next day however on October 8th the Chinese Communist Party's people daily ran an editorial which claimed that Apple was endorsing and protecting what they called the rioters in the 2019 Hong Kong protest by listing quote a poison app which the editorial claimed allowed quote Hong Kong rioters to openly commit crime while openly escaping arrests although the editorial didn't name HK map dot life specifically the next day Apple removed it from its App Store once again according to statistic Apple made forty four billion dollars in revenue from China in the fiscal year 2019 after HK map tweeted quote we once believed that projection is simply a bureaucratic F up but now it is clearly a political decision to suppress freedom and human right in Hong Kong it is disappointing to see us corpse such as Apple NBA Blizzard Entertainment Tiffany and Co act against freedom HK map is used by passerby protesters journalists tourists and even pro-government supporters it might be hard for people outside to imagine tear gases in your neighborhood train station or your go to shopping mall but roughly 5,000 of them is fired since June side note if HK map is for target and ambushed police or other illegal purpose as falsely accused why would I bother making it available to the public this was my next question Akuma why do you think the Google store still allows your app Google Play Store is a more open platform and they have much less China exposure than Apple also because the accusation of our app being illegal does not stand there are zero evidence to support such claim not a single law is being cited by cited by Hong Kong police and what we are doing is just same as ways any messaging app in social networks my next question why did you start accepting cryptocurrencies injustice and Hong Kong forced us to go anonymous crypto pseudo anonymity helped to mitigate this risk thus protecting us in our users many people think crypto equate evil but I don't think this is fair undeniably there are terrible activity funded by bitcoins but so do cash there are organizations fighting for a good cause out there really need the anonymity and decentralize feature Kryptos offer an H came out being one of them funding for anti-government movements in an oppressive regime is dangerous after all legality is defined by the government our encounter with Apple's shown that the HK government can declare as violating law without citing any evidence and specific law that we broke nor did they contact me regarding problematic user-generated content how did you get into crypto personal interest kuma said why would anybody not be excited about crypto my next question how did you choose what's cryptocurrencies to accept Bitcoin Bitcoin cash and etherium are mainstream Manero and zee cash offer more privacy others are usually upon request note to listeners the other crypto currencies that HK map accepts our stellar Ripple and nano how much have you received a couple thousands worth of US dollars so far how do you cash out and convert to Hong Kong dollars unable to disclose but many of our providers accept cryptos what do you do with the money hosting cost operation cost leave a legal expense reserve and other projects related to HK protests online and offline are you changing how you transact when it comes to your personal finances as well if so what strategies do you use his response not much to tell we're going to discuss decentralisation and how kuma manages his technology but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible will the world follow France and advocate banning privacy coins will government backed stable coins become the new Fiat are distributed and peer-to-peer exchanges just a flash in the pan the answer is maybe virtual currencies can flourish and create a new private and more versatile economy but that grand vision can't happen without keeping crypto clean and that requires support of Herrmann's and accountability for bad actors privacy

join now at eToro comm that's et oro comm back to my conversation with kuma of HK mapped out live how did you come up with the idea for this map hong kong's be water protests spread all around the city it is hard to navigate only with text info even for locals anyone who played a realtime strategy game will probably have similar idea before you launch this site how did people know where to go / what places to avoid depending on their view of the protests there are established information a telegram channel and text format HK map consolidate and visualize it in a larger scale how many people are behind HK map is it a group of people who are known to each other or you anonymous and decentralized if you're anonymous and decentralize how do you communicate and work together I am the only developer or / system admin / PR guy etc there are a handful of admins or I prefer moderators who will verify content submitted by users we know each other online and gained trust by a chain of and countless cooperation basically none of them know who I am in real life we communicate via telegram mostly then I asked him does anyone in your real life know you are the administrator for this site yes few that I trust 100% can you tell me anything about yourself he says I am a twenty-something financial professional the income from my job is still a major funding source for h-hey map how do you keep the info up-to-date our platform is crowd-sourced hk's protest is a movement that's supported by a majority of Hong Kong residents the masses provide us information they see and we process verify and organize them how do you know whether to trust someone's report we have trusted moderators and users for untrusted users we might one send a ground scout to check out the situation to live news broadcast 3 user history for other users up or down vote you can see a little check mark is if such report passed our verification for those we are unable to confirm we either leave it there or delete it right away and then I asked him why did you pick the dog emoji for the police and a dinosaur emoji for the police's special tactical squad dog is a local slang for police officers it is a negative saying but we think it is fair giving given the widespread police brutality dinosaur is for the special tactical units officially known as Raptors how many times you update the site per day continuously whenever there is a protest for the last couple of days we are talking about 10 to 20 hours daily sounds crazy but cannot be compared to those who risk their life and protests on the street now how to follow up with how do you manage to work on this 10 to 20 hours a day but also keep your job there are going strike in Hong Kong and sometimes I took annual leaves when I anticipate protests happening in the past in the past months protests usually happen during weekends people in crypto often talk about the dangerous of centralized structures this was my question to him people in crypto often talk about the dangers of centralized structures and many of the networks in crypto are decentralized or aimed to be do you see any parallels in the work you are doing with the Hong Kong protests RSA is currently centralized but I heard some are already researching the possibility of a decentralized solution that serves a similar purpose that said our site is developed in a hurry and with the limited manpower it is impossible to go that route and then I asked him are the protests also aiming to be decentralized if so why and what strategies are you using for decentralization yes we are by the matter of fact we don't have a single organization that organized the protests protesters form small groups and call for protests and online forum like Li H kg which is Hong Kong's version of Reddit and telegram groups this way we won't have to risk the leader getting compromised by the Chinese government however funding is an area that we can hardly decentralized decentralize except receiving cash donations HK MF is likely the first to push cryptocurrency donations in HK my next question in general what measures do you take when it comes to your technology communication and finances to be able to keep protesting he wrote encrypt everything use VPN and tor interchangeably a separate device with secure OS for more critical stuff like server and database access general communication using telegram and then he put an arrow - telegram secret chat this is sort of like getting more secretive and then another arrow - PG PGP encrypted email for more important stuff avoid Chinese owned company at all cost and try to use a crypto accepted service providers whenever possible then I asked him a follow-up question where you said separate device with secure OS for more critical stuff like server and database access what does that mean that your phone is not connected to the servers that run the website his response I use a separate machine to manage the servers not the one that I use while typing this email this way even the means even if the main system is compromised our server and user user data will remain protected my next question what technologies are apps or improvements do you think crypto needs to make it needs to make it more usable accessibility for example in Hong Kong it is hard to obtain cryptocurrency without extensive kyc which stands for know your customer processes which require identification personal information is the last thing they want to share to a lesser-known third party when they are trying to support a protest that the government is hitting hard I think this can be fixed by increased adoption my next question to him what do the protesters want from either the Hong Kong government or the Chinese government well I cannot speak for the protesters here's the widely accepted five demands one the complete withdrawal of the proposed extradition bill to the government to withdraw they used the word riot in relation to protests three the unconditional release of arrested protesters and charges against them dropped for an independent inquiry into police behavior five implementation of genuine your universal suffrage then I asked what would make you stop protesting again I cannot speak for the protesters but fulfilling the five demands would likely be a prerequisite and then I asked him just to clarify you are not a protester what is your stance on the protests he responded I consider myself a protester but less often to physically participate as I have to manage HK map my next question which is your favourite cryptocurrency and why is there any particular one that is best suited for your purposes I don't have a strong preference and not going to start a war here they all have promising features [Laughter] next question are there any features you'd like to request of any particular cryptocurrencies or any products or services you would like to request of entrepreneurs in the space his response I hope there are Fiat two crypto exchanges in Hong Kong that don't require kyc at least for small amounts but understandably that is not up to the exchanges my last question to him is there anything else you would like to say as a message to my listeners who are primarily cryptocurrency enthusiasts entrepreneurs developers investor investors regulators and all the other roles involved in the space in my opinion two core features a cryptocurrency are transparent and decentralized and we all know China is unlikely to release something that they cannot control see how Hong Kong's one country two systems' China's version of blockchain would very very likely be centralized making it a massive and transparent surveillance tool for the Chinese government here's a side note for listeners he later said that this comment refers to the upcoming Chinese digital yuan with China's increasing influence to foreign cooperation like apple blizzard and ba etc people around the world should reconsider if they still want to take the China money and let the communist government take control I also hope you guys can spend some time to learn about the situation in Hong Kong Hong Kong people need international support to fight the giant let's stand with Hong Kong and hope HK heirs will get their well-deserved freedom and democracy that was promised by the Chinese government 22 years ago also please let me know if you have any blockchain idea that would like to share with us we CH h cares like innovations and that concludes my interview with kuma of HK map live so thank you all for listening I hope I'm not sure how this experiment works I will have to listen to it myself and see what I think but anyway alright so don't forget next up is the news recap stick around for

on stable coins join the over 1 million others and download the crypto comm app today hi thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap we start with a pretty fitting announcement given the interview I just did for the show seventy-five million dollar anonymous Bitcoin fund launches to support cryptocurrency among other areas a new anonymous organization going by the name unknown fund announced that it will invest in and donate seventy five million dollars worth of Bitcoin to startups that quote directly or indirectly support the idea of anonymity preference will be given to the following niches protection of personal data tools for anonymity cryptocurrency and blockchain the organizers say that they are ordinary people from around the world who met on 4chan quote we are you we are your sons and daughters brothers and sisters friends and colleagues our ranks consist of representatives of many countries and nationalities United by a virtual comradely spirit and the belief that we are fighting for the good of many and not for the benefit of some Anonymous is the voice of those who believe in truth freedom and the right to self-expression the unknown fund sites the protection of personal data as one of the big challenges of our time due to the way it has been used to manipulate people the examples it gives are what it calls the ultra targeted advertising used in the campaigns for brexit in the last US presidential election quote one can see how easy it is to manipulate public opinion with enough personal data however the manipulation of people occurs not only in big politics but also in our daily lives a perfect example is the level of addiction that the general population has to social networks addiction orchestrated and achieved by corporations intriguingly unknown fun ended its press release by mentioning that it will start by investing in commercial start-ups and donations to profits nonprofits then it says quote investing is just the beginning anonymous have developed a number of strategies and methods that will be announced later and then it quotes Edward Snowden if you believe in freedom of speech and the media and most importantly in a free and accessible Internet then you are also anonymous our opponent should not doubt our determination or conviction we will continue to fight as much as this area to achieve our goal the second story I want to highlight is what I'm calling TL DR on coin shares a 2019 crypto trends report coin shares released its 2019 crypto trends report a 134 page behemoth that included data from Gartner Bloomberg election capital the World Bank the US Federal Reserve and others and which was presented by meltem to mirrors at the crypto invest that consensus invest conference in New York the part of the report that I wanted to highlight is the one in business models in which coin shares analyzed ICO funding it observes that many crypto foundations are now operating as investment funds for instance one chart shows that the EOS VC fund raised four billion dollars and has deployed six hundred million dollars to date and the ex praying fund by ripple has 12 billion and has deployed five hundred million dollars today meltem tweeted quote using a token to bootstrap open source protocol development seems inefficient after looking at the various types of business models in the space and calling some scalable x' and others not she says quote the market is ripe for M&A activity lots of spare cash on corporate balance sheets and 2018 was a strong year for FinTech M&A with two deals greater than ten billion dollars however not many attractive M&A targets yet they need stable revenue and free cash flow the next headline multi capital multi coin capital releases report finance is blitzscaling VC fund Multi Cohen capital which owns B and B tokens published a report on finance saying quote the by Nance team has continued to execute a fan at a phenomenal pace and they're not showing any signs of slowing down in fact finance is expanding to compete with every major crypto exchange around the world the report then lists those products first peer-to-peer on-ramp for a Chinese retail which competes with whoa B's p2p op offering finance us for us traders which competes with coinbase finance futures to compete directly with VIP max okx and other derivatives exchanges lending and margin trading to compete with BitFenix and pallone e^x launching finance stable coins such as B USD to compete with geminis G USD it bets packs that Fenix's tether and coin basis USD C and finally Fiat on ramps in the long tail of Nations to compete with localized exchange offerings the report concludes quote the buy Nance team is making the explicit decision that they want to be the central hub for all crypto economic activity they want to own staking borrowing lending options trading futures trading asset issuance venture investing spot training sovereign currency tokenization and more I'll let you dive into the report to see how well multi coin makes its case but there is no question the buy Nance that finance is moving quickly on a number of fronts also side note the blocks steven jiang tweeted that finance us makes about 870 dollars per website visitor and as colleague Larry Cermak said Bitcoin base has been making on average 370 dollars per website that's her over the last six months speaking of coin base the next story is coin bases blog post which details how it thinks about proof-of-work it explains its decision to change conformation requirements for four assets include including lowering confirmations for Bitcoin from six down to three hopefully if you've been a listener of this show and of Unchained you know that one of the main benefits of ASIC mining despite its tendency to centralized mining is that it makes the network more secure that's the first point that coin base makes here quote coins are the greatest greatest risk a 51% attack are the ones where there exists large amounts of hash power not actively mining the coin that could begin mining and disrupt the coins blockchain if you want to understand this concept more you should have please check out my Unchained episode with david vorak of SIA coin and nebulous the coin race blog post then goes into the benefits of ASIC friendly consensus mal guerrillas saying quote ASIC resistance merely raises the barrier to entry into the ASIC market this results in greater centralization of mining hardware manufacturing the very situation that the selection of an ASIC resistant algorithm is meant to avoid finally the the post concludes quote every at scale professional industry utilizes specialized equipment it is naive to think that cryptocurrency mining will or should be any different for the next set of headlines I did a little Asia roundup there's a lot going on in Asia now and a switch I'm sure you all know first little tidbit here changshan Moo the
