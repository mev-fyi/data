[Music] hi everyone welcome to unchained your new hype resource for all things crypto i'm your host laura shin author of the kryptopians i started covering crypto seven years ago and as a senior editor at forbes was the first mainstream media reporter to cover cryptocurrency full-time this is the june 10th 2022 episode of unchained with the crypto.com app you can buy earn and spend crypto in one place download and get 25 with the code laura link in the description hey builders looking for one of the best scaling solutions in crypto that's easy avalanche's breakthrough subnet design lets you minimize transaction costs and maximize your speed consistency and user experience to experience web3 like never before head to avox.network to learn more today's guest is lewis cohen co-founder of dlx law welcome louis hey it's great to be here laura heads up everyone i still do not have my nice mic even though i had the cord that hooks my mic up to my computer shipped to me apologies for the sound uh hopefully i will get this while i'm here in austin on tuesday senators cynthia lummus and kirsten gillibrand introduced a new crypto bill called the responsible financial innovation act it defines digital assets plus largely places them under the regulation of the commodities futures trading commission commission which is largely seen as friendlier to the industry lewis you were involved in helping to shape the bill can you tell us more about what this bill would do and what it is proposing yeah thanks laura i think it's really exciting uh to see this i know um the senators um lomas and gillibrand worked really hard to come up with sort of a balancing here in terms of addressing the securities laws and commodity laws issue around digital assets and what they what they put in place i think is a really interesting and pretty innovative framework the sec has of course repeatedly cautioned us that all icos are securities there's there's securities issues all around here and and the senators certainly agree there there are securities issues all over the place what the bill does though is it teases out where the securities activity sort of ends and and where activity between parties who have nothing to do with fundraising or any securities activities are are involved and so in that way it uses a a key defined term ancillary asset and what ancillary asset is is really intending to do is recognize the way the law currently works and that is you know you've probably had many guests on your show i'm guessing laura who've talked about the famous howie test the supreme court case that helps to delineate when uh security is present and very often people will recite i would joke sometimes that i have a tattooed on my arm but people joke about the the four prongs of the howie test that there's an investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profit primarily from the efforts of others but what's often not mentioned are the words that precede that and that's really kind of part of a key piece of the llama spill the words that precede that in the in the howie case are that it in a contract transaction or scheme what that means is that the the court with the howie test is looking at transactions or arrangements where funds are being raised in what appear to be regular commercial transactions hey would you like to buy some whiskey or some orange groves or whatever it may be but really nobody wants the whiskey or the orange groves that are being offered what they want to do is make a profit through the efforts of the sponsor the lumis chilibrand bill does not disturb that so it recognizes that all of that activity is securities activity really it focuses on the assets that are the object of those schemes the ancillary assets and it recognizes that those ancillary assets themselves unless they have the characteristic of the security are not themselves securities and their force can and should generally trade in commodities markets overseen by the cftc it adds though two really interesting pieces one is a sort of materiality threshold and that is that the asset that's traded has to be traded at sufficient volume to make it sort of relevant to have a public policy interest and that amount in the bill is five million dollars equivalent of daily average trading so if an asset is not trading much at all or certainly below the threshold it's sort of not something that the bill concerns itself with and the second thing and this is really the critical thing is that whoever was effectively raising the money the sponsor the project lead are continuing to provide what the bill refers to as the essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts that drive the value of that asset in kind of common speak that's what usually people mean when they refer to a project being sufficiently decentralized or not sufficiently decentralized so when you add this all up laura what we're saying is that where an asset is sold in a securities transaction where it's traded as significant volume and where the project team is still actively involved effectively it's not sufficiently decentralized then there are disclosure requirements that have to be made to the sec and those disclosure requirements a lot will allow market participants to give a much better sense of what's going on with the transaction but at the same time people trading the asset in the market do not have to worry about being engaged in sort of being a securities dealer or a national securities check exchange or anything like that so it really finds a balancing there i know there's a lot to sort of take in with all of that but it's it's a again in in in simplest in summary form it allows people who are not involved in the securities activity to use digital assets in the way that they're intended without the sort of damocles of securities compliance hanging over them while ensuring that those who do use digital assets to raise funds and who continue to be involved with that fundraising activity have securities obligations so i have seen some chatter amongst the kind of crypto law crowd and there's a lot of commentary around title three of the act which is what you were talking about here how the ancillary tokens are used and much of the bill brings crypto under the cftc's purview jw vera who's a law professor at george mason law school and he teaches securities and corporate and banking law with blockchain applications and also recently served in the sec's advisory committee he said to me that he felt that this ancillary token approach is more complicated than need be and he also said that he felt it put too much power in the hands of the sec because they could seek a ruling from the judge that an exemption will not apply by a term called judicial presumption and he said that that process he felt could take years and for that reason could actually be a cudgel that the sec would hold over projects heads what do you say to that i think it's a jw is a great advocate for the industry and for investors and um i think he's got you know a lot of important insights that being said is to really the two points laura that you mentioned and i saw jw's comment and responded to him offline number one in terms of complexity yeah no for sure it's complicated but this is you know very complicated problem and i think when you when you boil it down the answer is reasonably simple which is assets that are not securities shouldn't be regulated as if they were and people who raise money through the sale of securities should be held responsible for the statements that they make so that's in the simplest terms i think that's that's pretty easy to understand in terms of the cudgel it's a great point that he makes because in the law in the u.s and you've probably done podcasts around the world so you have a sense we have principles-based system of common law and that means that we don't have bright line tests and personally i would say that that's a strength of our legal system not a weakness but one of the factors one of the consequences i should say laura about having a principles-based test is that you don't have bright lines and that's just the nature of things the law seeks to be fair and balanced and to ensure that people don't use this law once it's adopted as a way to circumvent the securities laws for actual securities transactions and so the the provision that you mentioned that jw highlighted is one where in fact you know the law seeks to ensure that workarounds can be stopped it takes a lot of effort i want to emphasize um this does not give the sec an ability at a blanket basis to say you know all of these tokens are securities instead it requires the sec to go after a specific project where in good faith it believes that there is a real you know workaround or abuse taking place and it requires them to have a notice and a hearing for every single asset so that's not something that the sec can and should have the resources to do across the board so you know i think it's right to give the sec the opportunity to look for people who are trying to cheat around the edges in a principles-based scheme but it's not something that is a practical matter is going to fundamentally impact the vast you know majority of projects uh people should look at the the law you know for themselves in title iii and what they'll see is that not only are there protections for the sec but there are protections for projects including assumptions that if the sec has not raised concerns within a finite period of time 90 days then the project can continue and also even if the project is asked to present reasons why effectively it believes it's no longer sufficiently decentralized the only consequence of this is not that all of a sudden you know the market stops and people can no longer use the token it simply means that the project has six more months of providing disclosure which is you know not the end of the world so this is not something that's going to fundamentally disrupt you know projects from continuing it may you know cause them to extend slightly the period in which they provide reporting to the market but other than that there's no other consequence it doesn't sort of turn something that was not a security into a security so that's really important to understand so in a moment we're going to talk about some of the other ways in which people felt that this could be handled but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible in just a year and a half since launching on mainnet avalanche has built a vibrant community of builders leaders and innovators expanding what's possible in web3

for your netflix spotify and amazon prime subscriptions download the crypto.com app now and get 25 with the code laura link in the description back to my conversation with lewis i did see additional commentary where people felt that something akin to sec commissioner hester purse's token safe harbor proposal which would give token projects three years in which to decentralize and to no longer be classified as a security might be a better way to handle this issue what's your take on that um commissioner purse is a true leader here and you know that the challenges that she's faced in trying to advocate for not necessarily the crypto industry but just common sense are you know incredible and so um she deserves you know credit from from all of us i think her safe harbor proposals both the original proposal and 2.0 proposal which again brilliantly she put up on github which is i think tremendous are great ideas the challenge with the safe harbor is that is twofold firstly it embraces what some people refer to as the morphing concept the idea that a digital asset can start life as a security then based on things entirely extrinsic to the digital asset later but no longer via security and then later if it sort of other things happen the asset would re-become a security this is not a concept that's just not supported in the law and and really upon any extended thought doesn't make a lot of sense assets don't change their character based on extrinsic factors so so i don't think it's a great idea to embrace this morphing concept the second thing about the safe harbor that is a challenge is that it asserts that tokens are securities and then accepts them from some of the securities law rules that would otherwise apply if they were securities the tokens are not securities and i don't think that from a policy point of view making exceptions for things that really are securities is a great idea if you're a security then then you should you know as commissioner carolyn crenshaw noted when she responded to this put your big boy pants on and comply with securities laws why do you deserve any uh particular exemptions so so creating a safe harbor that would give special and preferential treatment for crypto is not something that i think is fair and balanced that i think you know commissioner crenshaw's critique was unfortunately you know really on point there so so the llamas chile brand bill does not do that it does not create an exception for anything in fact if anything enhances the sec's oversight responsibilities but in doing so it also recognizes that the you know most digital assets that we use don't have the characteristics of securities and therefore you know third parties like people like you and me when you buy ethanol on gemini or you know i buy um you know uh ave tokens on coinbase none of us are engaging in securities transactions that that's kind of a legal fiction and something ridiculous and so lumis gillibrand you know helps all of us work with crypto while still keeping the responsibility on the people who benefit from the fundraising and in that sense i think it's a much more balanced way of of approaching the issue so you say it so clearly as if it's very well established that tokens like ethan ave or whatever these other assets are clearly not securities but the chair of the sec gary gensler has made some noise in the other direction and he doesn't i think view these things as so clear-cut so what makes you so certain and how would you respond to some of his statements where he seems to think that actually the vast majority of digital assets are securities sure we we have a long promised paper if you followed me on twitter you know we analyzed all 259 i believe it is appellate cases involving the howie test since its inception every single one of the investment contract cases and based on that in-depth longitudinal review you know i can say with confidence that there's nothing in the case law that supports the idea that an asset that's recognized as not a security should be hypothetically treated as security when it's traded between people who are not otherwise involved in the transaction like you and me buying buying assets on on gemiini or just trading amongst ourselves or using a decentralized exchange moreover we have the sec's own words you may be familiar if you follow the whole ripple saga that a group of disgruntled xrp holders attempted to intervene in the ripple case as defendants which is kind of an unlikely thing and in doing so they they filed a motion with the court in the ripple action and the sec responded and on page 24 of that response the sec acknowledged that the xrp token is not in cell in itself a security and instead said well similar to the gram token in telegram it's it's not a security but it's the embodiment of an investment contract and so i think there the the sec kind of put their cards on the table the the problem with the statement on page 24 is it doesn't have a footnote and there's no case law support because it's really a novel theory and it's it's it's well within the sec's rights to advocate for novel theories that an asset that is not a security can somehow embody a scheme but that's not something that has been adopted by any appellate court and it's one that presents you know real challenges for the market because again thinking of you and me how do we know when a given asset does or does not embody a scheme we have no basis for determining that and yet if you were a dealer in a commodity asset and you couldn't figure out that it embodied an investment scheme you might be subject for the liability of violating the securities laws as a you know unregistered exchange or unregistered broker dealer that the law doesn't work that way and it doesn't support putting people in jeopardy that way so what lomas gillibrand does is says let's keep the securities laws where where they belong where everybody can determine them and for third parties who are not affiliated with the transaction these things look like commodities and they're presumed to be commodities absent again like you said somebody you know doing some clever work around so so i think i think this creates a balanced approach that the sec can and in the long run i think will you know absolutely accept and embrace as something that's very pro favorable for them and favorable for the cftc too and giving them oversight over the commodities markets that that these digital assets trade in one other aspect of the bill involves stable coins and in light of the recent collapse of the stable coin it's interesting that the definition of payment stable coin in the bill defines that term as a stable coin that is backed by reserves issued by a business entity so what does that mean for algorithmic stable coins such as tara had been would they be prohibited based on this definition or does it simply mean that anything you know that is under that algorithmic stable stablecoin model simply would not be called a stablecoin or yeah that's a great question laura algorithmic stablecoins are a subset of an example of what digital assets can do because digital assets at the end of the day are just code you can kind of make them do anything you want and it's really difficult to tell people not to do certain things so the the bill itself endeavors to address the kind of stable coin that we most commonly see and think probably is most commonly improperly used you know it's an interesting thing whether there can ever be a viable algorithmic stable coin i tend toward the skeptical on that front but you know i'm not going to say it's an impossibility that is a matter that's hard to legislate around um sometimes i would say laura that that people ask well what isn't a digital asset as a very existential you know platonic question what's a digital asset and oftentimes i'll answer by asking you a question for a platonic like right what's a piece of paper what what is a piece of paper well whatever it is it's what's written on it right and it's the same thing with a digital asset the digital acid is a medium it's not an end and so what it is depends on those facts and circumstances that around it what the code does what promises if any are made all of those factors just like a piece of paper if i write you know laura we go out for for beers later and i forgot to bring my wallet and i say i promise to pay you you know 150 plus interest by next week i've given you a note right the piece of paper became a note if i write oh let's get into a business venture together and this will represent one share of that business interest it could be an equity security the the piece of paper is whatever you do with it and a digital asset is just the same thing so with stable coins it really depends on how the stable coin works the bill addresses you know the most important area of regulation which are payment stable coins which are backed by by fiat dollars but it it it leaves to elsewhere how do you manage all the wild and crazy things that can go on with with digital assets you know you can put one digital asset inside another digital asset we have all these wrap digital assets you have all kinds of things going on in this exciting area i think it's terrific but each one has to be examined on their own terms and i think the bill wisely when it comes to stable coins limits itself to a defined area the bill also has a provision for dows or decentralized autonomous organizations to be considered as legal entities what's the intention of that clause to me dows are one of the most fascinating areas in blockchain and crypto full stop uh broadly the the bill tries to help sort of provide some guidance to the taxation of taos by at least creating some subset of dows that can be either taxed in a certain way i think some people misread the bill saying you know you must fall into those categories or somehow you're not allowed or i don't know what people thought it's really just a a way of organizing certain dows and then and then taxing them in a certain way people are free to organize themselves in any way they want you know a dao is is like a you know a social club with a common treasury um people can come and go and be part of it or not as they as they see fit what fascinates me about dowse laura is what you can accomplish with them and i think the maker community is is perhaps the most exciting example right now of something that's both at scale and operated over an extended period of time but we don't know where it goes the bill is not trying to define you know what it takes to be a dow or you know what are good dows or bad dows or et cetera it's simply trying to say for certain sorts of dows that that have a legal wrapper and embrace that how they can and should be taxed and it's endeavoring to be helpful in this regard as i'm not a tax lawyer so i'm not necessarily best positioned to go into detail on the tax but i think the important thing laura for your for your listeners is that it's not sorry trying to be prescriptive as to what is a permitted dow or what is not the bill also removes the capital gains tax obligations for cryptocurrency transactions of 200 or less are there any other parts of the bill that we've not touched upon that you'd like to call attention to yeah i think really it's the interplay here between finding a way you know we we've had for the last you know four or five years this this fundamental kind of knocking of heads of everything so security nothing so security the sec should oversee things you know they shouldn't and the bill for the first time really provides a path forward that balances those two things and i think is a is a kind of detent or glasnost between you know kind of warring factions and and to me that's the most exciting thing i would add to it and i really i say this and i think for all of us who are you know american citizens you know we don't often necessarily get up and wave the flag but to see senators gillibrand and lummus come together i'm certain that they have significant differences in many policy areas but being able to work together across the aisle to present something that makes sense for both of their constituents and for the for the us as well it makes me really proud i have to say i think this is a very you know proud moment to say that you know for all of our many complaints about our government and how it works whichever side you know of things you're looking at i think this is an opportunity to see two leaders in the space and two women leaders right you know step up and say we're going to get past all that and make something work and i think you know the two senators and their staffs deserve immense credit here from all of us even if you disagree even if you think it's a terrible solution i think that's fine comment on it it's not going to get you know adopted in this congress we all understand that i think it will be up on github i understand that's the expectation and engage in the process and be part of that change you know instead of sitting on the sidelines and complaining the bill gives us for the first time everybody an opportunity to you know say what they feel and let's see if we can create something here in the u.s that's made in america and really as good as anything there is out there in the world when it comes to a regulatory framework for digital assets yeah and i should note that senator gillibrand is on the agriculture committee and senator lemus is on the bank committee both of which are key committees for moving this kind of legislation forward so we will see what happens especially in the next congress when um this bill might kind of get more airtime all right well thank you so much for coming on unchained uh laura spent my pleasure thank you so much don't forget next up is the weekly

investigations from sec and korean authorities bloomberg reported thursday that the sec is investigating the marketing claims behind tara usd aka ust the now defunct algorithmic stablecoin that collapsed last month according to bloomberg sources the sec will be attempting to determine whether ust marketing violated several federal u.s investor protection laws terraform labs said it was unaware of sec action related to ust marketing and the sec has declined to comment also this week court documents published by the u.s second circuit on june 8 made clear that terraform labs and its co-founder jo kwon will be required to comply with sec subpoenas related to the ongoing investigation of tara's mira protocol kwon had initially been served with a subpoena in this investigation upon his arrival at missouri's main net conference in new york in september 2021 where he was a speaker at the time terraform labs argued that the sec lacked jurisdiction over the entity due to terraform's lack of sufficient contacts with the us it also argued that the sec violated its own rules of practice when it served the subpoena by handing a copy to quan in person despite tara's lawyering the court ruled that the sec was in line with its own roles and did have jurisdiction in the case because terraform labs had u.s employees and had previously stated that 15 percent of its users resided in the country investigations are also ongoing in korea according to the financial times the seoul metropolitan police agency said it was looking into allegations that employees of terraform labs embezzled an undisclosed amount of the organization's bitcoin holdings those holdings had allegedly been loaned to market makers to help buttress the ust peg last month but there has been no independent verification that the funds were used according to their stated purpose roxton merges successfully wednesday morning ethereum's robsten testnet the largest of its three test nets completed the protocol's first successful public merge of an active test network ethereum's other two testnets gourley and sepolia are expected to merge as well in the coming months in the proposed merge of the ethereum main net to be enacted q3 or q4 of 2022 the existing economic activity on the proof of work chain will be merged into the proof of stake chain currently being run on the bacon chain with a set of independent validators each staking 32 eth while robston's successful dress rehearsal bodes well for the technical aspects of the merge concerns are building about the centralization of staking both in terms of software clients running the network as well as staking as a service providers for example the prison client holds a two-thirds market share in the validator set for ethereum's beacon chain which is worrying because if prism had a bug it could cause a consensus failure on the network additionally staking services contribute to this centralization more than a third of all validators are controlled by staking services of which lido is far and away a leader and a significant portion of the rest are operated by centralized exchanges op tokens stolen on back of winter mute mix-up 20 million of the new op tokens from optimism were stolen due to a mistake made by optimism's market-making partner wintermute optimism provided the tokens to wintermute in the form of a loan unfortunately for wintermute the address they had supplied and confirmed to the optimism team was an ethereum wallet that did not have proper support for layer 2 chains an adversarial actor took possession of the 20 million op tokens that had been sent to the defunct address optimism and wintermute both published statements on the matter winter mute has taken full responsibility for the attack and promised to buy tokens on the open market to counteract any sales by the attacker and to make the protocol whole winter mute also promised to pursue legal recourse against the attacker provided the tokens are not returned within the next week if they are returned a gig is in the offing wintermute described the adversary's actions as rather impressive and offered an opportunity for consulting work kane warwick founder and ceo of optimism-based derivatives liquidity protocol synthetics wrote in a tweet thread wednesday seeing the funds in your address is not sufficient as a test the correct way to test a transaction is to ensure you can move the received tokens but like zero percent of people do this my conclusion after years of watching this stuff happen is that it's not possible to avoid every mistake but communicating them transparently and quickly is the optimal approach finance faces increased scrutiny a number of developments this week increased scrutiny of finance by regulators and law enforcement in the united states bloomberg broke a story about an sec investigation into the initial coin offering or ico of bnb a token with a nearly 50 billion market cap the bnb ico occurred in 2017 100 million tokens were sold to the public for 15 million dollars the firm has recently backed away from its initial promise to use 20 percent of the exchange's profits to buy back the token each quarter chiang fang zhao founder and ceo of binance claimed in a 2020 blog post that the decision was a result of legal advice so as not to classify bnb as a security according to bloomberg also this week reuters released an investigative report on how finance became a hub for hackers fraudsters and drug dealers to the tune of 2.35 billion dollars the report caused a stir in the community finance responded in a blog post by publishing a portion of its email correspondence with reuters in related news binance received regulatory permission for the opening of regional european headquarters in paris this week after 18 months of work with french regulators the exchange has agreed to invest 100 million dollars in france to advance crypto technology

june 4th last friday the discord server of hugo labs was hacked a participant obtained the login credentials of a senior community manager and absconded with keys controlling approximately 32 nfts including one bayc nft according to crypto security research firm peckshield the attack was first publicized by twitter user nft herder yooka did not confirm the hack until 11 hours after the initial tweet from nft herder this was the second time in less than 10 months that eucalapse has been compromised on april 26th 2022 eucalypts has closed a 2.6 million loss in a phishing attack related to an intruder accessing its instagram account when bayc founder gordon gauner responded to the incident he blamed discord saying discord isn't working for web3 communities we need a better platform that puts security first however stephen fink of nouns now tweeted that it's users faults for clicking on phishing links you didn't lose your nft because you used discord you lost your nft because you signed a malicious transaction with your key yuca labs recently raised 450 million dollars in venture funding in a seed round entailing a monster valuation osmosis bug in a temporary lapse in judgment the osmosis dex was compromised on thursday after a bug was found that allowed users to increase their position sizes without adding capital through the deposit and withdrawal of funds an official post from the osmosis team stated liquidity pools were not completely drained devs are fixing the bug scoping the size of losses likely in the range of roughly 5 million dollars and working on recovery on-chain activity and validators were paused upon discovery of the vulnerability but not before five million dollars was lost one culprit was the fire stake validation pool which reported that it had taken two million dollars from the protocol during a temporary lapse of good judgment representatives from the poll said we were thinking about our family's future and not the future of
