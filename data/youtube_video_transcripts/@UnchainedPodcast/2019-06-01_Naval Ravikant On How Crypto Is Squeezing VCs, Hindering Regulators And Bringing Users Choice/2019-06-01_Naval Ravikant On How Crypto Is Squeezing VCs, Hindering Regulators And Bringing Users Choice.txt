fall thank you thanks for having me I guess you're all out of plan here as an influencer Zechariah no no no no no I literally was telling my life driver I was like this is the most important interview I think I'm gonna do today no no no no for this podcast please don't be self-deprecating everybody knows that you I mean everybody's following you on Twitter everybody's retweeting your tweets so let's chat about what you're up to last time you emailed me me it was to see you were no longer CEO of Angeles and he hadn't been for a while but in July I interviewed you and I think you said you were on a title I mean I'm not big big on titles I've been I started AngelList seven years ago I've been running it in some form or another for those 7 years today I'm executive chairman I've couple of good CEO so the different units cuz Angeles has a bunch of different business units running it so I'm still day-to-day here at the office I still kind of do my thing I just don't have that many direct reports anymore which is a relief to me after seven years that's all of it well percentage review time do you spend here versus with medicine well physically I'm evangelist the whole time medicine doesn't even have an office but I mean it and just your your time I think mental bandwidth it varies some weeks is fifty-fifty some weeks is 70/30 angellist you know a metastable honestly my partner Lucas Ryan and Josh science do a lot of the heavy lifting I'm just the face so I do a lot of talking okay okay so you're not it's not like you've made some wholesale shift over to crypto I would say my mind sure is heavily crypto so even on AngelList I spent most of this year building coin list witches are legal regulated well-lit marketplace for AI cos that we started with protocol labs and we spun that out as a separate entity but I was basically playing the founder role on that so I helped assemble the company race you know raising some money just kind of create the whole infrastructure for it get some of the early customers and then recruited a team for it a really capable team and then handed it off okay and I know that coin list also recently I launched a sister company where public crypto the Republic's been around for a while so Republic is an angel Asst crowdfunding spin-out so basically we had a bunch of angels alumni who left a few years ago and they started a crowdfunding company around title three of the JOBS Act and that was Republic and recently as you've seen a lot of AI CEOs they want to be legal they want to be compliant with securities laws and so they are doing that using coin list but that only allows it to sell to accredited investors they also want to be able to bring them on the rest of the community because community building is critical with with the coins and tokens and so Republic is a crowdfunding site that is legal and so Republic crypto is this crypto arm that helps these i ceo's also reach sort of more ordinary users but with regulations and controls around how much they can invest and the levels of disclosure sophistication that that's required so yeah so the angel is family I'm pretty big now we have coin lists we have Republic with producthunt with Angela's talent and of course evangelist fundraising so at this point it looks more like an alphabet you know like a group with a good group of companies rather than a single company and so I'm exact chairman of that group okay and what public with the icy notes on that platform being limited to like 1 million or some small amount I I think the base case the easiest case is 1 million which is what's in there by law but republic could also do things like reggae plus offerings and other offerings that can open it up to more investors it's just that the disclosure of the diligence the preparation all that work goes up so it just depends on how much you're trying to raise what specific circumstances every company are unfortunately when it comes to securities law nothing is simple I can't summarize it on a podcast but if you're interested in any listeners interested they should reach out to the Republic team or to the coin this team okay so I want to establish everything that you're doing across crypto I kind of did a little bit of digging you're on the board of the Z cash foundation you don't have to crypto index fund the holes ten which I wrote about I will put that chair notes a twines Bolton yeah what oh yeah bitwise yeah is the name of the company hold ten as a matter of fun I've been pushing and called the whole time I guess they wanted to be conservative I think they want to go very mainstream right the whole point of an index fund is making a low-cost vehicle available to lots of people so to the average Joe who may not know what Hodel is I think it's a hold of misspelling that is true which it is which is why we love it um obviously you're also doing coin list or a public crypto and you've also invested in final coin blogstock Ryan money Marc Shaiman podcast a few episodes back for listeners who about them you invest in bass coin which is attempting into a stable coin yeah did you invest it in n√∫mero tiny bit in my way back when ledger racks tiny bit way back when chia coin crack in Corbett there's about three more cooking right now that haven't been announced but I actually don't do a whole lot and in the private side of crypto most of my crypto investing it's absurdly all the public coins you know the big coins the etherium those things all go through metastable and even the private investments a lot of them go through a metastable I only do personally on top of metastable if I want to put it more basically so is there any like particular philosophy or thesis that you're following as you make these choices about what to get involved in yeah at least at the moment Li have a distinct point of view which is that for the most part I'm looking at the money and money like tokens the things that can become a store of value unit of account media of exchange or be power or power financial contracts and I make that trip because I think those are the most near-term applications that are close to being fulfilled by my close I mean five to ten years I don't mean two years and those are also the applications that are the largest markets frankly if you get to redefine what money is that is a much larger generational shift of value than building an applicant application the exceptions I make I do make an exception of certain apps that I think can be really large like fall coin is an example where false storage is a big business but none of this is investment advice you should not invest in any of this it's like my advice people that would be if they want to invest in this asset class it's crazy risky just by a tiny amount and index fund and be done with it that's the best thing you can do obviously this this asset class makes venture look like safe bonds and you know value equities so anyway so going back to that I invest in the money and money like tokens take me large or things that I think can be platforms that's why I'm in a block stack that's a lot of fall coin because I think they can be large platforms and I'm also invested in mesh which I just like what they're doing I'm sorry computer Orkut they used to be obviously call something else but orchid which is doing some kind of a tour slash incentivize VPN for the world just because I think that real unsensible VPNs or something that world needs especially a lot of countries it's something that crypto is uniquely well-suited for because there they need to be decentralized by nature and even resistant to attacks by nation-states so I think that's a good thing for you maybe it just needs to exist yeah well I was reading your blog and you basically dreamed that up in 2014 and I wondered if Steve Waterhouse's that under of orchid if he stole that from you or you gave me idea or what happened there well in 2014 2013 I got bitten by the Bitcoin bug and the wire you know the virus took hold and I couldn't think of anything other than this new model for how to create and deploy protocols and how to kind of administer and control a large networks so on my blog which is startup boy calm I wrote a few articles where I have some ideas about how else this could be used and I missed some use cases and I picked out some good use cases there's sort of the obvious ones and there were some that I put in there there still haven't come true like we need a very fast clearing low transaction fee coin that can be used for settlements between fast-moving anonymous real world objects like cars negotiating rights away for example so some of these don't even exist yet but I tried to get fanciful and it's a nature of features and we're gonna get a few right and then you take credit for everything that comes after it and you get a few completely wrong and you sleep those under the rug but it's all out there in the open I put it down in writing so it keeps me intellectually honest yeah and honestly I mean you know I get pitched so many things but when I got the orchid pitch I was like oh this this is interesting unfortunately I didn't get to write about it but it's a nature of covering this space where there's five million things we write all the time so I'm kind of curious because you have this sort of long history in startups and in Silicon Valley and things are shifting right now so I'm gonna do a brief summary of your career feel free to correct me if I'm and any of this but no earlier you launched the opinions and according to the San Jose Mercury News your VCS and one of the cofounders convinced you and so many other co-founders that the company was worthless they engineered a merger rebrand and went public was later acquired by eBay for six hundred million dollars and you and those co-founders who felt that you had been sort of deuce sued and later settled and then that experience led you to become an expert in tarnishing negotiation which then lets you to become a match maker basically for startups and investors which led to angel angel list and obviously you know angellist has been hugely successful but here we see but maybe what you tell me you know if you agree with this that the startup model is getting up ended and here it is now you're in your you've joined this firm this crypto hedge fund that is not even investing in startups at all but mostly in decentralized networks so I'm sort of interested to hear how you think this model of like VC back startups that eventually go public has evolved over time how you would describe the current phase of where we're at and in that yeah it's changed a lot for sure with AngelList we tried to create a network to bring a lot of the startup deals online get them access to more investors get more investors around the world access to startups and that's that's the work relatively well today I'd say about a quarter of the deals in the english-speaking world mostly California New York and Europe and Australia are available on AngelList to a savvy investor also about half the company's startup companies in the english-speaking world are recruiting on AngelList and there's about a million candidates available on there so we've definitely had a big impact but the real financial financing shift for startups that's happened is I CEOs and there we've created a new native token model native to the internet native to startups that helps them get funded online it's still in very early phases so it's frothy it's full of fraud it's for a little chunk so it's not something that every startup can or shouldn't use it's really designed for a small class of internet protocols that I think are being developed today that could not have been developed twenty years ago the the first generation of internet protocols the HTTP TC the eyepiece of the world these are free open systems where nobody got paid for them and they basically treat every resource in the protocol as too cheap Demeter but I think we're now entering an age where these inner we have next-generation internet protocols that are starting to meet our scarce objects digital scarcity and that could be money money is a digital object but it's scarce obviously don't wanna be let's create it as you go bandwidth is another one file storage maybe another one mid although that's debatable may turn out that energy is another one etc so whenever you have digital scarcity blockchains are creating a new generation of internet protocols they come bundled with these tokens which is how you keep track oh who owes who what in this scarce environment the tokens themselves and create a financing mechanism because their bearer assets where the owning a token is all you need you no need to register with the company or file with the SEC they can be more freely traded all around the world they get treated like cash or money like instruments and so startups have sort of created their own new financing mechanism that's native to the internet and that can up and parts of VC and where it's happening is at the edges so if you look today that you know five sorry let's go back like 10 15 years ago if you want to raise VC financing you went to Sand Hill Road or you went to a few forums in New York or Boston your classic series a series b2b CCD and maybe there was a little bit of angel investing in right at the beginning and then you rode this whole wave down until you got to go IPO ten years later well now the prawn is the IPO markets have closed post post Enron they're much tighter much harder to go public so people are starved for liquidity and on the other side seed investors angel investors angel this syndicates micro funds all of this has come up so you have a lot of seed money floating around a lot more options there you also have things like Y Combinator and all the incubators you have now you have saps for tokens but you also have safes for easy in easy legal documents so the early stage has gotten very rich very vibrant very innovative the very late stage has just been completely closed and the VC model in the middle hasn't changed so what's happening now is the early stages creeping up as the seed funds are raising more and more money and the seed rounds are getting larger I was involved with a company that just closed a four million dollar seed round in a safe note which is an absurd concept you know three years ago you couldn't have done that let alone ten years ago and then on the other side the I CEOs are letting open the liquidity valve and taking the place of some of what the IPO is used to do and these seeds are getting squeezed in the middle so now if you're a venture capitalists you either have to participate in a seed round for one of these companies or the a or you miss it because the next round is the ICL there's no Series B or Series C now obviously I'm only talking for a very small class of companies these are again the protocol token companies but people are definitely trying to expand the definition of what a protocol token company is and who should be using tokens so I think the VC model really is in danger of getting squeezed down to a very very small space which is sort of exciting honestly in a certain way I'm sure it's a signing of scary you know the VCS have developed norms over the decades that prevent them from getting squeezed or getting defrauded although one could argue there was a period of time when that power was used against entrepreneurs because they got too good at it so now the pendulum is swinging in the other direction where an entrepreneur is far more likely to be fraught avicii than the other way around so it's so I think that in the new model I see how investors seed investors they need to learn some of the same norms and practices and defenses that that sort of help balance the market out you know in in biology terms there is a predator-prey relationship right between these these two characteristics although there's an arm basically an evolutionary arms race right every time the entrepreneurs get a new instrument the VCS need to like evolve to make sure they don't get taken advantage of and vice-versa and historically the entrepreneurs were always at a huge disadvantage because the VCS do thousands of deals this stick around for a long time the entrepreneur shows up signs are furniture first term sheet they don't know what they're doing but now the internet is leveling that great playing field with the internet people exchange information incubators level the playing field YC level the playing field a lot AngelList levels of playing field yeah but one thing that I'm wondering in in a way it is disruptive and yet at the same time I feel like a lot of the people that are able to invest in these ICS are people like these scenes people who have money particularly you know something like coinless that does is restricted to accredited investors so is it really that disruptive Oh even with coinless restriction I would guess the 90 percent plus of the capital is coming from non VCS well okay yeah let's just talk about disruption in terms of shrink who has money who's able to get in on these deals well there's okay so let's let's talk about in to two forms one is new players I would argue ninety percent plus the money is coming from new players second is on the terms the terms is coming on is very company friendly so now the company can put hundreds of investors into a round which before they would have had one lead VC and a few angels and the third is actually when the companies blockchains go live and the tokens turned into a real use case was being used for real network then retail investors can go in on these secondary exchanges like a coin base or a Gemini or a Kraken and they can buy stuff there too so it is opening up I'm not saying it's perfect it's not gonna happen overnight also as we can see like you know when we've opened up the market from just VCS to I CEOs the valuations and the pricing has literally increased 10x it's got insane so it's not clear you want to increase it that much that fast while the norms aren't in place because you have companies that probably couldn't raise five million bucks through the venture circuit that are suddenly raising 50 million my CEOs and that's not a good thing so so the market needs to settle out there needs to be a little bit of a crashed it needs to be a little bit of a comeuppance for so for some of these investments and then I think it'll become more rational it's the nature of technology that there's always a new zubrin's there's always a bubble there's always a crash and we just have to go through that cycle here too and it can you imagine right now any mechanisms that would sort of both help keep the democratizing aspect as well as sort of rein in some of these wild valuations for saying I think there's needs to be a market correction for a lot of the junk so you know a lot of the poor poorly thought through projects the need are gonna fail the ship product or they gonna ship product and it's not going to amount anything or people going to figure out that oh the decentralized version of this is an even worse idea decentralized edition was the centralized version didn't work why is the decentralized interesting so the people will figure that out the investors will sell those tokens the market will crash there'll be the inevitable cry for the government to step in and do something and I think that's the critical time period if the government doesn't step in and do something I think it's actually a little better because then the market will correct and we'll learn if the government does sense step in and do something you know something quote unquote then you get another set of rules and applying a hundred years from now that no longer apply meanwhile most the capital formations these overseas so I think it depends there's probably a happy medium but the medium isn't in the middle it's probably more in the favor of just letting the market play out and correct itself out to some extent when you look at early investors in Bitcoin in theory M they've collectively made over a hundred billion dollars and to them that's almost you know returns on investment so it's it's money that they came in and they sort of created out of thin air so to them spending about all the people that buy I mean name name any of the other hundreds of all kinds you know what I mean like it's not you to see it for those it's just I I sincerely hope that anyone who's buying especially the all points it's doing you with an extremely small percentage than that worth so they won't lose sleep at night if it goes away anyone who's putting in a meaningful amount could be in for a really rude surprise at the end of the day in an open market you can't protect that everybody the the price of protecting is basically killing the market and turning it back into a crony capitalist system or turning into a highly restrictive system so you can't have it both ways you can't have it open and democratize all at the same time having you know ninety and babysitting so you got a big why do you feel like there must be some way to combine the two and you know to do both III don't know I think that that's the that's the middle of the sec tries to walk but at the end but this one is tougher because these are global markets so even if you stop a US citizen you say hey you can't trade this token they can just go anonymously and do it somewhere overseas it's a purely digital assets and I think one important thing to realize here is that we've always had strong financial regulations but we have no speech regulation speech is free because we're a free society and we're not gonna do away with free speech because it's the fundamental basis for a free society but now money is just code and code it's just speech so money and speech are actually the same thing so you're trying to keep you just free and you're trying to restrict the flow of money and the two of those just can't go together and what do you mean by that when you say like money is is a form of speech and I don't really know what that means well so in this case what bitcoin did was it turned code into money right so bitcoins pure code there's no paper there's no guns there's a federal government it's just pure code so to stop Bitcoin you gotta stop code and code is actually just speech it's just a bunch of numbers and letters that are write down the computer interprets so you have to stop me from writing those numbers or letters down a certain sequence and conveying them to other people to stop them from loading it up a computer somewhere in the world to stop that somebody else from then turning that into money so you can't control the way money flows onto the unless you can stop the developers from writing the code and from talking to each other and from thinking and the regime that could do that would probably be one of the most evil regimes on the planet not a society that I think any of us were gonna live in so essentially by turning money into this right by turning speech into code or just writing in a code and that computers can interpret and then turning code into money that computers can exchange you can't stop money from moving around anymore this is what China's figuring out this is why they had to shut down all the exchanges because they had huge capital flight issues because they're trying to control the egress of ingress and egress of money in China but you can't do that unless your firewall policy you can filter out all the traffic that has to that looks like money and it's really hard to recognize what it is that this is all encrypted to begin with there's all these zeros and ones flowing by on the wire trying to figure out which one is someone talking on WeChat and which one is money really hard problem so yeah that's working I mean obviously I mean there are so many theories about like why China did the the obviously capital flight is one other people are saying that they want to do their own cryptocurrency but I think one thing that I've looked into and that confuses me still is I just wonder why they even shut down the Bitcoin mining do you have or have not have not well Bitcoin mining the miners are a very small set of people who are very well known to the government so if they're concerned about capital flight they can literally just watch those few actors whereas if there's general training going on the exchanges and it's very frothy then you have to basically monitor the exchanges of course I think it's extremely heavy-handed they shut down the exchanges I think it'll backfire because what's gonna happen is sites like little bit coins if their exchanges are going to capture the just the the excess and it's gonna go offline where they won't go to track it my sense is it was it's disappeared guests I have known set of information but my sense is done for capital flight reasons then with the miners you can just track the capital flight so it's much easier control I think in the medium term they do know they have to re-enable it they have to re-enable it because this is very much the future of Internet protocols and they can't miss out on the next generation of protocols this is also the beginning of digital commodities and when I came to physical commodities they went out there and tried to accumulate as many of them as possible so this should be no different and this so I think it's more likely if they would nationalize the miners then they shut down the miners interesting okay we're getting a little bit further away from where I wanted to go but I actually just want to go back to the this tension about like protecting investors but also you know letting innovation go I you know know that you were involved in getting the JOBS Act passed um those are the crowdfunding rules that enabled everyday people to invest actually is less well known JOBS Act really enabled I SEOs in one critical way before the JOBS Act it was completely illegal to solicit the public publicly for investment even to accredits you literally could only go through words of mouth and closed networks like AngelList or YC you could not for example you know announced in a press release that you're raising money even from accredits and the JOBS Act title the JOBS Act allowed something called general solicitation and that seemed like it was going to be a big deal but it wasn't so in 2013 when that was announced we had Angelus enabled general solicitation a lot of fanfare around it nobody used it so we thought it was dead on arrival until the ICL showed up and the ice eels rely on it okay okay and then in title 3 of the JOBS Act enables crowdfunding which is what I think you were referring to or small dollar investors can invest in early stage companies well one thing that I found a little bit curious when I was just singing mighty mystery was you know you worked on this funding mechanism that would open up investment to the crowd but then with the ICO is one of the first things you did was pointless which is you know for wealthy investors and I just wondered well coin is Plus Republic together can hit the whole market so yeah because of the way the regulations are written unfortunately the current law assumes that if you have a million dollar net worth you're a genius and if you have lower than a million dollars you're a fool so you fall into two completely different regulatory frameworks so we have to have two different entities but between those two entities you can do a full I co2 accredited and non-accredited that's the law I don't make it up I don't I don't think it's necessary rational reasonable if are up to me it would be more of a sophistication test and it would be a smooth gradient rather than a binary cutoff between 1 million above and below but that's just the way the law is written well I'm not actually if you because you were involved in lobbying for that and kind of helping to formulate that regulation so I wondered if you had any ideas about how they might do things better yeah the the current regulatory infrastructure is a just a giant mess of individual regulations that have been piled on since the 1930s Act so over the last 80 something years and it's the infrastructure of Wall Street runs on which is the most powerful lobby in the world and doesn't want anything to change so just getting the JOBS Act through was a miracle because it really did seem to some elements on Wall Street like it was a threat it was a bypass around their chokehold on capital formation and capital distribution so I wouldn't expect a lot of regulatory relief I think what we can we can hope for it is in horsemen relief maybe a little bit of enlightened non-regulation of crypto just like there was non regulation of the internet in the early days so little hands-off and then most importantly global competition because there are other countries in the world that don't own the reserve currency of the world but don't have strong financial infrastructure that would like to be able to play in the next generation of financial infrastructure so I think that will keep that will help people keep each other honest okay so you're not thinking about getting into lobbying game again god no I mean I do a little bit behind the scenes here and there like there's this whole stock options thing in the Senate recently so we waited on that I've definitely been talking to and helped educating some people on Capitol Hill about crypto and you know what the kind of enlighten regulation there is and we've responded to information request from the SEC as they're actually very up to speed so they're they're quite knowledgeable about it but they come in and they ask us for data so I put to spin all of that but I'm not gonna go out there and lobby Congress so yeah okay all right well we're gonna talk about what a blocking feature looks like in Hound of all asbestos terpenes but first I'd like to take a quick break to tell you about our fabulous sponsor on-ramp if you're starting up a new project or needs to design our branding help on an existing one on-ramp as he covered on-ramp is a full-service creative agency that has helped numerous companies including many in the crypto space maximize their brand awareness gain traction and accelerate growth on-ramp has a passion for assisting brands and boosting business results and can help with everything from website and logo design to social and content strategy focus on your core technology and leave the rest to on-ramp to learn more and see how that helped passionate entrepreneurs achieve their dreams go to think on rep comm I'm speaking with navall rom-com partner at metastable and chairman of angeles so let's talk about how you evaluate tokens do you have any kind of step-by-step process when you get a pitch or hear about a token like what do you look for first what do you look for next what factors make you realize it's not worth researching further yeah first I send it to my partner Lucas it's a little glib but it's a way of telling you that even though I think I'm fairly sophisticated in the space it's very very difficult to evaluate anything Lucas and Josh actually in many cases when the code is available along with technologies available there are a lot of the source code they'll review the buyers the developers they'll track down their histories and really try and do a level of technical due diligence that I think is critical in this space even to an extent that it's not adventure adventure someone comes to you and says you know I'm a professor and so-and-so and I've written this code on VR headgear it's enough to use the application or use the prototype whereas here I think you actually have to go and review the source code it's just another level and then what are you looking for it like what would be red flags in the code well the number of people in the world were qualified to develop an internet protocols probably numbers in the hundreds it's not in the hundreds of thousands so you have to basically make sure they know what they're doing in terms of distributed systems engineering encryption protocol design cryptography all that stuff so you're looking for technical competence you're looking for a good design you're looking for having thought through all the various holes you're looking for experience and then there are there are outright frauds in the space where the swipe papers look really good but they're backdoors in the code so Lucas used to make a living beforehand by claiming bug bounties by finding holes and coins or bugs and coins so he also looks at those kinds of things so for example you know we looked at the parody wallet stuff a while back and Lucas concluded that it was just too dicey there was the code was just too complicated and they were trying to do too much so he didn't identify a specific hole but he said this is the kind of thing that has holes so we can't trust this so we have to be very conservative on the technology side at a market level we look to see is there a big is there a big enough market for this is this trying to be a money like token is it really bringing novel technology how is it priced and you know right now I'm probably getting hit with like 10 I see how it deals a day and 9 out of 10 are actually pretty easy to dismiss because very often they're just companies that don't need a token we're not interested in block chains or cryptography until suddenly the ICL boom started or their ideas that often didn't work as a centralized company so why would they work in the decentralized so and a lot of them don't need a token in the middle or they don't need their particular token in the middle they would be better off especially because all the winning here open-source software somebody's just gonna fork them remove their proprietary token and insert a Bitcoin or an aetherium or maybe a version of proprietary token that gives 0.1% the developers instead of 10 or 100 percent to developers so I think a lot of it is just outright greed and so those ones are easier to dismiss then I think there's a category that are interesting but probably too early where people are trying to build you know next generation marketplaces or broad applications almost platform like applications but I think we're still at the infrastructure layer so I tend to dismiss most of those I don't I think that might be fine and investments for other people but I have a strong viewpoint that we're still in the infrastructure phase here so I tend to remove a bunch of those so that's sort of like choosing not to invest in web man but later investing what in instacart something like that something like that hopefully that would be that would be good if that works out there's also a number of these that are what I consider asset tokens where they're not really a protocol where you have some digital thing you're moving around underneath it's actually rather mapping some asset in the real world like a piece of real estate or a car or a share in a real-world company I also think those are less interesting because they're not it's not fully digital it's not fully protocol native it requires external enforcement by lot of legal authorities and as such it's basically security by another name so those ones also less interested in intent to dismiss and then when you get into what I consider to be the protocol tokens and especially the gold standard or the money like protocol tokens the bar there is really high because there's only going to be one to five winners in that entire space so the technology yes why do you think that money has a very powerful network effect to it one way to look at it is you know if we didn't have Geographic national boundaries we probably only have the US dollar or the equivalent for the entire world we wouldn't have thousands of currencies the currencies only exists because the national borders money is like language it's something that's intrinsic to the human species we wanted to be as open as possible in the world tends towards one now within money itself they're different use their store of value like gold there's unit of account where we use dollars for today and there's meeting of exchange where we actually currently use digital packets that represent US dollars or singing digital signatures represent US dollars and the next money could be all three of those things in one it could be a different one for each of those three things or it could be that we have a basket of things for each one and it's not clear yet nobody really knows whether it's going to be one or three or twenty or a hundred but it's more likely going to be in the one to five one to 10 range so now you're basically saying okay there's hundreds of still business plans to do these there's only going to be one maybe two winners so you really really have to have a very very high technical or for what you think is going to do well and today the default use case is default case is probably going to be some combination of the you know top 20 crypto currencies so to get in there and unseen one of those you're gonna have to come up with a pretty fundamental innovation and it's not why you've invested in base point and z cash like it sounds like maybe you think that a stable coin will definitely stay at a stable point yeah stable coin is one of those coins that sort of needs to exist I would miss Li recommend base coin I think there's gonna be dozens of players in the space of which none might win but if one does win then a stable coin is great because it allows you to actually do real world transactions without the price moving on you one of the problems today as a user or as a merchant is Bitcoin and other coins are just too volatile when something can go up or down ten percent in a day you can't use that to run your business you have to get it in and out of that as quickly as possible which encourage transaction fees and has storage costs and all those kinds of things a stable coin in theory could hold its peg like the US dollar stays within the very tight range over long enough period of time that people can actually post prices in that coin and they can actually transact in that coin well one interesting thing that I thought when it was reading the base coin white paper was that because I you know I understood this part about how they were sort of incentivizing I forget the name of the group because they were like three people they were the bond people and then this actual coin and then there was the third where you're incentivized to to sell anyway then even that group but the point is just that I was kind of like well they're up site is only going to be limited to a certain percentage so I was like why would anybody you speculate on this when they can speculate on like Bitcoin and ether and you know and then I just wondered like is this gonna be that popular and anyway I just because I feel like speculation is what's fueling everything right now I was just was like if somebody's being really rational they're not gonna be like oh I'm gonna get it all in on this because they're gonna realize that their profits are gonna be pretty limited right but they but their downside is limited to and the profits may be relatively not guaranteed but may be a lot more predictable so it's like if you look in the bond market versus the stock market stocks and average make a lot more money than bonds but bonds are a quote safer and you're guaranteed your coupon over some period of time a very low risk of complete default where it's equity the chance of a Total Wipeout is actually pretty high so equity ends up being more risk capital bond that's the more safe capital and and most of the money in the world goes into bonds credit mark it's not into equity markets so you could argue the same kind of thing here but a lot of it depends on the exact parameters and you're right that in the crypto markets it's driven mostly by extreme thrill-seeking money making speculations so it wouldn't be the same kind of investor that necessarily invest in both points yeah yeah well we'll see how well that one does so one other thing is that I've seen in other interviews you've talked about like with startups about how timing is extremely important and a lot of that's due luck so um I don't know if maybe you referenced this a little bit earlier when we spoke but do you've any particular types of tokens now that you think have a bigger chance of being lucky you know like are there any that you feel are kind of in that sweet spot of really needing or this stays really needing them and then also the technology being pretty ready for them yeah I think we're still in the infrastructure phase even think even the two biggest coins Bitcoin in etherium have not yet figured out how to scale properly they have not yet figured out how to decentralize properly if they're a missile controlled by a very small number too Bella purrs like very small you can count em on one hand and Bitcoin is controlled by a relatively small number of developers you know probably about three dozen and this small number of miners were concentrated heavily in China and a small number of exchanges that you get to set policy on what do you call the coin so we are not actually in the decentralized future yet and these platforms can't actually handle applications and scale them yet that said we are making rapid progress so given that I think that investing in apps is just early it's okay for entrepreneurs to start building them and they're probably a few that may break out early like for example you know if you look at the first generation of web almost everything from the 1998-1999 dot-com boom is gone we don't use it today but there are notable notable exceptions like Amazon and Google right the big five so two of the big five companies were born during that time period and Apple was sort of reborn during that time period as an infrastructure provider to a lot of those companies so I think you have to basically realize that the entrepreneurs are playing right now playing an extremely high-risk game they may form the big five at most I'm gonna end up like the dot-com companies the pest calm and the web vents so for me at least as an investor I look much more at the infrastructure and deployment phase so infrastructure trades rather the app development in the deployment phase which will I think come later and then earlier when you were talking about how Bitcoin in aetherium haven't really kind of figured out a good governance model for a decentralized network do you have any particular idea in mind if how you think governance should work for these decentralized networks well they're they're not really fully decentralized yet but they're already more decentralized and anything that has come before them and the thing that really makes it possible is that even though aetherium is not only controlled by a small handful of developers those developers can't just do whatever they want because the it's open source code it can fork very easily if they do something unpopular the users can literally pick up the code in the network and leave so that creates a level of honesty that that just doesn't exist imagine if you and I had the ability to press a button and teleport our entire lives from the United States to any other country that we and that was true of any citizen of any country in the world countries would still have control over their geographic boundaries and their borders and the laws of them the borders but they would just behaved extremely differently it's also the difference being when your casually dating somebody which is when you're married to somebody all right when you're casually dating them they have to be on their best behavior otherwise either party can walk out but when you're married then people can I tend to revert to sort of not there were cells but there are normal cells and because they know they have locked in so at the end of the day because cryptocurrencies can for that because the users can leave because you just can sell your currency and buy another one it just forces you to behave at a level that other that's not true with other code another infrastructure for example there was a woman recently he was banned by uber and lyft because she went on some screed against them online and I'm sure I think what she did was probably reprehensible but the idea of being banned by uber and lyft that's pretty insane because it's not like you really have a third option what are you gonna do in San Francisco sit on the phone for 20 minutes and wait for a taxi so they did so those companies have a lot of control in crypto land nobody has that much control they try to do anything that the community doesn't accept the community's gone and I think that right there that right to exit creates better governance than almost any other system that we've ever had now on top of that you can layer on additional better governance like Bitcoin has this concept of there's the users there's a minder there's a developer's right it's a soft analogy that would be there's a judicial system that's the executive system - this legislative system in the United States so you do get some division of power but it can be better bitcoins had a really hard time agreeing on anything new moving forward which many people would argue is a source of strength because it's trying to be an immutable store of value and eventually I actually think it's better for a Bitcoin to be extremely conservative Bitcoin is where you put your money and and hope that nobody can touch it nobody that includes the government that includes Chinese miners that includes us developers so if Bitcoin is going to make a mistake I would rather err on the side of not changing quickly enough rather than changing too fast because as a user now that may not be what's best for a big point necessarily but as a user I have other options I also have etherium which changes a lot faster moves fast and break things but they don't handmade because of that mentality isn't really interested in protecting an investment it's interested in creating an ecosystem of services on top and so that's probably where I'm more likely to want to run my business and that's something like Z cash and Manero are much more focused in privacy and if I care about privacy if they're gonna defend protect and encode it at a level that the other big two or not so I think in general it's good to have a diversity of coins with different governance models different philosophies different communities and as a user I can just go in and out of whichever one I need when I need it within a given community they get extremely acrimonious and there's a lot of fighting mostly by the holders because they just wanna maximize value and survivability and they have very different viewpoints and why that currency exists but as a user I want there to be a thousand different currencies with a thousand different governance models and a thousand different etc etcetera so I think Bitcoin kind of is doing what Bitcoin does and another video that you've done you talked about how you thought back when the internet started that it would be into market izing floors so would take up a middleman but now we've got like Facebook it was on Twitter or Google and you called them our new overlords do you think we've run again that risk of missing out on this democratizing opportunity that watching technology offers yeah I was always I love the internet I love computers I grew up on the Internet and to me the big promise of the Internet was getting rid of the chokehold that Microsoft and Intel had over the tech industry or that other companies have over our lives the Internet is fundamentally a democratizing force and what it did do was it got rid of a lot of choke holes like you know the New York Times is not what it used to be it's Hollywood studios don't have the power that they used to have even the US government kind of doesn't have the same power over certain things that it used to have the banks don't have the same power that used to have the VCS done the same power that used to have so it did help democracy certain things but it created these very thin broad new overlords that Ben Thompson from species recalls the aggregators but you know you just look at the big five you look at how concentrated power is in the hands of an Amazon Google Facebook Twitter and micro Microsoft or even uber these country these companies essentially run natural monopolies beneficial monopolies that help the consumer they're not jacking up prices on us they're actually doing quite the opposite what they're doing is they're lowering prices on us and they're squeezing suppliers on the back end but we still end up going through one company whatever it's politics are whatever its power structure is that's what we've been holed into now you know your Twitter Twitter could be the greatest force for freedom in human history you can have one person broadcast censorship free to the entire world but Twitter doesn't run as a censorship free platform nor is it available in certain countries if it were built on a blockchain Twitter would be available in every country it would be very hard to repress and you couldn't shut down any speech and I think something like that needs to exist so the good news is I think blockchains with bought chains the long arc of the Internet is bending back towards decentralization and I think we're actually going to have next generation of companies will be created that will be far more decentralized and have much smaller chokepoints than the current set do and so I really don't worry that we will end up just with new different you know watching based overlords I don't because I think block chains are inherently decentralized it's in their core infrastructure you can't change it without ripping it out to give you an example then they could recently went off on this giant screed against gab gab is this Twitter like competitor that has a lot of you know the right-wingers that have been thrown off a Twitter on it Gavin is looking for a new home to build where it won't get censored so Gavin wants to build on top of aetherium into an ICO and vinay who was involved early on with the etherium foundation theorem development went off in this giant screed about how your cab you are not allowed here we will stop you we don't want you or your people building on top of kathiria and you know it's interesting to watch one of the I don't know if he's a founder but one of the early people in etherium sort of try so hard to stop something and basically have no effect Vitalik the lead basically said no we're not gonna stop anyone in fact you're the home page for the theorem it says build unstoppable applications even batalik couldn't even do it if he wanted to because if they didn't we basically just kick him out the community jumped all over Vinay and told them to get lost this and you don't speak for us and I don't even think it's possible even if all the developers and all and a large chain of community wanted to stop them the gap would just fork it like happen with a theorem classic you know build on top of a theorem classic so these really are unstoppable sort of networks and it means that you can't have censorship and you can't have central control beyond the level that's encoded into the system and if someone doesn't like the level this encode in the system they can always fork it or they can go to hundreds of competing cryptocurrencies well so speaking of control um you also said in another video that blotchiness make individual sovereign and put them in power but I think the other thing that happens at that point is that then it gives people another thing to manage and I just wondered like it but I even think about managing my own private key it's or my identity or whatever it just it feels like another burden and other thing to worry about do you think people really do want to manage their own personal data I think most people don't want to but they want to have a choice of who manages it for them so in today's model but the way the world works is if I need a bank it has to be one of the Federal Reserve regulated member banks and there's just very little innovation or competition between them if I have my identity Experian TransUnion and Equifax manage it whether I like it or not and we saw how well that worked out in the Experian hack so I just don't have any choices whereas in a blockchain based model I can choose if I want to manage my own identity I can if I want to put it on Civic or block stack or a different watching I can if I want to have a third party that I trust there can be a thousand different third parties competing for the right to help me manage it they can have different security models different pricing different policies and how they issue identity data to raise people and take responsibility for it so what at the end of the day all of this boils down to not that this isn't eventually better but that it gives you freedom of choice across the board you know that's a little bit more centralized in a certain way at least people are choosing that is that exactly like with Facebook I don't really have a choice I want to be in the same network as all my friends and family I got to go on Facebook and only Facebook can operate that network only Facebook has access to that data Facebook that's built in the blockchain there would be hundreds of thousands of companies any one of which I could say okay you are the you are my manager of my social network profile and data the others aren't and well you're misbehaving or you're selling my data out for ads I'm switching away from you so now you have reputation do you have choice I mean look what separates capitalism from communism its outcome is not attentions communism probably has better intentions but what separates them is choice in capitalism I can choose my vendors I can choose to leave I am a consumer and by having the choice I'm in charge whereas in communism because I had no choice I've become a vassal so the same thing happens in watching land versus classic internet land or classic financial infrastructure land classic the model I have no choice that one or two or three monopolists or federally appointed oligopolists who get to run my entire life whereas in a blockchain world the data is on the blockchain it's ultimately controlled by me and I can cryptographically lock and unlock it for different entities based on how well they are serving me and if they're not serving me well I can always do it myself worst case or if I don't want to do that I can lock them all out and choose the friendliest one of the law so in a way it's like if you do use the centralized service with when it comes to its any of these watching based networks then first of all it's your choice but then also there could be many more of them than there were previously and my data is portable and blockchains one of the key differences between blockchain based protocols and the first generation of Internet protocols is in a blockchain based protocol at whole state my data is held in the network so I can take my data with me we're just good luck exporting your data out of Facebook in such a way that if there was even a competitor that has survived that a competitor could use it okay so I want to go back to the governance question do you have any particular model in mind of how you think decentralized networks should make decisions the the decision-making model for the decentralized block chance comes the open-source movement so it's around commit access and consensus and drafts and requests in the other little fork that's sort of the best model that we found to date for these code based systems the new constituencies that have been added are the users and the investors right and of course minors so those constituencies didn't exist in the open-source movement so miners the way that they vote on governance is basically built into each protocol the way the users vote and the way that the investors vote is the investors vote by buying and selling the way the users vote is by adopting not adopting all of these can be improved so for example you can see that future wallets would allow users to actually vote on the future of their currency through the wall so very much like you have elections you could have your wallet basically say hey this month these to be currency that you hold are making decisions on these three things here's what people that you trust in the community or follow on Twitter are saying how do you want to vote you could have a voting mechanism built directly to the wallet you could imagine something similar for the miners and the software that they run for investors especially the ones who are speculating and buying into AI cos you know against all odds they actually need to have much stronger governance they need to be able to say well you know what okay we're putting 50 million in the script up into this ICO project but we're not going to give you all 50 million bucks immediately it gets locked up into a contract where it gets released in milestones every 5 million bucks every three months and there's a vote based buy on the wallets on the different holders as to whether we release it to you or not based on that have you been hitting the milestones and have you been performing that's the simplest level but you can imagine many many more layers of governance so I think we will get more sophisticated about these things over time but it's gonna take years to evolve and my fear is there will be a boom bust cycle and then a crack down which doesn't give it a chance to evolve but that's the way it should work well how much more do you think this thought was gonna go it can go a lot bigger I mean the amount of money in this space is still small the dot-com bubble was 1.7 trillion and that was restricted just to United States and that was just accredited investors so this one King and those 20 years ago so you take all those factors into account this one can go a lot bigger custody has been a big problem space how do you hold on to your private keys as you were saying earlier so I think that is starting to get solved I think within a year to a year and a half you're gonna see a lot of very serious solutions in the custody space and at that point you're gonna see a wall of money coming in from endowments and sovereign wealth funds and larger players but even now you know at the beginning of this year I only knew of two crypto hedge funds probably a meta stable and even policy and I think is only about a year old and there were a couple that were sort of just in Bitcoin like Pantera and greyscale and so on now there's probably a hundred so the number of crypto hedge funds gone through the roof and I think in all these big boy hedge fund managers sitting in Connecticut or wherever their fancy estates are saying wait a minute you're making these returns you're getting this money and you're an amateur I'm gonna enter this space too so we're gonna see a lot more of those people flooding in so I think the amount of money that can flood in the market still is enormous and so it sounds like you think that regulatory action will only really happen when there is some kind of correction well I think the SEC is already taking regular to reaction against the obvious frauds but I think the way most money is lost in markets is not in fraud it's actually just lost to poor investments it's just these are legitimate people who are trying to limit things it just weren't very good or they were at the wrong time or they don't get very far so that's how the majority the money gets lost and I think that's gonna happen and there's nothing the SEC can do about that that's just the market needs to develop a taste and it knows for what a good investment is and that takes time and so let's talk about power and how this is disruptive to those in power what kind of threat or disruption do you think that this poses to governments I think the most interesting thing about cryptocurrencies is if you step back for a second the history of the human race is a history of networks and humans are the winning species compared to other species because we have the ability to cooperate across genetic boundaries right you're probably what Chinese by origin Korean okay I'm Indian by origin my wife is actually Korean by origin we can communicate we can cooperate we can relate we can intermarry these are the kinds of things that other species just don't do they're literally only cooperative within genetic boundaries within the anti within the Beehive within the very small tribe and humans can do this because we stitched together networks by telling each other stories and the story of networks is the history of the human race the United States the network forbes is a network AngelList is a network the u.s. dollars in network the English language is a network so we create these networks and generally you have to have some way especially networks that are allocating scarce resources of adjudicating and running the network and historically the oldest form government that did that was you had a king in power who was basically whoever the most brutal person was the biggest tyrant they got to be in charge or eventually the king got attacked by the mini kings the aristocracy and they then forced them to share power so you also network that run by elites like them the medical system or the legal system or even the u.s. kind of the US Republic is run more by elites than it is by a president or a dictator you also can run a network by putting corporation in charge and the corporation can punish cheaters like uber writers who aren't paying or who keep calling cards and canceling them but then the corporation can end up as a monopolist just like the king can end up as a tyrant or the elites can end up as an aristocracy you can also have a one-person one-vote a democratic or a communist Network but then you end up with it tries to do a commons or mob justice so the humans have always been trying to figure out how to govern large groups of humans punish cheaters and reward the people who are contributing and the best network that we've created the last few hundred years to do this kind of thing are markets so markets are open like democracies or Commons they allow anybody to participate but you have to vote with money so there's at least some merit-based system but it's a money merit-based system block chains extend that concept of market into managing all kinds of networks that before would have needed a central corporation or a central individual in charge and I think that's incredibly interesting in a blockchain based network I can get rewarded for contributing whatever the network needs if it's a network that's allocating bad to people if I could create an allocate bandwidth into the system as a miner I get rewarded by coin from that network and nobody's in charge there's no central authority who then takes charge of the whole thing takes a 50% tax and starts kicking out people they don't like so I think humans have literally created a new form of governance it is a sixth form of governance in addition to the fact that came before them and that's the kind of thing that only happens once every few hundred to every few thousand years that's fundamental so that's gonna help in every power structure that exists there are corporations it's not gonna up in the existing corporations but there are new networks that will be deployed that wouldn't needed a central corporation that will not instead use the blockchain there are new groups of people who are making rules amongst themselves and adjudicating themselves who might have made an elite to do it who will now use a blockchain based solution there are new open systems that would have suffered from the tragedy of the Commons that won't because they will use a blotching based system will we get so far as to have a government run on a blockchain I don't know maybe in my children's children's lifetime but that's a long ways out but along the way I think we are going to see some of the fundamental functions of government we'll see if they're more efficiently done using a blockchain for example a blockchain based voting system would be would be essentially as cheating proof as you can create a system you could audit exactly that everybody got to vote everybody who voted was entitled to vote was registered to vote but you don't get to see what their actual vote is and it's done in a cryptographically secure way such that there's no Diebold no corporation at the center that holds the voting machines there's no Republicans or Democrats sitting there and counting the votes and throwing out the third party votes or things like that so that is an example of some piece of infrastructure of government that is probably better done through a blockchain than by the government itself and of course governments don't want to give up power so that's gonna be a struggle in the process but I think we're gonna see watchings remake parts of government and eventually maybe hundreds of years from now you could actually see them replace a lot of government well going back to your description about the election or your example do you imagine that that would happen in in an election that's run by the government where they're choosing the Queen watching based election or are you imagining it decentralized my guess is will happen like always government's always a final adopter of any technology solution they're never the first stood up to the last adopter just take a look at the DMV in the post office if you have any doubt about that so the way it's more likely to work is that small private organizations that do have internal elections but are worried about cheating are worried about you know there are some very opposing groups on each side you would see them adopt a blockchain based solution first and it's probably brand new private organizations are just starting up they're saying hey there's this and of course the infrastructure will need to exist so we're still in the infrastructure development phase but five years from now if you're starting a group that needs to have an election like let's say you're electing a college president right on campus and there's like the left wing and the right wing on campus and they're really opposed to each other nobody trusts each other some clever student is gonna say well I'm just gonna use this off-the-shelf blockchain basement voting mechanism that this is not a defunct company built and you know with their ICO money and it's open source anyone can audit it it's running on the etherium blockchain so it's completely cryptographically secure any student can vote your login with your student ID using your private keys so it can't be faked we can show which students voted and each student can audit their vote make sure their vote was counted using zero knowledge proof but your vote doesn't actually get revealed so your vote is completely private and then we can know beyond the shadow of a doubt that these were the exact vote outcomes that seems like a much better solution so I could see small private organizations adopting it and then it grows and grows and grows and grows until one day all the voters look at each other and say why are we using this antique system for the big one when for all the little ones were using this better system it's sort of like how when the iPhone first came out corporate America was still all using blackberries and continue to use blackberries for a while until finally the CEO who had an iPhone at home and the blackberry in the work and the CFO and iPhone at home and Blackberry work with the IT person and said what the heck are you doing it's time to get with the modern world I don't care what you think about the security I don't care what you think about your apps and your provisioning and all the stuff they use to defend your job just switch over the iPhone already I don't care right so that same kind of technology adoption cycle needs to happen blockchains but that takes decades that's not an overnight thing so what are some like upcoming trends that you think we're gonna see in crypto in the short term future I always find it's much easier to predict long term and short term because short term has to do with vagrancies of humans and long term you can focus much more on the math and the protocols and the logic of it if I had to guess I think there's a wall of Wall Street money coming in like a lot of Wall Street money coming in I do think I this is more a hope than a prediction but I am hoping that some of the top 20 currencies that are not that high-quality do get recognized as such and and you know more of the money gets concentrated into the good currencies I hope that a lot more goes into development especially for high quality protocol engineers you have brilliant people sitting at Stanford MIT Johns Hopkins you know and even lesser known universities and places around the world and these crypto economists and crypto technologists these people are worth their weight in gold and they should be financed such that they can do fundamental good research into governance and scaling I hope that scaling gets much more addressed that's a big one if the area was trying to do is proof of stake and sharding to get scaling going Bitcoin need now that it's rejected to X needs to get its lightning later deployed and actually functional so that the fees come down and the wait times can come down I think it would be great if governments started basically putting moratoriums around crypto regulation just like they did around internet regulation in the early days to give it a chance to blossom you know not only new york's bitlicense helped anybody it's not a surprise that that came out of the state where all of Wall Street is so I get the lobbyists there you know have a certain agenda but nevertheless it's it sort of shorts out of New York to say hey you know we took over finance 1.0 we're gonna throw finance to point out the door and hope it doesn't happen somewhere else all right that this is not likely to be the case New York does not get dictate they'll stay the financial regulation if financial innovation for the entire planet if anything is just insuring us going to end up like Detroit hollowed out as the industry moves on so I'm hoping that some of these things will come to pass I hope also will just get better at things like custody so the average user doesn't have to worry about their private keys will get better about education so you know your average person is running around and buying an ICO but rather they're you know trying to figure out what the high quality ones are or they're using an index or they just realizing the inherently highly volatile nature of these assets and they're holding small amounts through good custodians I think there's gonna be a lot of good technology development in the last two years when the hardware mods got really good for example more than two years ago you didn't even have that solution right it wasn't very good didn't work well so I think will continually see some stuff like that I think everyone's still waiting for end user use cases where crypto currencies are better than for the existing currencies we still haven't seen a lot of those it's been a little surprising to me I would have guessed that something like the collapse of the Venezuelan Bulevar you know would have led people to adopt cryptocurrency is there but the infrastructure just hasn't been in place your average Android phone or iPhone is still not geared up to be a good crypto to crypto platform but maybe in one or two years from now it'll be good enough that people will actually start transacting in crypto in places where the local currency essentially no longer works and do you have any like big thoughts that are floating around your head around crypto that you've just been thinking about recently that we didn't discuss you know one thing I've been coming around to is it's taking a lot longer to solve even the basics like how do you scale Bitcoin how do you build a secure multi-sig wallet on aetherium etc you know and you're having really large changes like the Chinese government shutting down all crypto exchanges or Bitcoin cash coming up in competing with Bitcoin it might be more centralized or less centralized depending on it so crypto is if anything becoming more volatile not less volatile and so in that world I think the right answer to where crypto heads from an end user perspective will be that we may end up stopping to talk about is Bitcoin win I'm gonna win or is a theory I'm gonna win monaro gonna win or z cash gonna win and we may end up focusing much more on having baskets of crypto and it didn't work with currencies because it's very hard for me to go down to the local store and say here's a basket of the top 50 currencies in the world right because they don't know how to handle some bobbly dollars and they don't know how to handle mexican pesos and all that stuff and they're limited by governments but it's a nature of crypto that these things are completely electronic the wallets are completely in software so if for example we could somehow agreed every year these are the top ten crypto assets right now and they're relatively stable and relatively high quality and they all have different governance methods of different levels of decentralization different threat models and different adoption models that you can then say okay I'm gonna give you top ten basket I'm gonna buy it from you I'm gonna sell it from you I'm gonna hold a top ten basket and you could almost start using it as a currency there's no fundamental log of software that says that it has to be one cryptocurrency at a time so I think we may just get more comfortable with baskets and I know this was tried in the real world with European Union originally had the before the euro they had a special Eurobasket instrument that comprised all the Euro currencies but it was a temporary thing but it didn't work or the the IMF has SDR Special Drawing rights or XD RS they also call them which are sort of a basket kind of currency instrument but I think we may actually see in the crypto world in the software world that we create real baskets that actually be reused for real cases and they're safer than any of the underlying crypto currencies so if there's a big hack on a single exchange or governance model of one currency collapses or its encryption gets broken or there's a bug in the software it turns out to be a scam you know you lose 10% of what you lose the whole thing it's almost like using a mutual fund or something as your currency that's right we don't like that you know it could happen to learn so it's just an idle thought I don't know what the odds are but it's fun to think about well maybe you can find some entrepreneurs and we're gonna create that all right I'm gonna ask you a personal question it's one of my last questions so if you run me out the door then I've at least got my interview what percentage of your net worth is I got to run you out the door now I don't
