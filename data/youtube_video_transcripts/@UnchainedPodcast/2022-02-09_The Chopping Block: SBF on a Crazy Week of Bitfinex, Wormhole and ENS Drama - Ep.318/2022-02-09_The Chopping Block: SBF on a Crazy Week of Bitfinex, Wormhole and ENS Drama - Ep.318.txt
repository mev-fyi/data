hello everybody and welcome to the chopping block every couple weeks the four of us get together and give industry insiders perspective on the crypto topics of the day so very quick intros um first we got tom the d5 maven and master of memes next up there's robert the crypto connoisseur and captain of compound uh next we have tyron gigabrain and gran puba at gauntlet and myself haseeb i'm the chief hype man of dragonfly and today we have joining us a special guest the baron of the bahamas sam bankman freed otherwise known as spf uh so the i usually say the four of us uh but the original four of us are early stage investors in crypto and then we've got a amazing founder who's joining us today but i want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice or legal advice or even life advice so with that out of the way sam how are you doing i know that you've had some tech trolls getting on board uh how's life you know it's been pretty good it's been busy as always i'm in dc right now for the second time this month um and uh testifying in about uh 16 hours that's exciting how many of those hours will you be sleeping oh i'm guessing five four something like that okay that sounds that's that that so the rumors are true yeah we'll see that's all right but yeah any any lessons learned from last go-around that you were uh testifying yeah i mean i i think to some extent the lesson was like it was their what it seemed like like i don't know i i i think that the biggest surprising thing honestly was how constructive it was like i was honestly expecting a bit of a show like i was sort of like expecting a lot of partisan bickering and there just wasn't like it is sort of like almost everyone had a constructive attitude in across both aisles that was just like legitimately was surprising you know and and then beyond that you know i think everyone has you know their own questions that they're like most interested in in the house but um i but i don't know it was fun robert you spend a good amount of time uh talking to legislators and lawmakers right yeah i mean historically you know i've been one of the you know advocates for defy um and one of the founders that has been sort of championing the idea and the cause um long before it got to what defy is today so today it's a huge umbrella which encompasses so many different things you know the d5 you know of yesteryear was you know a very limited number of projects like compound maker now and systems like that and so you know i've been you know educating um you know our elected and appointed officials for a long time about what is defy the phrase has sort of evolved a bit and now you know when you read a bloomberg headline um oftentimes things that are not d5 get called defy and so i think it's you know creating a little bit more confusion than uh there used to be but you know it's been a long time passion so let's let's go ahead and jump into news so what we're going to do this uh for this for this today's show is we'll start by going through some of the interesting news items of the week and then we'll circle back and start asking sam questions so that's the that's the that's the game plan so uh first piece of news um well first of all i wanted to congratulate sam for the amazing fundraisers recently announced for ftx i think between ftx us and ftx the parent co or whatever ftx main ftx.com uh you guys are now collectively 40 billion in valuation which puts you almost on par with coinbase thoughts yeah i i think that that's true um it's been a wild ride and i mean just the difference between now and a year ago is is really you know fear especially massive and i i mean i think the weirdest thing to me about it is or the most surprising thing is just that like the best predictor i think of of our path was like if you sort of threw out all the outside views and threw out all the sanity checking and just like i don't know write down on a piece of paper what could happen it's still like it still would not predicted it correctly i think like a billion dollars a day of volume on fbx was sort of my like wow there's we chance we could get there and we're that you know 15 times that but but i still think that was a better predictor than like trying to bake into it any any other sort of like conventional wisdom or or anything like that well yeah it's completely incredible to see how meteoric the rise of ftx has been and i think we've got a lot more questions for you that will that will hold to the end but that was probably one of the you know probably the blockbuster fundraising news of the last couple of weeks so congratulations to you for being a part of that and then again part of the kind of the sam universe of course is solana and the other big news of the week was this uh wormhole hack that took place on solana so just the very kind of headline summary basically what happened is that so wormhole is one of the major bridges that extends into salon it's a multi-chain bridge so it's not just solana but the solana side was the part that got uh hacked and the entire size of the hack was 325 million dollars that was hacked basically the attacker was able to go onto the solana side of the chain issue unbacked ether and withdraw that unbacked ether into ethereum and run off with the money um and what ended up happening is i believe within a day jump which uh uh acquired certis which actually developed the original wormhole bridge and jump is now the primary maintainer of wormhole they basically decided my understanding is that entirely off balance sheet to fill the hole and recapitalize all 325 million dollars worth of ether in order to save the day and uh and basically patch the the hole in the bridge so um all is relatively well in solana land but it was a something of a near-death experience for a lot of folks especially in solana defy um who realize all of a sudden that they're uh you know the bank that they thought they had uh money in uh was empty and uh so it was a pretty wild experience uh any reflections from folks on what happened that day yeah i guess one you know the obvious statement is building bridges is hard the second statement is um you know there's actually been this fight sort of in in in between sort of like the solana and cosmos ecosystems we call it fight i call it a philosophical disagreement of whether you should have multiple rap token types for bridged assets versus non-bridged assets and i actually think in the solana world people went a little crazy with like how many different synthetic wrapped versions there were and that's that made it a lot harder to actually be able to reason about sort of like the state of like a lot of the lending protocols because they would they'd have like one type of stake teeth uh that was on wormhole another type that was on a different bridge and you know people had loans where they were sort of borrowing both against a single type of collateral or bronx table coins against both of those and it became that was like one of the crazier and more gnarly types of things we saw and you know getting used to these like bridge synthetics i think is a really big part of cross chain d5 that has not been solved well just to step back and go to like 90 000 feet real quick so as i understand what happened for anyone who's listening who hasn't gone into like the deep detail about what happened you had wormhole which allowed people to take ether from the ethereum blockchain and create essentially a shadow asset on solana which is wormhole weth and the incident was somebody was able to print a huge amount of unbacked wormhole weth on solada and this wormhole weth was redeemed on ethereum and they took real ether out on the ethereum side and they had extra wormhole wet tokens on solana which they then caused havoc intentionally and unintentionally with uh in the salon ecosystem in that you know wormhole weth didn't have any assets backing it and the attacker had extra wormhole weth to play with so this is how we sort of begin the story yeah i thought the the mechanism was also pretty interesting like samsung had this had this thread about it and it was like so so innocent it was basically there's like this one precompile that um solano uses to basically verify a signature it was like missing in like what the solidity version or the uh ursula program version rather that wurmo was using versus like a prior version and so therefore like the signature wasn't checked and so really really innocent mistake but of course and now it's a you know 325 million mistake i don't know if it's totally innocent it was their pr was already the pr was already up for it in fact that was the craziest part right the pr the pr was up but i jumped did not realize the consequence of the it was just kind of a routine upgrade right it's like okay well there's some deprecation in the code we got to change over to this thing but they had no idea that there was this level of uh vulnerability introduced to coaching true i'm sure you could not cite all the intricacies of every different you know version and subversion of solidity i i agree i agree i'm just more pointing out that it it was it was actually a known issue it just like people didn't realize the spoofing level could be as high like you could actually call something of that function size like mint yeah i think i think one of the the the repeated bad takes that i saw is that like oh this shows that like solana is broken or that uh oh we're getting layer twos in order to solve this problem and the reality is that uh it was a software layer bug and the software layer bug was at the connective tissue between two systems right it's like how these two systems are gonna talk to each other and authenticate the decisions are being made correctly and um the problem was not like if this was a layer two bridge you would have like the same kind of failure could have happened so the problem is not intrinsically even about solana or i mean in some sense it is because obviously this was a solana code change that ended up triggering this this mistake but it's fundamentally a problem about connecting up two blockchains and those two blockchains can be a letter one and layer two they can be two different uh layer ones it could be really anything you're connecting to the important take home is that cross chain is really freaking hard and it's very likely this is not gonna be the last mistake we see in the crosstalk universe to completely agree bridging is hard and all bridges are sort of hard in similar ways whether you're bridging a layer to a layer one two layer ones two layer twos bridging i don't know two countries whatever it's it's uh uh you've got like two different ledgers that aren't the same legend that don't read each other and you know and i think in particular maybe an interesting part of this is wormhole was intended to be one of the more decentralized bridges there's a lot of bridges and they will all brand themselves decentralized most of them is decentralized that there's two different keys that one person has both of that are necessary in order to make the asset or like they're just right it's just like this guy is he like god's ledger and he's like ah someone sent me some some of this token yeah sure i'll send back some of this other one i'll mince them you know i got the key for that that that's how bridges usually right and like you know being a little bit glib but but you know the more decentralized you try and make it on the one hand it provides a lot of great property it's also way easier to find right because fundamentally like it's it's a lot easier to just run an aws service that like gets that the balances are correct and like never give anyone else permission to do anything if you're trying to make permission be something much more complicated than what you dictate it's again really powerful but also really easy to just throw up it's 100 right and i think uh you know one of the concepts we were discussing this internally and one of the concepts that i've started to really like is this notion of private bridges and state-backed bridges and what you see today is that actually the vast majority of the bridges are quote-unquote state-backed or sort of state-sponsored meaning that the blockchain themselves endorse and like kind of route traffic through a particular bridge and i think what you're going to see over time is that these bridges are just going to be absolutely dominant the ones that are state-backed it's very hard for these private bridges that are sort of third parties developing on these chains to win and the reason why at least for cross-chain transfers why that's so hard to to break that is because bridges are by and large a public good for the blockchain that wants to get assets over the bridge and as a result there you know bridges are basically banks when it comes to you know these sort of bi-directional type bridges they're basically banks they have assets on one side liabilities the other side and the goal is to make sure that the bank vault is always you know correctly sized for all the liabilities and if something goes wrong as it did with wormhole as it has with other bridges in the past the ultimate thing that's going to give you confidence that the bridge is going to be okay is the size of the sovereign backing the bridge and in this case you know it was jump was the score the pseudo-sovereign player that was like okay look you know this wormhole is so important and salon is so important that we're just gonna put all the money in and make sure that we have enough capital to keep this whole thing alive you know if if this was some other bridge like some other you know small startup that was creating a bridge between a couple chains and if it got hacked for 300 million uh it's game over right it's it's sort of a bitfinex situation where now you know we're trading ious about whether this bridge will ever make enough money again yeah i mean it's it it didn't serve shitty to say but the honest answer is like yeah the size of the bankroll the person who issues the bridge tokens matters and it matters you know even if there isn't an explicit insurance fund for it it gives you a sense of how big the implicit insurance fund may or might not be and that's sort of the world we we live in actually i mean i feel like compound the protocol is one of the cleanest examples of like yeah i think it's one of the pro calls which has the a maximized ratio of like complexity to failure while being fully decentralized like it's like like i think in terms it's like one of the it's not that's the most complex perk i'll ever it definitely isn't but like i i think that's one thing that's impressed me about it is having even the updating code for it be actually fully unchained but also it's not broken and it doesn't break periodically i think it's like somewhat impressive and it's like somewhere somewhere in a weird corner of the spectrum that doesn't get explored very much of like high decentralization moderate complexity and like low failure well that's that's like the original d5 vision right which is like you can take a smart contract which is a piece of code that is going to do one thing really well and really robustly so well and so robustly that you can rely on it in a different program and it's composable and you build it so that it will always work with a very simple api or interface and will work in a decentralized fashion and will work forever and since then you know that's slow and hard to build and so i think a lot of the development activity has really excelled in other corners of the world which is like oh it's centralized and it's fast and we change it every single day or you know it's you know a different approach entirely but yeah it's you know it's a great approach it's just really the downside is it's very slow to develop a system like that to prove our product market fit and to get things going yeah and actually one thing i'd say historically you know if we look at the history of compute in general right like parallel processors like getting to single core linux took you know five years let's say roughly getting to like smp and like multi-core linux took like 15 years so there's a lot of it just takes a long time to get you know many different systems to interact in a way that's sort of efficient um i had this one really awesome co-worker a long time ago who actually now is the head of researcher jump uh who had this this the statement which is you can pull a carriage with two horses but can you pull a carriage with 10 24 chickens and uh that's that's sort of uh that's sort of uh that's sort of a thing to think about when you're thinking about these systems in a lot of ways i love that that's great it's just very intuitive as to like what the problem is right like yeah when you stay that way yeah yeah very true okay so let's uh let's go ahead and move on um so another piece of news uh i just i mean this one because we tend to talk about weird dows uh another another tidbit in the world of weird taos uh we now have a dow that's even larger than constitution assange dao which raised 41 million dollars on juice box to try to i'm not exactly sure what it's trying to do it's something related to getting julian assange out of where he is uh which i don't know why money is going to solve this problem does anyone know the story here yes it's it's actually it is a bit strange um so people probably remember constitution dow also used juice box to yo do fundraising to buy this copy of the us constitution assange actually has more um eath but roughly the same amount in dollar amount to you know ostensibly support julian assange but the way they do it is a bit strange basically they are buying this one of one nft by pack who's a famous nft artist and the but the pack sale the proceeds from that are going to julian assange's defense fund basically fighting this case saying that the uk is unfairly extraditing him to the us and so yeah it's basically going into his defense fund but in a very sort of roundabout crypto-y way that sounds like so they're buying an nft with all that money yes yes i'm like yeah why can't they just donate directly or or but but you have that aside i think yeah we talked about constitutional dao um go ahead oh i mean it seems brilliant way better than donating directly right if you donate directly you get nothing here you're getting on a fee think about that that is a very fair point 41 million dollars clearly right they get the nft and they give the money exactly amazing it's like we added intellectual property to philanthropy i impact certificate this is in fact almost exactly an impact certificate that the problem though is that it's unclear that uh julian needs 41 million for his defense like it's it's an open question whether this is a good way to get oh i didn't we're not necessarily making comments about the hyper quality the actual impact right yeah yeah this does feel like i think someone said this a while ago which was like if sort of the you know if the 2000s and 2010s were sort of about you know internet mobs collectively uh communicating and uh exacting some sort of you know real world action a real consequence basically defy allows them to do that with uh finance and we sort of are seeing this more and more of sort of like you know global crowd funding and global capital formation um and this is like the latest incarnation of it right i think you know 4chan and reddit and all these these internet forums have been you know long supporters of julian assange but there's only so much that you know right into your congressman will do but now they have 42 million dollars you can you know move your cause uh pretty far with with that amount of capital and i'd expect to see more and more things like this uh going forward yeah i feel like in some way this is like um what's it called when you take like a neural net and you kind of like sort of figure out like what is the thing that's gonna activate it the most i feel like this is like that version for the internet like julian assange plus dao plus lots of money plus nft and like you just end up with this thing and it's like oh yeah this just like tickled the hindbrain of the internet as deeply as you can and this is what happened i mean it would be better if julian assange minted nfts for everybody who donated then it would raise 200 million and we'd be having a very different fear of conversation yeah sam sam you you you've probably thought the most about alternative donation mechanisms how do you feel about this like you know what would you optimize differently if you were yeah well overall i think it's a really good idea sorry i think it's a cool idea as far as not commenting on the donation itself um on the sort of like method here i i think i think it's basically an impact certificate and what it can let you do is be entrepreneurial about philanthropy and and and to me to flush this out a little bit like part of the cool thing here is let's say that like there's someone who's gonna do something really good for the world right and like you didn't have like a lot of capital to donate yourself but you you eventually thought the whole world would be like oh i got a baller like what he did was great right um but the problem is he needs the money before he does the great thing right or it doesn't work you can't he can't go into debt to do it um uh but like you're stretched pretty thin you have to give like literally everything you have or something in order to fund him to do this thing and there are lots of people with lots of money who will in retrospect wish they had funded it were to happen but only if it happens and proves they should have funded it so what you can do is is something like this where you say all right here's the deal i'll fund it and i get the nfp for having funded it at the impact certificate nft whatever you want to call it then they go they do the thing paul was like holy this guy's awesome it's an amazing thing to do you're like great here is this certificate of having done this great thing how much is worth you know people like 200 million dollars like great sold and and now the guy got his funding you were you know making the market more efficient right bringing the funding to the the good causes that needed it before the rest of the world realized they needed it you get rewarded for that you bought the nft and then sold it for more later and the large generators still get to cause good things to happen because if they make a sort of like pattern of this people like oh great like refund good things that we see and others don't we can later sell the impact of that to the ultimate donors for a profit and and so thus we will go search out cool awesome things to do for the world that other people wouldn't notice and make those happen there's a sense in which what we are seeing here is a kind of permutation of of what was previously called impact certificates so it's interesting i think i think the interesting thing is that people didn't trade impact certificates before right well they were supposed to the intrinsic idea was that they were supposed to but of course nobody actually cared because there were no nfts back then so now that we have entities we have solved in one fell swoop the entire ill-equipped juice juice box contributions are tokenized right you sort of saw that with people with constitution data which went up like 100x and so if you do you know donate to assange dao you are getting justice tokens which who knows what those will trade at but you know you could sort of think of them in the sense of impact certificates do you think the contributions are a response to the overvaluation of people potentially but you know who's to say what people's motivations are and is it so wrong if there's some profit motivation in someone's video donation to assange yeah i mean obviously like most of these crazy dows we're seeing are just the things that manage to they're they're the most evolutionarily fit memes they just kind of burst their way onto headlines and um it sort of becomes this like this kind of ratcheting up game of of kind of who can do the most you know ridiculous thing and get attention now that being said look i'm not taking any view on julian assange i think you know this is not an unreasonable thing to care about it'd be surprising to me if he needs 41 million for his legal defense fund but you know what do i know maybe it's got a very expensive set of lawyers what would what would you do differently sam like let's say let's say you wanted to make it an impactful assange dao i i mean well okay sorry do you differently in the market construct or in like what the money would do oh yeah the market concert let's suppose there was some way of measuring an outcome right because the problem is the outcome is completely not tied to this fundraising yeah vehicle yeah well i think it's wait in the end i think it's quite hard to have you could imagine so here's the thing you could do in this specific case but it doesn't work necessarily in general is you could say that um there's you know that there's some payoff related to whether or not he is extradited or have have some measurable outcome here that this is like ultimately tied to and then what you could get is a bunch of people to pledge to pay some amount for a conditional on that right you can imagine that like what happens is that you know some foundation says look conditional on achieving this well-defined goal we will pay 200 million dollars for this nfp and otherwise we will have absolutely no interest in the nfp um and then it if theoretically had no mean value which maybe it does but if it sandwiches in fact the thing sam's pointing out is actually this very old sort of mechanism that vitalik proposed in 2018 the daiko uh which was like supposed to basically do this but pre-nft dikers didn't have this nft concept i would say it's like a diagram it's more like a prize it's effectively like a prize i mean was like a prize right it was like a metered youtube channel i know it's more like a yeah it's more like it's more like you you achieve sort of further funding goals if you hit certain milestones yeah yeah so i think i think it's basically like a permutation of a prize that then you know the recip the receipt of that prize is tradable in some sense or a certificate of that prize yeah which in some sense like kind of defeats the point of the prize maybe in some you know if you had a nobel prize that was just being traded around in the secondary market would be a little bit weird but it's weird but i'm not sure it's crazy right because what it means is that like if you can do something noble prize worthy you'll get actually paid money for it according to how cool people think that is more than the nominal prize more than the nominal amount right you'll get paid how much the world actually values your nfp which is exactly the same as they value what you did of course that's how it works right right that's interesting okay let's let's let's move on um so there was uh another piece of news uh this thing so gamestop and immutablex did a partnership uh and so gamestop is gonna be launching their nft marketplace in partnership with the mutablex you guys might remember immutablex they're a starkware powered zk roll up nft marketplace uh they originally came out of the team that built god's unchained and later they also uh they did this partnership with tiktok uh it's like tic toc moments thing and so immutable x uh gave gamestop a bunch of imx tokens which is the the tokens for the the meetablex platform and gamestop then subsequently immediately market dumped something like what was it like 40 35 million dollars worth of this token and people got mad on twitter but i i we we had a big debate internally about whether this is even a story because ultimately like you know if you give somebody a grant and you don't have any investing on that grant the understanding is like okay well we have costs associated with like building stuff so when you give us tokens like what what do you want to say like we need working capital we need to sell it to go higher engineers uh but it was very interesting how very strongly the reaction is oh no you guys are and you're terrible and how could you have done this to us uh curious what you guys think like what are the norms here when you receive a grant from a group like this so here's the up thing right right like if they'd gotten dollars let's say mutable paid them 100 million us dollar bill for this no one would have complained that they weren't toddlers right no one would have said why didn't you use those dollars to buy the immutable token in the market right but if you give them immutable x tokens and they sell the tokens people aren't like oh we're back to that original state that we're fine with like what the  you sold the token right the framing is very different even though it's a similar say we lost you maybe part of the lesson here is uh gamestop needs better trade execution uh so then just immediately you know market dump however much it was and then said yeah spread it out over time so you know it's not not so immediately noticeable but i'm kind of inclined to agree i think like at zrx or 0x we give out grants in zrx and you was expected especially for a lot of these early stage startups which actually are very cash straps maybe unlike gamestop that's expected that they you know sell it to you know pay their employees and to pay for servers and stuff like that maybe part of the weirdness too is gamestop has raised a bunch of money by selling stock in the stock market recently and so it's like did you really need that extra you know 40 million dollars or whatever the number was well i think the thing that made people unhappy was that there's an expectation when you're giving tokens then you're going to have long term alignment of interest right that gamestop and immutable x are going to be partners and teammates for a long time and it's the view of gamestop and mutil mutablex like oh yeah of course we're teammates right like we gave them a whole bucket worth of value and we're building this huge thing together but to a community member you know you see that there's a more pure alignment of interest that's possible they hold the token they benefit when token go up right and that didn't happen here so i think there's really two you know modifications that you might see down the road in a future bd world one is vested tokens or something that like unlocks over time you know we're seeing this pop up all the time in dowse and defy and protocol to protocol interactions it's becoming way more common it's always been common with investors and things with tokens especially when there isn't vesting or lockups you know the market learns why there should be very quickly so i think that's the first change that might happen in future projects is you'll see lockups if it's like a system like immutable x giving tokens to a company like gamestop for a massive bt deal it probably won't be immediately liquid it might invest over years right and the second thing you might start to see is it looking more like how you incentivize employees which is you know you might see it look more like options or upside in a relationship as opposed to here's a huge amount of value today and you know i don't think you know obviously i'm a little bit biased as an investor and immutable but like i don't think what they did today was that bad i think the communities are going to learn better approaches to structuring these long-term relationships over time and then next time there's a company like immutable and a company like gamestop it probably won't be tokens that get markets sold at the very outset of the relationship maybe a few other things i basically agree a few other things first off you want to blame someone like i i think you can blame immutable as much game stop here like immutable could have paid in dollars instead they paid in tokens were they the ones who dumped like really serving mutables treasury that dumped that 100 million dollars and writing gamestop just purchased and then sold them if you want to think about it that way right and so i think it's as much a question of like why they pay with tokens and not dollars as anything else and i think what it gets to is something like like robert's point which is like there's sort of not that much point in giving someone unlocked fully vested liquid tokens instead of dollars because they could use the dollars to buy the tokens if they wanted they could sell the tokens for the dollars stick to one half dozen at the other but yeah i think basically if you're giving unlock fully blood vested liquid tokens it's the same as dollars and it's just a service fiction that they're like very different and it's just the framing yeah that makes sense okay well um there are two remaining items so we'll try to be relatively quick so the big drama of the week in kind of you know social media this wasn't a week of just one big drama i know there are multiple there's always big dramas because it's crypto twitter so okay so ens the ethereum naming service which is basically like a big you know it's kind of you get something something dot ens uh associated with your name dot eat dot e dot i'm sorry there is a gentleman by the name of brantley milligan who is a director of operations at uh ens he's been there for a long time and he wrote a bunch of tweets in 2016 at my understanding that he actually wrote a bunch of tweets like in his entire career as a tweeter that basically were uh very so he's a staunch catholic and he's a very anti-gay anti-kind of everything that catholics don't like i guess and he's been very public about it and very um you know offensive of like first world norms and um this broke out into this big conflict especially as you know the intent of ethereum has grown quite a bit with the advent of nfts you know it used to be that people in the theater can be like ah whatever who cares you know everybody can just have their crazy libertarian views and go live off in a corner it's fine but there's now this big conversation going on at ethereum about cancel culture free speech you know this guy's a catholic a lot of people in the world believe this stuff but it's also not inclusionary um and so what do you want to do as of yesterday he was removed from ens uh basically fired but it kind of brought about this big culture war that has been noticeably missing in crypto that uh kind of reared its head in the ethereum community also he was he was he was fired by a company that has contracted to do work for the dow technically not fired from the right let's get this correct in terms of related things he was undelegated from but he was undelegated from the dow thank you for that clarification tyrone so i mean look i i just very quickly give my two cents um i you know i in general i don't have a very strong view about people who are just sitting around doing their jobs having beliefs that i disagree with but i i kind of agree like look man it's 2022 like i don't know this is not even like a mainstream catholic thing to be constantly hating on you know people who are into same-sex marriage um so i i i just think like at a certain point like if you're gonna be loud about it on twitter i don't know we can find out the director of ops you know like it's fine there are plenty of people out there who want to help out with the ns so but but in general the the cancel culture thing coming to crypto uh is interesting and i think this is kind of the first beach head we saw something like this with open source happen um you know probably about started probably about four or five years ago and then the kind of culture around open source totally changed but open source used to look a lot like crypto in that regard i i mean uh let's put this away the rust community is 80 crypto haters 20 crypto lovers and it's very closely related to this there's there was a schism there as well right i mean i think like one thing and this doesn't answer the ultimate question but i think it's like relevant for the proximate one is acknowledging that like maybe he was fired because the company and or dao and or company dao combination that had hired him disagreed with his belief maybe he was fired because they were worried about the pr impact of other people disagreeing with his belief not clear exactly which one of those it is or where on that spectrum it is i think it maybe doesn't impact the end result or the impact of a down society but impacts where you should direct your love and or hatred depending on how you feel about it well i think it's also at the heart of crypto right if you remember the coinbase drama when brian armstrong posted his big piece about coinbase being in a political place oh yeah that's a really smart piece to have posted yeah i mean i feel like this is really intrinsic to what how our industry works like i mean sam how how do you think about this given that you know you just caught up to coinbase and coinbase has kind of put out this big memorandum about their view on the intersection of politics you know cancel culture kind of you know cultural battles where does ftx fit in that spectrum i mean i'd like to say that that's like you know we're not trying to take a side in it it's sort of like sam's mike just went out i'm kidding i was hopeful i was i was grateful but no i don't know it's complicated yeah i know it's a shitty answer but like you know and and i think i will say that like two different things you could say that i feel somewhat differently about one of them is like you know one could say like that you know they don't think that people could bring their that their politics should be noble or known at work at all and another thing is like that people should be able to work productively with each other as a team independent of their political belief i certainly agree with the second one much more so than the first one i wasn't sure exactly which of those was intended by coinbase's piece on this and i i think that like you know my my take is roughly like you know people are welcome to have the belief that they want and i'm not gonna pretend that none of those are ever gonna make it into work and that none of those are ever gonna be discussed at the office oh i i guess i i was just more going to say i i actually think the coinbase post reads better now than it did then um in some ways and and also the interesting thing is like i think nick from ens had like a tweet like criticizing fwb for retroactively changing their mind on something and i kind of out there there's there's there's kind of i think it's like hard when you're in the hot seat and that happens and oftentimes history will judge you from the future not from you know at that moment you know you you'll get judged relative to the context of the future rather than like the context at that moment okay so quick speed round so if somebody brantly like was at your organization would you fire him so we'll just go around one by one because i think most of us are are currently in the position of run or running or having run organizations tarou you first i don't know honestly i i i i you have to go we can't equivocate here and and say probably not but you know yeah probably not all right robert you know there's been a saying uh at compound for many years which is you know we hire people regardless of their views about religion sexual orientation and cryptocurrencies um you know i i personally believe in you know allowing people to be a part of an organization with extremely broad views i think the cardinal rule is you know don't be you know offensive to people i think it's one thing they have used i think it's another thing to not being willing to engage in fruitful conversation you know it would depend on the circumstances but you know if it became you know a very public situation like that and they let's say double down and triple down and refuse to apologize and refuse to engage in fruitful conversation you know i would lean towards you know firing them but it would still be extremely difficult and you know my bias would be towards keeping them got it uh tom yeah i mean this is like classic yeah paradox of tolerance kind of kind of stuff i think the the thing with brandy and i've talked to a few folks who have worked with him is like ever said he's like extremely nice you know very inclusive there's i don't think there's any sort of idea that he would have maybe treated people who were in his tweet maybe differently and i don't think it would have had any impact on ens the product which is another part of the concern with like you know uh um thinking about inclusion in the workplace i mean the problem is just maybe as sam said like if you want to build a team a lot of people will not want to work with somebody like that um and therefore it just becomes a problem for performance and company performance independent of the actual output of the person or independent of the actual uh you know product impact yeah i would say i agree with robert's sake here but i think that makes me say fire because like somebody posted this like very very long collection of like every single time he said the word gay and he's he's posted like like 200 different tweets basically saying that like gay people are evil and bad and that they should go to hell or whatever i'm just like what what why do you couldn't talk about this could have done that yeah but then that's that's a hiring time decision because that's true that's true but like look if you get it wrong when hiring somebody like at least get it right you know um so yeah i would also also i think uh you know while the ens drama was drama i think the real drama still hasn't been talked about in the show and the comments in the comments everyone wants to hear about biff and x so oh i think let's start with sam because i i actually feel like you know you were around when leo came into existence and we're probably more close to that so like how how do you feel about the uh the overall situation i mean like super excited that that that it was found i think that's that's great and i i think rewinding a little bit i think you know the news today i think straightforwardly good and and and really happy for them you know what whatever i i've heard a lot of rumors and stories about what happened so i really really briefly just interrupted you because i think a lot of our audience may not know what the hell oh yeah no so bitfinex uh recently announced that uh 4.5 billion had been recovered by the doj biffin x was hacked many many years ago and there's a u.s couple that has been uh accused but not yet indicted is my understanding of having been responsible for laundering uh some of that 4.5 billion dollars in bitcoin so that was recently recovered by the doj sorry go ahead yeah and and i think the implication is that they have the whole 4.5 billion dollars and probably are the ones who hacked it i i i don't know if that's been said explicitly allegedly allegedly but but i think the the allegation is that they are not just that they were somewhere in the food chain there although i'm not i i don't know that for sure you know i i think like i've heard a lot of different versions of what actually happened you know six years ago when when when the hack took place but i think that the recovery here is remarkable from a number not just the recovery of the coins but the recovery of bitfinet i think like them going under as a business and their customers losing a third of their money was probably what most people would have guessed the outcome of that hack was gonna be and instead they were able to keep operating they gave everyone an option if they could take a haircut or they could take equity or they could get an iou and they ended up making everything pull according to what they chose and you know if you'd held on you got paid back fully if you took equity you probably did better than that so it's i mean i think it's sort of is remarkable how well that story ended up given the circumstances ending for forever and involved and and for the customers and i think it it displayed some amount of it was a gutsy move but i think one that was probably the right one and and and showed a lot of dedication from the team involved there during what i know is that absolutely hellish thing to be involved in i i think the the the story that's funnier is that the uh the culprits are people well at least i will i will say someone i i knew reasonably well uh well one of them a couple years ago and uh the weirdest thing is i used to run this meetup where people gave talks and uh she gave a talk about basically how to social engineer your way into anything and there was also this very weird scenario where where like bitgo uh also had her doing a talk on cyber security and and and hidden in this bitfinex thing and and maybe this is actually something when when sam gets back we can talk a little about is you know what's the relationship that bit go had with this sort of incident cause i like i i do think they were involved in a lot of the custody portion around this time and like the relationship between bisphenex and bitco somehow like that that's something that has never been understood to you know i don't totally understand about like this attack and sam probably knows way better i don't know for sure i i hear a thing i don't have first-hand knowledge here that i can say with confidence but i can echo what karoon said that there is i i think a lot of things that are not generally understood or public about that relationship and i think what it gets to is this really nasty problem in custody for scripture i think we hear a lot of people saying is like well i want to store my crypto a third-party custodian and i think the my response was like okay first of all there's like a question of how secure that custodian is but but second of all how about that interface between the custodian and the exchange like let's say that you sell a bitcoin that you're throwing at a third-party custodian to someone on the exchange and then that other person requested withdrawal of that bitcoin their private wallet then the exchange asked the custodian to send it and do they just do it without asking questions like if so like if the exchange gets compromised probably you're not safe if you're in a third party custodian if they don't how are they filling withdrawals and whose coins are those really and like who's what's the governance around that how do you get settlement to work on two different very different systems what if the line between them is compromised right like what if someone like imitates the exchange talking to the custodian or vice versa like it's the centralized bridge problem it is i mean it's it's it's it's it's instead of bridging two decentralized things where you can actually look at the public ledgers of both you're bridging two centralized things that you're hoping you're both telling the truth and correct about everything there's bridges all the way down is what you're telling us god damn it so tyrone i i am fascinated by the story of this woman because i keep hearing tidbits about her she's she's actually like a funny person to hang out with it's just that i she she always did talk about these kind of a little bit weird things like she also knew a lot of cyber security people in new york which is how i how i met her and so you know i'm not totally surprised in some ways but she's she's a very good speaker her talk was hilarious i i don't know about her rap career as much as the internet does seems to know right now they know much more than me i was gonna say that the details of the case are also pretty funny basically it looks like they were like sometimes spending like the bitcoin on on via gift and that sort of tied some of the addresses to their email addresses and they were just like storing the raw private keys on this guy's icloud account with like a week password which is i think how the fbi actually like got a hold of it so it's just like classic terrible like opsec but you know somebody they're also maybe able to allegedly steal several billion dollars of bitcoin oh also this this guy was talking about like on twitter like how he needs to teach people like crypto opsec which was also kind of a little bit comical i mean the fact that they were cashing out via gift cards and bitcoin etms and sending money to many different exchange accounts all of which was like bitcoin from an extremely well-known invisible hack shows that they are not criminal masterminds um whether or not you know they are involved with the original hacker or just the recipients of the bitcoin you know or something else i have no idea but a lot of that behavior is not you know mastermind tier it's really bad amateur too and sorry i may have missed something here but what what exactly was their relationship with bitco and with bitfinet oh so she actually was a consultant for bitco for a while and did uh basically like taught like cyber security for uh consumers class we don't know if this has any relationship to the hack when the hack happened no this was way later actually way later did she have a relationship with either of them while the while or before the hack unknown right now the internet is full of innuendo and like a lot of whatever that you know charlie from always sunny meme of dear the reality right now is that we don't really know a whole lot um and so it's not super useful to speculate also laura has repeatedly instructed us to use the word allegedly over and over again so that uh we make clear that right now you know there's not been a uh an actual uh case that has been seen in a judge so we don't know anyway um we're running up on time and we did have some questions we wanted to ask sam to wrap everything up uh so true and i think you're you're first up yeah so the big question and this is the one that was sort of uh you know advertised on the internet was whether sam is a word cell or a shape rotator and so just to give a little background so sam how much do you know about the word seller shape rotator meme i i have seen it and have no idea what it means okay cool so it's basically a meme that makes is basically argues that um there's two types of people in the world there's one the word cells who are the cell uh as a suffix referring to self-sabotage uh those who are you know very likely in cell no no no but intel comes from that too they're both the same latin uh no intel's involuntary celibacy oh well you should read that you should read you should read you should read the etymology of of word cell which is in this in this uh tyrone is all shape rotators zero percent word sale 100 yeah that is definitely true well the there there is the the kind of uh the the god guide by the other terrorism so it was invented by another person named tarun who's probably soon going to be more famous than me on the internet so basically shape rotators you know really like logical almost to a fault can't express uh things that they want in words very well but you know can get a you know be a partner fellow exactly word cell is like really good at writing but maybe like kind of uh i don't know has has sort of the the feeling of like a journalist and then the self-sabotage thing is actually where the cell comes from according to uh the the manifesto but the idea of a word cell is someone who sort of like complains online on the internet a lot with big words and so that for some reason that dichotomy has been just taken over uh the internet and and so the the thought is that the shape rotator there's not exactly just a mathematical versus literary divided by kind of it's kind of like your spatial intelligence it's like more like an iq test right like if you if you break down iq tests they have like half of those like shape matching problems of like hey are these the two shape or can you turn twist one to another and the other one are sort of the vocab ones and there's this argument that you should split iq into i mean i don't really believe in any of this stuff that like the internet decided to hold on to it i don't know i mean i guess three to one vape rotator to word seller or something i don't know okay that's pretty good jaron how would you classify yourself on that probably if you had to do a ratio similar probably similar like two maybe four four to one wait four to one no root is four to zero oh four to zero two if tyrone was four to zero he would not be you know uh on the show he would be uh off in a closet my hair my hair color at least it gets me a couple word cell points all right that's you definitely get word sell points for the hair in the sweater yes yeah so you're getting you're getting a good workout bump there and and i think uh you know it's good it's good that now now how do you feel about this meme now that you've seen it so many times and that now you've kind of like sort of got that idea for it i i think there's maybe something i've left to get about it i i think there's probably a spirit behind it that i haven't quite dived or melded with yet that i'll see where i'm i'm gonna look like oh that's a word so like that's a shape rotator yeah i'm not at that point yet where i can be like that is the classic example of one of these i want to diagnose i think the reason why this has taken off is that it's the first dichotomy of this kind that basically puts literary people in a lower position than mathematical people and like classically it's the other way around like the journalists are yelling at tech people on the internet and that's kind of the thing that's mostly happening on twitter whereas like oh you're a word cell word cell is like basically an insult and it it it's kind of like being able to define your terms and like no no i'm not the nerd you're the nerd yeah this is like it's like proxy war for tech versus media but like you know we're playing it through this other little thing so it's not as direct or another way of saying it is uh you know shape or traitor versus word cell is just myers-briggs for shape retainers you know you want to make up your own dichotomy and then here you go myers breaks for shape routines now you that means tom is a five five out of five on this yeah to be clear i think we're probably all five of us are shape rotators which is why we're talking about this if you were a word cell you don't you're not talking about this this is true i think maybe i feel maybe to give a slightly better answer i think i feel natively much more like a shape rotator but i think that i can rotate words as well if i need to or or something like that and hey it it kind of weird that sounds like a 40 billion dollar ceo answer that's fair are you a shape cell that's the other no no all right i like that i like that okay um i think we only have time for one more question so i'm gonna go ahead and ask one so this is something i was chatting about with it with a friend actually so if you look at like the real big characters that have come out of crypto in the us who've led big companies and started new exchanges the first one was arthur hayes and arthur hayes is like almost the perfect polar opposite of you sam he's like a big super buff black guy who's like kind of a super villain in a lot of ways and just the way that he was like very broski like you know just is sort of out there and like fighting with people and uh was willing to kind of you know put a middle finger to uh you know us regulators and you are very much the opposite right like you sort of have this heroic status you've donated a bunch of money to political campaigns you're like this effect of altruist you're giving away a bunch of money you're much more uh you're much more shape-rotaty you know it's hard to get mad at you how much of this is intentional and how much of this do you attribute to just like how much this was like you saw what happened to arthur you're like holy i should not do that i should do the opposite and how much of it is just incidental to your differences in personality oh i could be that buff i just choose not [Laughter] uh no um i i think there's some of each i mean i i think maybe the way that i would phrase it is something like and look i you know i don't i don't want to put words in other people's mouths but my sense is that arthur is arthur arthur is being arthur and he's being true to himself and you know the arthur that you see it is sort of like you know there's some bluster there's bravado but i think that's a reflection of what he feels and it's a reflection of what he thinks and how he thinks and i think there's a lot of interesting things that he thinks um that he talks about i i think that like the way that i approach it is almost just perpendicular to that as opposed to like going in the opposite way or something which is is something like look like i'm not i feel like i didn't get born with like being like pro regulator or anti-regulator sam we lost you i i also saw arthur kind of recently he's he's he seems to be having fun lately yeah look to be clear i love arthur actually i saw him at the same time as you saw him he seems to be just chill he's chilling no arthur arthur is great i don't i i don't say that with any anything but love for arthur he's great and he's authentic and i really respect that about him and i don't know it's interesting listening to him and it can be fun and i admire that he says what he thinks and i think not enough people do that in general but yeah no i i i think i i sort of like a person more from the perspective i don't know let's sit down let's think about like what makes sense for society what makes sense what's the right thing to do here like what you know what what's the appropriate action and then like let's do that thing and i think that like that turns out to have like come out in a very different place on like regulatory matters than it than i think arthur did but it's not because i was like born hating that or something like that and they're like ah you know seems like some regulatory supervision to be healthy seems kind of dumb like go to war over that like you know let's try and like work constructively regulators that like build a regulatory environment that like achieves the you know 80 percent of reference goals or something like that it is sort of like my my like you know take away on that is not very blustery it's not very sexy i don't know no it's it's great spoken like a true shape rotator that's right okay all right well on that note sam we're gonna have to lose you one last time because it's time for us to sign off uh all right thanks everybody we'll be back in a couple weeks you
