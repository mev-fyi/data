of the biggest hacks in all of crypto history in which an attacker was able to steal more than 600 million dollars worth of coins from the cross chain protocol poly network why don't you give us an overview of what happened here yeah sure so i'll start with the basics the brief background about polynetwork is that it is across blockchain application it allows you to pass messages from one blockchain to another one of their main product is a bridge between different blockchains so if you have tokens on ethereum you can move them to bsc or numerous other blockchains that poly network supports the way this bridge works is that you lock tokens on one blockchain and then you can unlock them on other blockchains so it maintains a balance between locked and unlocked what the hacker eventually managed to do is break this balance and unlock their tokens without locking any tokens um in exchange so um they basically like broke this balance and withdrew all balance all tokens without having to lock their own tokens wow that that is um quite quite a simple actually attack um to extract a huge amount of tokens so as you mentioned poly network is a cross-chain network but i did see a lot of crypto people and i myself also had not heard of polynetwork before this moment so can you tell us kind of how it is that um it was that you know many of us had not heard of it yes sure uh so firstly like this hack was actually uh relatively complex um there were a lot of steps involved um i'm just over simplifying here in some sort but it was indeed like complex act and the reason probably none of us none of us have heard about poly network is that their target audience is in china i'm sure most of the chinese users would have heard about it and probably used it but outside china i don't think anyone really uses poly network yeah yeah and actually when i called it simple what i meant was it's not like they had to hack keys right they ended up just kind of making their key the one that could could uh give themselves the money so in that sense it was um it was i guess sort of like um almost like a whatchamacallit just kind of going around the normal route or something yeah sure it was indeed a unique attack um it wasn't like your previous hacks in the d5 space which usually use something like flash loans price manipulation and stuff like that but it was quite different um obviously poly network has quite a unique architecture from other protocols so um yes the hack was also unique the attacker managed to kick out the trusted parties from the system and replace them with their own malicious party um they call it keeper in the system so once the this key was replaced of the keeper um the attacker was free to do anything they want yeah so so just to actually break down the steps a little bit more um you know you kind of mention at the end but and i mean you did give us the overview but why don't you just walk us step by step what they did um without obviously going into such technical details people won't be able to follow yeah sure um so i can start with some background about poly network firstly um they have a system they have a concept of keepers keepers are trusted entities that sign messages uh that are then very validated or by the blockchain so um as we know ethereum can't directly talk to other blockchains like bse um so we need an intermediary source that can validate messages that happened on ethereum and tell bhc that it actually happened and similarly if something happens on bse these guys validated and tell ethereum that this actually happened this is the basic job of keepers now as long as these keepers are trusted entities and they are not behaving maliciously um they will only uh verify actions that only actually happened so um if they like sign a transaction of ethereum then that transaction must have already happened on ethereum um they won't sign any transaction that hasn't yet happened um so with some background uh the only poly network passes messages around is that they have a manager contract on every blockchain that once it receives receives signed data from the keepers um it verifies that the signature is correct if the signature is correct it assumes that the transaction actually happened on a different blockchain um it does not uh it has no way to verify it apart from those signatures that this transaction has already happened or not when the signature is given to it it very it assumes that the transaction has happened and it rebroadcasts that transaction on the target chain on which the code is now running so now the transaction the this is the complete cycle of message passing transaction first happens on a source blockchain the keepers sign it and then pass the data to the destination blockchain and then the destination blockchain rebroadcast this transaction this means that anyone can make the manager contract on the destination blockchain basically rebroadcast almost any transaction they just do that transaction on a source blockchain the keepers will verify it because the transaction has happened and then the destination blockchain will also executed the manager and the destination blockchain will also execute it because this has happened the security concern with this approach is that since anyone can meet the destination uh chain the destination manager contract do anything we should make sure that this contract has no special permission on anything it does not hold any tokens it is not an admin of any contract or anything like that otherwise what can happen is um let's say i do a transaction on source blockchain um which is an admin action obviously i don't have those admin permissions so it will fail on the service blockchain but on the destination blockchain since the transaction is done by the manager contract not me if the manager contract has these admin permissions this transaction will actually go through rather than failing and this is a problem um the transaction which was supposed to fail is not going through and this is what the hacker exploited um they did a transaction on one of the blockchains that failed on that blockchain because they didn't have enough permissions but it actually went fine on the destination blockchain because there it was executed by the manager rather than the user directly um they used this transaction to replace the keepers in the system now once the keepers were replaced um you could make the destination blockchain do any transaction you want you don't even need to do that transaction on the source blockchain the hacker basically created such false transactions which did not happen on the source blockchain but they still signed it with the keeper uh they controlled the keeper now so they can sign whatever they want they signed these transactions which basically said that take all money out of the system and give it to the hacker these wouldn't have happened on the original network because these can only be called by a specific permission contract and this contract is obviously not going to call these unless you lock your tokens but since keepers can sign keepers cannot sign anything that the hacker wants they did sign these transactions they broadcasted these on the destination chain um the destination chain verified the signature um the signatures were correct and it let the hacker take all the money withdraw all the money by unlocking these funds yeah and ultimately it ended up being 273 million dollars of ethereum coins coins 253 million dollars worth of binance smart chain coins and 85 million dollars worth of usdc and then tether um it also uh stole 33 million dollars in tether but tether the company ended up blacklisting those usdt so there's a lot of twists that happened after the actual attack um and we'll get to discussing those but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible do you love sports

conversation with muda gupta so the exploit itself was um you know pretty crazy just especially the eye-opening amount but then after that a number of twists happened so first let's start with a tweet from slow mist um which is i guess like a a security company or an audit company or something so let me tell us what it is that slo miss discovered um yes so slow mist has been working on like finding who the hacker is and what they did since basically these uh since as soon as people knew that this hack happened um i assume they are working working closely with polynetwork and other entities so they discovered that one of the wallets um is linked to this hacker's account and that wallet has done transactions on an exchange uh which requires users to go through kyc process this means that there is a chance that um the hacker messed up and actually used the kyc verified wallet which will allow these agencies to like actually know the identity of this hacker and uh get him uh in real life um so this was one of these slippers uh by the hacker the hacker later uh claims that um this and like they didn't slip up maybe they used fake kyc or a stolen account or something um it's basically like we can't verify these games um either thing is possible it's also possible it's the real identity or uh they are just making it up so this was one of the things slow miss discovered then slomist has also been working on finding the underlying root cause of this hack um i think they did to analysis a brief one on the day of hack just a few hours after later which didn't contain many details but um it did give a brief overview and then recently they added a more detailed analysis where they went over a bit more details so yes lumist has been working on finding who did this and then the attacker began returning the majority of the tokens at least as of by thursday um noon eastern time so how did that turn of events come about yes so by now i think about 50 of the tokens have been returned um there are two sides to the story one uh the hacker is claiming that they are uh white hat they always intended to return these tokens the only reason they hacked them because they didn't trust that poly network team uh if they disclosed this bug bounty then the poly network team will take proper actions and resolve this issue properly they were scared that such a big amount might persuade the team themselves to like run away with these funds over table um so um it's their claim that they actually saved the project they actually saved the money of the users and now they are returning it and since the project now is under limelight the project will not run away with these funds or anything but the other side of the story is that um it is highly likely that slamist and other teams were narrowing down on the real identity of the hacker um this identity to link to exchange was one of the slippers that the hacker did and some other stuff so if these these teams were getting closer and the hacker was realizing that um so they might have changed their story like i i believe they their original motive was not to return these forms the actions they took after immediately getting these funds like they sent out a tip to a person who uh tried helping them launder these funds uh they were talking about creating a dao trolling the apollo network team and stuff all of these kind of actions are usually not done by white hackers but people who have malicious intentions um that being said it is hard to tell what the exact intentions of the hacker was hacker were but i believe that they changed their motives once they realized that they can get into trouble if their identity is released this is obviously a very large amount of money and uh people will do their best to grab hold of this person in real life even laundering such a large amount of money is very risky so if they wanted to actually use these phones they will have to go through a lot of risky hoops uh and now they are trying to get a legit uh bug bounty reward in exchange for returning this one so they're negotiating the terms with the team right now but um i guess under uh like in the curtains it's they're saying maybe i return you 95 percent of the funds you let me keep five percent and um you don't do any like uh you don't take any legal actions or anything against me you announce this as a reward and uh like give me legal money that i can legally use without any troubles these negotiations are still going on i guess they are negotiating the amount and the terms but this is where the situation is right now yeah the whole thing just every twist and turn has been pretty crazy um one other aspect of this is that um they've been broadcasting a bunch of messages through the blockchain can you talk about kind of how that conversation's been going and how that came about and why they're doing this yeah sure um so i think at the start it started out as something a bit cocky um in some sense they were teasing people trolling the team and posting uh such comments uh when they also tipped a user who tried helping them launder money and stuff like that so i think it started out as a nefarious thing um a chaotic evil of some sorts but over time it has uh become a bit more neutral communication medium now they are actually doing q and a's on the blockchain i think they have done four till now people are asking them questions by sending them messages and they are answering those questions on the blockchain uh they also use the blockchain to communicate with the pali network team uh they posted a address and they said encrypt messages with the public key of this account they know the private key so they can decrypt these messages so they have established an encrypted medium of communication between them and the pali network team these messages we can't decipher we don't know what they are talking about and similarly different agencies that might be listening on will not be able to decipher these messages unless the poly network team decides to de-close uh disclose this um so now i believe it has these communication medium has become something quite useful um this is the only medium to talk to this hacker right now so i think yeah it's a very important bit yeah one thing i wanted to add was that tip that they sent to the person who said you know don't use your tether because it's blacklisted um the tip they sent was the amount of uh one three three seven which is like this like internet leap speak and um so it's definitely uh and and what lead speak is is a way of using numbers to spell letters and words and so um yeah it's just kind of like a a deep an internet culture thing and it sort of shows kind of maybe a little bit of the personality of the attacker um so i mean this attack just raises all kinds of questions because um so obviously tether which is a centralized company was able to blacklist the tether um but then there were people you know i i think that maybe also were questioning whether binance because it has launched finance smart chain or whether usdc could do anything about what happened with those coins so what what do you you know think happened there and and should have happened there yeah sure um so let's talk one level uh tether actually responded quite quickly uh after the hack they immediately blocked the balance so that's great ustc has similar functionality but i guess they were just a bit slower in reacting and the hacker had already deposited these tokens in curve by then so um the even if usdc wanted to blacklist them they wouldn't have been able to do it um so like props to data for reacting so quickly um but for other folks um i guess maybe somehow they need to improve their alerting monitoring system or something as far as bsc goes um although bac is relatively centralized as compared to other blockchains but is not but it's not centralized in a way that um like any single identity can our entity can block this hacker from doing transactions there are still uh like or two dozens validator on bse and all of them will have to collude to block this person and getting that sort of collusion is not easy in a short time time frame and even if it was possible for cj to let's say anyone to get that called or that sort of arrangement on bac they wouldn't really want to do it because um bsc is positioned as uh as a team that is free that is censorship resistant and if you take an action that blocks these hackers uh it does not look good from optics point of view from bse's users yeah so as you mentioned at this point um the attacker is negotiating with a poly network team to keep five percent of the tokens as sort of like a bounty um what do you think the poly network should do at this point um yeah sure so i think we can uh take a page from your traditional ransomware requests and uh stuff like that so the uh what like the suggested approach in these cases is to pay the ransom whatever the demand is or get your product back um get as much iphones uh secured as possible and once that has happened then you can continue uh taking all those legal actions and whatever you were originally planning on uh taking so even if right now uh poly network agrees to a settlement with the user um the settlement like if they wanted to pursue a legal action at a later date the settlement won't matter what this person did will likely be treated as illegal in most jurisdiction uh now i'm not a lawyer but uh these are my views so um whatever the pers whatever primary network agrees to right now uh will not really be considered as a final agreement in the uh codes and all so uh right now the strategy for poly networks should be to secure as many phones as possible and then decide if um they should continue pursuing other means of getting to this user um if the amount remaining like if the hacker agrees that they'll keep uh the bounty of like 100k dollars or something and return everything else then i think it makes sense to not take any further actions the hacker probably deserved those 100k but if the hacker is saying that i want to keep 10 million dollars um like i think 10 million might also be fine but let's say they are saying 100 million they have returned 50 of the phones now so they still have 300 million left if they are saying they want to keep anywhere between 100 to 300 the only thing that is not really justified um for now the poly network team should give into these demands but still consider options of uh taking these traditional legal methods yeah but what is the typical amount for a bounty uh the traditionally accepted value for critical boards like these is ten percent of the amount hacked um so um adverse you should be giving uh this was a 600 million uh billion uh six hundred million hacks so you should at most be giving 60 million to the user but i personally feel that this amount should be leaking as the uh like amount at risk increases so for maybe like if the hack amount was one million dollar then maybe 10 100 and k is justified that for such large amounts like 600 m i don't think 10 percent is justified um even like a million dollar bug bounty is a life-changing amount and i think it's a fair amount for this hack yeah yeah i i would agree with that um but we'll see what happens all right

this week's news recap first headline the infrastructure bill saga ends at the beginning on tuesday the senate passed its infrastructure bill voting 69 to 30 to invest 1.2 trillion dollars into the country's public works to the crypto industries chagrin however the bill moved out of the senate without changing a certain provision regarding crypto taxation despite multiple amendments being offered as a refresher the original and final language requires reporting for crypto brokers in order to bring in 28 billion dollars in taxes over the next few years the provision mandates crypto brokers report customer gains via a 1099 and any transactions over 10 thousand dollars to the internal revenue service while the community does not object to appropriate entities being taxed the provision received vociferous backlash over its broad definition of a crypto broker kristen smith executive director of the blockchain association interpreted the bill to encompass quote software wallet developers hardware wallet manufacturers multi-stick service providers liquidity providers dow token holders and potentially even miners as brokers under the current iteration of the bill such a requirement would force pseudonymous decentralized protocols to collect and enforce know your customer or kyc information an impossible task senators proposed multiple amendments though none gained the support necessary notably on monday morning a last-ditch compromise between senators cynthia lemus pat toomey mark warner rob portman and kirsten cinema to amend the contentious language fell just short of approval courtesy of a single objection from senator richard shelby the infrastructure package is now on its way to the house of representatives with the crypto provisions original language intact however the crypto industry nor the house will be taken by surprise this time around coin center's jerry brito is ready to make a brand new amendment tweeting the bad news is that the amendment did not receive consent so it will not make the bill the good news is we're not giving up next stop is the house where we can try to get a whole new amendment from scratch that can address all our concerns four members of the house's blockchain caucus are also prepared for another round of crypto policy debates with representatives tom emmer darren soto bill foster and david schweikert pending
