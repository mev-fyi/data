not a dividend It's A Tale of Two fun now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet generally speaking airdrops are kind of pointless anyways um my name's trading firms who are very involved I like to eat the ultimate D5 Protocols are the antidote to this problem okay hello everybody Welcome to The Chopping Block every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry Insider perspective on the crypto topics of the day so this is also I just want to announce the 400th show of Unchained whoa yeah it's amazing we're very excited um we uh we're actually we're officially taking over Unchained in celebration of the 400th episode so every episode from now on is only going to be the chopping block uh so we're just gonna be doing this three times a week so look out for that uh all right team intros real quick so first we got Tom the D5 Maven and master of memes next up we've got Robert the crypto connoisseur and captain of compound uh then we've got tarun the Giga brain and Grand Puba at gauntlet and then you have myself a massive I'm the head hype man to dragonfly so the four of us are early stage investors in crypto but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice legal advice or even life advice so guys it has been uh a pretty down bad kind of week um the the main news of the week has been the merge we were talking about it pretty much non-stop for every show for the last like two months and the merch happened it went off basically without a hitch as good as one could have expected and in my mind like the outcomes the decision tree when the merge habit was either okay one the merch fails in which case everything's gonna dump or two the merge succeeds and either rallies and everything's great we're all happy or path three the merge succeeds but it was priced in and nothing happens instead what happened is the merge succeeded and everything just proceeded to Turbo dump and eth is now in the [ __ ] I only have one word for you taxes taxes wait September 15th why September 15th it's like October so everyone is selling their crypto because people are selling anticipation of taxes yeah yeah here's here's the long and short of it so everybody made a ton of money last year the market was up everybody was like churning crypto buying it selling it everybody filed extensions which are due soon and people are just now realizing how much money they made last year and how much lower their crypto is relative to last year but why would this affect no no why would this affect ether more than Bitcoin that doesn't make any sense it's impacting everything yeah it seems it seems in the uniformly across I I think the E thing may have been that like peop more people are speculating for the merge but then like yeah once it was a nothing Burger it was like a nothing Burger in a good way sorry not I don't mean that I'm not trying I'm trying to say like nothing in like there was no excitement right each W died immediately basically so I I guess like the the that part people were hoping to probably make some carry on for whatever little time they had that trade existed and then like now they're like oh [ __ ] we need to pay taxes I I the best explanation I heard was basically people were long each spot to get the airdrop short perps and then just there's a ton of you know spot selling post merge um and it's like yeah that's that's kind of why you're seeing that in the market but wouldn't that be offset by buying in the perps yeah it's like and also like each power was so small like people it was priced at like one percent but like a lot of people were putting on the trade right like I mean you see that in the funding rates and everything so I mean any argument is like eat is less spies less liquid than perps and so that's why it's just like you see more cell pressure now and it's like so immediate because no one actually wants the eat after that it seems like this create this trade just became so overcrowded that it no longer made any sense right because like you're you're getting presumably you're getting one percent that's what this thing was being priced at in the ious so you're you're taking these crazy funding rates you're taking all this risk just for one percent and then you have to get out of your trade by which point you know Ethan's already started dumping so it seems that in aggregate this was a massively massively overdone trade that but that happens a lot in general right it was just such an obvious trade right it's so easy to explain why this trade makes sense and there was all the story about moving to the upside um it's really unfortunate because I feel like ethereum didn't really get a true celebration because basically the day after it got kicked in the teeth I feel it feels really sad that that being said I do think ethereum deserves a lot of credit because the merge was completely correct it was a non-event in a great way the blockchain is running smooth ever since the inflation rate is like half a percent a year at this point like in the days since you know the block speed is 12 seconds it's like ethereum is better than it was a week ago and I think it deserves a lot of kudos minus the uh deflation didn't happen component yes the argument for deflation yeah for a minute there people were pretty thrilled but it's it's still materially less than it was right like that's sort of the you know counter argument so well it's also material less than Bitcoin right Bitcoin is like between one and two percent inflation so ether is now more disinflationary than Bitcoin is which is pretty very impressive yeah very true I mean it clearly like if you there was a there was a chart that I mean there's been like 20 of these charts of showing uh at the at the rate at which fees are being paid and burned through eip-559 um if the merge have been activated at different times what would be the net uh inflation rate or deflation rate in ethereum and there are clearly a bunch of times over the last cycle that you would have been uh net net uh deflationary now right now we're at the bottom of that cycle gas fees are super low on a relative basis um and so yeah the ether is not going to be deflationary right now but if we see another cycle come into play Then very likely that each will go through periods of deflation we just need more on-chain activity to get people revving up and paying high gas prices then it's deflationary again The World Is Right yeah I mean it's going to take Bitcoin a while to catch up right Bitcoin is going to be like you know 10 years basically until Bitcoin is at the level that ether is at now even assuming no net deflation yeah we need a couple having eggs we need another two happenings and there was and there was also a great debate uh on this show between Eric wall and um I can't remember who the other person was but they were talking about um uh Bitcoin uh Bitcoin needing to have a uh a Taylor Mission so having to continue to be inflationary in perpetuity in which case you know that Taylor Mission might be on the order of about what ether is doing right now uh which again also breaks the narrative between what Bitcoin and ether would be about well I you know we don't have to get into it on this show because you know it's a much broader debate and conversation about the security budget necessary to keep Bitcoin safe in the end years but fundamentally I don't think the current model works I think you have another couple happenings and it requires the price of Bitcoin to go up for the network to be as safe um transaction volume has never supplanted minor block rewards um as was envisioned by Satoshi in the white paper which when I read the white paper the first time I was like oh my God that's Genius Like The Block rewards are only there until the network is like up and running it's a bootstrapping mechanism but transaction fees have never so playing through the block rewards and so there is a massive security risk to bitcoin you know and a half into happenings three happenings especially if price don't go up that I think people are under pricing um and I think Bitcoin fundamentally will change and I think it can be done in ways that are not going to violate the sort of like immutable 21 million dollar 21 million token cap on bitcoin I'm sure Bitcoin will find ways to you know maintain a are you sure every developer just gets run out every time they make a bit but I don't know like I feel like Jeremy Ruben's been trying to get bit 119 for like three years can you describe 119. sorry bit 119 is a way of doing sort of like uh deferred covenants so you can kind of like schedule transactions and so a lot of like not fully D5 but like some defy like constructs that can be made using that like you can do sort of like hash rate derivatives and stuff like that using it but like bitcoiners are really against it because it like it's sort of um it's like Opera it brings back this op return um debate in from like 2013 2014 Bitcoin and op return was sort of like hey you could return an arbitrary value and it would store that and then people started sort of taking advantage of that in a weird way and I think like basically people are still kind of feel that way about covenants but the problem is I don't see what are you going to do you know half the time people are like oh we're just gonna use lightning clearly that's not [ __ ] working like that that just like it's just like no one wants to run nodes like in fact there was an amazing tweet the other day but one of the main lightning devs uh Bosworth Andrew Buffett that was like oh like I only need like 20 20 gig of RAM to run in the lightning mode I thought that it was supposed to run your phone and you were just connecting to local notes he can't he can't even like and whenever whenever Bitcoin be like oh no eth has fat nodes I'm like this one [ __ ] person's transactions that he's routing is is already just bigger than probably the the unit swap set from 2020 for just the so like and and there's no way it was anywhere near the same amount of volume so I I just sort of think lightning is kind of a dead end the whole like starkware trying to do Starks on bitcoin thing that you know maybe that has life but that's going to need things like bip not 119. I'm just like very bearish on the developer side because like it feels like anyone who isn't like yelling at anyone who isn't like Bitcoin standard reader uh is sort of like shown the door for development stuff Tom how are the lightning metrics looking because I remember you know a while back on the show we were talking about how the metrics of lightning look really good I was yeah I was trying to dig into this a little bit more but unfortunately it's very hard to get data like inherently because it's all like off chain so the network capacities continue to go up which really shocked me over the past you know year or two but there's like more and more you know Bitcoin and lightning Network for for um they can be traded but like you know we don't know actually like what that volume looks like I suspect some of it is probably subsidized by uh or like it is not economically rational for some people to maintain some of these channels but they maybe do it because they're a startup and they want to make lightning be a thing but yeah I've been trying to get like the network data in terms of volume I just haven't been able to find anything actually if you go to so so at least for the publicly indexable nodes if you go to 1ml.com that's sort of like a reasonable place to look it obviously doesn't have like everything but like this whole Maxi from 2019 were like oh there's so many private channels because you can only see the open and closes on private channels not the actual settlement just turned out to not be true so like the public channels at least give you a reasonable lower bound and you can see that like it's kind of like like it is increasing capacity wise but it's not like the volume that's actually really going out there yeah that was a confusing part yeah if you look at the network capacity it is 4 800 Bitcoin which is very small and compared to the amount of Bitcoin that's wrapped and put into D5 on ethereum and it's flying around someone who had their Bridge hacked and I won't mention it who but they they were like oh yeah you know there was more funds stolen in my bridge times three than there was in the lightning Network ever definitely kind of crazy flex but okay yeah all right yeah that's a bad Flex bad bad yeah yeah I I agree I agree I agree but I thought that was like a funny statistic it's like oh like Bitcoin people are like championing the [ __ ] that has like no [ __ ] volume barely has capacity when you when you think about it relative to these Bridges where people are are like pummeling through million dollar volume all the time right so but to be clear if any Bitcoin Maxes are listening we love lightning uh tarune if you please direct your IRA tarun not at us we are we are team lightning Lightning's great um and they're it's interesting how many lightning startups have also uh isn't uh David Marcus's startup is like doing uh yeah it's like lightning oriented startup where if I recall it was like we're gonna figure out what the product is but we're gonna we're gonna Target lightning yeah and then strike strike uh you know there's been all these stories about how the El Salvador Bitcoin push is kind of falling apart and and you know people on the ground are not really using uh Bitcoin or strike very extensively so it's you know because they're growing off a low base uh you know the like I think the lightning growth numbers in terms of capacity look pretty good but the reality is that as crypto has grown and as the infrastructure has increased the alternatives to settling Bitcoin through lightning have all gotten better and better better and lightning is just not getting that much better and unless it drastically improves in a short amount of time or there's some kind of distribution hack that sets into place I think I think everything else is just gonna overtake it as there's also there's also this there's also this sort of schism between the like lightning Labs lightning and uh block stream lightning because lightning Labs added this overlay Network called Taro which has tokens and like you can issue stable claims on it but it kind of is like its own private Network and so there's kind of this war going on between them of like you'll you'll see like the block stream Samson type people being like Oh like they're just like adding in this like private chain it's not real lightning and then lightning mods like no no no no we at least post some of the commitments and I'm like I the fact that they're still debating this [ __ ] just like sometimes boggles my mind yeah yeah well I I'd also okay so coming back to the ethereum merge and all that uh so Eve Powell I think we can pretty safely say is dead uh it's now trading at five dollars which is basically uh what is it like 40 basis points of ethereum it's down 91 from inception so it launched at like 120 bucks and now it's trading at five dollars um tarun I remember you were telling us how you were in the private Discord and you were seeing all the Mayhem those going on give us like the give us The Insider play-by-play of what exactly well well that is disappeared that Discord disappeared disappeared wait why yeah I think they just were like they didn't want the like negative press in general because a lot of people who are in there were writing all these tweets and stuff like that so I then I never I didn't really I didn't really follow much other than I heard about all the like maker Mev um some Searchers I know I talked to were just talking about how like die was sort of like the main uh form of muv because you could just like borrow a ton of die against the ew collateral and they were running they were basically running the maker Oracle on their own and there's enough like you could just basically background the Oracle you you basically take out a really big dye deposit and then back background the Oracle and liquidate your own collateral and it was like profitable because ew is going down fast oh wow I was curious about that there's actually like a good amount of ew volume on such as exchanges like it's like 70 mil today or something like that is that just like people doing Mev cashing out like why else you know it just seems like a very large amount of of volume on like legit exchanges for something that no one is actually building on I I wouldn't rule out the pow Fork I I think that just yes yeah really really I'll be the contrarian I'll say that I would not be surprised if in a year people are like oh no this thing is better than ethereum classic let's just use this for like our thing um and I think it's still around I think everybody viewed it as like oh it's free let's sell it and I think if you leave it alone for long enough and like we just come back to this in like one year I think its price in ether terms is higher than it is today I I get the feeling that people are going to people are going to walk away from this I I think it's the I think it's the opposite I think that Eve Powell like there's there's a narrative moment I think for each Powell and that narrative moment unfortunately has passed and like I think blockchains very often have this small moment in the spotlight and if you if you if you mess up your moment in the spotlight like they don't invite you back on stage you know and and that feels like what happened to youth pal but what did they mess up specifically I think they mess up like actually coming out and having a coherent story having some kind of pitch to developers to users right like the only thing I have heard from anyone about if Powell is how to sell it and how to trade it right and specifically how to trade it in a way that like maximizes you making money from The Ether that you have to be fair it's it's pow well the two versions uh biggest fan is Justin and son who you know arguably Tron had the same uh sort of Genesis of uh you know the only thing people cared about was really trading it so that's true I mean I think the the difference though is that I think Justin for for whatever criticisms we might make of him he's clearly a very engaged founder who has big Ambitions to how to make Tron successful and I just don't I just don't say I mean maybe I'm missing it but I have not seen any story about that with with Eve Powell you know so you know this is part of the the natural tension in blockchain is that you do need to have some kind of leadership team for a blockchain to really be viable unless the text speaks for itself and it's very hard for the text to speak for itself in 2022. all right let's let's move on I think at this point it's depressing enough to talk about either dumping and Heath pal being a nightmare um let's talk about other different depressing topics so uh one of the one of the big news of the week of course has been our good friend dokwan who was on the show before he for Terror collapse and the the vibe around stoquan really changed [Laughter] look I like look we I met dokon in person multiple times he's a nice guy I mean I know that he's kind of a dick and he's a lot more of a dick online than he is in person but yeah like I don't know I it's weird the fact that like I know him personally and he's like now one of the most famous people in crypto period ever right just like Satoshi and then like dokwon like Satoshi vitalik dokwon is probably the list you know most famous script of people you know I think the ultimate nft of this last cycle that I will cherish forever is being followed by these accounts that basically are you know Under Siege in the sense that they're uh like like goes to Kyle were like they make those accounts might be orphaned at some any point but like whoever their followers are you get to keep them forever like if you're followed by them you're following it's like an nft yeah it's an nft it is a sort of nft of the last cycle if you're followed by them which I thought because like their followers haven't changed they haven't changed they haven't been adding followers very much they just kind of like yeah they're too busy too yeah yeah no it's it's weird anyway so do Quan um the the news basically is that uh so Korean authorities have now put out an arrest warrant for uh dokwon we don't have a ton of details on exactly what is in the arrest warrant I believe but it's something around some Financial crimes something something uh they're seeking to void his passport to prevent him from traveling uh they've now also issued an Interpol red notice to try to prevent him from kind of hopping country to Country um dokwan claims that he is not on the run which is a kind of on the Run thing to say of like oh no I'm not on the run I'm totally cool but I don't know at this point it it just it just seems kind of sad this whole episode seems very sad where I I to be honest personally I again you know having Meto Quan all the all the how he is as a person aside um I think the the criminalization of the failure of Terra is a dangerous precedent and now again we don't know all the details you know they haven't released a whole lot of information about what exactly are the nature of the charges it could be that they did absolutely heinous stuff especially going to the terror collapse as a lot of people have speculated uh right now we don't have any hard data to know one way or another whether or not they lied or misrepresented things to people or if they misappropriated funds from the leader Foundation guard for themselves no one knows so anything along those lines is really speculation um but assuming that his crime was failing and losing people a lot of money um this feels really this feels like a kind of dark and sad outcome for this whole Terra Saga I don't know if you guys have any Reflections on this or if you know anything that I didn't already relay well I only know things that are already in the public domain um but you know I would suspect he's not being charged with you know losing people a lot of money it's most likely to do with the public statements that he was making about the soundness and the safety of the system um which really you know is potentially what was causing the harm to the users of the blockchain um if it was misinformation in some way um you know you don't you know get in trouble for losing people's money you get in trouble for you know doing fraud or doing misinformation that loses people money like other situations where a huge amount of money gets vaporized and like it Forks between like crime and not crime is like you know archigos the hedge fund that you know imploded like you know 20 billion dollars you know very quickly that veered into crime because you know they were deceiving Banks and the people lending them money you know Lehman or AIG you know vaporizes 100 billion dollars and it's like oh no no it's no crime because they were a regulated business you know um and I really think it just comes down to whether or not you know somebody's playing by you know supervised rules or not um in deciding it's also just how sympathetic they are right like the reality is that if you want to throw the book at somebody you're gonna go find something and if a judge or a jury is not going to be sympathetic then you can you can get it done uh I think I mean again we don't I don't know so I'm totally wildly speculating but whatever's our show we can speculate um it it feels to Me Like Somebody it needs to feel like someone did something and issuing in a restaurant is like the most something that you could possibly do even if the actual substance of a case is pretty thin and that that that's what this smells like to me is that you're absolutely right I'm sure that they can throw things from Twitter feed that says misrepresented the stability of but also like the clearly it's you know it's all in the docks right you can see exactly how it works they talked about desk files that's why they raise money to protect against it and if they didn't raise enough money that's on you as an investor to decide whether it's enough money to defend the peg but I will say the foundation guard and like sort of some of this the like custodial entities involved in the middle may have misrepresented and those are in my mind if I were to guess the Luna Foundation guard probably is where all the legal liability was and I forget if they're a Singapore ND or a Korean but like the accounting and stuff that they were saying that to me is that feels like that feels like the thing that's where like the the liability exists yeah I was about to say the same thing I think you know when we were talking about this on the show initially I was I was saying you know let's not criminalize you failure and very much in this this Camp of like you know Luna was an experiment and but it was all open source and honorable and it's sort of on you and it does feel like lfg funds you know the rumors they were misused um the basis cache thing all as well kind of very much rubbed me the wrong way and kind of changed my perception so um I don't think there's anything you know necessarily criminal about what happened with Luna but it's the stuff on the periphery that I think baby is getting caught up why do you say basis cash uh so by the way just for quick people who don't know so basis cash was a pseudonymous implementation of the basis protocol that was actually launched secretly by dokwan he was Anonymous when he launched it it failed and that was that why does that fact rub you the wrong way um something about I don't know like missing missing disclosure um around the fact that like this was happening to like you know Luna investors um I don't think there's anything actually like in you know the legal system that would that would you know put them behind bars for this but it's more optically um you know uh not sort of disclosing this this fact while you were running Luna seems pretty I don't know very strange I don't think we'd really accept that of like most other um Founders especially if it imploded the same way basis cache did um I I just think it's like a very optically uh uh poor decision I I see what you're saying at the same time like I don't know anybody who didn't know that basis cash failed who like actually understood how stable coins worked you know what I mean but nobody knew that it was doe Quan's project right but like is is the problem with basis cash dokwan like mismanaged it or is it that the [ __ ] model doesn't work like that that seems like the takeaway it's not that like wow dokon really mismanaged basis cache yeah basic cash didn't work maybe it's more of an argument that like you know having concrete evidence of the fact that like this model doesn't work and then going in public and chilling Luna which is you know effectively the same model arguably even worse um feels very off I mean look I'm gonna I'm gonna do team Luna right now I I totally disagree like what they did was they went and raised Luna Foundation guard a bunch of Bitcoin to prevent exactly what they saw with basis cash right so to me like the basis cache was completely public all of us knew about basis cash I mean none of us were loon investors but all this new BET bases cash and understood hey this is yet another example of this model not working it's not the exact same as a Terra model it's different Tara was a full layer one they had some applications that were using uh Luna and Luna was getting integrated and USD was getting integrated different blockchains um so I think the story that they were presenting was a coherent one right and like people [ __ ] knew that most other seniors shares coins have broken so I I I I understand optically like it's kind of a it's a terrible way to learn that story right like learning that oh basis cash was launched as like a little experiment by Doe that blew up and he didn't tell anyone and then you know we learned that like the day after Tara blows up it all ends up looking really bad but practically speaking like unless you're gonna impugn the ability of a Founder to launch something autonomously or maybe maybe the argument is like look Luna's so big that you it shouldn't be okay for you to launch something pseudonymously if this is an experiment that you're trying to learn from you should allow the rest of your community to learn from it too and understand the way you're thinking about the lessons that come from this um but it feels to me like more that it was Sensational rather than that there's a clear reason why it was wrong for them to have launched basis cached anonymously I do think it's sort of weird in the sense that it is sort of like making a competitor to your main protocol and that under an add-on yeah yes there are multiple instances in defy of that uh you know obviously we will not name names but there's obviously quite a few projects where a team has gone out and built another project you know to the side or on top or adjacent you know especially with you know add-on projects I think it's more common than people think yeah there was the famous story of the McCullough now brothers who made the curved Fork on Solana and ended up getting a bunch of attention but I'm sure they're I'm sure they're I'm sure they're just the tip of the spear when it comes to D5 Founders getting cute with their ecosystems but anyway you know moving a little bit away from Tara and Daquan um there was another story that was just announced last night that the house the U.S uh House of Representatives is right now contemplating a bill that will involve the Banning of algorithmic stable coins for two years um this seems I don't know so the the bill just had a bunch of random crap in it um so if I can just quickly kind of skip through it okay so to place to your band on points similar to Tara USD it'd be legal to issue or create new quote unquote endogenously collateralized stable coins now to be clear this effectively grandfathers in currently endogenously collateralized stable coins so it only says that you can't make a new one or issue a new one for two years uh in that time they want there to be some I think like the FED to investigate UST and how it works and like how to create a safer version of this or something I don't know why they think the FED is the right organization to do that um and they're also going to be allowing Banks and non-banks to issue stable coins uh which you would need to get uh you need to get approval from the OCC in order to actually issue such a stable coin and then there's some other kind of random stuff in the bill it seems like a total non-starter bill to me it seems so half-baked that I think there's just no way this thing is going to see the light today well I think these changes are ridiculous and I think these changes make the build less likely you know if you asked me a month ago I would have said oh the stablecoin bill like you know there has a lot of broad bipartisan supports of you know regulated stable coins now it's like you know getting burger and like a lot of that is reactionary to I think Tara has scarred or you know freaked out a lot of people you know from staffers who are the ones writing this legislation to the people that will vote on it but you know I I think it's crazy you know I don't anticipate in its current form it'll pass but it the part that's mind-boggling to me is that you know I never could have imagined a year ago you know having a bill you know in the house that says no I'll go stable coins you will go to jail if you make an album like that's the surprising part and you know I don't know if the FED needs to study it I mean I've traded almost every algo stablecoin that's ever been created most of them unsuccessfully um I know a lot about algo stables at this point and you know there's not that much to learn I yeah I I tend to agree I think this seems like a well it's a very understandable reaction wait can I can I actually pull pull the others on the show what percentage of Luna and or UST and or anchor or be I'm including people in every application what amount do you consider what percent of that do you think was U.S investors versus like Korean or Singapore I'm just kind of curious to get a sense of like how much you know if it's like Americans lost a billion dollars then like yeah I could kind of see this being through if America sells 100 billion dollars probably not you know you know what I mean like I'm just kind of hard to get like where do you guys fall on that Spectrum I think it was like completely spread out everywhere I think it was like 50 50. I mean like everyone I knew was like obsessed with Tara like I don't think that was like a us thing I don't think that was like an Asian thing I think like everybody caught up in this because it was like the easiest way to make you know 20 until the collapsed 20 yeah 20 yeah and then I'm just more curious about the net damage to U.S citizens because I kind of just roughly think the probability of success of these bills is like proportional to in some you know at least I understand I understand the point you're making is that okay if the U.S bore the brunt of the losses then that makes it more likely that this yeah the regulations gonna pass I I actually don't think that's correct I think that like as a as a legislator you have so you have such low Fidelity in actually being able to understand the impact of economic damage it's much more about the sentiment and the storyline that ends up trickling up into your constituents and into like you know your general agenda then it is like a clean like distillation of exactly where the damage was and the other thing too of course us is much wealthier than any other country right so like even if we took more of the damage on a percentage basis it might be much lower and of course the other thing is that like so remember at the time the tear collapsed the market cap of crypto was 1.5 trillion okay Terra between Luna and UST on the whole had about 40 billion dollars a market cap and if you've seen that was wiped out completely which it basically was then you lost 40 billion out of a 1.5 trillion dollar base but it's not actually in absolute terms it's not that much it was the fact that it brought down all the other crypto assets so much and spooked the [ __ ] out of everybody that was actually the the broader impact was just the narrative and the the fear I I agree but I kind of also think that if there was were a lot of American losses the stories you get in the news would be would be like as bad as they are in Korea I assume for this Korean Singapore stories if you read them even just like Google translated the sentiment is like a hundred times worse than what they are here so I guess my question is like that's why I'm asking kind of like where you think the U.S Falls and the like loss if I were to like ranks you know here's what I bet there's a big confounder here which is that uh Korea has a much higher savings rate than the us so I think I'd suspect that a lot of these countries like I mean ultimately anchor was a savings product right so if you have a very high savings rate then it's much more likely that you're going to put a lot of your wealth into this product whereas in the US like because we're such a consumption driven economy you know some guy loses 20K and he's like oh that sucks but like you know like I don't have that much savings to begin with because I'm you know living I've ton of debt and I'm living off credit cards and like I you know a lot of people probably lost their like unemployment checks on Tara which in absolute terms they lost a lot of their wealth but they didn't have that much wealth because they were you know it was such a credit driven economy it's just it's just kind of different I think like there I don't think there'd be nearly as much desperation from people who lost money in the U.S compared to uh clearly you can see it right I don't see anywhere near you're right the density of stories that you saw coming out of Korea and different parts of Asia then what else is what you saw in the U.S which is also I guess maybe maybe including all of that that it does feel like these types of bills are not going to pass because I feel like they need that kind of like breach of negative sentiment to get like the level of action you see that you're seeing in Korea supposedly Singapore soon well I think you know and this is speaking extremely broadly but I feel like a lot of the attitude at least you know domestically is like one of like self-reliance and it's like you know penny stocks are legal and like most people are smart enough not to lose money on penny stocks we don't have to like criminalize them and make it illegal to create a penny stock right most people don't do it and like you know your parents tell you not to buy penny stocks right like I don't think we have to criminalize making an Outlook stable coin I think like what we would be better served by doing is educating people that most Outlet stable Queens are horrifically stupid ideas and that they're going to lose all their money just like they would with a penny stock or playing Blackjack you know and like I I think the better outcome is directing resources towards you know education instead of like trying to criminalize something just because there was one like really dumb you know implosion Army our U.S entrepreneurs even making how to stable coins like I don't get the sense that you know it just feels very yeah yeah this is not exactly a hot area anymore after Tara and uh you know there was a moment but this thing regulation is always a regulation of this kind is always so backwards looking right like nobody wants to launch an alcohol stable right now nobody wants to buy all the Stables right now this is a problem the market solve for itself because it saw the most catastrophic dramatic failure in history and so it's kind of like okay we're going to make this thing illegal that nobody wants to do it's like okay great awesome we're glad you're here to save us although I think I've seen an algo stable coin like pitch deck recently I think there's still like one or two people yeah there's a few uh there's a few new ones angle angle was like the last one I saw that got funded is now like oh you can get all these like angostick angle safe field vaults but they're all just basically trying to be like oh we're like going this they're all going sort of like for the frax model I think there's been more convergence around the frax model um which is basically like as minimally algo as possible and super super high collateral ratio which is basically just like what's the point semi-full Reserve banking you know it's very very safe or just you know banking with a very high uh Reserve ratio so like 80 70 Reserve ratio banking which is very safe for obvious reasons the I guess the other I mean not not always not always not always but always the other thing I think that makes it particularly sensitive in the US is because we still remember the GFC right and it happened here it happened on our watch and so I think there's a lot of sensitivity around Financial engineering come on it affected the whole world we caused it we caused yeah that's what I'm saying that's what I'm saying right like if you're in Korea you're like yeah GFC sucked but like it wasn't our fault it was America's fault Americans screwed everything up for everyone else and I think for that reason we have this uh kind of collective scar tissue that makes us particularly sensitive to Tara even if there wasn't actually that much direct impact on Americans from Terror I mean obviously there were some but it clearly wasn't as pronounced as it was in some of these other countries speaking of scar tissue because I remember that uh there was a we whenever we talk about Luna too much we start getting people tweeting and being like sucks stop talking about Luna so we probably we probably should we probably hit our cap on um but we should talk about the other Scar Tissue which is winter View oh yeah this is a sad one this is really sad so um so winter mute for those of you who don't know winter mute is one of the most highly regarded Market making firms in crypto they're very Define native Market making firms they do a lot of stuff on chain in defy through uh dexes and and other you know defy uh platforms they end up getting hacked so the back story was that um there was a revelation by the one inch team that there's a a tool used to create vanity addresses called profanity so vanity address for those who don't know normally when you create an address on a blockchain you just you generate some Randomness and it creates this address which is basically the equivalent of your public key and this address is just a bunch of random bits but what you can do is you can grind to try to find a uh you know basically try to generate more and more addresses one at a time until you get an address that has some kind of nice prefix that you want so you might have a prefix that says you know dead beef and that's cool because like it just kind of looks cool it might cost you a bit of money to generate that by repeatedly trying you know millions or billions of combinations until you finally get one that has the right prefix but with some mathematical certainty you can you can do this so there are a lot of tools to generate these vanity addresses one of these tools was called profanity and profanity the one-inch team revealed that there was a bug in profanity or not a bug but an implementation flaw that profanity uh normally you know an address has 256 bits of entropy but they uh were do they were doing something very stupid where basically they seeded this algorithm with 32 bits of entropy and then did some key derivation that was deterministic to extend it out to 256 bits which basically meant that the entropy of anything generated by by profanity was basically 32 bits module with some extra you know kind of grinding on top and to give people who who don't think in binary as a rough proxy 32-bits has four billion inch numbers four billion operations is not a lot especially when the only thing you're really doing is doing a couple elliptic curve multiplies or adds depending your belief in the poll that the hotel photographer on Twitter um but it it it's actually a very small side of things right whereas um two to the 256 bit integers is roughly 10 to the 80th so one followed by 80 zeros well 83 zeros and uh that's slightly more than the number of particles in the known universe so that four billion is a very tractable number 10 to 80th is not a very tractable number and that's sort of like the problem with the that's right with four billion potential addresses or seeds rather uh with four billion potential seeds to try to iterate through you can do that on Commercial like you don't even need fancy Hardware in order to go through four billion possibilities um so what ended up happening was that when when is disclosed this uh there was a bunch of folks who realized that they had these profanity uh generated addresses vanity addresses that had already gotten hacked in the past um and but everybody started trying to migrate their profanity addresses away uh because of course they were now known to be uh insecure and winter I didn't actually catch the details of what they were doing because there was some kind of there was some kind of multi-sig or something that their profanity address was on and they they so winter mute by the way has had a couple [ __ ] ups that have been epic um and they generally tend to come from the fact that like you know when you look at like the top tier defied trading firms like the svps of the world they never make dumb mistakes like this so I think this is actually winter mute sort of technical in confidence not I would not I would not uh qualify this as a kind of like oh like we should feel totally bad and like oh it's great that they like gave us the truth on Twitter that's not true this is incompetence like there's a [ __ ] cve out like you should be like changing your systems and monitoring stuff so winter meets first up was when they were supposed to be a market maker for optimism and they didn't initialize the gnosis safe on optimism as they did on mainnet and then like someone figured out again a kind of like a way where like you could figure out what the sort of private key was more efficiently or you deployed to that address and you own it right they kind of [ __ ] up on these cyber security stuff like left and right there's a bunch of examples with them so like this is actually them being kind of like incompetent like trading firms normally are structured in the normal markets where like okay if I'm starting hft firm and I trade Futures at the CME or I trade equities and asset NASA eye Colo there if nasdaqs up some cyber security thing and like someone breaks in and like changes my net margin or balance and gets me liquidated right but you can't do that here there's no there's no there's no reversion function here and that means you have to be thinking about red team in your code you can't be you can't just like have this like YOLO like attitude towards cyber security stuff as a trading firm you actually have to act like a cyber security firmer or to some extent of an object that's why some of the best D5 training firms are actually people who are Auditors first and Traders second whereas the people who are kind of like keeping up like winter meter mainly traders who like treat it like it's centralized trading and that's very irresponsible especially when you have other people's money in their case um and so I I actually don't don't think of this as like oh a sad story I think this is a cultural [ __ ] up on their part for not actually taking the cyber security and tax side seriously because like this is a huge cve the so the index Finance hacker in fact got this is his address drained it was like you know Robin Hood I guess like uh and I thought that was kind of funny but there were so many things on in the world that were like happening post this post by One Direction there's a bunch of other people who validated different ways of like emulating it and like you have a [ __ ] set of wallets with a hundred million dollars and then you're not like reading these cves that's your [ __ ] incompetence that's not that you shouldn't be trading on chain just stick to Central you should never be trading on a chain well especially I especially that much money in what amounts to like an eoa yeah that's why I'm saying like all these people giving them compliments on Twitter I I kind of disagree with like fundamentally that they should just stoppage well here's the thing here's the thing as I understand your point and clearly look when when this this was revealed the one inch um disclosure was like two weeks ago it was a while ago this is not like the moment that it happened and then they got they got you know they got God that being said the one thing that I will give winter mute credit for is that I mean one they owned up to it right like you said okay SCP and some of these other guys like they don't have these kinds of colossals well they're also a lot quieter right so they don't they don't you don't necessarily see what they have made we don't know what mess-ups that other firms have made I guarantee you everybody's been doing this long enough has made massive um so that's one right like just the velocity of stuff that they're doing they're going to mess things up crypto's hard everybody has messed up in in some some in bigger ways than others but like you know I I agree with you but the reason I I say this is Dave wintermute has had very recently some clear [ __ ] big stuff like a cultural problem that shows like like I would not want them Market making any protocol at all ever they should just like get out of D5 training I I don't I don't disagree and look at the magnitude of this failure is so big that there's there's a good possibility that they wiped out all their profits from D5 potentially since deception I have no idea but that seems plausible to me that basically they're like net down on on defy after having lost 160 million of their own money now that being said the thing I'll give the credit for is that it's their money right they they uh although there are market makers they have these loans they have these loans from protocols like that's that is very different that's why I'm saying like you actually have to right like they're covering it with their own money right now yes but they actually did technically lose a protocol's office the same way they lost optimism's assets like it it it it it it shows that like they're like I believe they said that they're going to pay back the the on-chained debts no they're they're going to pay they're gonna pay them back but my point is if you are custodying these assets that are given to us alone you should be treating them with like the type of security no no no that's not custody man that's a that's a lot you're they're in debt that's not custody when you're in a market making loan these things are kind of half custody half pure debt because like you yes in a market making loan yes in a market making loan yes but not the on-chain borrows but you have slas that you you sign up and you're basically not guaranteeing that budget okay right so this is why I think let's give them the time to see whether they actually pay everybody back and and make this whole it's pretty clear look winter mute they plan to be running for a long time they have a big enough balance sheet they have I mean you know uh if Guinea said that look we have a bunch of positive Equity we're going to be fine this hurts clearly that's a lot of money to lose for anybody um and there's also the possibility of getting some uh remediation because it is a lot of money to try to move through defy especially with tornado now you know in some way well they the the the the the hacker the hacker was pretty smart they put in the curve pool like those are the first transaction because I like the only thing you can do that is freeze the whole pool and I don't I don't I think like that's actually quite was quite common yes they were smart but you can still see like that that doesn't that doesn't prevent it's not cashing out right like you still need to somehow Cash Out sure uh somehow out of crypto and it's pretty easy to follow in a post tornado world so I think there's a good chance for recovery for at least some of the assets and finance they announced that they were on it um but I I I I feel like look losing 160 million [ __ ] sucks and for sure I agree with you look there we don't need to yell at them they're going to learn this lesson they've already learned a good a good chunk of it the fact that they are not a fund right they're a market maker they they raise Equity capital but they run their own money so for me it's like look there's no uh there's no um principal agent problem here right these guys are facing the 100 the brunt of the losses that they that they took and it's on them to fix it remediate it and and do things right yeah I I guess I'm more pointing out from the perspective I have a protocol a new online protocol and I'm like hey which Market maker should I go to like if someone I invest in like what Market makes I would just basically tell them never go to interview like they've proven that this is like a problem I don't know like you could argue that like look you shouldn't you shouldn't work with jump because John lost all this money in Wormhole and blah blah blah but then Wormhole like jump put the money back in Wormhole and it's all good so to me that's actually the strongest sign of strength if you [ __ ] up for 160 million and you make good on all your debts that's a strong sign that okay these guys are this is different than normal this is like there was an active cve for multiple weeks this is not like there is like a niche bug in in this complicated softer stack that happened like this was like something where there was so many like this is more like incompetence than it is like now like kind of like I I agree with that in that if you're running a hot wallet with 160 million dollars of funds or more than it manages you better be really careful about managing that hot wallet especially if it's a vanity hot wallet I mean I wouldn't use any address creation tool ever to make a wallet that stores a lot of money like maybe for you know a couple nfts it's fine right but like let alone using like an address generating tool you have a hot wallet that has 160 million dollars I was gonna say if you talk to any custodians who are like generating entropy for like an NPC ceremony or for they literally will like have a laptop like in a room that's like a faraday cage but and like absolutely no connectivity to generate the the initial entry and then like here we have the YOLO entropy right like and this is the kind of thing I'm saying like exchanges and custodians are very very careful about this type of stuff and they've built their business in the defense in the defense in the defense of wintermute right so they they said the reason why they use profanity was not because they wanted to look cool and generate the school address the reason why they did it was because they generate an address that had a large number of prefix zeros which actually is more gas optimized right and their whole thing is that look we we did this not for vanity but for optimization and of course premature optimization is the end I know right I know like the CV is I saw a good chart that was like yeah they saved like 16k in gas on the address and then they lost 160 million dollars um so yeah maybe not positive EBV on that unfortunately yeah I mean look we also we don't know that they didn't take profanity and go run it inside you know Faraday cage so you know like it's a client-side thing right so they they still have to generate the entropy client side um but yeah look terun you make a good point the the good thing here is that they lost their own money so it's the most you could hope for when somebody messes up is that they are completely internalizing the cost of their mistake which uh which you can't say for many other failures in crypto so for that reason that is the reason why for me I think it's very very different than something like Tara I I and I think the interesting thing that this has shown if we look over in the last two years is the new type of trading for you know like when electronic trading started say like pre-reg nms so like 2000. but it was like really starting to heat up it was like oh like you these new types of people entered Finance it looked very different than you also feel right like the 90s was like the math and physics phds but then like the 2000s was like all the heart well 2000 was really like software engineer like low-level software engineers and then 2010s like Hardware engineers and there's kind of at each stage of like finances like kind of increase in history like ads one new technical skill that like the next generation of trading firms have to have and clearly this has shown that like the cyber security offset type of thing is the next like high demand like Finance job that would be that would be my guess for the next 10 years unless there's startups and platforms that abstracted away for people like you should be able to plug in or trade in D5 without having to like become the world's best at cyber security like I think this is the gap and there's obviously a lot of startups like that are attempting to fill this Gap and like I'm bullish on this but like I guess my view is like you shouldn't have to be you know having like hard science inside like a trading firm you should be able to plug in to someone that can like incredibly securely give you access to any smart contract without you know private Key Management as long as these things are turning complete there's just no way we're going to get there anytime soon it's kind of like you know you could say like well why is it the trading firms need to have like Hardware Engineers working on you know optimizing fpgas and all this other stuff it's like well in some sense you can't be too prescriptive about what Financial should it be Finance is always going to find some way Finance also likes to vertically integrate right they don't like people at each firm like to Silo and like not you know and I feel like that's what's going to happen that's kind of what that will end up happening here but it's good it's like a good Evolution like people having these events means that people realize that they start by focusing on these things but there's always someone who takes a huge loss like there's always a ltcm of of like every new kind of financial world so maybe this is hopefully this is the maximum of that I kind of doubt it I mean every time like the next week There's an even bigger one yeah someone else is going to lose a lot more money at some point yeah if there if there is one bet to making crypto this is one thing that uh Kyle samani says a lot is that the the number one lesson in crypto is that basically people have the memory of goldfish and nobody ever learns anything really like if you can bake the lesson into the software then maybe you can solve it but if you can't do that you're you're screwed to repeat history and I think that's probably the case here well I learned this specific lesson in like 2013 when I tried to use like a website to make a Bitcoin paper wallet like siphon your address or whatever yeah never use never generated address you know unless it's in a faraday cage you know or it's on Hardware got it yeah that makes sense well it's been a week full of just kind of depressing bad stuff we haven't talked about anything positive has anything positive happened to any of you guys in crypto in the last week that we can end the show on well the merge was a success the ethereum blockchain is coming along it's incredible so That's the Silver that's great yeah I was up super late that night um I was on the east coast and so it was like 3 A.M that the merge finally went through and I was watching the I was watching the live stream of like you know all the Eve devs in Berlin and they were all just like everybody was like oh my God I can't believe it's really happening I got really choked up it was like a really special moment uh and then markets had to go on all of it the next day so but we can't have anything nice in crypto for longer than longer than a few hours that's not true you're just you're just you're just like wallowing in the the bear Market you should be we should be excited about all the new technologies people are working on instead of new dog coins yeah all right there's no new dog coins coming out right now which is that's a positive that's good that's that's up that's up no I actually saw I actually saw that there was Winter mute Eno uh was actually a token why why why must he do that to them we got to get of Guinea on the show we got to get him getting on the show I agree we need we need to defend his honor I think we need to get if gimme and tarun one-on-one get them to hug it out because it felt like there was uh I I didn't I didn't mean to just take it out just on them I've seen a bunch of these trading for mistakes and like I and then you see that you thought there's only one trading firm who's ever done legit attack it's a just-in-time liquidity attack where you add a bunch of uh unisoft LP position right so that I mean that all these people could say attack I'll produce a trade really opportunity but you can't flash loan it so you have to put up capital and it's actually quite hard to execute because you have to hedge the the price movement that's uh happens and like the people doing that you can like see that they're like churning addresses and doing all sorts of crazy stuff to hide themselves and like I think there are some people out there who are extremely confident at op Tech stuff like really really like very very confident and like I think those people will be the the firms that kind of win in the long run that's true to end the show I'd like to ask tarun a hypothetical question if you had a protocol with a treasury and you had to pick who to send it to either wintermute or three arrows capital in their treasury Management program Circa one year ago someone today had a shirt on the front said three areas Capital treasury Management on the backs of three hours Capital risk management so I thought that was pretty funny that's pretty good as long as we're talking about cool shirts I gotta uh wrap my shirt a little bit right now yeah no no actually it looked great um yeah look look if I only had those two options I would say winter music but honestly I'd rather pay out for the people I know who win the liquidation Wars because like those people are clearly the best like but they're not going to take your money that's the problem we'll do though they'll do Market making they're fine sure I'm taking they don't take external capital is what is what I mean but yeah you know yeah so you it's either it's either three heroes or you know you take you have to take what you can get man anyway anyway all right so to wrap up just real quick uh just because I've been this show has been such a downer one thing from each of us that you're excited about um I will I'll go first I'm really excited about ZK VMS coming to mainnet uh Tom what are you excited about uh this is kind of random but internet game launched this week and I've been playing and it's super fun it's like the most fun I've had playing a crypto game so everyone everyone should check it out it's like uh yeah it's been great which makes it fun it's good you know uh is this the thing where you win nfts it's like HQ like type yes yeah yeah yeah it makes it high stakes because it's like I bought this ticket and I I want to win you know the nft and so it's like there's there's skin in the game and people are getting really competitive about it and uh yeah it's a it's a it's a cool energy Robert what are you excited about I'm excited about compound V3 it's running it's pretty sweet it's going to grow it's it's humming it's new nice exciting tarun uh I'm excited about features in lending protocols like the compound V3 where the supply side and demand side rates are adjustable separately because that's will change some of the capital efficiency defect okay now let's leave it to tarun to find the most esoteric detail to get excited about that's great I love that cool all right well that is it for this week thank you everybody we'll be back next week I'm sure prices will be a lot higher than they are today not really I have no idea thanks everyone
