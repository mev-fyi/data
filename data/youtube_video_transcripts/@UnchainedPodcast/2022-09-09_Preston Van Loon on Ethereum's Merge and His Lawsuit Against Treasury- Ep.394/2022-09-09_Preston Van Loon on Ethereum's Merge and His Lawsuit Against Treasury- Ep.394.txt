recording ethereum's long-awaited merge is projected to occur sometime between Wednesday evening eastern time and Thursday morning this shift to proof of stake is certainly one of the most momentum uh transitions in ethereum's history at least from a technical perspective and you Preston have been working on what is currently the most popular client for the merge how are you feeling oh I'm feeling great really excited you know we've been working on this for many years and and the impacts and and benefits of of the merge are just it's just amazing to see it's finally here I think everyone's been waiting merge is coming soon since I don't know 2016 and and finally we're one week away is just incredible to see it so let's make sure that all the listeners are up to speed on what the merge is can you explain what's happening on a technical level yeah so the the merge in short is to switch from proof of work to proof of stake um how basically how ethereum comes to consensus on blocks in the blockchain the reason is called emerge is that we already launched the proof of stake side in uh another blockchain called The Beacon chain this is running you know alongside the proof of work chain and has been for I think about a year and a half since December of 2021 or 2020 a year and a half ago and uh the reason we did it that way so we really wanted to test it make sure it works uh that proof of stake as a concept and and the model that's been designed it's really going to work and now that we've been running it for for a considerable amount of time and sort of got it up to a scale that that has a large Economic Security with billions of stake say okay now it's time to do the switch so effectively we will take the beacon chain and merge it with the proof of work chain or the main chain of ethereum and effectively remove the the proof of work part there and use the proof of stake to come to the consensus on on the blockchain so if ethereum pulls this off what impact do you see it having on ethereum as well as the larger crypto space there are a lot of really important benefits to come to the switch of proof of stake so the one that we is probably the most evident is the efficiency gain right proof of work is is very expensive in terms of computation in terms of resources hardware and energy and now with the switch to you know proof of State there's there's not as much computational requirements so like I like to think about it as if you wanted to be a block producer today you know before the merge you you almost need an entire data center or a larger of Hardware a fleet of Hardware to to Hash enough information to come up with the right answer for for a block right you're doing a lot of work the proof of work part well now you know in proof of stake it's it's as simple as or it can be done on something as simple as a consumer grade Hardware like a laptop a lot of us have been running on a Raspberry Pi which is like a 80 piece of Hardware that you know middle schoolers use to Tinker with and and learn about computers right it's really cheap Hardware it costs nothing to run effective uh essentially cost for a little so that like that in itself is a really amazing trade-off that our benefit that comes with this and you know the energy that's hard to quantify but there there is some like reduction in carbon emissions which is really great that's not really why we're doing it but the Energy Efficiency is has a lot of benefits to it I think the other pieces that we like to highlight are that it makes it more decentralized right like in the example I just give you would need an entire data center to be a block producer or people usually do is they join a pool and pool of resources with others well now you as an individual with a minimal investment can be a block producer it can be a participant we just really lower that barrier to entry for for at-home sneakers for more individuals and you know make that pool of participants more decentralized because the the decentralized future is not you know three or four large organizations producing box it's a much larger group of people then the other part of this is that it makes ethereum a bit more predictable when it comes to block times with the proof of work the you know ethereum has like a 13 second block time and this is an a probabilistic average like it's not guaranteed that a box is going to come every 13 seconds well with proof of stay we have more of a time-based issuance of blocks every 12 seconds a block is due to be issued or produced by a validator so not only is that a slightly shorter time where you get approximately 10 percent more block space per day but it's also consistent right it's almost a guarantee as long as a participation is high near 100 then you're always going to get a buck every 12 seconds which really helps with estimations like if you are making a deposit and they say oh you need you need you know 30 bot confirmations well you know exactly how much time it's going to take and so earlier when you said that the environmental benefit isn't exactly why you're shifting to proof of stake is it for these other technical reasons that you outlined or what is the main driver yeah I think that when uh these uh cryptocurrencies were first developed and using proof of work I I don't think that we had or this you know that it was quite a picture the future how how big it would get and in terms of how much energy would be put in there so when you know ethereum was launched it always kind of had this quota switch to proof of stake uh and I think that at the time they weren't thinking about carbon emissions just that this makes a bit more sense in terms of Energy Efficiency and even with like renewable energies you know you you could argue those are bad energies better spent somewhere else but really like we talk about like what does ethereum care about as a platform well it aims to be scalable and decentralized and I think those aspects of switching to proof of state are really the main motivators here besides the Energy Efficiency is great and that makes a lot of sense but but to lower the barrier to entry increasing decentralization and increasing the economic security of the chain makes it more secure in that way it's much harder to attend back when you need a lot more Capital to do so obviously there have been a number of successful test merges so at this point it looks highly likely that this will also be a successful merge but just because we're not 100 sure I did want to ask what does the contingency plan if for whatever reason the merge does fail next week part of the process here is like building confidence you know what's taken us so long is that this this merge admittedly is very complex it has a lot of complexity right and with complexity there's more surface area for bugs more risk more things that could possibly go wrong but we have also kind of added in some some insurance there so things that could possibly go wrong or most likely would go wrong is that there's some kind of issue with the implementation of this of the software of the merge what ethereum has done and that their Community has done is that we've come out with five different implementations of the proof of stake side of things so that being an insurance policy is that okay well if one of those clients let's say prism doesn't work that's the one that I work on if it's just that doesn't work for some reason that we'll switch you know you have an option you can switch to another one and the great part about this is that we can push an idea called client diversity which means okay we have five clients and we're going to encourage people to use them such that the distribution is not very high so you have a larger diversity you know prison being the most popular client is just over a third of the networks so I think like 35 percent something like that so if it did completely halt well the chain could continue and people could you know quickly scramble to get to a new software carefully of course but but you have that insurance policy there now I think that you know this is pretty risky right and we have tested a lot and I really think it's it's going to go well however in you know the unlikely case of like it just doesn't work at all none of the clients work like the the the stars align and the Swiss cheese the lines and it just doesn't work well you know it's it's kind of hard to plan for that but I mean you could the proof of work side is still there like it's just a hard Fork right so it's not like we can stop anybody who continues to not to mine that and not upgrade right so I guess like the you know in the absolute worst case we just say okay well it didn't work let's keep going on the before chain and sort of figure out what to do next but again that's so unlikely that all of the clients don't work in the same way even after all this testing and even with the testing entropy of doing like Shadow Forks like we have four main net and done the merge many times and including all the like chaos that comes with the with ethereum you know we've simulated that and even copied that into into these tests so confidence is extremely high there's not a bit in me that believes that it will get to that point but you always say like okay well what if if you don't ask the question then you're not going to be prepared you'd have to have a plan to get out of your house if it's on fire even though you know it's never going to burn down you just got to know how to do it so we do think about that and we've kind of thought about all these uh different Avenues um but you know since it is like such a dynamic problem that you you can't really formulate a concrete plan you kind of just sort of say okay here's where we're at and we'll figure it out and that's who the ethereum community is pretty good at they've had plenty of times where things are not going well and they figured it out yeah just what you were describing reminded me of the Dos attacks from the fall of 2016 which I wrote about my book they there were different attacks and sometimes one of the attacks would Target like the death client and then other times it would be the parity client or whatever and so yeah they kept having to tell people you know switch to this other client very effective it worked to you know help ethereum survive that period okay so in a moment we're going to talk more about prism and Prismatic Labs but first a quick word from the sponsors who make the show possible the most anticipated crypto event of the year is back join us at mainnet 2022 happening this September 21st to 23rd in New York City connect with 4 000 plus crypto Builders and thought

get 25 with the code Laura Link in the description back to my conversation with Preston and so as we discussed you founded Prismatic labs and obviously you've been making prism just talk a little bit more about what these clients do and what you've been working on and also what the future of Prismatic Labs will be yeah you know we've been working on this um since the beginning of 2018. I I first discovered ethereum in 2017 and said oh this is a pretty cool idea but does the scale very well like token listings are are people where everyone's creating a token back then with their icos and I was like maxing out the chain gas prices were getting out of control the crypto kitties was crazy so we I started asking questions you know and and kind of saying how can I help make this techno this technology that I believed was really cool and and impactful how can I make it faster so we formed Raul Jordan and I formed in 2018 we kind of started working on just like a Moonlighting project is saying like I want to add sharding sharding being the the big scaling effort to increase throughput I want to add that to the go ethereum client which something we were familiar with and interested in and that evolved into okay well let's uh put a team together we met up in real life so okay let's put a team together uh we had got uh I think there were four of us or maybe five of us or other six of us originally we never met before and never contributed to ethereum anyway we're all just for interested I want to make impact so we make Prismatic Labs start working on a go ethereum sharding working closely with researchers so like vitalik and Justin Drake and and those guys hit the EF that were really responsible for formulating these ideas and we would help you know flush them out and discuss it if they're practically implemented and then try to do that so we started building you know prism and it's written in go so it's very similar to going through which kind of made sense uh when we wanted to merge it with that but as the ideas evolve to say okay we're going to have to have two blockchains here the beacon chain and uh three mainnet it became like a standalone client and the ideas were you know we'll do proof of stake in its own like world and then have that like reach consensus and then also uh validate and secure the proof work site the big problem we were having was that we couldn't figure out how to do proof of stake without paying gas within uh ethereum mainnet and we were worried that you know if gas prices were going high which they were doing all over the place that that could mean a liveness failure and that valuers who are not able to pay for the gas to to validate transactions to validate the blockchain so I had to think of another model and that's how it came up with this Beacon chain idea uh and and so so far the beacon chain has been doing it extremely well it's uh not had any major issues it's been live perfect liveness the entire time with this concept of finality which is really really nice um so I guess like what's uh the future right prism Prismatic Labs we still have a lot of work to do we think with the ethereum core protocol the room has this great vision to be or possibility to be a global settlement layer to really be something we can all use but to I think to reach this scale there's a lot of work to do primarily being we still haven't done the sharding part that we've kind of set out to do four years ago it's mostly beyond our proof of stake and getting things ready for that well in the next uh I'd say like two to three years so that's really what we work on there's ideas like ink sharding protein sharding uh EIP 4844 which is to do data availability charting for Roll-Ups and Roll-Ups being like layer twos that can really bring this you know like scaling transaction throughput to ethereum where ethereum is doing 10 transactions per second well Roll-Ups can basically 100x fat you know guarantees that ethereum gives you some data availability so we give more data space this could be more space for Roll-Ups and stuff like that so that's kind of our immediate future the next couple years for prismatic labs to focus more on on scaling and sharding yeah and that's really like Prismatic labs and of course there are a lot of other teams in the community like a one of five that does the proof of stake side but uh I think that's like the the road map is coming up at least for us so First Medical this is working on the this scaling part again and sharding in particular and how big is your team now because I know for instance after the initial ethereum launch then the team's working on the clients like you know Geth and parody they you know had to keep uh making upgrades and all that so are you expanding in order to kind of take on this new task or yeah we have uh thankfully been funded from you know the ethereum foundation um others in the community uh get coin grants right people are we're open source public goods project and we've been thankful to receive enough funding that we're now 11 people and with being 11 people it's it's enough that we can maintain the client in its day and also be working on the new features I think that we could always use more people right and and we encourage open source contributors to come take a look to break things ask questions to even just read the code and if it's not making sense that there's probably opportunity to to clean that up but with that said you know we're a pretty good team size and we've been working well at this size I feel like once you get over 10 people you start to have some scaling problems internally is hierarchy and you need managers and all this kind of stuff so we're like the sweet spot of the size and we're feeling like okay we're not totally drowning at work we're still getting things done uh shipping things on time and yeah so yeah and uh one thing I wanted to say earlier too is I just love how you know with you and your co-founders you guys had not really contributed to a theory before and now obviously hugely important to this momentous shift happening in ethereum which is just something in general that I loved about I love about the crypto space because you know I think a lot of people get into crypto and yeah they have nothing and uh it's very open space and so people can really make something of themselves one thing I wanted to ask you about was I'm sure you're aware that there are these miners that are threatening to Fork the proof of work chain you mentioned that you know obviously it's still not clear whether this is definitely going to happen but I just you know was curious for your take on on that movement I have been seeing that as well ideas about like continuing the preferred chain like purposely removing difficulty bomb changing the way feet guest fees are burned or gas is burned like EAP 1559 I don't really understand I guess I do understand it's like some of the motives but in general like I I just don't really see a future for it again you know I'm a core developer where I I really understand like the code the logic and the things that go with it I'm not a Trader investor or anything of that sort so I can appreciate that some people might find some value in a chain like that but I really don't you know see a long term long term being a thing but you know people said that about youth Classics so I don't know you know what what's what's gonna happen but um you know I was looking at the code they have like a fork of go ethereum it doesn't look ready I mean there's still a week to go and they're they're kind of it seems like they're kind of planning to do their for after the merge like maybe a week after the merge it's also seems kind of strange you'd think that like you'd be an instantaneous like when the merch happens there's one chain and there's another and the other one's the other one but they're almost like branching off of the what the merge is branching off of and making a sort of like a third fork and calling it something else so I would just say like okay well if you if the merch wasn't happening and somebody did that would you want to be a part of it and what's happening to defy on there it's just gonna it's gonna be chaos so I personally I I won't I won't use it or endorse it but I I can appreciate that this is a diverse space and people can do whatever they want and that's really like blockchain and and this contract is great because you know who's who can stop you no it can stop you so that's great all right last question for the users out there who are waiting for lower gas fees and more blog space what would you say to them I would say that is coming soon yeah we would say coming soon for song But at the merch you get like this like a very small Improvement 10 10 more box space not really you're not really going to feel it a whole lot you're not going to feel much with the merge it is top of mind after the merge we're thinking about uh withdrawals you know validators have been at stake indefinitely since the beginning so maybe it's time for withdrawals to be enabled transfers and then it's in in in around the same time it's also like getting back to the scaling part so making throughput faster and all these kind of things but if you're looking for I don't know if you're looking for some relief right now well there there are solutions to Layer Two so it's a lot of great other two options out there there's a lot of great like D5 activity or or nft activity or really what you want to do on the main chain you probably can find the same projects have deployed to multiple of the layer two roll-up chains um so they're they're and and some of them have extremely low fees with the same security that ethereum has so definitely check that out yesterday news broke that coinbase was funding a lawsuit against the treasury Department over the tornado cash sanctions and it turns out that you are one of the plaintiffs can you explain what motivated you to do that and what you think the significance will be you know can we talk a little bit about uh active case but the basis of it is that the code that powers tornado cash is speech who's been established a code of speech and we think that the sanctions that ofak has put on here is effectively putting a a sensor on Free Speech I think that's wrong so I've you know joined in this lawsuit with a few others and with the help of coinbase and our goal is here is to try to get that overturned we're not really seeking any like bunny or anything uh I do have some ether that's trapped in there you know I can't take it out or be face for sanctions violations but really the goal is to get that reversed and say you know code is speech and free speech is a constitutional right and so ideally then it would only be addresses that would be sanctioned rather than the contracts themselves is that sort of the outcome that you're hoping for yeah I don't know about that I I can't really comment on too many details I've been told I can't say too much but you know that's we we do think that the Free Speech part of it is important and really want to get that part of it overturned all right so before we go assuming that the merge is successful how will you celebrate um I think yeah if it goes really well I'm gonna have a really great night's sleep I think that's gonna be the one of the first things there's been a long journey to get here and and and we really wanted to go well and yeah we'll definitely have a drink or two and celebrate and maybe party but it I not right away right it's good my vision is going to go well and then like maybe after a couple days I could really say okay it went well and it's still going well and things are good so definitely looking forward to it okay yeah I guess there's no fast finality for the merge it's like it's kind of a long game too it's like it has a lot of things it wants to solve that you can't even really quantify for for some time so yeah all right well good work so far we look forward to seeing how it all plays out thanks so much for coming on Unchained yeah thanks for having me don't forget next up is the Weekly News recap stick around for this weekend crypto after this short break to swap crypto a user has to choose among

funds lawsuit against treasury over tornado cash sanctions as mentioned earlier in the episode on Thursday six tornado cash users including Preston Van Loon filed a lawsuit against the treasury Department their legal fees will be covered by coinbase coinbase's Chief legal officer Paul gruel told CNBC he is worried about the legal precedence that these sanctions are setting he said if this code can be designated without any limits imposed by law any technology any tool or system could be fair game ever since the sanctions there's been uncertainty around what U.S based institutions will do after the merge such as whether they would validate or attest to blocks with transactions involving sanctioned addresses however this week girls said that coinbase believes validators are not compelled to censor transactions the merge sparked some defy disruptions and new business opportunities ahead of the merge D5 protocol Ave decided to temporarily halt loans of ether the decision was made by the Ave Community which was worried that people would increasingly borrow eth in order to receive any coins from a potential post-merge proof-of-work version of ethereum the excessive borrowing could cause a liquidity crisis decentralized applications are not the only ones moving fast before the merge this week binance us enabled high-yield staking offering a six percent apy for U.S users in addition Swiss crypto Bank seba also announced its own ethereum staking services on Wednesday for institutional investors ethereum miners are re-allocating resources with emerge the ethereum mainnet will transition from approval work to approve of State consensus algorithm but that doesn't mean that ether miners are going to have to waste all their computing power for instance crypto minor Hive blockchain is exploring other mining Alternatives the company which is reportedly mining 350 000 worth of bitcoin and ether day is testing other proof of work chains but hasn't confirmed which ones specifically however HUD 8 mining group decided to take a different path as it will desist from Mining and re-allocate its resources to machine learning and artificial intelligence this week ethereum Classics hash rate hit an all-time high which indicates that miners may be shifting their computing power there in addition london-based firm Etc group announced that it would support a proof-of-work version of ethereum if one exists post-merge is the White House against proof of work the White House released a report called climate and energy implications of crypto Assets in the United States in which it claims that crypto assets could hinder broader efforts to achieve Net Zero carbon pollution consistent with U.S climate commitments and goals the report said some crypto asset Technologies currently require a considerable amount of electricity for asset generation ownership and exchange electricity usage from digital assets is contributing to greenhouse gas emissions additional pollution noise and other local impacts depending on markets policies and local electricity sources it urged federal agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the department of energy among others to minimize the environmental impacts of crypto assets ensure energy reliability obtain data to monitor the impacts Advance Energy Efficiency standards and other measures the crypto market cap drops below 1 trillion dollars and vitalik has concerns about BTC on Wednesday Bitcoin fell below the nineteen thousand dollar Mark dragging the crypto market cap down to less than one trillion dollars once again BTC and Eve hit a weekly low of 18 644 dollars and fifteen hundred dollars respectively according to coin market cap the eth BTC ratio which tracks the performance of ether against Bitcoin reached a yearly high this week showing that investors are more confident in ethereum in an interview with economics writer Noah Smith ethereum's founder vitalik buterin said he has two concerns for BTC first he claimed that Bitcoin can't rely solely on transaction fees to secure the network this will happen when the block rewards are phased out sometime around the year 2140. he said Bitcoin is just not succeeding at getting the level of fee Revenue required to secure what could be a multi-trillion dollar system Bitcoin fees are about three hundred thousand dollars per day and haven't really grown that much over the last five years second he said that proof of stake is more efficient than proof of work and he is worried that the Bitcoin Community doesn't want to make that transition but Celsius a Ponzi scheme according to a filing from the Vermont Department of Financial regulation crypto lenders Celsius used new investor funds to repay old investors a technique most commonly known as a Ponzi scheme Celsius is currently going through bankruptcy proceedings and the report from the Vermont Department analyzed how the company was managed the filing said during the course of the multi-state investigation it has become clear that Celsius through its CEO Alex machinski and otherwise made false and misleading claims to investors about inter Alia the company's Financial Health and its compliance with Securities laws both of which likely induced retail investors to invest in Celsius or to leave their investments in Celsius despite concerns about the volatility of the cryptocurrency market furthermore Celsius is being accused of manipulating the price of its token Cel to boost its balance sheet some Celsius borrowers are asking the bankruptcy court to appoint an independent examiner to look into celsius's financials however they don't want one employed by the U.S trustee office as they are concerned about the delay it would cause in the resolution of the case Celsius is expecting a cash injection of 70 million dollars from loan repayments according to Kirkland and Ellis a law firm in charge of the company's restructuring These funds will help Celsius meet its operational expenses for 2022. speaking of troubled crypto companies Poland wallet the wallet service of one of the world's biggest Bitcoin mining pools suspended withdrawals amidst a liquidity crisis Kevin Pan the firm's CEO and founder assured users that the assets were safe crypto broker Voyager digital will hold an asset auction on September 13th as part of its bankruptcy proceedings the results of the auction will be approved at a hearing to be held on September 29th coinbase makes a controversial proposal on maker Dow coinbase the largest cryptocurrency Exchange in the US offered makerdale a business proposal to access 24 million dollars in yearly Revenue the company posted a governance proposal on the makerdale Forum to have the protocol deposit 1.6 billion dollars worth of usdc and coinbase prime the exchange's institutional platform in return for a 1.5 annual yield which would be about 24 million dollars the drama around this proposal is that it would push maker further towards the centralization side of the spectrum something that its own founder has been trying to fight the community is divided on coinbase's Proposal with some arguing that it would boost makers Revenue While others saying that die and maker will end up in the hands of coinbase Finance removes usdc but circle is not worried binance the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange announced it will remove usdc and some other stable coins as tradable assets from its platform on September 29th the platform will automatically convert any usdc usdp and TUSD tokens into its own stablecoin busd at a one-to-one ratio two enhanced liquidity and capital efficiency for users of getting gay boy founder and CEO of wintermute tweeted removing most stablecoin pairs is a good thing it's not usdc d-listing it's another big step towards tether losing ground to U.S native stable coins Jeremy Lair the CEO of circle the issuer of usdc doesn't seem worried he said given how limited busd usage is outside of binance this will likely benefit ustc as the preferred cross CeX and deex stablecoin rail unless binance can convince all their competitors to get behind busd unlikely the FED wants stablecoin regulation but it may have to wait speaking of stable coins three different Federal Reserve officials Federal Reserve board chair Jerome Powell fed Vice chair for supervision Michael Barr and fed Vice chair Leon Brainerd push for stablecoin regulation at three separate conferences this week as Powell said at Aikido Institute conference I think you need regulation if people are going to think something is money it needs to have the qualities of money I don't think you want to take money and make it into just another consumer product however coindesk regulation and policy reporter Nicholas Day wrote in a column that although it had been expected that stablecoin regulation might be adopted this year that's currently looking unlikely a number of issues such as the role of State regulators and the possibility of a digital dollar among other items remained to be ironed out time for fun bits a violin soundtrack for the rainbow model over the past few years there's been plenty of analysts trying to come up with models to predict the price of BTC but there's one that's become a meme on Twitter Eric Wall's rainbow chart the mock model for the Bitcoin price it is basically a rainbow indicating when BTC is cheap to buy or in the model's words basically a fire sale even though it is a made-up model the price of Bitcoin has never fallen below the lowest band on the rainbow while a crypto analyst and writer posted a hilarious video on Twitter showing how closely the rainbow model was to failing against a clip from the movie Titanic in this scene the boat is sinking and the violinists play their last song because it looked like the model was just about to fail while superimposed the rainbow chart on top a sort of anticipatory elegy hours before the daily BTC candle closed he tweeted summoning a VTC USD daily close that will save the rainbow moments later BTC rebound and the model didn't break that Wall's Twitter bio reads you can't predict the price of Bitcoin with a rainbow you idiot thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about Preston and the merge check out the show
