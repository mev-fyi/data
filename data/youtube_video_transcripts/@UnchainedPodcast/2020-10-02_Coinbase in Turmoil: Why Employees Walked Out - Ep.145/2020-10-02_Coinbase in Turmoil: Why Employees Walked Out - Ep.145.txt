thanks so much for having me on so great to be back it's great to have you coinbase has been a major topic of discussion this week not only in the crypto world but also in the wider world of tech business and politics why don't you give us a recap of what happened it's it's been a major reason for why i haven't gotten any sleep this week as well but um yeah just basically to recap on sunday brian armstrong the ceo of coinbase released a blog outlining um effectively his apolitical vision or anti-social activist vision for coinbase as a firm a very mission driven sort of um mission for uh a very product driven mission for the company effectively and so obviously that kind of set the crypto and tech world um more broadly uh uh a flame with different um perspectives on whether or not that's sort of the right course of action for a company that's so public facing like coinbase to take a company that could in many ways drive um you know messages of social justice and and black lives matter to um large audiences um and so lots of debates around that lots of coverage in mainstream and crypto media alike about you know what this means for coinbase and and from a um you know companies perspective and and from the perspective of whether or not it will result in in folks leaving and then on tuesday the night of the debate um literally right after the debate ended um i got an email from a source uh which was basically the email that brian armstrong sent out to employees saying listen if you are uncomfortable with this with this new mission or the way that we sort of outline the mission um perfectly fine we will um give you a very generous honestly package uh severance package to then leave the company which you have until next week to consider um so that was tuesday wednesday obviously you know still this was in the in the media being talked about on twitter and definitely being talked about at coinbase internally in in various slack channels and then today they had an ama discussing this and and i put out i'm in the process of putting out a report that's gonna walk through this timeline uh an ama addressing all the stuff that's been going on this week and then as you know uh some of the attention has been sucked away by quote-unquote rival not necessarily a rival bit max getting slapped with charges from the department of justice so that's been the week in a nutshell that's been what we've seen in a nutshell and it's been it's been interesting it's it's but not necessarily unsurprising so you mentioned social justice in black lives matter were those the specific social and or political issues that employees at coinbase wanted the company to take a stand on or or you know take action on or were there other issues because obviously with we've seen with twitter and facebook that there's also a lot of talk in the in the tech world about what companies roles are in um you know managing misinformation and i know coinbase isn't in the business of misinformation but there is a lot of talk about how tech companies what their actions can do in terms of our democracy and there's a lot of there's a lot of talk around this election right like let's let's not forget that we are just a few few weeks away from what what many would consider one of the most um important elections of our generation um of many people's lifetimes maybe and so there is probably just uh just as there there is this this sentiment at many other companies of how do we you know take action how do we provide employees with the right tools to go vote to make their voices heard and to have an impact on on this decisive election so those were the issues that coinbase or what were specifically the ones that appointed i'm just saying i wouldn't be surprised if that was sort of something that was underpinning this this this blog that brian felt like he needed to put out on sunday now rewinding the clock and this is what my report gets at this isn't this isn't an isolated thing that happened on sunday and if you go and wind the clock back to this summer okay and this was hinted at in brian's blog but not explicitly talked about back in june um there was an ama and you know this from covering coinbase through your own reporting that they have these amas where employees can submit questions and ask company management senior leadership about a myriad of things from you know personal preferences of ice cream i don't know if that's ever been asked but that could be an example too to you know thoughts about company um product launches to you know other personal and business questions alike and so someone asked um according to several sources a question about brian's view on black lives matter okay and so that kind of resulted in him i wouldn't say rebuffing the question but there one source described him as not necessarily being uh not necessarily knowing if the person was asking about black lives matter the movement or black lives matter the specific organization and kind of saying like i'm not ready to talk about this and so what that ended up resulting in was a walkout in brian's post he describes their being new walkouts plural um not necessarily sure if that's because obviously we're in this decentralized uh work working situation where um none of us are in offices so people basically you know walk out turn their computers off and sign off for the day so that's been brewing since june right this question of whether or not coinbase should take a definitive um uh make a definitive statement in in support of black lives matter and so that and just to be clear he did tweet from his personal account oh that's what you're gonna say yeah so that next day as a result of sort of all of this you know all this commotion i guess for lack of a better word he then did go out and tweet that he definitively supports black lives matter as a movement supporting the idea that you know um black lives as a result of of of the state of african americans in this country need to sort of be recognized and uplifted to an extent and then he had a pretty long tweet thread um outlining that and and in that tweet thread as well i think i think i'm not 100 sure he mentioned the walkouts as well so it's kind of been a long at least from my understanding a long um thread also underpinning it like aside from the issue specifically like there's a question or or an interesting point to be made about brian himself and like i'm sure you also can like speak to this given your your previous coverage uh in 2014 there was a bloomberg article that described him and fred as these um vulcan bankers right like you know very not the most gregarious characters that you'd come across and and very serious and like brian i was talking to a source about this like basically an hour and a half ago um brian is someone who probably like wanted to build the most used most important product in crypto but not run the largest most important company in crypto and so i think that also undergirds this this like situation where i'm sure brian is like a fairly nice guy and like i i take i'm sure you know his sympathy or concern about certain social justice issues could could be legitimate but he like wants to build coinbase like he wants to build this company um and so you know what's so funny about that yeah i have a feeling i know which source said that to you but anyway we'll check about that later we can check after the show yeah um but yeah so that's that's that's basically where we're at with this i've just been surprised and i'm sure i don't know how surprised i am i no i am surprised that it's gotten so much attention um i think maybe because of the language of the blog and the language of the email and apparently that's been another thing that's been discussed in in the ama today and just generally internally is and and this is probably not surprising like did we were this right and and and that's obviously evident in the fact that they've changed some of the language in the post right so originally there was a reference made a kind of like strange reference um some would say to brianna taylor in which they sort of talk about like the events regarding um you know recent events as opposed to like you know this this tragedy someone probably want more passionate language and so there's been talks about whether or not the language in these two documents um uh were were appropriate um and i think it's not so much about what's going on maybe internally at coinbase that that people are reacting to but these two you know this this blog post and then this email right which are really kind of coldly written people might argue right um and so that's what i'm sort of like been thinking about in these past few days yeah so in a moment we're going to talk more about the reaction to this but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible

offers until the end of september back to my conversation with frank chaparro yeah i actually just want to call out maybe some of the quotes from the original post just to give people a sense and um you know as you kind of mentioned some people maybe weren't surprised to hear these things from brian and you know for me you know i've been interviewing brian himself as well as people who work closely with brian now for five years and yeah i mean i could practically hear him saying these things yeah yeah sorry i didn't mean to interrupt but like you can like if you've heard this guy speak you you can totally see him saying this in a non-malicious way exactly like this this was just 100 the dna of brian um you know things like he talked about how coinbase's mission was to build an open financial system for the world and said for instance like you know some people interpreted the mission more broadly and so now i'm quoting to include all forms of equality and justice it makes sense if you believe that economic freedom is not possible without equality for all people others interpreted the mission more narrowly believing that we were trying to create infrastructure for the crypto economy and that yes this would create more equality of access for all people but we weren't trying to solve all forms of inequality in the world the narrower interpretation is how i intended the mission to be understood and this is this is like brian you know from 2015 to 2016 to 2017 to 2018 2019 and now to today this is the same brian he says quote i don't think companies can succeed trying to do everything creating an open financial system for the world is already a hugely ambitious mission and we could easily spend the next decade or two trying to move the needle on global economic freedom he's very much the like i have a huge goal and in order to you know make that goal happen accomplish that i have to focus only on that you know he's famous for the headphones rule only wearing the headphones in office or wearing the headphones in the office and then if you are wearing them nobody can interrupt you that kind of thing um but let's talk a little bit about the reaction to this um it was pretty divided you know i saw paul graham of y combinator tweet yet again brian armstrong leads the way i predict most successful companies will follow coinbase's lead on the other hand matthew green a cryptography professor at johns hopkins tweeted the coinbase post genuinely makes it harder for me to recommend that my students work there and then the most interesting one actually came from twitter ceo jack dorsey who tweeted bitcoin aka crypto is direct activism against an unverifiable and exclusionary financial system which negatively affects so much of our society important to at least acknowledge and connect the related societal issues your customer face daily this leaves people behind and then he linked to the blog post so i wondered what did you make of of the reaction i think it makes sense in light of the fact that a lot of people who probably vaguely know of coinbase don't really know that much about brian right and so they don't have that that context of of of his sort of demeanor and the way that he kind of views um his role within the company and the crypto ecosystem more broadly like it's it's not even that like brian um is disinterested in in you know issues of social justice like he is not someone who is even going out and talking about some of these more crypto native topics on a regular basis like someone like you know i don't know maybe mike novogratz for instance right like he rarely does interviews he rarely is sort of speaking at conferences and panels and so to to sort of like um you know which is maybe dissimilar from a lot of other like executives right who who kind of come out and say these things so that kind of kind of made sense um or kind of what i was thinking and i i guess like a lot of it i thought was just fueled by just this broader sort of political discourse of of of the election coming on the horizon and this this broader push among many different companies and i think i shared you this dm this morning you know esg has gripped markets and and many companies across the world remind people what esg is yeah so we're talking about like these um environmental um sustainability governance goals that um are becoming increasingly more important not just to um investors but to to broader financial services companies you know they they it's not just about like okay you're not a tobacco company anymore um it's not just about like are you a tobacco company are you a gambling company are you you know what they call a sin company like you need to start like hitting the bar even higher and like passing there was an article in the ft this morning that talked about like passing these positivity tests like you need to be actively doing things and so there's this dichotomy in the world and and it i i see it in my dms and in my mentions of you know is being apolitical good or is it bad and so a lot of the tech world has has kind of moved towards the direction of being a being just like inactive politically is is sort of political and of itself and bad and you have a similar sentiment on wall street where this idea of if you're not like contributing to the greater good and what the greater good is you know the definition is a little flimsy it's not something that um you know many people would say is objective right and so um that's kind of at the heart of of this controversy as well is well you know why aren't you taking a stand why aren't you being political whereas other people are saying this is exactly right you know some people um i i tweeted this the other day um i've never uh it was um in the midst of of all this so many people who were giddy that brian had did this and sort of set the line and set a tone for for future founders and ceos to kind of just like say hey like i care about building i care about creating a strong business and unless let's not forget that they potentially have an ipo on the horizon so meaning they have a financial incentive to not take a stand is that what you're saying meaning that they have a financial incentive to like focus on like building product and not like being concerned about um what what brian might might deem peripheral issues um because you know you gotta hit revenues and you gotta hit uh the expectations of the street um so that might that might be playing into it as well um so let's now talk about the offer of the exit packages for people who aren't comfortable with this a political stance and as you mentioned it's really generous four months of severance for employees with less than three years tenure six months for those who have been there more than three years six months of cobra and a seven year option exercise window why do you think they decided to go with something so generous and and also to offer this in the first place this is totally my speculation i don't i actually haven't like talked to people inside of coinbase about this but there is a gentleman that they hired um so elky brock is the chief people officer at coinbase he was at citadel security citadel um the the affiliated firm of citadel the hedge fund or maybe he was at the hedge fund in any case citadel who is you know obviously that's the firm that's sort of run by ken griffins and you know the billionaire hedge fund um chicago guy citadel has a strong history um a well-known history on the street of just having high turnover right and sort of like being a sort of like you're they're in it to win it at citadel if you're not then sayonara you know you don't need to be here and so i i wouldn't be surprised if like a lot of this memo was influenced by lj brock and and this maybe citadel-like mindset but that is total speculation um historically coinbase to be fair has had great benefits you know very high salaries very impressive benefit like fertility benefits um for for for women at the firm so maybe it's a mix of that um but certainly like everyone i talk to and everyone commenting on twitter right they saw this and and didn't believe it we didn't believe it either at the block when we first got this anonymous they were like there's no way that they're just gonna be giving away money to people when in fact they uh they clearly are yeah well it's probably one of those calculations where um they feel that they'll get uh that that it's worth it's worth it to spend the money to to get a team that is 100 aligned on their mission um and do you have a sense of how many people will be taking the severance package no that's a good question um i have a sense of like like i said earlier um of how many people will probably be leaving i imagine i i don't know if like everyone here's the here's the way you said that to me privately so can you just say it for the show oh that's right so like it's it's not clear like the the the parameters around which people will accept these packages so you know whether or not they'll have to sign an nda or etc so my sense of the number of people leaving is around you know maybe one to two dozen maybe maybe upwards to like 50 people is my sense and then of of those people those that will sort of take this package which could include things maybe not delineated in the email right because it's like hey we'll talk about this through rachel so um that that remains to be seen the exact number who will take this package but i would expect personally my sources described a lower number but i think probably more than 50 would leave well okay yeah and um there also wasn't all hands today the day that we're recording which is thursday do you have a sense of what happened or what people at least plan to say if you don't know what actually happened there were a few different um i mean obviously it was it was basically to discuss some of the controversy in the um that one slack channel i was talking about just the sort of um the vitriol and high emotions and contentious sort of discourse that was taking place and just about like the general reaction to um the blog post that went out and like the sort of way that the way in which coinbase has communicated these points have all been up for discussion during this ama some people described it in many different ways like i it's it's been interesting to sort of like kind of can condense what i've been hearing you know there are some real gritty like wall street types at the firm obviously who like just are so kind of let's just get through this like why why is it so emotional some people have described it as boring some people have described it as completely chaotic right it really depends on your vantage point um but it's certainly uh interesting okay all right so let's also now just cover the other huge news this week very quickly because i saw that you tweeted about um you know the bitmex news about how the owners have been charged by the cftc and doj with running an illegal crypto derivatives exchange and for um allowing money laundering on their platform and you tweeted that you had just spoken on the phone with ceo and co-founder arthur hayes last night what did you guys talk about and did he seem to have any awareness this was coming it's a really good question i mean like like i said before we turned the mics on i was you know finishing up a long day and and obviously it's morning time in hong kong when it's nighttime here in new york um and so it was a run-of-the-mill um you know prep call for a podcast you know i'm sure you've done a few of those um he was supposed to come on tonight in three hours time and i will say in hindsight um you know not to say that arthur wasn't his usual funny self he was gregarious he was um you know charming but his answers were shorter than any interview that i've seen him do like kind of just like to the point the um his communication representatives were all there and like we were just trying to get a sense of like some of the things we we would talk about on a show and you know my thinking was well let me like ask you some questions to like see how you would answer them so then like you know just like when we came on before you kind of asked me about my report so i could get so you could get a sense of like maybe um how to better frame your your questions and so that was like kind of the idea and he was basically normal but in you know he was he was his usual self to aside from maybe the fact that his question seemed a little like um the opposite of me i can ramble on and on all day i'm just very maybe a little bit shorter than than normally but that could have just been because he finished a 60-mile bike ride you know i asked him you know what were you doing before this and he goes just finished up 60 miles uh biking and so you know classic arthur uh you know response right and i'm just like okay i'm like literally laying in bed um in my pajamas um but you know fair enough yeah that is sorry we talked about um you know we talked about a lot of the recent developments obviously bitmex has been you know in the headlines more um they've almost become sleepy frankly like in the past aside from like after the 2019 cftc uh uh bloomberg article rather that broke that the cftc was investigating them like you know they have you know they're not like ftx right they're not like finance where they're launching all these products and you know making crypto coindesk the block headlines every day they're kind of just like oh i remember bit max from 2017 and from the lambos parked out of consensus um and then they wrote that kyc right and so they've been trying to button themselves up from everything i can tell i don't know if you've engaged with them in the past like six months but they work with edelman now and and like you know are very much trying to communicate in a more i don't know if refines the best word but kind of like really solidified this message and they've re um they they they kind of did a restructuring of the parent company so um the original question you asked was whether or not if arthur seemed like he had a sense of what was coming yes maybe but just looking more at a high level like you have seen the firm kind of like taking these different steps that maybe indicate that or or do indicate that something like this was coming yeah yeah yeah looking back at it you know i mean i i think yeah i sort of had a feeling like because why would they start doing all these things after they've been in existence for six years you know yeah so anyway well we will see what happens i'm sure we'll see yeah a lot more to to discuss on that um but we'll do it another time well maybe when maybe when um if if arthur gets back on whether or not he'll do he was supposed to come on the podcast tonight we can have you on and we could do like a co we can talk about yogi um for listeners i was just telling them that um arthur and i both are really into yoga and so so uh that makes him quite similar to a lot of people in my normal real life like my real-life friends [Laughter] but anyway okay well this has been hugely informative um thank you so much for doing this and i would love to talk with you and arthur that would be great um so thanks so much for coming in unconfirmed thanks so much laura talk to you soon cheers don't forget next up is the weekly news recap stick around for this week in crypto after this
