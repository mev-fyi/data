Louis welcome David hey Laura how you doing I'm interested to hear your background because you obviously work at the Federal Reserve but you are also quite a prolific author and speaker on blockchain and cryptocurrency so tell us how you came to be in this role right sure so my background is actually as an academic economist I spent about 20 years in academia and moved to the Federal Reserve Bank of st. Louis in the research division where I got to basically apply the the theories that I was studying and I learned as an academic that involved primarily monetary policy banking financial stability payments etc and so when you know this this new phenomenon emerged quite naturally became very interested in this this kind of alternative type of money and payment system so I've been basically keeping an eye on it ever since it's not part of my official job description here's kind of just more of like a hobby something that I keep an eye on and in and try to see how it relates to things I've seen happen to foreign history and also whether or not any of this emergent technology has any you know monetary policy implications going forward and so how did you hear about Bitcoin and blockchain and I'll say why do you think that they really caught your interest other than you know the fact that it you know is sort of in your professional sphere yeah well you know I as a bit of an historian of monetary policy and monetary developments you know I was aware that there have been many many attempts in the past of you know private currency issuance or non-government currency issuance and that when I first heard about Bitcoin I think I think I probably heard it heard about it kind of referred to you know kind of people were very very skeptical at the time you know calling it a scam I mean I think Paul Krugman famously wrote something on it that that intrigued me and so I think if I recall correctly I mean that's you know five or six years ago now maybe longer but I decided to peek under the hood to see what all the fuss was about and I quickly it didn't take me too long to realize that there was actually something quite interesting something quite novel about this this new innovation and that's just basically how I got started in in studying the phenomenon and in kind of researching it and I continue to do that today so before we get into the meat of our discussion which is going to be pretty wide-ranging and really interesting I just want to make sure that the listeners kind of understand essentially like what the Federal Reserve does and also what the different Regional Federal Reserve banks do and also the role of commercial banks so can you just sort of talk generally about you know how all of that works oh yeah sure so the the Federal Reserve was founded in 1913 it was founded after the United States had experienced a number of severe panics in the latter part of the 19th century financial panics and one of the big ones happened in 1907 and and what was decided at the time was that you know this this type of very very you know unstable kind of financial structure needed some sort of backstop some sort of government-sponsored Bank to kind of help stabilize the financial system there were attempts in the in the past two other attempts that the first and second national banks in the United States that failed to get their charters renewed the Fed was established as kind of very is a very unique kind of creatures kind of like this public-private sector partnership it's not completely public it's not completely private it's kind of this a mix and you know just the the Fed was basically designed to basically be there as a backstop into service kind of a lender of last resort to provide an elastic currency as the phrase was used at the time and and since then it's it's evolved over time you know to play a major role in facilitating payments in in the in the United States it played a big role in in in in and clearing checks for example and also there's that part of the Federal Reserve that is responsible it has congressional mandates to use the powers that it has to fulfill its congressional mandates of price price stability and in full employment and so the Federal Open Market Committee is responsible for that and that committee consists of the twelve regional fed presidents plus seven representatives at the Board of Governors and basically this is you probably most most of your listeners are probably aware of that part of the Fed where where were the FOMC the Federal Open Market Committee makes decisions about the path of interest rates in the economy to help regulate inflation in economic activity according to the congressional mandates that it has and can you also elaborate on the role that commercial banks play in the pinking system sure commercial banks I mean there's a lot of them in the United States you know thousands of them and these commercial banks all have accounts with the Federal Reserve Bank in fact they they are basically digital currency accounts fed wire for example is a real-time gross settlement system that the commercial banks used to clear payments with each other so this is kind of interesting in of itself in the context of the talk today because as we speak you know for a long time we already have had a central bank did currency but it's been restricted basically to the commercial banks so the Fed plays a major role in facilitating payments across banks as they you know help facilitate payments that occur in the in the in the private sector so when you go and you make a payment to the Starbucks merchant you know your account is debited the account of the merchant is credited there's got to be a flow of funds from the two accounts what's happening in the background is that Federal Reserve funds are flowing from your bank to Starbucks bank and that happens it happens through these back channels in the payment system all right so this sets enough of a stage for getting into the meat of the discussion where we're going to talk about all the different ways that developments in the crypto and blockchain world are sort of intersecting with your world let's talk first about probably the biggest news of this year which is Libra what do you think of the Libra proposal it's intriguing I mean there's been a lot of proposed this is not you this is not you by any means there's been a lot of proposals in the past to create Libra like objects the Special Drawing right at the IMF the International money fund is an example of this type of Libra and that although that has limited access there have been many proposals in the past to do it as well pre-internet days what's different about this is of course we're now in the internet era one and and what and also Facebook is a social media giant it has over 2 billion users so it already has a really vast network in place already so people can talk to each other through Facebook and that's at the end of the day what money is and money transfers all about is talking to different accounts as information transfer and so what makes Libra interesting is is you've got this large private entity with this just humongous network already established that could potentially you know move information around it already does move information around you know it kind of you can talk to your friends for example but imagine imagine asking opening up an account at Facebook and and asking you know whoever's in charge to debit your account of whatever Facebook units or Libra units and in crediting the account of somebody else in principle you know Facebook could could be involved in this in in a way that could could have a major impact on on payment processors around the world on a scale that you know like I said it's it's these types of proposals have been around in the past but just the massive scale that Facebook brings to bear on this possibility is what makes it really interesting and so when you say it would have a massive effect on payment processors like I guess you mean from the sheer aspect of people might prefer to use the Facebook system simply because of its reach but I'm curious to know also like do you think that it would have an impact on central banks you know what would the impact be on retail things on maybe weaker economies or just aside from payment processors what are some of the other and other impacts on existing players well I I actually just I don't see what other impact it would have other than payment processing the well that's not quite true I guess they they're there there might be some effect to the extent that this monetary object that they create might serve as a competitor to other types of monetary instruments so there's that but you know when you like what are some examples of some of the others oh I just mean uh euros and yen and and US dollar you know currency competition has always been very fierce and and you know we have Bitcoin we have many many competing currencies out there and central banks have to constantly be concerned about currency competition usually you're concerned about currency competition of other types of currencies for example and in many emerging economies you know people like the US dollar for example that competes against the the domestic currency in principle private currency issue in like a Libra might compete against the US dollar for example these are just kind of the potentials I don't necessarily see that happening oh you don't well okay because what I was gonna ask you was you know David Marcus who headed up the group that developed Libra at Facebook he's come out a few times and said that it's not a threat to these existing fiat currencies you said it could potentially be but then you actually just said you didn't you didn't think it would be why not so so I I'm not sure if you agree with David or disagree with him well I could it's a complicated issue even kind of one could imagine different kind of parameter configurations for how things are set up but a lot of a lot of it depends for example on what I think the how Libra would be restricted by basically domestic regulations I just think that I mean they're going to have to be compliant to the underlying regulation of ever of every country and I just think once once these these companies are compelled to be come compliant that they're going to be on an equal footing with any regular money market mutual fund for example I don't see what the difference is necessarily between Libra and a money fund a government money fund except for the fact that Facebook of course can be accessed globally and very easily relative to say a US money fund you know I don't know so yeah that's that's kind of I see a lot of regulatory hurdles that I think that would make it very difficult for for Libra to kind of displace such a dominant world currency like the US dollar at least anytime soon we should I should never say never of course but I don't see it in the foreseeable horizon and what about for weaker economies that probably doesn't apply like if you were you know a Turkish central banker or Argentine or something what would you be thinking about the advent of Libra well that's a good question right for Libra I again I think for countries like that they could impose currency controls that would effectively prohibit their citizens from accessing Facebook for example on the internet that would prevent them you know I think that one of the disadvantages of Facebook is it's it's a registered corporation with a you know there's a CEO there's they they have to be compliant if they want to play nice and so ultimately they're subject to the regulatory whims of whatever country they're operating in this is very different very different say than say from Bitcoin for example that has no designated CEO or corporate structure so it's a very very different you know competing against Bitcoin is completely different animal than competing against si se Libre so even there I think I think that you know it kind of depends on on how open how open the the jurisdiction is to permitting its citizens to process payments using some private provider like like Facebook it's just kind of at the end of the day just depends yeah and even what you were saying about how they could shut off access to Facebook you know Facebook claims that it will be the Libre Association that will be in charge of Libre and that there will be other wallet providers that are built on top of this network that's controlled by the Swiss entity and so even if people couldn't access Facebook maybe they could access these other wallets but we're getting really far ahead of ourselves because we don't even know if liro will launch but it was also I was also curious to know you talked about how Libre is not that different from previous at um to form well-liked you compared it to the STR is that the IMF has created and I just wondered in general what do you think of the way that Facebook approached Libra like you know if you were to have designed a global stable coin would you have done it the same way or do you think you know it was a mistake not to just peg it to the dollar or you know just on the design of it what's your take well I mean the idea is in terms of like creating a stable coin I can kind of see the logic of the approach they took and indeed I I think that they may very well have been inspired by the approach that the IMF took when the IMF the International Monetary Fund created the Special Drawing right when the Special Drawing right however was created which of course was many many many years before the internet nevertheless there were you know I I've seen references to to people back then proclaiming the end of you know domestic currencies that one day everybody was going to be making their payments receiving their payments their wages spending their Special Drawing rights that it was going to basically displace all national currencies well needless to say that never happened and so whether or not you know the the ability of Facebook to leverage up the internet might might make it more amenable for people to to want to use kind of a basket of currencies as kind of the numeraire the unit of account I don't know I mean I just think was it was a big hurdle to kind of climb I think I think they may equally well have approached it by just saying luck I mean we're just going to create these things called Facebook dollars you know just like just the way any a lot of games create their own credits inside you know their their environment you know Facebook just creeks and create its own money could be your Airlines create air miles you know various companies create coupons redeemable and in in money that they issue themselves little little credits so Facebook credits and what would the value have those been like would it have been pegged to the u.s. dollar then if you're saying that they should have just created you know Facebook Facebook dollars is are you saying it should have been pegged to the u.s. dollar I guess it depends on what your objective is I mean if you if you wanted to peg it you could try to peg it to the US dollar but I mean you know I mean I don't know I guess you could have chosen that model to the US dollar is the dominant currency but I guess for a variety of reasons right you might want to move away from having the US dollar being the the dominant currency they probably have in mind that they have a global asset of users and and they these users may have wanted a currency that was backed more by a basket of currencies rather than just just the US dollar so I can like I said I can kind of see the motivation behind that but I mean I don't know they could have alternatively like I said just created their own Facebook dollar and all right but but that's why I was asking you like what would the value of that have been like what would the exchange rate have been just a floating are you think then oh I see they're just a floating exchange rate I mean so you know one way to envisage what this what this currency because I guess you have to distinguish between this currency is a store of value and as a kind of what I think some economist have called a vehicle currency so most people perhaps might not even hold this floating currency these Facebook currencies this Facebook currency what they might use it for is just to effect a transfer of funds so they'll just buy it for a very short period of time transfer the credit to from one Facebook user to the other Facebook user to facilitate the payment very quickly that they couldn't otherwise facilitate and say through the correspondent banking sector in the world and then Facebook could just like debit and credit accounts you know instantaneously basically so you'd bear very very little exchange rate risk and then there'd be a separate set of agents or agencies or firms that would be holding this this Libre currency is kind of a store of value absorbing all the risk associated with it so that would that would have been a kind of an alternative model it's not entirely clear to be which is the best way to go okay well since we've been talking about the US dollar I did want to bring up this letter that was recently sent by house representatives French Hill and Bill Foster to Jerome Powell the chair of the Federal Reserve and they stated quote we are concerned that the primacy of the US dollar could be in long-term jeopardy from wide adoption of digital fiat currencies the letter notes that 40 countries are looking and develop into developing digital currencies it cites the soon-to-be-released digital yuan in China and it concludes by asking chairman Powell if the Fed is looking into additional US dollar how it plans to respond to competing digital fiat currencies what the Fed would need from Congress for the development of a dollar etc what what did you think of the letter and do you think they're right to be concerned about the long term primacy of the USD no I don't think they should be concerned about it I mean the US dollar is if anything solidified its its hold as the primary currency in the world since the 2008 financial crisis there's been a lot of regulations passed worldwide Basel 3 for example that if Safilo solidified the the the role of the US dollar is a regulatory object so I don't think I'd be too concerned about that but even I have to say this even even if it was true I mean who cares really I mean most countries most countries don't have a world reserve currency I mean it's like Canada for example seems to be a perfectly respectable country to live in and nobody wants to hold Canadian dollars except for Canadians and when I whenever I visit Canada it seems like a very nice place to visit people are prosperous and happy and you know so at the end of the day I don't even think it's a huge deal in a sense that you know the wealth of a nation is determined by its people it's human capital its productivity the opportunities it offers and and this whether or not the US dollar is a is the world's global currency is actually kind of just peripheral it's kind of like a an exorbitant privilege as they say for the United States because it gets to export dollars for goods and services and and that's kind of a nice benefit to have in some sense but I mean it's not critical for the well-being of a nation in terms of like a digital currency you know I'd argue most people have access to digital currency already I mean through the they they have access to digital bank accounts for example so the commercial banking sector is is how we make payments right we we use our debit cards for example and most of us you know I guess most of the complaints I guess are it's kind of interesting I mean I'm old enough to remember when even you know you didn't have yeah I didn't have debit cards you'd actually have to use checks or traveler's checks and things like that so many young people today kind of take a look at the the landscape the financial landscape out there and they see in efficiencies everywhere in terms of payments but one thing you have to realize is that there's been tremendous innovation in in money in payments over the last 20 30 40 years it's not like things are standing still and you know in the in the old days you know if I wanted to travel to Europe I'd have to take traveler's checks you know I don't even know if many of your listeners know what a traveler's check is anymore you'd have to go to the yeah you'd have to go and buy some traveler's checks you'd have to visit the office by the traveler's checks you'd have to have the Miss UT if they could have to go back pick them up you'd fly to Europe you'd have to go take a taxi to a you know American Express or Thomas Cook office it'd be closed because it was a bank holiday so you have to go back home and go back the next day then you'd go back and visit the office and then you know you'd make a big cashing of lira if you're in Italy for example and then you'd have to carry around a wall full of lira in a country where you know maybe you didn't I mean today you travel to Europe and I take my I take my credit card I mean it's great so there's no if you if you were to design like a u.s. dollar CBD see yeah how would you do that like would you because there are a few options here like the Fed could issue a digital dollar where it then allows everyday people to have accounts at the central bank and it could bypass the commercial banks to distribute it so you know would you go that route I've seen you written you have written that you believe that if the central bank releases a Fed coin that there shouldn't be kyc restrictions on it so just describe for me your ideal US digital dollar right well be very careful about that last statement you said about Fed coin is that there's different models of what one means by a central bank digital currency of course right kind of the the old idea is just opening up the Fed's balance sheet to everybody and not just commercial banks so in a sense the Fed already does that we all own a piece of the liabilities of the Federal Reserve to the extent that we hold paper dollars and so you know one might say well if we're allowed to hold paper dollar accounts in our wallets why can't we hold digital account digital money accounts at the Fed directly right now it's just the commercial banks that are permitted to have digital currency accounts with the Fed well that's fine I mean what happens now is the the digital money accounts that that you and I have to hold are going to be done through through Bank of America for example or through a money market fund perhaps so you know in in this model it's it's basically indistinguishable from central bank digital currency except that in fact for for most people it's just indistinguishable you know the it's you could have the you you could permit everybody to have accounts directly with a Fed or you could kind of have it this intermediate a little bit let the let the bank's intermediated that's the model we have now and the the only quibble that people have is really about with respect to the fees that Bank charge and whether or not their accounts are insured above some certain minimum level and whether or not they can make payments overseas efficiently these are the things that people are are complaining about and you know I'm not if you were to design it would you design it you know bypassing the commercial banks or like you kind of said you could do it either one way or the other but I'm asking what do you think is the better way yeah so the this I'm sorry I got a little off track there in terms of the KYC thing there you know another model of issuing the Fed Fed digital currency is to have it basically as kind of the Swiss anonymous Swiss bank account model as well as kind of a token based model and and and so there's a wide variety of models in which you could issue this central bank digital currency for myself I think that many people have made the case that you know there it would seem that there might be a role for for the Fed to provide a basic utility banking service for for people in the economy very much like I guess the US Postal Savings Bank did for many years from nineteen I think nineteen thirteen to nineteen sixty-five just a basic plain vanilla payment processing service that you know would pay kind of a nice little interest rate on your deposits it would offer real-time gross settlement it would charge no fees your accounts would be fully insured and and there would be no other services provided no no overdraft privileges for example and that this type of service is kind of like a public option that should appeal to the people who might otherwise find it difficult to open up bank accounts in the commercial banking sector it wouldn't it wouldn't attract it could coexist with with banks it's not like it would drive banks out of business because banks of course offer their clients all sorts of services that they bundle together with payments so yeah I think I've been up the idea that the Fed could issue just a very basic plain vanilla the kind of central bank digital currency which the way I'm describing it it's not a Fed coin but it's just basically permitting people to open up bank accounts directly with a Fed very much by the ways in the way that Americans can already open up bank accounts directly with the US Treasury you can go to WWE direct gov and you can open up an interest-bearing account there at the US Treasury you're not allowed to make payments with this with these this interest-bearing objects but that's that's something that could be overcome that's not that's not a technical barrier that's just a policy barrier so one could imagine a world where you could kind of remove that that barrier and people could one form that this central bank digital currency could take is in fact in terms of Treasury money where people could make online payments directly with their WWE direct gov accounts many other models are possible of course but that's that's kind of a basic one I see all right so we're gonna discuss how all of this could affect commercial banks as well as how cryptocurrency is playing all this but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible crypto comm sees a future of crypto

Louis Reserve Federal Reserve is it one thing you know earlier when you talked about how you didn't think it was super important that the US dollar be the you know a global reserve status currency what's your take then on China's PBOC digital currency which will be released soon do you think that could kind of affect the US dollars global reserve status and does that give you concern especially as you're watching kind of what's going on in and how maybe additionally one could I guess increased China's power yeah am i concerned you know I'm a central banker so I'm paid to get concerned about everything I guess but I don't see I I you know I mean I don't know I take kind of that view that you know all the power to them if they want to try to do that I mean they they might have some success as a regional currency like in in Southeast Asia and I think that would be fine I mean I I personally don't see them competing on the global stage with the US with the US dollar I mean I just you know you just have to ask yourself I mean how would you rather be holding your wealth in US dollars or you know Chinese one you just ask yourself that question a lot of it depends on how the global community trusts you know a particular country and I think right now and probably for the foreseeable future the US has got it in China hasn't although like I said perhaps China could could have some success and especially regionally and I think that would be fine it's not it's not like control over this stuff is going to dictate the the the trajectory of the wealth of nations I mean like I said it's just what we're talking about here is is is record-keeping debiting and crediting accounts information transfer record-keeping database management I mean it's it's not something that's profound in the sense of like developing human capital developing entrepreneurial spirit you know of you know we have to keep our eye on a ball on the ball about what truly it is that that creates the the wealth and and material well-being in a society and yes payments are important yes it's it it is advantageous for a for a nation to have kind of a favored currency but it's it's not something you know foreboding that you know if suddenly China becomes the world's reserve currency you know is the United States the economy going to go into an into a death spiral I just don't see that so we have to be a little bit careful about you know being too melodramatic here but where the ultimate consequences of Bitcoin or some other currency displacing the US dollar it's happened before it's happened before in in in history and you know countries and people just continue to live and prosper so in the crypto world many people see the emergence of central bank digital currencies is practically inevitable and I was wondering in your world of Federal Reserve bankers how much are these ideas being discussed in how seriously well they weren't being discussed that much years ago when I started to study the phenomena but increasingly a you know you see more and more prominent central bankers discussing the idea and indeed President Harker of the Philadelphia Fed just recently suggested that a central bank digital currency is is among the g20 is likely inevitable now he didn't believe the US would be a leader on that front but he sees as sees it as inevitable and what did you think of the Bank of England governor Mark Carney suggestion to have you know a global judicial reserve currency right so that's an interesting idea right that's again trying to get away from from the special status that the US dollar has and kind of the the issues that it implies for a number of countries I'd like to peg to the dollar or that the issue dollar-denominated debt I think that it's an interesting idea but that kind of from a practical perspective I just don't see how countries are going to agree agree on how to manage such an object so at least I could be wrong with it there might be a way to do it but I actually don't think that politically it's it's a it's a it's it would happen and so for the for the time being I mean I guess we're basically stuck with the US dollar as far as I'm concerned and earlier when I asked you about how you would design a central bank digital currency you did say that you felt that everyday citizens could open accounts at the central bank thereby bypassing the commercial banks and you didn't seem to to really kind of imply that this would have a huge impact on commercial things so do you feel like this is something that they should not be scared of you know JP Morgan and Wells Fargo are also working on their own versions of digital dollars and I just wondered how you thought that you know they were viewing all these developments and if you were in their place what would you be doing oh well you know I I think that they should be worried all right but the the primarily in the sense that they should be worried only to the extent that they would be worried in quite naturally about the emergence of any competitor right so any new competitor on this on the scene should have them worried about how them are going to compete against this this new player on the block and and so in that sense with the Federal Reserve entering into the offering its own accounts directly to citizens instead of having an inter mediated and having these accounts they pay maybe a more competitive deposit rate for example would certainly increase the cost of maintaining deposits in the commercial banking sector so that'll definitely it might have some impact on how much profit they could extract from deposit accounts to the extent that in the banking system is a monopolistic sector you know one could well argue that this might be a good thing reducing the monopoly profit and providing better services to the depositor so the other thing is that they'd be able to continue to compete as full-service banks right I mean the model I envisage is just a very plain vanilla payment processor that may appeal to kind of a very limited constituency people well most likely most people continue to have both commercial bank accounts and Fed accounts for example in the the world I'm in visit jeans so so yeah I think that they'd have to get they'd have to be concerned but I mean it's not like a threat to their business model they just have to be concerned about competing more vigorously for for you know for the payment payment services and do you think that this could also have an effect on the fractional reserve banking system and if so I have seen some other academic papers that say that if fractional reserve was affected that that could also and presumably you know if that became less common that that could have an effect on the creation of credit and even effect monetary policy do you think that what you know do you agree with that and if so what do you think those effects would be well that's a big question um you know I think that I think that banks would continue to I mean fret the so called fractional reserve banking model is exactly the business of banking banking czar in the business of creating money when they extend loans against good business prospects or good collateral and they they they issue their deposit liabilities to be redeemable on short notice on demand typically for currency and so it's is exactly that that stipulation and the demand deposit liability that makes banks dependent on on reserves and currency the fact that they have fractional reserves is hardly relevant I don't think if as long as they're running their business you know model in a responsible manner the amount of reserves they have on hand is you know they always have the option of borrowing reserves from each other on the interbank market or borrowing reserves as a at the last resort at the the discount window at the Fed if they're if they're in need of reserves so I don't see how the business of banking necessarily interacts with what I'm talking about what we're talking here which is about the processing of payments the processing of payments entails the debited and crediting of accounts how do we keep the account safe secure how do transfer information rapidly at little cost how do we keep the ledger secure these are these are the important questions in any database management system but these questions are very very different than the question of how should a bank be permitted to extend credit to say an entrepreneur that's that's to me that's a very different question that I I don't really see how it directly bears on this question of processing payments right it's more about where people are keeping their money you know in order to then later maybe payments so if they're keeping it in a commercial bank versus at the central bank versus like I said though but I mean the private banks can compete for those deposits you know they might have too high they might actually have to pay a higher deposit rate to retain those deposits or they can borrow the reserves on the interbank market or they can access the reserves from the Fed at a higher cost so they're just going to have to compete so so again it's it's it's more like about what sort of how are these banks going to have to up their game sort of speak to kind of retain these deposits you've written that Bitcoin is essentially what you view as like a promising payment system but I as money maybe you view it as less than ideal and also you view it as having a less than ideal monetary policy so I was curious just on this payment system aspect how you view it competing well right so as many people have commented in terms on the payment side I mean I think that the underlying model is of course tremendously inefficient and it's going to define that it's designed to be inefficient in a way kind of the proof of work that underlies the clearing of payments in Bitcoin is is kind of the cost one has to bear to make it a permissionless system without any central you know trusted third party to do the accounting so but nevertheless in spite of of of that that property that one thing that is true is that given the current structure given the current infrastructure of the worldwide banking system the correspondent banking system in particular you know that kind of the quasi monopoly status a Western Union and making international remittances that I could see kind of a role for something like Bitcoin to kind of bypass the correspondent banking system or to bypass Western Union as kind of as a relatively efficient way to process payments so in that sense I I kind of see Bitcoin as being kind of promising and also promising to the extent that it's it should spur competition in the kind of kind of conventional space to kind of from to promote competition so that these banks are are motivated to do better to kind of use their standard database management systems to extend their lines of communication to make world global banking kind of operate more seamlessly than it does at present something that I find interesting about your take here about how it's more promising as a payment system and has less than ideal money money and monetary policy is that actually if you Bitcoin as succeeding so far primarily on the strength of maybe the monetary policy you know most people really are treating it as a digital gold right now rather than as a payment system or digital cash so why do you think that is well I think that inherently it's it's very difficult to to displace kind of a local unit of account right I mean when you go pay your rent it's you know Subang you're in the United States your rent your monthly rental payment is denominated in dollars and so if you know if you're selling your your services and accepting Bitcoin is payment you you receive the Bitcoin as payment and you're all happy about that and then tomorrow you wake up and you notice that Bitcoin has depreciated 20% relative to the US dollar and suddenly your rental payment just went up by 20% overnight and you're gonna like what the heck happened and of course the very opposite could have happened you know maybe the Bitcoin would have appreciated and you would have been happy but the whole point is that you are exposed to exchange rate risk and people do not like exchange rate risk when they're trying to manage their payments they want something more stable when they're making their everyday payments they want to make things more predictable and so the very properties the monetary of properties of Bitcoin which is to hold the money supply basically fixed it means that the demand as the demand for Bitcoin fluctuates it's going to cause very very volatile fluctuations in the Bitcoin exchange rate making it basically very unsuitable for making high-frequency payments like paying your workers or paying your rent on the other hand it's it's it's monetary policy is kind of probably arguably very good for for as a store a long-run store of values or if you're willing to live with the volatility that it might not be a bad place to park a bit of your wealth is kind of a long-run store of value so kinda that's what kind of motivated my comment that I can see it as kind of a as a you know flight to safety security or is a kind of a long-run store of value kind of something the digital equivalent to say some sort of commodities like gold but that is kind of an everyday monetary payment instrument it is probably not likely to be taken up anytime soon and what do you think of a currency devoted to inner bank transfers such as XRP does that make sense and if so like why do you think it hasn't really taken off yet well I don't think these these things are taking off of because fundamentally the system we have in place is ultra efficient in the sense I don't beat some of your listeners are gonna fall off their chairs when I say that but in the sense that again yet one really has to sit down and ask what is this fundamentally all about and this is all fundamentally about debiting and transferring debiting and crediting accounts and a ledger this is not rocket science I mean I can do it on my sell spreadsheet here on my computer right I mean it's just debe dean one one accountant crediting the other so at a fundamental level this is not rocket science and if you can trust an entity to do the bookkeeping it's very very very efficient to have an accountant just do the debit and crediting you have to worry about security of course you have to worry about resilience you have to worry about keeping a backup copies you have to worry about a whole bunch of stuff but this is standard this is just seeing your problems that people who manage databases have had to contend with for a very long time enter kind of the Bitcoin kind of model the blockchain based are kind of something quasi in between like XRP where you want to replace this designated record keeper with some sort of more communal effort in in the case of XRP may be some sort of designated nodes in the case of Bitcoin you're opening it up to anybody in the community that wants to become a a miner they can become basically an accountant and contribute to the accounting effort of maintaining the ledger in Bitcoin that is a very very different type of model this consensus based model of recording communal information like the could be communal information in general like the type of information we we keep it a library at a public library when this happens to be information in a spreadsheet of digital accounts of money whenever you bring a community to get involved in managing a database you introduce all sorts of problems right you have to achieve consensus it's kind of tough to achieve consensus and and and this is it becomes more and difficult to achieve consensus the larger the group is and it's not impossible and I tip my hat to Bitcoin for actually solving this problem but what's true at the same time is despite whatever merits this consensus based approach has it's inherently more expensive and so unless you have a pressing need for a consensus based record-keeping system like why would you want one anyways even people who hold Bitcoin often hold it through a trusted intermediary like coinbase for example so people have demonstrated their willingness they they'd love to trust their intermediaries why would you want to hold something that bypasses that trust well there might be some reasons you know you might some people just might not trust the government some people might not trust the central bank some people like permissionless access to payments fine but it's gonna cost you and for most most people are just not worried about stuff like that I'm very happy I get my paycheck I get paid through the banking system I you know sometimes we complain about the fees that banks charge but you know the answer to that is just you know let's let's encourage more competition and but you know by and large the banking system does a pretty good job or can do a pretty good job in to the extent that it doesn't like in terms of the corresponding banking system worldwide the answer to that is not Bitcoin the answer to that is just to let banks encourage banks to talk to each other more directly so that I can bypass the correspondence structure you know instead of going through a chain of correspondence just open up a direct telephone line what could be easier than Bank a in the United States talking to Bank B in in Italy just directly so that's kind of how I see things stand my broad view on things for you as a consumer let's say that we're you know five years of ten years in the future and there's central bank did digital dollars as well as you know these stable coins on public blockchains that are pegged to USD which would you prefer to hold and I know there's different models of staple coins so which model of stable coin would you put most faith in like one that is backed by reserves one that's crypto collateral I is like maker Dow or like a senora chairs model of a stable coin Ferguson is a two-part question if for for under for under two hundred and fifty thousand dollars I would hold it in a US there's no stable coin in the world that can beat that I mean there's Federal Deposit Insurance covers that account it's completely stable I know that when I go to the ATM I can withdraw my bank account at par and that if the bank ever got in trouble that my account is fully insured up to 250,000 dollars and indeed in a crisis is probably that insurance is probably going to go up so there's no stable coin in the world private stable coin in the world that can match that that stability already but I think that the point you're trying to make is that these stable coins do not need to rely on any government insurance regime they are basically their their value is guaranteed by kind of a verifiable set of assets that they hold and you ask me the question which of these would I find kind of more desirable safer yeah it's not entirely clear to me which ones I would because as a student of monetary history I'm very familiar with what is called unilateral exchange rate Peg's which is basically where a country tries to peg its currency against say the US dollar on a unilateral basis and the way it does that is by accumulating sufficient US dollar reserves or US Treasuries to back up the promises of meeting the redemptions at the par exchange rated promises almost every every attempt to do that in history is basically failed and I'm not sure why I would expect anything different to happen with these stable coins that are emerging there's really there's there's it's it's conceivable it's possible and like I said the models that I know of that could right be run reasonably well basically already exist today in the form of government money funds so I'm not exactly sure what's what's new here except I suppose possibly that they would enable a user to make say cross-border payments more efficiently I guess that would be the the reason one reason why you might want to use one of these stable coins a lot of people espouse the potential for blockchain technology to bank the unbanked but at least I think so far it's really barely made any inroads in in that effort so why not what you and or why do you think that hasn't happened and what do you think needs to happen for us to get there well I I don't know why people think blockchain is is a solution to the unbanked problem I mean a blockchain like I said is a consensus-based recordkeeping technology that might be desirable if you want permissionless access to a database and if you don't trust a third party to do the the accounting but most people who are unbanked you know don't have those problems they're perfectly willing to have permission to counts and they're perfectly willing for a banker to debit do the debit and in crediting of their of their checking accounts so the the it's like not like one can wave the magic blockchain and expect the unbanked problem to go away and indeed like I said blockchain is inherently more inefficient way to conduct information transfer relative to a centralized system so I think the idea is that a lot of banks don't find the unbanked population kind of desirable as customers whereas you know if you can just open a blockchain wallet then you have a way to safely store money where you don't need kind of like the approval of a bank I think that's sort of thick for thinking no that's a good point actually that that is a good point so I think that a part of this depends on on what unbanked you're talking about I'm not sure if you're speaking of the unbanked of the United States or the globally unbanked I I'm not sure that the unbanked in the United States kind of suffer from this if so for example compared Canada to the United States and in the unbanked issue in Canada is much less pronounced it's almost you know virtually non-existent in fact so there is a question of what exactly is driving this phenomenon of unbanked nests in the United States is a regulatory you know their banks being prevented in some way for regulatory reasons from reaching a particular constituency I don't know for sure I think one would have to look into that but you're right that I mean in the sense to the extent that imagine well you know I guess even you know opening up a Treasury direct account what sort of information do you need you need you need to you basically your address you know you have to identify yourself so there's there's that information requirement I guess what you're suggesting is imagine you have access to a payment system where you don't you could really just open up an account with no you know no need to identify who you are the equivalent I guess of holding that of holding cash for example I I guess that would that would be encourage people to open up digital accounts I have to grant you that and and I think that that could be desirable along that dimension but like I said there's in many jurisdictions like in Canada for example the the population is a hundred percent banked a virtually a fully Bank and it's done under a very conventional banking system so it's not entirely clear to me that the solution to the problem of unbanked is kind of like a blockchain based payment system it could be could play a role I mean I'm not gonna rule it out entirely but to me it's like gee if we've got a constituency that's on Bank why is that the case I mean is it is it a regulatory hurdle is there something we have to maybe is it something that a central bank could get in and provide a basic public service I think that that would be the more natural way to attack this problem of unbanked nests and just kind of hinging my hopes on kind of some blockchain sort of solution that like I said is probably not a solution all right well we have run out of time there's just so many topics we could have covered but it's been so great having you on the show where can people learn more about you
