deep liquidity privacy by default and low fees directly from your private wallet today's guest is Kane Warwick founder of synthetics welcome Kane hey Laura how's it going this week compound distributed its governance token which generated a lot of buzz how did they do that so you know they've been planning this for a while and essentially they've set up a distribution where the people who use the protocol get the tokens right so you know people who are lending and borrowing on the platform receive calm tokens as an incentive to utilize the platform and so that seems you know pretty straightforward it but after it launched a lot of people were talking about it why what happened I think there was a bit of a surprise in terms of the overall market cap that was kind of achieved at that point so they initially put a distribution you know someone from within the team or someone who's close to the team put a distribution of tokens on to uni swap and those tokens were immediately brought up and pushed the price up to a little over a hundred dollars the price then over the you know next sort of two to three days as people were earning comp and selling it down into the market dropped down to about sixty dollars but then this morning when I've woken up to do this interview I've noticed that it's been announced that it's gonna be listed on coinbase and now the price is up at about a hundred and seventy dollars so I expect that there's gonna be even more craziness over the next week or two as as that kind of plays out yeah yeah and I saw that people were saying it almost feels it's like a little bit reminiscent of the ICO cranes because you know the amount of ether locked up when it is I think maybe about 300 million but the market cap now is definitely over a billion so yeah yeah it's interesting it's interesting the dynamics of play for sure and you said you hadn't foreseen it playing out like this what did you think going into it and what did you get wrong I mean III thought that you know it would do fairly well right I thought the token market cap would be you know in the kind of range of like 200 to 500 million initially right you know which would be twenty to fifty dollars so you know the fact that it was five - you know double to five times higher than that range you know at the low end of the range was pretty surprising to me and I think you know that was partially due to the fact that there's not much liquidity because people are just starting there and the token but I think that the big difference in this distribution versus say you know I SEOs back in the day is that it wasn't just a bunch of tokens sold to people who were supposedly going to use the protocol it was tokens that were you know only it's simply distributed to people who are using the protocol and then there was a little bit of liquidity put on uni swaps so the price discovery still going on at the moment and I think it's going to take a bit of time for that to kind of play out but you know in terms of just the price action I was very surprised I think a lot of people were surprised and one other piece of this is that now the governance of compound is in the hands of the community how do you think that's gonna go so I'm one of the participants in that governance process so I'm someone that you can delegate your comp voting power to and I think there's two parts that for me you know they're both self-interested so one is I have a fair amount of value on compound so I'm an active lender and borrow one compound so you know when I was given the opportunity to participate in governance obviously I liked the idea of having some level of control you know it's a community participant and I think the other thing is you know we're all kind of trying to figure out this decentralized governance process right and you know as part of our synthetics transition to decentralized governance there's a whole bunch of things that we're testing out and you know in defy the fastest way to learn is just to get in and do things and so having exposure to you know another project in the way that they're approaching this from the outside is quite powerful and so you know that's that's kind of the reason why I wanted to participate was you know to have some measure of control and also to kind of be able to to follow along closely as they they work through it and I think you know already we're seeing proposals come out that are trying to you know more closely align incentives within the system so you know this comp distribution launched there's people that are yield farming which you know they're trying to maximize their gains from from the comp emissions and I think people are trying to tweak those incentives to get that right to make sure that we're actually you know incentivizing the right behavior and not just incentivizing you know people to kind of pull as much value out of system as possible and when you talk about that yield farming what are they doing so they they will put some value into compound right and a lot of this is happening on USD T which is a bit ironic because it's not the most decentralized asset in the world right but you know they're they're depositing some value into the system then the borrowing USD T because the the borrow cost or the the APR on USD T is the highest in compound right at the moment so to borrow USCT cost about 15% APR the way the distribution works is the more interest you pay or the more interest you accrue the more comp you get and so a lot of the the kind of comp emissions are going to these USD tea farmers right who like put USD tea and borrowed it then move it into another wallet deposited it again and borrowed it so you can kind of like leave her upright and and try and maximize your gains which is not ideal right it's not exactly what we want we want actual users to be getting the comp tokens because it's supposed to be this you know community governance process so on some level you want to incentivize people to come in who have assets but you don't want them to be kind of gaming the system I guess and if that were to continue on too long would that put the system at risk in any way it does put the system at risk but it does have some interesting dynamics for the rest of defy I guess because you know the rest of defy obviously is very connected and so there are a number of weird things that happened over the last few days as you know different lending pools got drained and you know people were putting value in and we saw a lot of value you know on the curve pool for example you know there was there's 25 million dollars worth of transactions because people were borrowing and curved pools and a mmm so like an automatic market maker for stable coins and so people were basically cycling this us DT into USD see through this pool and so there's you know so there's all kinds of weird things and effects you know flow on effects from from an incentive like this that's so big that's got so much attention and one other thing is I saw that you I took issue with a tweet that Tushar Jayne made where he talked about how he didn't see how liquidity mining and defy protocols was any different from transaction mining for centralized exchanges and he basically said that for both he didn't see how either would help their projects get market share long term so for the listeners can you define liquidity mining and transaction mining and then explain why you disagree with sushar yeah so you know the transaction mining thing the kind of start of that coin some of these other centralized exchanges was designed in a similar way it was designed to create liquidity right it was designed to have people that were you know putting liquidity into centralized order books right you know as a means of attracting normal traders right because the more liquidity there is the you know the better off it is to trade on an exchange but it wasn't very well controlled right you know so the the fact that people were just washed trading to try and you know maximize their gains meant that there wasn't really a strong kind of alignment incentive alignment from those those promotions it just created you know a lot of I guess up optics right like the the optics look like there was a lot of volume but the reality was there wasn't much liquidity coming from that I think in this case and this is one of the benefits of defy when you're incentivizing some behavior you know the liquidity is genuinely there you can see it you can see that you know the assets in compound went from a hundred million to two hundred million you know for the the course of you know a few days right now those assets are there for people to borrow like they actually exist there in the protocol you can borrow them and you know in many of the cases ignoring the USD T example the cost of borrowing is going down right because there's more assets now that that lenders have deposited into the protocol so I think with some small tweaks to this incentive program which is our job as decentralized governors of the system you know myself and others are looking at ways to kind of tweak this mechanism I think we can ensure that the incentives are aligned such that you know it's a beneficial sort of program and beneficial incentive and all the incentives are aligned and users actually get you know a better experience from this and so I think that's where it kind of deviates right is that you know you can actually tweak these incentives and the community has control of it you know to ensure that the incentive alignment is there all right so in a moment we're gonna talk about what how this trend could continue and what it means for the future of defy but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible in response to the challenging times crypto comm is introducing three measures to help the community first the 3.5% credit card fee for all crypto purchases will be waived for the next dream second you can now get up to ten percent back by using the MCO Visa Card on food and grocery shopping lastly you could buy gift cards on the crypto comma from merchants like Whole Foods Safeway Burger King and more and get 20% back on food and 10% back on groceries download the crypto comm app today in this crisis many investors aim to keep and grow their digital assets others seek to maximize the yield on their cash next allows you to achieve both of these goals the company offers instant crypto credit lines against all major cryptocurrencies with interest rates starting from only 5.9 percent APR next o also allows you to earn up to 8% annually on your Fiat and digital assets what's more interest is paid out daily and you can add or withdraw funds at any time get started at Nexo dot io back to my conversation with Kane Warwick so when we saw what happened to the comp token on the first day you tweeted that you thought seeing at 5x on the first day was the harbinger of a d5 bull market why I think it shows how much interest there is in the space all right you know it there's a lot of things that you kind of see at the start of the bull market you know little anomalies right little things that kind of forget the girl that's interesting right that was the you know that's not what I was expecting that was surprising and I think that you know we were starting to see little sorry one second sorry sorry my daughter's just sitting next to me so we're starting to see we're starting to see little you know blips like this right that are kind of indicating that we're getting into a market where there's a lot of attention starting to flow into d5 and you know crypto has been in this weird sideways movement for a while now but there is kind of one bright spot which is defy that you know it started to get attention start to get some traction and so I think the fact that you know we're seeing tokens and this resurgence of tokens and and tokens used as very powerful incentive mechanisms is kind of you know the start of this movement right it's been going on for a little while but I think the rest of the market starting to take notice and compound you know being such a hype profile project moving this direction I think is kind of a big deal so that was it was just one of those things where I was like okay this is interesting we're starting to see you know some real attention flowing yeah I happen to look at this I guess it's a newsletter like herman Coley called defy weekly and he said comp is basically a bank that lives purely in the cloud and took less than 10 people to actually develop also the fact that it's a liquid unicorn less than three years is really real really wild to see the past of raising continual rounds of investment and hoping to go public or over and yeah looking you know I think compound raised about twenty five million or at least in its series a I guess probably there was maybe a seed around but for a little bit more yeah so you know that's yeah it's interesting right you know there's definitely something there something's happening I guess is the point right yeah and I also see you had another tweet storm about BTC dominance or what you call the BTC dominance cycle and it was about how Bitcoin flows and so what you called alts I think so can you summarize your thoughts there yeah so so I think you know I'm probably the most bullish person that I know at the moment on this whole thesis of like BTC flowing into aetherium so I'm very close with a number of projects that are working on this solution up in you're actively kind of pushing for this for a while so you know we've been talking to the keep team forty BTC you know I talked to some of the people from bit Co around wrap BTC and talk to the rain team you know as well on rain BTC so I'm across most of the different approaches to bring in PTC onto aetherium and I think that you know there's also ruin as well for chain which is working on it so there's a number of people working on this solution and as someone who's kind of a recovering Bitcoin max list I think that it's you know I can see how this view of bitcoiners that you know bitcoin should stay and not do much and should just be a store of value could get eroded I can see the path for that and so you know if that starts to happen and they you know see yield like comp for example right like you can take your rapid and you can deposit into cult right or you can let it sit on you know polonius or cracking or finance or whatever and not do much right you know if you're not actively trading it's just sitting on exchange maybe it's sitting in cold storage but now there's a way that you can actually put your Bitcoin to work and you can you know bring it on to aetherium as a tokenized representation of it and you can lend it out or you can you know do a whole bunch of things with that and so I think that there will be this movement of you know a significant portion of Bitcoin is realizing that they can actually do something with a Bitcoin they can leverage it and there's ways to get yield there's ways to participate in other protocols and I think that that's going to have a huge impact on the overall etherion ecosystem and obviously defy write because there's just so much value in Bitcoin you know there's almost 200 billion dollars with the Bitcoin floating around it doesn't take much for that flown to define I have a huge impact and we've seen that in maker you know one maker enabled wrapped Bitcoin a ton of Bitcoin flow you know flowed into that system to issue dot right and I think that's just the start of it I think it's going to increase from here so I'm really excited about that I think you know it's it's something that you know we need to be watching for this this movement of Bitcoin or theorem yeah I had Matt LaJuan go on Unchained talking about T BTC and I agree there is something about the idea of marrying Bitcoin to defy that it does make me think that there's gonna be something that happens there yeah yeah very much agree and when you wrote that tweet storm you kind of we're talking about how you feel like you're already seeing some of this action happen and you talked about kind of like which kinds of tokens have benefited so what are you seeing in that regard like which tokens are you know kind of already starting this trend where you're seeing Bitcoin going into D Phi yeah so I mean you you're seeing you know the maker example it was a great example right and and compound as well and we're actually launching something with the curve team which is that AMM protocol that I mentioned and the Ren team where we're going to put s BTC which is our synthetic Bitcoin rap Bitcoin and Ren BTC all into an AMM pool which is designed have a ton of liquidity and so we're hoping that we can get your 4 or 5 million dollars with a Bitcoin into that pool which will mean that you know someone would be able to go from Ren BTC to R a PTC or synthetic Bitcoin etc which should really help with the liquidity across these different protocols you know because it's the composability that really makes it you know work so you could take your wrapped Bitcoin out of compound convert it you know directly into Bitcoin haven't deposited into an exchange for example and I think once that liquid on ramp and off ramp becomes just easier and a bit more accessible for Bitcoin as that's going to be when you know at the moment it's a little pretty high friction as that friction is reduced and someone who's got 100 BTC wants to in a single transaction get into the compound and they can I think that's gonna be a big deal and I think that's when you know a lot of the people with a lot of Bitcoin locked up just sitting on exchanges will start to see it kind of flow in but the impact of that I guess from a sort of tokens perspective is you've got all these D Phi tokens that you know some of which have been languishing for years right you've got you know lend K and C R n you know even s NX to an extent maker all of these tokens that have been live for a long time that you know over the last six to twelve months have had a bit of a resurgence right and again it's kind of what I said earlier right it's one of the few bright spots where there's a lot of activity happening and so a lot of these you know kind of layer one chains that don't have much activity going on we're starting to see value flow out of them and into you know some of these d5 protocols and D Phi tokens and I think that you know that has a very powerful kind of compounding effect you know as that happens and and you know the prices increased people get excited and they start looking where you know where's this what's happening why is this happening so I think we're starting to see that yeah and so this even goes back to what we were talking about a little bit about compounds valuation based on you know not that much work I mean compared to the traditional startup world and I saw that Tom Shaughnessy of Delphi digital tweeted that he is seeing what he called a layer one to defy trade in full effect and he said quote investors will sell graveyard layer ones for momentum defy plays where tokens make sense and then he also said he was interested to see how VC's would handle this because many of them had already invested quite a bit into different layer 1 protocols and he was saying like if they were to invest in defy now that sort of puts them at odds with their previous investments and then there's also the fact that a lot of these defy projects are small enough that they don't necessarily need that much venture capital so what do you think of those thoughts so I think there's a couple of there's a couple of things there there's a lot of value locked up in projects that are not going anywhere really right if we're if we're honest right there's a lot of a lot of tokens if you go through the top hundred tokens right there's a lot of dead chains and dead projects that you know don't have much momentum and then when you're looking through the top hundred and you're looking at you know what's actually happening would should the projects that are really delivering and there's interesting stuff going on it's almost invariably a dphi token you know when you know it's some kind of deep eye token it's it's maker it's it's ran its land it's you know all these different tokens and I think that you know if you if you add up the total value that's kind of stuck in these older projects that are not you know not super liquid we're also not really going anywhere there's billions of dollars there right the total defy market cap of actual project tokens is you know maybe 1.5 billion all right so you know there's there's billions of dollars worth of money locked up in layer one chains that needs to go somewhere you know as this kind of shift happens and where is it gonna go it's going to go to aetherium and it's gonna go to you know some of these default project is you know that's Tom's thesis and I very much agree with it and I think that you know it's it's very exciting obviously you know for to be in the defy space and kind of see this playing out you know it's it's what we've been talking about for a couple of years now and it's finally the rest of the markets catching up and so if you were to guess how a future d5 bull market would play out you know what are you thinking is it all these different factors about BTC coming to defy and then the proliferation of stable coins like what factors do you think would come into play and how would that look yeah I think this there's some element of like you know we haven't yet seen kind of the capitulation moment for a lot of these you know these people with these theses that they had around like l1 competition with with aetherium right I think there's still a lot of kind of hope out there that this is gonna play out but you know the longer we go the the less likely that feels right you know the less like like they'll obviously be competition and competition is good and we may see one or two you know competitive chains to aetherium getting some level of traction but there's you know 50 or 100 of them right like they're just not gonna survive and it's gonna be very hard for that to happen and so I think that as you see those projects kind of wind up right now it's hard to wind up a token it's not like a company where you just kind of say okay we're gonna shut our doors and and you know and wrap it up right tokens just kind of live on as Zombie tokens for a long time right and and so I think that at some point you know I look at something like XRP right XMP has an eight billion dollar valuation and there's a lot of people out there holding XRP that i think are going to be in disbelief when the thing that they've been talking about which is you know the the remittance rails being taken over by crypto happens but it happens with stable coins on aetherium and I think at some point you have to just capitulate and accept that that didn't work right so where does that eight billion dollars worth of XRP go where does it flow to it has to flow into aetherium and stable points other you know the projects so what's something like that happens that's like a tectonic shift in the market right you know that's the the third largest market cap token that potentially you know it doesn't have a value proposition anymore right and again a lot of us have been saying it doesn't have a value proposition for a long time but at some point reality has to set in and that you know that's going to kind of play out so that's again that's my kind of thesis that I think that we will see the shift in the market but it's it's coming it's not here yet I think we're on the edge yeah yeah it's kind of amazing how you know this first mover I mean it's not even a first mover advantage but but you're right there there are a lot of these zombie tokens that have huge market caps and it's taken a while for other things to catch up NOLA

traditional investments such as stocks they observed quote Bitcoin sauce severe drops and liquidity around the peak of the crisis in March but that disruption was cured much faster than other asset classes they conclude that cryptocurrencies past their first stress test at this time however they made this caveat quote there is little evidence that Bitcoin and others served as a safe haven ie digital gold rather it's value appears to have been highly correlated with risky assets like equities this all likely points to continued survival of the asset class the likely still more as a vehicle

productive asset that generates a yield you're now holding farmland not gold however Stephon warns the yields of 20% would likely occur earlier when there's more risk and then dropped a two to three

showing how quadriga did not store client's crypto assets specifically for them nor did it store them and secure offline multi-sig wallets as cotton claimed instead most assets were held in hot wallets and placed on other crypto as a trading platforms even then many of those were simply being traded and spent by cotton with 28 million dollars where the client assets lost trading on those platforms but most of all concentrated with quadriga customers using fake money 97 percent of this trading was through an account under name the name Chris Marquis though others were called sceptre

2017 and early 2018 he credited the Chris Marquis account with single deposits of 100 million dollars and 50 million dollars by 2017 the exchange held 20,000 fake bitcoins and cotton had lost 115 million dollars by trading fake assets and covering those losses with the assets of new clients effectively running a Ponzi scheme although quadriga touted its high volumes in reality cotton was party
