dcg announced via a statement on Twitter that a subset of Genesis Capital creditors have walked away two months after what they call a comprehensive settlement was submitted to the bankruptcy court I spoke to a Genesis creditor who is in this group and they said they felt that this was mischaracterized that the two sides didn't have an agreement but just a framework for what a deal could be this person also said that this framework had been made with limited financial information and that the group revised the terms based on new information and Analysis either way Genesis requested a mediator to help resolve the issue meanwhile dcgo owes Genesis 630 million dollars next week so what do all these recent developments mean for Genesis and dcg well it's an unfortunate mess so you know at the outset of the petition the counselor presenting ECG and uh well Genesis as well as the creditors inform the judge they expect a speedy resolution because they've been working at this uh and this is a step back there was a term sheet that was published that outlined the key terms of the deal it was a framework for the deal as you mentioned the ad hoc clutter group has pulled back or walked away from that as you said due to new information there's a lot tongue packing what information they learned as well as still what significant information uh is outstanding were you looking at happen at this point especially given dcg's debts to Genesis next week do you think it's likely they'll be able to pay them I don't believe they'll have the ability to make the debt payments there are uh 630 million dollars that do on dates rated from my May 9th May 10th and May 11th 631 million dollars you know BCG reportedly paid off the senior credit facility to Eldridge recently that means they have less cash to meet these obligations but we also don't have as much information we do not have access to the dcg balance sheet we know that they publish financials recently they've generated more Revenue because the price of Bitcoin has increased however even the free cash flow one would expect that grayscale would generate is insufficient to plug the hole I estimate something like you know 117 million in cash flow from grayscale that's just not enough to plug a 630 million dollar hole here are the other reasons too you know you have a some reporting that the CFO Michael Crane's left that is a negative sign that's a red flag you're also seeing dcg portcos like luno they're various executive departures we haven't seen new Venture investments from dcg or it stopped entirely the three ways to plug a hole either you generate capital from operations again I don't see enough of that there from grayscale second using cell assets there's been no sale of any of these prize jewels of BCG third is you do a capital arrays haven't seen that announce and they haven't done a debt refinancing so unless we see some announcement reporting around that I just don't see how they're going to make their debt payment and so if that's the case then it looks like what a bankruptcy for dcg would also be on the table well they'll attempt to do an out of court workout it's very similar to what happened when uh Genesis announced that they're not honoring with the drawls so there's no imminent bankruptcy you attempt to do an out-of-court workout you attempt to negotiate with the creditors and arrive at favorable terms but guess what that's what they have been doing over the last several months so this is uh you know they'll have to continue to negotiate uh and there's a strong interest so creditors have in preserving the ongoing value of dcg and seeking a settlement promptly it's not an interest for creditors to hurt the ongoing concern of of dcg that doesn't help the creditors doesn't help dcg and so what factors are you looking at to determine like How likely it is that they will end up having to file well let's let's let things unpack let's see what actually happens uh next week I think the first thing I look for is May 9 is that 200 million loan payment made or not if that's not made none of those payments are going to be made by the way I don't think you're going to see a scenario where dcg makes partial payments either they husband the liquidity or they meet all their obligations so May 9th is a key date to focus on you know let's see what happens there and let's reassess also you know we don't have access to the contracts and the loan agreements so we're you know making the best judgments we can you know based on on publicly available information I should also say that uh I'm not a party to any of these transactions I'm not a creditor Genesis I'm not offering Financial advice I'm simply trying to get a point of view on what this does for the 4gbtc the spreads the price of Bitcoin Etc so one other wrench that got thrown into the works is that late Wednesday FTX signaled its intent to try to claw back almost 4 billion dollars in funds from Genesis how does that affect matters right it's an unfortunate surprise it's a surprise because you know FTX several months ago under John rains he had a slide indicating the course of action he would take to seek recoveries and and and the Genesis claim was not on that slide that's one second it's been a lot of time months have passed of course the last day to file any claims is the what's called a bar date that's May 25th uh and so we've seen this claim come in for 3.9 billion dollars uh that does change the recovery particularly the recovery for uh Genesis direct creditors and I think they're in a different position than Jedi earned we'll come back to that however Genesis can argue the ordinary course of business defense so that defense is used as a way for creditors to protect themselves from having to return a preferential payment to the debtor um there are two standards you have to meet to argue for this defense one is that that payment was made in the ordinary course of the business or the financial affairs of the dinner Predator so a margin call would be in the ordinary course of the business operations um or calling back a loan due to risk management concerns uh and the second thing you have to show that's that according to the ordinary business terms uh so it's really a legal analysis question but I would say that you know there's there's credible grounds for Genesis to uh dispute that that has legitimate claim love to see that plays out and it may simply be the case of the FTX uh trustee is seeking to turn over every single Rock to maximize their recoveries even if the probability of recovery is not high do you feel then that like genesis has kind of good arguments to fight that or How likely do you think it is that they'll have to I believe they do they do have good argument despite it however it really is a you really need a lawyer that can look at prior settlements and have experience in commercial litigation has looked at any prior case law that's relevant to this matter but what I've looked at is what are the two standards uh they seem to be mad at the same time though I have not seen those contracts I have not seen how often uh Genesis has called in loans uh in the ordinary course in their business so those facts would matter to that analysis all right and then as you mentioned the Genesis creditor group also includes the Gemini earned creditors how did the objectives of these two groups either align or diverge this was really interesting this is a breaking news new development I hadn't appreciated this before happy to share that with you now first I think the Gemini earned creditors have a path to being made whole quickly and promptly as well and it's worth two reasons one is the security agreement so in August of last year a Gemini in system of security agreement and that security was in the form of gbtc that was pledged uh to Gemini and you know that's 62 million dollars in jbtc so that's one and the second is uh Gemini has offered up to 100 million dollars if the Gemini earned pool accepts the plan all right now the plans up in the air because creditors from the ad hoc that Guru have walked away so I do think that the path to recovery and that's that's terrific news however the uh direct creditors to Genesis particularly the top 75 creditors that compromises so-called ad hoc group they don't benefit from that security agreement and they're also not going to benefit from the Gemini herb sweetener that up to 100 million dollars to weight these liabilities in exchange for that uh they are negotiating some other sweetener from dcg and so these two groups are at odds another second question that would be like what's the voting decision making look like so you need two-thirds of the notional debt balances to agree on a deal any majority of the creditor's degree on the deal so the top 75 creditors to Genesis they have about 62 of the votes they're not enough to get there Gemini earned can swing the vote easily but the Gemini are wants a deal that's on the table today they want to liquidity yesterday uh so there you know there's a conflict of interest between those two groups all right so in a moment we're going to unpack this situation between Genesis and ECG a little bit more but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible meet stator Labs the

ROM so when you look at what's happening between Genesis and the creditors who do you feel is like in the right or um you know who do you feel will more likely prevail you know I think there are a lot of misunderstandings here and there's these asymmetric information problems and the big game theory is broken is my headline okay let me walk you through that and why these misperceptions have created you know this dragging out um scenario here so first off the creditors critically the ad hoc creditors are upset because they view these dcg Genesis transactions that's not arm's length remember that 1.1 billion dollar loan at a what percent interest rate payable in 10 years it's not arms like it's not Market terms and they're correct about that they also feel that they have uh evidence of allegations of of fraud of accounting fraud and misrepresentation you recall Cameron Winklevoss uh said that there was quote-unquote unconscionable behavior in December the other part is that you know the the former CEO of Genesis who resigned on the petition of the filing in the evidentiary hearings he used the term we to refer to both Genesis and BCG so people are you know creditors are saying like who are you representing are you representing Genesis interest or not and then the other very odd is the Genesis Council asked the judge if the dcg loan obligations the May payments due next week could be put in forbearance during the mediation term so why wouldn't Genesis Council application dcg's interest so you can see why that ad hoc credit committee feels aggrieved and upset however here's where I think they're making mistakes one is the the 1.1 billion dollar loan has essentially allowed these creditors to breach the veil and these creditors want to reach the veil and go after the BCG Mothership but they've already done that BCG has has already offered in the term sheet to restructure the Loans pay a higher interest rate pay those loans sooner same fast recovery and the creditors have upside on on the sale of certain digital assets so there's even a conversion option of debt to BCG Equity between 20 to 40 percent as well as a path to Ward seats on dcg so in an ordinary bankruptcy the recourse is limited to the assets of the debtor in this case Genesis right Genesis is at a limited liability organization and ECG has already offered up value over and above that so you know I I think the the asymmetric information problem is this like no one has seen the BCG balance sheet and if you're a creditor from Genesis you're saying okay I know the cash flow from grayscale grayscale is the cash cow bitcoin's gone up in value uh and why don't we seek recovery on that and that can happen over time the problem is that you can't get enough payments soon enough to make the creditors whole I don't believe that Genesis can be made whole on their May payments so it's an extraordinary form of bargaining leverage that the creditors have but putting PCG through a potential default scenario is going to create yet another legal proceeding so you know something like 50 to 100 million dollars have been spent on legal fees here yeah I don't think that's in anyone's interest I think the term shape that was Advanced uh most recently is quite reasonable you know it's it's very unusual again to go beyond the estate here and even if you acknowledge that then perhaps there was some accounting fraud you know this isn't the first time investment banks have uh have committed and proprietary and proprieties and you don't generally see 20 40 of the equity been given to the coinmans there's a settlement there's a report of something that's neither confirmed nor denied the parties move on and you have to deal with the realities of the situation it's it's like squeezing blood out of a rock and it's not in the interest of dcg to publish those balance sheet financials either so I think this mix of emotion and misperception is is causing us to drag out and the lawyers are benefiting uh and uh it's it's really unfortunate situation how common is this type of situation between Genesis and the creditors where they kind of seem to come to some sort of an agreement and then things fell apart you know it's unfortunate as disappointing and frustrating now recall prior to the petition the parties were negotiating uh and they went before a federal judge after the petition day and they said they expect a an expedient resolution that was one second they published a term sheet and the term sheet is a framework for the deal uh and then you know the ad hoc Predator group you know walked away so the lawyers have a responsibility to lead and manage their clients as well the emotions are high the stakes are high uh and I I I'm disappointed in the lawyers if you're publishing a term sheet of that should be a bona fide deal you should not be publishing a term sheet unless you feel like you've got a credible commitment from your client if you feel like you need to gather more information then don't publish you know the term sheet and you know the legal fees here are significant and that reduces the distributions the recoveries from the pi the size of the pie so it almost feels like you think the creditors should agree to the latest terms I think it's I think it's a very reasonable term sheet that balances the interests if you were to tweak one thing like I think this fundamentally comes on to a lack of trust BCG has lost trust with that ad hoc Predator committee group so for those two board seats that are contemplating the term sheet instead of making those independent board seats perhaps those board seats can be appointed by the ad hoc header committee group that might be a way to uh split the baby and create trust now these the DC cheat board's not going to want that so perhaps what what the Genesis ad hoc Federal committee can do is Advance a slate of potential board candidates including the Predators themselves or or not and then have dcg assess interview that slide that might be a path forward to create trust all right well we will have to see what happens I think there's a big meeting the day this comes out so I'm sure there's going to be more developments in the next few days one other thing that I wanted to ask you about was the grayscale Bitcoin Investment Trust has been a cash cow for grayscale which is um one of the companies in dcg's portfolio and it's currently grayscale is currently in litigation with the SEC to turn gbtc into a Bitcoin ETF and if that happens then that way cut fees for them so if the judgment is in favor of grayscale which at the moment it sort of looks like it will how does that affect the picture for all of these other proceedings yeah it's it's another monkey wrench on the on the one hand you know you want grayskill to Prevail in their litigation against the SEC that would unlock the so-called Hotel California at the same time we would expect to see significant amount of redemption activity as customers you know move to lower cost ETF products uh that presumably would also be approved on or around the same time there are something like seven ETFs that are on the docket including offered potentially by Doug Gemini and Vanek but what that would mean is that it hurts the cash flow generating power you know the number one Crown Jewel of dcg and that were hurt the ability of dcg to honor its loan obligations and make Predators whole and this goes back to the bar point so if the ad hoc creditor committee group Waits another year for another process to unfold that creates more risk on recovery grayscale is a melting Ice Cube that melts right now at a two percent rate per year that's the fees are extracted from the trust and there's no more Bitcoin getting Plus in the trust and it's got a discount nav but if that ETF is approved that melting ice cubes got a hot hair dryer blowing over it it's going to melt very rapidly and that's the cash flow generating power uh so you know they really need a verb to expedient resolution uh swiftly and the other side of this is from various perspective on the one hand the higher the price of Bitcoin the greater the capture generating power of grayscale and to make these crevice whole on the other hand it means that uh BCG has to pay out more next week so that last payment that May 11th payment dcg is short four thousand five hundred fifty Bitcoin so the amount owed on that last date has gone up from where it was in December like 68 million to now it's like 100 30 million so it's a really odd situation for uh dcg where in a way that hope that the Bitcoin price drops next week and then shoots up you know sometime after that okay and um one last thing is so we're watching for the May 9th State what happens on that date um we're also watching for the Bitcoin price um what else would you advise people to watch for in the next week to see how this might all play out so there are a few things one is there was an independent investigation Mission by the uh Genesis special committee they were Kane Cleary Gottlieb a former U.S Southern restrictive attorney these are the best these are the vast determines hot better and they were going to investigate the prude petition transactions and you know other allegations uh we haven't seen any findings or report of that now in the dock it was indicated that at a summary report will be made available to the public I have not seen that I'd like to see that perhaps some of the findings from that were is the reason why they ad hoc credit committee has pulled back I'd known saying that other descendants into that uh so that's one uh the second is decent G you know the number of questions there no one passing the BCG balance sheet and they're like in the cup spot if they were released a balance sheet it can make their situation perhaps more challenging uh in terms of their negotiation uh the other part I want to know is like what is the net Equity position of dcg uh and is that the reason why they may not have been able to refinance their loans or obtain an equity infusion notwithstanding these the threat of litigation and other lawsuits flying around you know and the reason I call that out is you know in August uh BCG pledged gbtc to Gemini earned good move Gemini earned for securing that collateral as I mentioned however uh on November 16th that collateral was foreclosed upon and liquidated uh and that could have caused an impairment to the dcg balance sheet so I'd want to understand like what is the net Equity position of dcg I'd also understand uh what gbtc is held on encumbered meaning not pledged to Gemini earned and what's the value of that dcg balance sheet in the end of Q4 financials dcg and coin is reported some very summery statistics they said there's something like 600 million dollars in the Investment Portfolio uh what percentage that is ooliquid Venture what percentage that is liquid Securities we need that to get a definitive analysis on the ability for uh dcg to generate its uh liquidity and need its obligations so I think those are the main ideas that you know you want you want to look out for and so if they make like partial payment next week what happens is that not a thing or well think it makes sense to like a partial payment uh if they make a partial payment then they're how much cash flow there's a reason to think in the partial thing either you pay off all your bills on time when do uh or you don't paint any of them uh and I think we'll we'll learn which state of the world we're in on on Lane nine now again um I don't have access to the terms I don't see the consequences of not paying these are you know these are uh well negotiated agreements so um I expect that the consequences would be severe for non-payment well what happens you know Penny you earn it you get kicked out to an up Court workout so I'm in the same position they're on today in a sense of negotiating the question would be would any of the creditors seek to pressure BCG by filing an involuntary petition for chapter 11. it only takes three betters perform the action he also you know dcg could be in a tough spot you know another way to look at this is dcg has their own duration this match Laura you know I've talked about this in various podcasts before where ECG has this asset called grayscale this other asset called boundary and Luna and and Blue Island coindesk they generate cash they generate cash flow over tying uh and dcg does not have the time there these pings are due next week and the way generally you saw these duration this match is you get financing for that cash loan for that asset we have not seen a point of that the CFO left so uh you know not a good sign I think things to look for in the markets would be I would expect the spread for gbtc to widen I would expect I've been digital assets that uh dcg uh owns on its balance sheet I would expect that those assets you know sell off because the market makes spec forced selling from dcg uh and we saw some of that in November December however uh yeah we don't know if dcg chooses not to pay the May plummets you know they they might not actually sell those assets so we'll see how things unfold and Melody and just to be clear about what you're saying there you are saying that perhaps grayscale might sell the Bitcoin in gbtc well sir dcg UB dcg grayscale won't sell anything grayscale is a fine business they're litigating the SEC they're you know seeking to convert to an ETF but dcg in the run-up to the three years Capital collapse they acquire 7 or 16 million dollars worth of gbtc on Leverage from Genesis subsidiary now good chunk of that it's already been pledge to a Gemini ER however they're stung onencumber component meaning has not been pledged it is on the BCG balance sheet and that is a source of liquidity for BCG dcg can sell that to generate proceeds to pay some portion of the 630 million dollars a month not enough based on my analysis uh but you know if if dcg does need to sell that then you'd expect a slippage and expect to see Market impact remember uh in November uh it was reported that Gemini in November 16th when they foreclosed on the collateral they didn't block Salem gptc and it did create a market impact uh and you know uh BCG has to make a decision on whether or not they want to sell those assets and we also don't know do they already sell those assets now based on the most recent 10q Fila from grayscale it does appear to be the case at dcg or Genesis still has a material amount of gbtc on the balance sheet something like 240 million dollars plus or minus on the balance sheet all right well this is clearly a very very sticky and entangled
