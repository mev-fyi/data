dabble in bitcoin coindesk revealed that blackrock is gearing up to offer crypto trading services to investor clients blackrock will begin by offering lending services using crypto as collateral additionally one of coindesk's sources says clients will have the ability to trade crypto via aladdin blackrock's investment management platform as covered in thursday's unchained daily chris perkins president of coinfund said that this was an important move for two reasons quote first aladdin supports many of the largest sovereign wealth pensions and asset managers in the world and this connectivity will solve many of the operational challenges that have been holding these institutions back he wrote in a message second aladdin typically releases new functionality based on client

meeting on cryptocurrencies during the meeting cftc chairman rosten benham made his case to bring crypto into the regulatory fold according to the block chairman benham asked for a 30 increase in the cftc's operating budget for 2022 after acknowledging that the cftc currently lacks the resources necessary to regulate digital assets as it usually only handles futures and derivatives benham cited as precedent as cftc's expansion following dodd-frank which granted the regulator purview over swaps markets and increased its budget by nearly 50 percent sam bankman freed the ceo of fdx who also

gamestop did just sell off millions of dollars worth of imx tokens last thursday gamestop announced a partnership with immutable x an ethereum layer two solution and disclosure a former sponsor of my show to launch its own nft marketplace as part of the deal immutablex set up an incentive fund for gamestop that will provide up to 150 million dollars in imx tokens for the gaming company's expansion into the nft space however it appears that immutablex granted the tokens to gamestop without any vesting or lock-up requirements so when gamestop received roughly 39.17 million imx tokens after hitting the first few milestones of the partnership the gaming company could do anything it wanted with the tokens based on data from etherscan it appears that gamestop began dumping imx tokens on the open market the gaming giant made five imx transactions in february in amounts such as 6.5 million imx a little over 8 million imx and 2 million imx with two of the transactions coming before the immutable partnership announcement as of now gamestop's ethereum address holds just 20.18 million of the 39.16 million imx tokens it received since last week meaning that roughly 50 million dollars in imx tokens have been sent elsewhere the block reports that tokens were sold on binance okay x and wobi notably imx's token supply is only about 225 million coins meaning gamestop's imx token transfer of approximately 19 million tokens equates to roughly 8.4 percent of all imx tokens being moved the flood of coins into the market from gamestop appears to have suppressed the price of imx which hit a peak above four dollars on the heels of the gamestop announcement last week only to immediately drop back down under three dollars where it had been trading over the previous 14 days zynga to launch a blockchain game this year zynga the mobile gaming company that produced farmville and words with friends has plans to jump into the blockchain metaverse according to axios the firm is reportedly looking to expand its blockchain team from 15 to as many as 100 members additionally zynga revealed that it hopes to release a blockchain game in 2022 that will target cryptocentric gamers on that note matt wolfe zynga's blockchain chief said the company plans to separate its nft game ideas from its current ones so crypto words with friends does not appear to be in the works speaking of crypto adoption cnbc reported that salesforce told employees at a private event online that it would be building an nft cloud russia will reportedly recognize crypto as currency sort of a report from comrasant a russian newspaper revealed this week that the russian government and bank of russia are preparing a draft law that will make cryptocurrencies an analog of currencies rather than just simply digital financial assets the newspaper reports that the proposal will be done before february 18th there's been conflicting news coming out of russia earlier in january the bank of russia was reportedly pushing for a blanket ban on crypto however separate accounts show that president vladimir putin is in favor of regulating rather than banning crypto mining within the industry time for fun
