so as a user you can basically download World app wherever you are it's an unconscious wallet there's many features in there that don't require any identity in that sense because we use local ramping infrastructure and uni swap on the back end so it's like it's fully it's a local Studio wallet in that sense we already have a 500 000 mu so it's already fairly large but it always was limited to a very small amount of markets we actually beta tested it we'll launch this globally so everyone can download it everyone can start interacting with it Alex lania co-founder of worldcoin there has been a lot of chatter about world coin I'm sure some of some of it you know has been um a little bit uh I guess critical which we can get into but why don't you before we get into that just tell me what your idea was for worldcoin there were two big motivations for rock coin one was the general idea that Ai and kind of General AGI will change everything much more than we realize and that's at this point it's like a very obvious statement three and a half years ago it really was not and something like non non-government Universal basic income will become necessary at some point we launch a token by giving ownership into every human being by solving proof of personhood through a biometric device called the orb that you might have seen and we give access to those two things to the user with an app called the world app um that is an uncustodial ethereum wallet yeah how did you come up come up that idea idea particular like I mean who's to say that in the future AIS can't make fake biometric data or I don't know you you tell me like why is this the solution so basically the only fundamental way to solve it is that you have to bridge to the real world you have to measure what it makes to be a human being right and so we we built a device that does a lot of raw checks so at first understands that whatever it is Imaging is an actual human being so there's multiple sensors in there that measure temperature and 3D signature and things like that and then there's neural networks on the device that check that all of uh all of that is is actually human right so that's why you cannot you just said you cannot just generate a computer generated Iris pictures or something all of this would not work because we would detect that at the first stage I I can only so is it that I can only get an account if I you know register with one of these orbs somewhere you basically need to show up in front of a physical device it's one of these 20 centimeter uh 20 centimeter diameter devices called the orb which you might have seen and you basically show up in front of this device and 30 seconds later you have your world Eddie how does the Privacy for that work like are you creating a Honeypot where hackers could get like multiple many people's biometric data yeah we're not that's the uh that's that's the cool thing so how it really works is the world ID is separated from your worldcoin wallet uh with with your knowledge proofs so the only thing uh if you would have all the information you could verify is that a user has verified before yes or no everything else is self-custodialy with the user and I'm sorry you said that world coin itself hasn't launched yet so all these people that you've been onboarding what have they been using it what have they been using exactly and what for they onboard it to a non-code studio wallet right where they basically could they could buy and sell crypto with local ramping infrastructure they could swap it to other coins there was an earned programmer there still is an earned program in the app so you can basically learn about Bitcoin or ethereum and earn a few dollars by completing a lessons similar to coinbase does it with coinbase earn and the other thing that is really exciting at this point is that people really start using the app to transact because we get a lot of users in in some markets we have like in total there's 1.6 million users at this point 500 000 Maus so it already is the fourth largest wallet it's gasless if you if you're verified with World Eddie so you don't have to pay any fees so can we now that we start growing faster and faster we actually start seeing these things picking up [Music]
