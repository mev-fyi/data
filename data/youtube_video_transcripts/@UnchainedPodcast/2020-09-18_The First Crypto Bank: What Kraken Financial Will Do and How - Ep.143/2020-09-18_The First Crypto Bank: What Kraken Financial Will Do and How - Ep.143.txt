will be about kraken and kraken was a previous sponsor of my shows today's guest is david kanitsky ceo of kraken financial welcome david hey thanks for having me on laura on wednesday kraken announced that it was the first cryptocurrency exchange to win approval to launch a bank congratulations yeah thank you it's a big day for us yesterday yep what will crack and financial the new subsidiary being launched be able to do with this status yeah so there's a couple of uh objectives that kraken had in launching this uh the first one i'd say three well the first one is regulatory look we're going to be in a much better regulatory position here as a bank in a consolidated fashion without having to go state by state in a money transmitter regime or something like that um we're also going to be as a bank be able to conduct certain activities that we wouldn't otherwise be able to such as serving as a good control location for custody the second reason we're pursuing this is because of infrastructure the bottom line is the digital asset industry has had challenges getting good banking partners now kraken is fortunate enough to have very solid third-party banking relationships but the fact of the matter is it's still very important for us to get direct access to the federal payment system and be able to integrate that seamlessly into our customer products and experiences now the third reason is this is an entirely new product and distribution platform again we can offer products that we wouldn't otherwise be able to as a non-bank and serve customer sets such as institutions that we wouldn't otherwise be able to serve so for those three reasons kraken found this very attractive and so from the consumers and or from a crypto user's end what will the new kraken financial mean for them like what will they be able to do that they couldn't do before yeah so for existing customers of kraken at first they won't motors too big of a deal they'll be just a regulatory update on the back end of how we're interacting with the the different agencies in the us but then we do expect them to see certain quality improvements uh like i mentioned before we are going to have direct access to the federal payment system and be able to more seamlessly integrate funding and withdrawal mechanisms and payment mechanisms into our products and so they should see an increase in quality of customer experience and perhaps a cost benefit as well and then they'll really see the difference once we start launching new products things like debit cards backed by digital assets things like staking things like ira accounts or other tax advantaged accounts things like wealth management investment product services the list goes on and and they'll see that institutional customers will also see a big difference because we'll be able to offer qualified custody and other similar services and qualified custody would mean like for a hedge fund or something where they're doing that on account of accredited investors that's correct that's correct and then also there's this separate but related notion of serving as a good control location for broker dealers for clearing purposes and what kind of crypto assets will crack and financial be able to hold for its customers and do you expect to approve those one by one or does it you know as i'm sure you're well aware it doesn't have to stay away from the assets that may be considered securities which has been a major concern in the industry over the past few years yeah so i think that it will look a little bit similar to how at first how kraken does it today which is it goes on a it has a framework uh and risk assessment uh process to go through different types of assets that are supported by its services and as we move to the bank that would initially stay the same that said there's a possibility that we could expand that list because a bank can actually deal in securities and commodities unlike a money transmitter or something like that so even to the extent that there is a risk of a particular asset being deemed a security we're still able to support it as a bank and so what would you how would you say that that would combine with this current trend we're seeing in d5 where these new tokens get launched very quickly and very very quickly become uh huge market cap coins and we are seeing other exchanges such as coinbase launch list some of these quite soon after they're formed would we expect something similar from kraken financial i think it's a we'll have to see how that plays out obviously it's a very new trend and the bank is just forming i think there's two ways to look at it one is what's going to be occurring on the kraken exchange and obviously that operates globally and so it's a it's at the crack of exchange level or at the kraken financial level and then in what jurisdiction and so obviously there's different laws and regulations and others you know similar digital asset exchanges do the same thing some assets are available in some jurisdictions and not um so yeah we we would love to be offering uh things and assets as they come out as quickly as possible to the extent that they are reasonable and suitable for our customer needs obviously customer protection and the safety and soundness of our institution are absolutely paramount in addition to security and earlier when you reference the jurisdictional issues kraken financial will be just us-based and serving only u.s customers or do you expect it to ever be global yeah to start it will be u.s focused however we do expect to be able to expand that in certain ways to other global entities now tbd whether that means will directly serve customers in in foreign jurisdictions or whether it means uh will provide services to institutions or whether it means simply will provide services to other kraken entities in those jurisdictions who will pass them through very much tbd but we would expect to operate internationally so let's now get into the details around how this occurred kraken financial is headquartered in cheyenne wyoming and it will be designated a special purpose depository institution or spdi under the wyoming division of banking's regulation so what is an spdi and how does that differ from a regular bank yeah so an spdi is a bank but as i think you're hinting at it's a very specific type of bank for one it does not conduct fractional reserve banking or associated lending activities which means obviously it is going to have a 100 of the assets that are deposited on hand and that is great because it removes some of the insolvency risks of traditional banking uh institutions um it also enables us to kind of have a carefully tailored pro approach to regulatory oversight um the reason why fdic and certain provisions of the bank holding act company holding company act apply to banks is because of this insolvency risk because that's removed we're able to kind of avoid that now we're still subject to the regulation of the wyoming division of banking and the federal reserve however uh it's carefully tailored and it's great because it has very digital asset centric features to this for one on the digital asset side it has the concept of bailments taken from property law whereby you can drop off a digital asset and the relationship between the depositor and the banking institution is spelled out and codified in law it's not pooled in some scenes pool like us dollars and lent out without customers knowledge as to the risk profile of that loan portfolio it does not happen like that so it works with the bail man and it's harmonized with the underlying commercial code which is very important the third factor is that it has a dedicated supervisory program for digital assets which is tremendous there is no other regime in the u.s certainly not a banking regime that has those features and for that reason this was an ideal framework for a digital asset or even a fintech company uh to operate under and so i was just so curious about this concept of bailman i think it's so fascinating and i love that it exists but then it it kind of made me wonder you know there is this saying not your keys not your coins and we've seen in past blow-ups of exchanges like mount gox or quadriga that when funds are stolen or misused that customers just lose out so you know i'm not saying that anything like that will happen in kraken financial but if so you know if there was like a rogue employee or i i don't even know how this would occur but if funds were swollen because the customers still legally own those assets then then how would you deal with that yeah um so one obviously uh we don't expect anything like that to happen kraken has a tremendous security record i feel obliged to uh to preface my statement with that but that said and it's interesting you bring up not your keys not your coin because the example of what bail availment is uses a very similar example it uses the idea of a valet when you go to the valet and you drop your keys off you are giving them control over your vehicle your property but you are not giving them ownership and you retain legal ownership uh over that property and there's a very clear contract that is interpreted under the the commercial code and bailment law as to what the relationship between you dropping your keys off and the person who takes control of the keys and operates your car it is not uh a some scenario where you just have a perfectable claim or security interest down the line to some poor portion of a pool of assets it's that you gave them a particular type of property and your interest is in that property so while it is still true that again it hasn't happened to kraken but to others that if there were some massive security breach and everything we're gone yeah it doesn't help with that if all of the cars on the lot are burned and destroyed and gone right uh those cars are not salvageable however your legal claim and remedy to that is a lot more certain than it would be otherwise okay okay yeah so presumably they could it would give them a legal basis on which to act and somehow get recompensated if okay yeah as opposed to having to go to like a bankruptcy court and get like a bankruptcy claim or lien on this giant pool of co-mingled and unrelated assets because it's a pool on desk chairs that they had in their office in addition to customer deposits it's totally co-mingled here your claim is directly only to your property that you deposited it's much cleaner and clearer oh i see okay it's wow that's fascinating all right so in a moment we're going to discuss how this regulation exists within the wider world of regulations around cryptocurrency but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible how much in fees are you paying for crypto purchases now crypto.com is waiving the 3.5 credit card fee when

app to buy gift cards for up to 20 back download the crypto.com app today and enjoy these offers until the end of september back to my conversation with david kanetsky for years crypto companies have struggled to obtain and keep banking relationships because they're you know sort of the gatekeepers to the wider world of finance and um potentially maybe even saw crypto companies as competitors and um that was you know a key kind of choke off point for a lot of these startups a lot of them lived and died by their banking relationships so how only the existence of kraken financial change that um long-standing problem for crypto exchanges for kraken in particular as well as for other crypto companies yeah now you're you're 100 right that the digital asset industry has struggled with this um and there's yeah perhaps crosswinds of competitive uh reasoning behind it another one is just the risk appetites and profiles of these these banking businesses who cut off uh other kind of gray market stuff whether it means you know cannabis industry whether it's uh actual you know uh adult films things like that um so a lot of it is about more like the risk profile and what's going to come down the pike to them and who they're going to have to answer to more so than it is in my opinion at least about competitive stuff now kraken is fortunate to have a slate of top-tier third-party banking providers but not all companies are in that same position and even though kraken is in that position it's still in our view a great advantage to have this direct access to the federal payment system and be able to integrate it very seamlessly into our product set without having to rely on apis or other sort of intermediary kind of linkage to third-party services so to start this will help again because we will be able to seamlessly integrate banking more seamlessly integrate banking into our existing product set and then you're correct that down the line we would look to bank other institutions and corporations and because we are a digitally asset digital asset native company we do feel that we obviously have first-hand knowledge of the types of risks that banks do need to make judgment calls on when they are banking a customer and then third point i would say just more broadly kraken's mission has always been to promote the adoption of digital assets in order to enable more individual financial freedom in the world this is a key tool on that path because it allows us to seamlessly integrate the traditional financial system with the digital asset ecosystem i know a lot of people say that but this is the first time that a digitally asset digital asset native company is going to have access to a banking license and that federal payment system so we're finally actually going to see what that means yeah yeah it's very exciting it's a really big deal i think um but i was so curious also because when this news came out this is sort of one of the latest in a string of different regulations and news articles about these new regulations um that are changing uh in ways that are promising for potential crypto banks or other financial institutions handling crypto so for instance the officer of the control of the currency or occ said that banks could provide services to crypto startups in addition to costing cryptocurrency the conference of state bank supervisors or csbs just said this week that it would introduce a new cryptocurrency compliance regime for money services businesses such as exchanges and that that would impose the same rules and standards across 48 states rather than the firms having to go state by state to get licenses which has been the case for you know i guess over a decade now so where does the spdi fit in with these other regulations how do they overlap how are they separate yeah totally so the occ um interpretive guidance that was released i think it was july 22nd or so but but in any event a few weeks back um but it was great um i will say um it's always been my understanding and many people's understanding that banks could conduct these activities they always could both state chartered and nationally chartered it's important to note that state chartered banks have the same powers as federally chartered banks they could always conduct these activities however if you're a big banking institution incumbent it means something in terms of like your risk profile uh to have the occ uh head or acting head uh have this interpretive letter in hand on paper saying that you can do it so it's important and matters from that perspective but as i mentioned earlier this spdi framework is a bit different than other existing bank frameworks in that it is carefully tailored to the needs of a digital asset or fintech company things like the uh full reserve nature of it and as a result the inapplicability of fdic or bank holding company act the bailments and commercial codes but most importantly the supervisory program um so even if you're a bank today and you say yeah we want to uh handle digital assets you have no idea how your regulators are going to examine you and conduct oversight it's not documented it's usually documented in a massive manual wyoming has that other regimes do not i would expect other regimes to borrow very liberally from the wyoming framework which is great news we welcome the competition and moving the industry forward you're also seeing as you mentioned that with the csbs there is this kind of like set state versus federal kind of harmonization or competitive efforts going on my understanding uh with the news that you mentioned about the csbs is it's it's not uh harmonizing licensure it's harmonizing examinations so you still would need to have a license in all 50 states it's just that the examination cycle would be much more streamlined so they say uh it remains to be seen oh go ahead wait so so basically then you still have to go state by state to get the licenses but it's that once you have them then there's just one regulator for kind of maintaining that license or those licenses that's correct you still need a license in all the states and you just uh yeah it's it's it's uh it is helpful to be clear it's helpful i mean you today if you have 50 state licenses you're going to have five exams a year or something like that if you can get that to one that's material but it is true that you'll still need to have all of those licenses in all the states and furthermore from a money transmission like license that doesn't give you what a bank does you can do a lot more with the bank but ultimately i think what's underlying all this is you're seeing the uh commingling and the convergence of the digital asset industry fintech and neobanks and traditional financial services there's lots of bundling and unbundling going on and regulators are having to figure out how to appropriately right-size regulation and so how would this bank charter affect what from wyoming affect how kraken would be regulated in new york where obviously the bit license has been in effect and kraken has actually not operated there due to how onerous the bit license regime is yeah so state chartered banks generally speaking have recognition and reciprocity uh into other states um and that's true here certainly for the lion's share of states 40 plus 42 maybe more we expect there to be on because it's a state charter bank there to be recognition reciprocity in other states now there are some outliers there where we do expect to have to conduct uh extra activities in order to enter those jurisdictions because of the fact that they have a very specific verbiage about digital assets in their money transmission laws or they have something like the bit license or something like that so new york would be one of the states where we would expect to have to at least jump through some extra hoops in order to enter but we believe that this because we have this banking charter it's going to be much less than if you're coming in there de novo or something like that um so we do anticipate using this to access all 50 states it just may be uh some of those kind of holdouts would be a second or third tranche of rollouts kraken is well known for having a somewhat contentious relationship with regulators sometimes doing things like pushing back on what it would deem as overreach from regulators asking for information um you know as we mentioned not serving customers in new york do the bit license pulling out of japan when regulations there became stricter in the wake of the blow up of mount cox so what made kraken decide to pursue the application to become an spdi yeah um so i would say that kraken is never been particularly in my view contentious with regulators it has though taken stands no doubt kraken's first and foremost objective is the protection of customers and the safety and sadness of our operation and you're correct that in the past to the extent that kraken felt that our customers were not best served or we could not appropriately serve customers within a particular type of regulation or jurisdiction we have withdrawn in certain instances as you're referencing we have always understood that we would need to be regulated to conduct these financial services activities we just want strategic and appropriately tailored uh regulation and that's what we've done here we've spent even before i joined kraken for a year year and a half kraken and others across the ecosystem have been working with the wyoming legislature the governor's office the actual agency of the division of banking and then other regulators at the fed or other states to create this spdi regime because we do believe that yes we understand you have to be regulated but we think there's better ways to create regulation not just for regulation's sake but to address the actual risks that an institution poses and protect the customers that it serves and that's exactly what we're doing here and why we're so excited about the spdi so as you mentioned earlier kraken financial have to keep 100 reserves and as we all know banks famously make money by lending out the money from its depositors so how will crack and financial make money yeah so uh even though you have 100 reserves uh you still are able to earn some yield on u.s dollar denominated assets via treasuries or other types of you know very highly rated securities that all banks invest in that are separate from the type of lending and portfolios that they conduct otherwise now in the interest rate environment we're currently in um it can be measly obviously if you have a big scale of assets it can be material but it's not going to be the windfall uh moneymaker there for us obviously we'll also be conducting a traditional you know wire payment ach transactional payments processing uh that you would expect some cut on probably not the like 25 plus dollar uh you know hit wire payments that you see elsewhere but some amount um and then percentage fees on on crypto assets that are safe kept or custodied with us and then all of the new products that i mentioned earlier have revenue streams attached to them things like offering debit cards that are backed by digital assets things like staking things like ira accounts things like and on and on that i mentioned earlier they all have their revenue stream so we would expect all of that to happen and then of course customers do conduct trading on the kraken exchange as well and so there are fees taken there you recently joined kraken tell us a little bit about your background yeah totally so i'm an attorney by training in particular securities and corporate law which is oddly beneficial in a lot of industries um but i quickly uh kind of reform myself and have been in fintech and financial services for the better part of 15 years i started that career at a company called second market which is actually the precursor uh to digital currency group at second market i uh ran operations for its pre-ipo private company marketplace uh which ultimately spun out and sold the nasdaq so i was there then when dcg got created and actually set up grayscale and ran grayscale investments uh so i was the head of graceful investments in the bitcoin investment trust that obviously has been uh very wildly successful um i then joined fidelity investments as the first digitally asset dedicated hire to help figure out their strategy in the space obviously that's culminated in some stuff recently and while there i was also a co-portfolio manager of a proprietary crypto fund uh and then uh for the past two years before joining kraken i was at circle another digital asset company where i helped restructure and pivot their business to what it is now based around usdc so then when this opportunity came up i've been with kraken in five six months or so obviously i'd known jesse and dave and others at the kraken and it's always been one of like the companies that i admired most in the space so when that came up coupled with this spdi uh i i jumped at the opportunity uh needless to say and will you move or have you moved to wyoming i'm here that's why you see pictures on the floor uh i mean i'm in my place in in cheyenne wyoming and uh still putting it together but yeah it's it's great um we are going to have a big footprint here uh we'll be opening up an office for kraken financial obviously hiring people here uh but then also across the the broader kraken organization looking to kind of bring more of our efforts and operations and people uh to the state here um and so super excited about it uh made the move from new york and uh that's a that's a that's a highway that's getting more and more uh treads on it as people kind of leave new york um to to greener pastures here in wyoming what should the audience look out for from kraken financial over the coming year or two what do you have to do before your launch and when do you expect to launch yeah so yesterday obviously major milestone uh getting the charter in hand from the state banking board uh but it's not a conclusion it's more of a commencement of next steps to do uh no sleep for the weary here we've gotta then approach the the fed and get a fed master account and or a domestic correspondent banking relationships we've got to then make sure that all of our uh programs policies procedures are all buttoned up and operationalized to get the green light to launch which we do expect to do uh if not later this year most likely in q1 of next year and so then from there customers will existing tracking customers can expect us to start servicing them out of this spdi shortly thereafter and then adding the new types of features benefits and products that we discussed earlier over the the following year or two great well this has been a very very interesting and exciting conversation congratulations again and thanks so much for coming on unconfirmed yeah thanks so much it was a lot of fun don't forget next up is the weekly news recap stick around for this week in crypto after this short break inter blockchain communication will be launching on cosmos soon join hack atom 5 the two-week cosmos virtual hackathon where you can play with inner blockchain communication before it is

k a t o m dot o r g thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap first headline micro strategy doubles down on bitcoin microstrategy the business intelligence firm that made waves in crypto a few weeks ago after it added 250 million worth of bitcoin to its investment strategy has now converted an additional 175 million dollars of its cash reserves to bitcoin to date the firm has purchased over 38 000 bitcoins and has committed the majority of its holdings for what ceo michael saylor has said will be the long term he said quote i want something that i could put 425 million dollars into for 100 years if my successor is staring at this thing it's still working sailor's confidence in bitcoin is a decisive turn from comments he made in the past including an infamous tweet from 2013 where he declared bitcoin's days numbered sailor said that he'd taken advantage of the covid 19 lockdown to go down the rabbit hole he's come out the other side of true believer as he sees the dollar's inflationary risks only increasing now microstrategy has adopted bitcoin as the alternative to a bank account where inflation might slowly whittle its cash reserves sailor has said quote we just had the awful realization that we were sitting on top of a 500 million ice cube that's melting next headline uniswap governance token uni released uniswap has launched its long-awaited governance token dubbed the uni one billion tokens have been minted which will become available over four years with 15 airdropped to all users prior to september 1st anyone who interacted with uniswap before then received 400 tokens which immediately became worth more than one thousand dollars uni's market cap immediately ballooned to almost 600 million dollars as of press time with the coin itself trading at three dollars and fifty cents and volume exceeding 1.6 billion dollars the community went wild with the news with pending transactions on the ethereum network jumping 30 after the token claim began coinbase listed the token on coinbase pro less than four hours after it was launched the fastest listing for any coin on coinbase binance also listed it in mere hours for a while uniswap was responsible for 50 of all gas use on the ethereum network in a twitter thread fabric ventures co-founder max mersch wrote quote with a uni distribution uniswap protocol has consolidated an army of missionaries that were early users and are now stakeholders incentivized in the protocol success and in his daily way newsletter anthony sasano wrote quote this is a clear example of what people are calling the ownership economy next headline bitcoin roundup key indicators for bitcoin are bullish cryptocurrencies are the best performing assets of the year according to pantera ceo dan moorhead who posted a chart on twitter of the year's best performing asset so far although gold is at a 5 000 year high and close to the top of the list the top five performing assets this year have all been cryptocurrencies 0x ethereum auger bitcoin and maker also in a september newsletter morehead describes how for periods in which inflation has been running below two percent the fed has promised to keep printing money until inflation averages to a two percent target moorhead wrote wow that's wild and then notes that bitcoin appears to be at the beginning of its next large bull market next in the roundup the current measure of bitcoin's decentralization shows that it continues to rise across variables such as the network cash rate and the number of active addresses was currently near are near 1 million according according to coinmetrics research also suggests that bitcoin supply is becoming even more evenly dispersed with more than half of addresses controlling less than 100 worth of bitcoin next headline sushi swaps chef nomi returns funds shortly after we published our interview on unconfirmed last week with co-founder xerox maki the sushi swap saga took another unexpected turn when co-founder chef nomi returned the money he had originally cashed out of the developer fund a surprise move that had generated controversy and criticism the reproach he received from the community prompted him to return 38 000 eath to the project's treasury fund nomi wrote in a post i would like to apologize to everyone who i have caused troubles to he said i was emotional i was greedy i was afraid i made bad controversial decisions under pressure and it hurt everyone i failed your expectation and i am sorry nomi went on to say that whatever reward he deserves for creating the project should be decided by the community as you may recall from last week nomi transferred control of the admin keys to sam bankman freed of ftx who had been one of his harshest critics bankman freed has since earned praise for ultimately turning control of the project over to the community the future of sushi swap remains uncertain with benquen fried admitting to decrypt that he is concerned about the damage done to the young dexa's reputation due to chef nomi's actions he said quote given its weird narrative that it crashed almost all the way down and then came back up somewhat it's still not totally clear which arc is going to win out in the public narrative around it and now after the launch of uni liquidity on uniswap is at 100 850 million dollars while liquidity on sushi swap is at 630 million dollars we will see what future twists and turns this saga takes next headline unicorn settles with sec unicorn an esports gaming and gambling company has agreed to pay 6.1 million dollars to the sec in a settlement announced this week the sec had accused unicorn of raising 31 million dollars through its unicoin gold token sale in violation of securities laws in a press release the sec said that while the firm promised to use the funds to add more features to the platform it failed to register the sale of the tokens which the sec alleges were offered as investment contracts sec commissioner hester purse who has long been an advocate for cryptocurrencies dissented the resolution pointing out that unicorn was not accused of committing fraud but rather a registration violation and that its punishment will effectively force the company to cease operations due to this registration violation as she has in the past she advocated for a three-year safe harbor for token issuers saying that in unicorn's case it would have been able to use the time to identify new uses for the token and expand its user base next headline why bitcoin cash may fork into two again a contentious disagreement within the bitcoin cash community threatens to split the network at the time of the upcoming semi annual upgrade one side called bitcoin abc created a funding plan that would redirect eight percent of the block reward to an address controlled by bitcoin abc for intersect for infrastructure development but only as long as the miner was using the abc client any block not redirecting funds to the abc address would be orphaned meaning it would not be added to the chain by the abc miners a new forked node called bch node instead follows the chain with the most proof of work and does not redirect eight percent of the block reward to the abc wallet that of course means that blogs mined by the bch node client will be considered invalid by the abc miners hence the risk of a split more than 50 of bch blocks are currently being mined using the bch end client giving the bchn miners confidence that they will have the chain with the most proof of work however the question remains of how the bitcoin how the bch network might continue to fund itself without this infrastructure funding bitcoin abc is essentially responsible for creating bitcoin cash and has tried to rely on donations for funding over the past three years with little success the faction that created bchn is protesting that bitcoin abc hasn't proven enough value to the community to warrant what they argue is a tax furthermore they say this infrastructure funding proposal will give too much power to a single developer team we will see if bitcoin cash splinters yet again time for fun bits crypto normies are coming be nice coindesk's lee quinn gives us glimpses of the noobs rushing into farm yam sushi uni etc for instance joe a math student at a canadian university is now one of the top users of a certain d5 protocol he claims he's made hundreds of thousands of dollars yield farming in 2020. another anonymous yield farmer made 15 000 from yem alone despite the fact that yam was over in three days and imploded due to a bug it is however relaunching but since there are so many new people a number of crypto stalwarts have taken to educating them tony shang laid out the risks inherent to new users rushing in a defy in a tweet storm while he did say quote unlike the ico era this cohort of prophet seekers are becoming quite sophisticated he cautioned them to not let their fomo rush them into following influencers he wrote quote it takes time to get sophisticated but people don't think they can afford to take that time they're afraid of missing out people are constantly losing money
