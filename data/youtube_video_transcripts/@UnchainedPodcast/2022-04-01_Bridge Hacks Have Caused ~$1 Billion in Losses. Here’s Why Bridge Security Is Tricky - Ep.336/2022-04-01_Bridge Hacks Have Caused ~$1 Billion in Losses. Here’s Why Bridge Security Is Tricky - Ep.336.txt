hi all in recent press interviews or at book signings and speaking engagements people have been asking what's next for me now that my book is out well i'm happy that i'm finally able to announce what i'll be working on today law and crime the leading live trial and true crime network and i announced that we will be collaborating on an investigative podcast series that explores the case of ilya lichtenstein and heather morgan the couple who have been accused of attempting to launder 4.5 billion dollars worth of bitcoin the series will be a deep dive into the story to understand the married couple at the center of it how they allegedly attempted to launder the bitcoin stolen from bitfinex and then to look more closely at the clues that led to their arrest i'm thrilled to be partnering with law and crime to tell this tale about stolen bitcoin with the depth and level of detail it deserves it will be a fascinating journey not only into the lives of this couple that has already captivated the internet but into how blockchain sleuthing enabled the government to track them down we have a press release out about it today which you can read on law and crime so if you're

bhuptani founder of connext network welcome arjun thanks laura thanks for having me this week we saw the largest hack in d5 history a 625 million dollar hack uh which was 176 300 ether and 25.5 million usdc and this involved the ronin network tell us what the ronin network is and what happened in the hack so the run network i apologize to the ronin team if i don't get this exactly right but uh the ronin network is an ethereum side chain that is built to host the the axi ecosystem um which is one of the largest like player games in the world right now the ronin uh chain itself is like run by a decentralized set of validators but then ronin has its own ronin bridge which connects ethereum to the ronin chain um and the hack specifically was a hack of the ronin bridge where ronin bridges you know as as has nine validators and uh requires a five out of nine threshold signature to to be able to like complete transactions between chains and five all five of those validators were compromised uh leading to 650 million dollars being stolen from the bridge itself wow and how was this money moved it was literally just they pretended to be all these validators yeah so that's that's kind of where things get interesting so general so this is this is basically it's an exam this is an example of a multi-sig bridge where you have a certain number of signers that are responsible for saying that something happened on one chain and then relaying it to another chain and in this case it was specifically associated with funds but it really could be like any kind of data in this case all you know nine of the people who are validating the ronin bridge were people associated with the axi ecosystem in in different ways so there's like like some that were run by the axi dao and some that were run by i think the ronin team and others and and what ended up happening was um there was a combination of two things that led to this attack before and there aren't exactly clear details on everything at the moment but four of the validators were compromised all at once it's unclear whether this was because they were using they were all run by the same people and it was unclear whether this was because they were using like the same key management system um or something else um and then in addition to that one validator that was run by the axi dao was also compromised and and i think the four that were compromised were compromised because in the past there had been a an rpc that like a basically like a white listed specialized rpc that had been set up by the axi ecosystem that was a gas free rpc and an rpc is a connection to the blockchain and so they had set up a specialized connection to the blockchain a specialized node that people could actually send transaction through that was not charging transaction fees that was subsidizing the cost of transactions and that was no longer being used but that rpc had not actually been removed from the whitelist um for for the last couple of years and what actually what happened in this case was that the it sounds like and again this is this this is only high level information that has been shared by sky maps but it sounds like the uh that specific uh rpc was compromised and uh leading to those four signers signing an incorrect message um so the rpc basically requested that the signers would sign a message that was actually a false message designed to exit funds from the bridge that shouldn't have been exited well and um just i i think you might have misspoke when you said that the whitelist access had been revoked for a few years it was i think a few months it was in december of 2021 that they stopped using it or yes sorry that was that was when they stopped using it but the white list i think the access had initially been given in 2019 if i'm if i'm okay correct right but i think am i wrong that that's when the whitelist access should have been revoked no you're right you're you're right but it should have been revoked in 2021 yep okay so one other thing that people were really shocked by is the fact that the hack actually hadn't been discovered for six days how is that possible yeah that is a good question i don't know i think it's it's a bit of a failure to not have like the monitoring and alerting in place to be able to discover this i think it's also astounding that nobody found out just you know i think like this this community tends to be very very diligent about these sorts of things and i think also typically you know you when you have this large of a of an ecosystem of users at some point someone ends up checking the balances on on etherscan and sees wait this is a lot lower than it should have been so it's unclear exactly how it remained undiscovered for that long but it is definitely a massive oversight regardless so the main culprit in this hack most people believe was social engineering as opposed to kind of what we typically see in a d5 hack just explain kind of maybe what a typical dfi hack um how that how that is typically perpetrated and then what social engineering is yeah absolutely so normally when you are using a d5 protocol you're interacting with the contracts associated with the d5 protocol itself and those those contracts don't you know and i'll get into like maybe those contracts may be owned by a multisig or something like that and that's that's definitely an attack vector but typically the contracts themselves are are just an implementation of the protocol that has been audited and thoroughly about it in theory and so you you trust kind of the implementation of the protocol itself and when it when a defy hack happens it's usually an attacker finding something in the core protocol code uh in in solidity or whatever that that was implemented incorrectly and then actually maliciously executing that code to be able to uh with you know withdraw funds from the system without having having permission to do so now of course d5 protocols can also have like multi-sig owners uh and this is this is true for a lot of like the the d5000 in the space right now or uh or even for some of the chains where you have a multisig that is actually controls upgradability into this contract and things like that so that adds a little another layer of risk which is that even if the core protocol itself is is secure the multi-sig itself may not be in this case it was a little bit different where it's like you had only the multi-sig and no underlying protocol and the multisig itself while multisig implementations are pretty robust now and we can be generally safe in assuming that they that they're that they're not going to be be hacked unless you're like really uh building something complicated from scratch or or you know in the case of like the wormhole hack you're dealing with dependencies on it on another chain that are slightly different and you may not necessarily know what those dependencies are doing in this case what ended up happening was something a little bit different which was off chain completely separately from the code implementation you had basically you compromised the multisig signers themselves and and the attacker was was able to get control of the system by figuring out who are the people running who are the people who are able to sign for these transactions and how can i specifically target um some subset of them to steal funds that's a really interesting change i think generally speaking we haven't seen too many of these kinds of attacks in d5 largely because i think in my opinion at least in my opinion like usually by the by this point like they're the kind of key management systems and things like that are pretty robust but even even in addition to that like having a five out of nine multi-sig system that is hosting this amount of money is is a massive amount of risk and so people typically have been able to like avoid this kind of social engineering but i think a large part of it also comes down to the fact that hackers are becoming more sophisticated in the first place um and so you know they're realizing that there are more easy attack vectors than simply trying to attack the contracts themselves and the ultimately and this is something that's true widely in the security space humans are the biggest vulnerability um and like having having humans in the equation really is the biggest problem that you would need to solve in the first place yeah yeah i mean clearly obviously i'm not going to claim that i'm like some master impresario with my own passwords but i i recognize that that you know i'm sure all of us recognize that that is our own vulnerability and famously um stephon thomas of ripple had accidentally locked away his bitcoins because he came up with some really really fancy password and uh used that to lock a device that um after 10 attempts would completely lock him out of his funds if if he didn't remember it and then he didn't remember it and he was down to like seven or eight uh he had done seven or eight tries it was down to the last few but anyway so in a moment we're going to talk a little bit more about you know the bridge security

in the description back to my conversation with arjun so last piece on this social engineering bit muda gupta chief information security officer of polygon tweeted i'm 99 sure that the hacker is someone seasoned with a lot of cyber security experience not a crypto dijon kid so can you just explain what he meant there yeah um i think this this kind of goes back to what i was saying where it's like there are a very very large number of social engineering and phishing and other kinds of similar like economic even even even economic attacks that happen in in crypto most of them don't happen at this kind of scale and so we we haven't historically had to talk about them as much but you know we have a discord full of people in our community who get scammed all the time and like we we you know we try to educate them about like okay don't give people your private key don't do xyz don't approve random websites uh to spend your tokens um but these are these are all like crypto specific challenges that i think there's a massive information asymmetry around in this case i think you know the fact that we weren't dealing with those kinds of lower level scams and like phishing attempts um and we weren't dealing with either also not dealing with like somebody just hacked some solidity contracts that they happened to like look at and it was a you know it was some typically those hacks end up being something associated with like either a mistake in the implementation or some sort of like flash loan attack or something like that but instead this was much more much much more sophisticated um you know the the attacker knew a lot about these systems they knew a lot about the breakdown of the signers in the ronin bridge they knew exactly who controlled what keys and they knew how to specifically go after those people now of course it was a failure it is absolutely a massive security failure that four of the keys were actually controlled by the same core set of people uh in the same environment and so so that automatically dramatically reduces your your security right turns this uh you know uh five out of nine multisig into a two out of five uh system because all you really need to do is compromise all four of those people at once but even beyond that the way in which those people were compromised is very interesting this attacker recognized that there is this deprecated rpc that people are not using anymore realize that they could spoof a signature through that and utilize that to get for the signatures that's that that betrays a level of understanding not just of crypto but also of like like the deep intricacies of like the the security systems and security groups that were that were likely set up for all of these rp for the rpc itself and then also the validators i think the the evidence here points to the fact that this is this is like this is obviously a much more sophisticated attack right this is like level of uh in many cases exchange exchange attacks rather than what you would typically see in a defy attack where this likely required quite a bit of like meticulous planning and wasn't just oh i discovered something in the contracts some artifact of the contracts that just happened to be there yeah it sort of reminds me of the binance one um where they must have like cased it for a while yeah so sky mavis announced that i would like to reimburse all the people who lost money how likely do you think it is that they will either do this or be able to do it yeah that's a good question i mean i think you know in in previous instances like uh like again wormhole is the most recent one that comes to mind you had you know someone financially backing the system who was able to like drop hundreds of millions of dollars to to like keep the system operational after the hack happened in this case uh it's i don't know if sky mavis has that kind of institutional backing that where someone would be willing to drop that kind of money that said they are a very large organization that is generating generating a lot of revenue um and i think that that's that says something i think the other the other piece of this is is also a question of like when they would be able to reimburse so for instance even if they're not able to do it right now it's it's pretty highly likely that through chain analysis this attacker would either be found or at least some of the funds would be returned because realistically it's going to be extremely difficult to launder 650 million dollars even if you use even if you use tornado cash that's it's there's you can't really build an animated anonymity set large enough to cover uh that amount of funds at the moment and uh and like in general it's it's unclear whether you know this could go in the direction of some of the the old exchange hacks where it just sort of like lies in somebody's wallet for a very long period of time until authorities are able to track the wallet down um and i think in this case uh this wallet had specifically interacted with ftx uh in the past it's most likely like a falsified account but that does give authorities uh some lead into figuring out who the attacker might be yeah i honestly whenever i see something like this i'm a little bit like don't you know you're not going to be able to use that money you know but anyway so there's been so many hacks of bridges recently why don't you just explain a little bit further you know what exactly a bridge is and why it is that bridges seem to be where so many of the defy hacks are centered nowadays so bridges are basically mechanisms to communicate between chains they have varying levels of security and varying levels of functionality um i think you know if you if you kind of rewind into a couple of years ago like most most bridges were just like very very very simple structures that were set up to be able to interact with some side chain or something like that and they were typically run by the team uh like the chains team itself which was in in this case was true as well but they were typically run by the change team itself and they were typically just like limited to the transfer referring of certain specific kinds of funds today bridges are starting to get a lot more sophisticated in some ways but not in others um i think in general people are recognizing that that like allowing communication between chains is actually a really really incredibly valuable thing because we're starting to move towards this world where it's not really possible to scale or people are realizing it's not really possible to scale to meet the requirements of the market only on a single chain so we're kind of like fragmenting like applications and the execution on those applications to all of these different environments and now this brings up this this much more interesting problem of how do you how do you actually make it easy for users to get between these different places you know if i'm if i'm using an application on ethereum um how do i go and and like interact with you know and i have all my funds on ethereum how do i go and interact with with uh with another application running on polygon and most importantly how do i do that in a way where users are not you know putting themselves into a significant amount of risk or or the other in the spectrum having to deal with this like very very complicated process where they might not really even understand what's going on one thing that has happened in the last you know couple of years is that there's been this massive proliferation of a specific type of bridge which is multisig bridges uh which is basically at a high level is is a bridge where you have a certain subset of people uh or a certain set of people and then a certain subset of people are able to of that group are able to verify that something happened across chains correctly um and there's a there's a bunch of different mechanisms for doing this uh you know there's there's uh simple multisigs there's threshold signers there's npc systems which is multi-party computation then there's like pos bridges but effectively they have the same rough idea which is like this group of people is responsible for taking like data from here and putting it over here data or funds now the risk of multisig bridges is you have this validator set associated with the bridges and in the case of of the ronin bridge it was the nine the nine kind of signers in in this uh or in the ronin bridge multisig and uh and that validator set is likely very different than the set of people that are validating the chains themselves underlying and in most cases i have i've yet to come across very many cases where this is not true that validator set is typically much weaker as in from an economic security standpoint it's a smaller number of people that are more likely to be corruptable with less money at stake than the underlying chain and i think that will probably remain true into the long term for for chains like ethereum where you know there's it's very very unlikely that if you go and you build a multisig bridge today that you'll ever be able to achieve the level of decentralization securities ethereum because the ethereum is by far the most secure chain um most most secure programmable chain out there right now now the uh the the kind of necessary conclusion of this is that like bridges are this security vulnerability they are because at least the way that they're constructed right now you you can have these chains and attacking these chains is extremely difficult but the bridges represent this like one  in the armor where like you can potentially go and steal very very significant amounts of funds from a chain and and because now that that ecosystem uh or at least that bridge is is just much more easily attackable than anything else in the space this wasn't necessarily true for for like d5 protocols building on top of chains either because for a d5 protocol you know as long as the implementation is correct and i want to couch that in couch you know my statement in that because that's always true for any any any kind of thing that you build but as long as the implementation is correct you can trust that the the d5 project is inheriting the security of the underlying chain which is usually very very strong so that i think kind of gets into why we're starting to see a lot of bridge hacks is you know this is new technology um it's at the moment being constructed in a way which is very very high risk and is a significant step down in security compared to the chains and uh it's also growing incredibly fast because this this market has just exploded out of nowhere for for interoperability for communication across chains now there are better ways to make bridges and i think that that's something that people are now starting to realize i think this is the you know the conversation first started with the wormhole bridge hack a little while ago and now it's it's accelerated and i'm seeing an increasing number of people kind of saying we need better bridges we need better systems out there that that aren't necessarily going to rely on um you know some external set of validators that could be compromised and it's like even if even if they're not compromised even if you have excellent key management at some point you know it's a honeypot like at some point there's a there's enough money in the bridge that you know if you if you have the set of people that are running the bridge now there's five people controlling billions and billions of dollars that's that's that's an objectively bad situation and that kind of defeats the purpose of crypto in the first place and so i think people are kind of realizing that this is uh this is an unsustainable direction um we need to figure out some mechanism for building bridges where you aren't necessarily going to add this additional security assumption and i can i can kind of like jump into that if you think that would be interesting yeah yeah please do i kind of touched on multisig bridges is like one of the one of the bridges and the early really like the earliest kind of mechanism of bridging that is out there in space today but now through a lot of research that's happening in this space um and we're kind of we're trying to contribute to this as well with knex we're starting to see that there are other mechanisms for cross-chain communication the other kind of simple one that has been around for a really long time is atomic swaps and that's been just talked about for ages and it is a it is a secure bridging mechanism is this secure like um i guess swapping mechanism because uh we have understood the constraints and the risks around it for a long time and and because the risk of an atomic swap is compartmentalized to the people that are that are uh that are kind of swapping with each other but even beyond that if you want to go past like simple atomic spots too like i want to be able to do more arbitrary data passing between chains or i want to be able to like have this connection between chains that is more that doesn't require having like a counterparty that's when you get into like more interesting kinds of bridges so um the first one that that is that i think a lot of people are really are starting to become familiar with is ibc which is the the the cross-chain communication mechanism in cosmos and what ibc uses is is a with ibc you have cosmos chains basically natively validating each other you you run a light client of one chain in another chain and that light client verifies the consensus of the other chain and so you can be generally very very confident that the consensus because you verified the data coming from coming from the other chain and the the entire validator set of of the cosmos chain is verifying the data from the other cosmos chain you can be generally very confident that the security of the system ultimately just will trickle down to the security of the chains themselves which is really like the ideal now there's drawbacks to this um the primary drawback is just that it's a bespoke solution building a light client for a chain means you have to understand or for basically to communicate with another chain means you have to understand that other chain's consensus mechanism and you have to be able to replicate that consensus mechanism within the first chain that's not only not possible in many cases but it's also extremely difficult to do for every chain so if you you know if you kind of like zoom out of simply cosmos to the rest of the eth ecosystem and avalanche and all of these other ecosystems out there it's extremely heterogeneous and so that means you have to build custom implementations on each chain to be able to to run ibc everywhere i think it's it's likely that people work towards something like that but it's that's not really a solution that's going to be able to be fixed or at least like be functional within the next like couple of years i think it'll just take lots and lots of research and work to get to that point the other the other kind of bridge that i think a lot of people have started to be really interested in is zero knowledge bridges um so you know uh uh similar to to ibc in a kind of a like client based bridge utilize zero large proofs to basically validate that the the data coming from one chain is correct now in effect what you're doing with the zero knowledge bridge is actually very very similar to what you're doing with like climb bridge except it's it's heavily optimized um and there are some like slightly different trust considerations with the zero knowledge bridge you are also like verifying consensus and i think i think that once again brings up this like core problem of like okay how you're going to have to do this custom implementation for every chain and i think uh in zero knowledge this actually is exacerbated by the fact that there are some kinds of consensus mechanisms that cannot be proven in zero knowledge um because of how they work and so in those cases you do have to actually have something like a finality gadget um which which basically introduces another trust assumption that that is now another external set of people that that are verifying that something happened that can be an attack vector uh and so i in my opinion i think zero knowledge bridges are probably uh like a are sort of like a lot of people talk about them as a holy grail but i think that they they have their own set of drawbacks that that will make it difficult for them to really work in the interim before we kind of get there in the same way that like you know people the same the same sort of like criticisms that have been levied towards like zero knowledge versus optimistic roles being that you know uh it just takes time to build xero systems like these things this is new very fundamentally new math that is still being discovered while we're doing it and so it'll take time to get to the point where it's like easily applicable everywhere the last kind of bridge and this is the one that i have been uh admittedly showing a lot on twitter is optimistic bridges and i really like this construction because i think it's it's it gives us the best in-class solution today that we can use to fix the the kind of massive systemic risks around multisig bridges without having to spend years and years and years of research uh to get to the point where we have these like fleshed out constructions for zero knowledge or like client bridges and basically with an optimistic bridge it's a it's a similar kind of construction and has borrows very heavily from concepts uh from from like optimistic rollups where uh rather than saying that you have a certain set of people that is like porting data from here to here or uh you have you know the chain on the receiving like the receiving chain kind of validating the data natively instead you just relay that data optimistically just go ahead and push it to the receiving chain and then you you have a cooldown period so you have a you have a period of 30 minutes within which um anyone who is kind of watching this interaction can go and prove fraud now this is powerful because it means that unlike with a multi-sig bridge where you have an it's an nfm system so you have to you know you could you you only need to corrupt n people to be able to take control of the system with a with an optimistic bridge it's a one of m system which means a one of m honest party system which means you would need to go and figure out throughout the entire world if there is anyone anonymously watching the chain to prove fraud and if the only way to be sure that you doing like you you know fraudulently making a state update fraudulently pushing a transaction through this bridge would succeed would be if you could be sure that there was no one else in the world that was going to to try to contest your fraudulent transaction and fundamentally it's impossible to do that right that's uh it sort of the no amount of money that you there's a fixed a theoretical amount of money that you could pay to uh to corrupt or bribe a certain number like an nm bridge or a multi-sig bridge but there is no amount of money that you could pay to find out that there is not a single person in the world somewhere uh anonymously that could prove fraud and and and penalize you and similar to roll ups the the um if you do commit fraud uh there is a a penalty a slashing penalty that is applied to the person that did that fraud right the only thing about it is like when we were talking about how it took six days to find this hack like the 30 minute window seems kind of short but i guess it's that people would be incentivized in some fashion and they could earn money whereas like there was no amount of money that people could have earned if they discovered is that the difference yeah it's that's the difference and also that like in this case like i you know this is this is kind of gets into the like remove humans from the equation uh the piece which is you know in in the case of people not discovering this hack for six days it was likely because there were just no automated systems in place to even alert that this had happened whereas in the in the you know in the optimistic bridge case you you basically build infrastructure called watchers that are just watching the chain full time and all they're doing is tracking the system to approve fraud and the this is actually pretty much the exact same way that optimistic roll-ups work as well so in an optimistic roll-up uh the roll-up sequencer which is the person who is responsible for taking data from the roll-up and pushing it to ethereum could in theory create fraudulent updates they could in theory do that um but you have this this network of of watchers people like basically people who are verifying this chain or verifying this roll up who are just watching to make sure that the data that is pushed to ethereum matches with the data that is that is on the roll-up and if if that isn't true then then those watchers would like basically start start a dispute they would they would prove that fraud on chain and then that would cause the roll-up sequencer to be slashed the exact same principles or were kind of like carried over to this ecosystem or to to to bridging to create optimistic bridges as a construction okay well we will probably see how bridges start to move forward to shore up their security because i definitely don't think that the current state of things is going to continue for very long we probably will still see more hacks while they're sorting it out but hopefully not this has been a super fascinating conversation thank you so much for illuminating all of us about this hack yeah no problem and if if folks are interested in learning more about optimistic bridges i have a blog post that should be coming out definitely before this this show goes live so absolutely check that out because i think it'll give a really good explanation of the kinds of trade-offs between this kind of system or even even more generally other kinds of more secure bridging systems versus versus multi-sig system great and will that be on your medium page or where will that be yes that would be on the connex medium page that will be blog.connect.org okay perfect all right well thank you so much for coming on

shadow attack a 200-page proposal published by the u.s securities and exchange commission on tuesday could spell significant trouble for defy despite not mentioning d5 once the sec's proposal would change the definition of a government securities dealer to include entities that provide more than 50 million dollars in liquidity while not written to explicitly mention digital assets the proposal could bring d5 participants like automated market makers and liquidity providers under the jurisdiction of the sec according to delphi digital's gabriel shapiro this is an all-out shadow attack on
