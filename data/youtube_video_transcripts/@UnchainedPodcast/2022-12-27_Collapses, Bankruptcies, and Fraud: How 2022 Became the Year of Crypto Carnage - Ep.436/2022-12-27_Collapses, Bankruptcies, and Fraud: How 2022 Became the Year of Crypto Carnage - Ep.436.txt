[Music] foreign in this end of year episode of Unchained I reflect on the roller coaster year that the crypto industry endured in 2022 from the markets plummeting to the billions lost in hacks the ethereum merged the bankruptcies of FTX three Euros Capital Celsius Voyager block five and the collapse of Terra Luna a few of us could have predicted how chaotic and unprecedentedly crazy a year it would be for the crypto industry here's Kobe and Chris berniski in their retrospective on the air oh Chris I just lost my money this year meow you we both lost but we're we're both surviving yeah it's

check them out on ethereum arbitrim and optimism today January 1st Bitcoin at 47 650 eth at three thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars this was a brutal year for the crypto industry through it all I aimed to bring you valuable insights and information on the most important news 2022 will certainly go down in the history books for crypto and hopefully the industry can take away some good lessons from these challenging events just one note as we present each clip I'll be noting the Bitcoin and ether prices from the day that episode was published without further Ado let's get started February 22nd Bitcoin at thirty seven thousand eight hundred dollars ether at two thousand six hundred dollars while researching my book The kryptopian's idealism greed lies and the making of the first big cryptocurrency craze I found evidence that I believe resolves the biggest whodunit in crypto who hacked the Dow the day my book was published I revealed his name Toby honish a 36 year old programmer who grew up in Austria and was living in Singapore at the time of the hack I discussed this discovery with Stephen Ehrlich editor of Forbes crypto asset and here's my take on why the Dow hack was so important this was the most important event in ethereum's history it was the only moment that I would say was an existential crisis for ethereum ever since then of course there have been different hacks in different events but this was the only one where it really caused a massive crisis for the community and resulted in an event that depending on you know who you are and where you sit you might view it as something that sort of delegitimized ethereum or that yeah it was just a blemish on ethereum's History interestingly I did find some other people people will read about this in the book who actually thought the way it got resolved was a sign of maturity uh so that was kind of fascinating to find just a huge range of perspectives and how people viewed it I also want to give a shout out and thank you to everyone who attended my book readings and talks across the country and in England from my book tour I loved meeting you all and can't wait to do it again March 4th Bitcoin at forty thousand eight hundred dollars if at two thousand seven hundred dollars on February 24th 2022 we were hit by news outside the industry Russia had invaded Ukraine the response to the crypto Community was truly remarkable showing that this technology can be of invaluable help in times like this Tamika tillaman explains how it was used I do think that actually this has really showcased some benefits of blockchain technology so what would you say are kind of the main lessons for some people who are you know seeing blockchain being used in this way for the first time well I'd highlight four big areas where the International Community should sit up and and take very close notice the first is when it comes to moving Capital to governments the United Nations has estimated in the past that in complex environments you lose roughly 30 percent of every dollar that's deployed due to malfeasance and Corruption it takes another 15 approximately of every dollar to do auditing monitoring and evaluation so before you have done any good at all before you've helped a single person bought a single blanket you've lost 45 cents on every dollar that's deployed using traditional Legacy systems we need to be able to do a lot better than that and so using web3 architecture to move Capital into complex humanitarian emergencies is the way of the future this is how it's going to go and I think governments are going to recognize that second piece is we can get resources to individuals in need in a way that we have never been able to previously one of the reasons that ukrainians are proving so Adept in using web3 tools now is that when they ousted their their past leader who was beholden to Moscow and and somebody who was engaged in extensive corruption you'll remember that many of the ukrainians on the maidan would hold up Bitcoin addresses on signs so that people watching from the outside could Target resources to them directly because they needed Band-Aids they needed medical supplies they needed food and you could send that help precisely where it was needed to the individual so that's another huge advantage the third thing I would highlight is the importance of decentralized systems in safeguarding information when a military rolls in they're going to do two things one is destroy physical records and the other and we know that there were attempts to you uh do this using the a bug called wiper is to erase digital records the Advent of web3 platforms like our weave will provide new Frameworks for safeguarding information in the face of military attacks and and that's very consequential and important if you want to be able to rebuild quickly and effectively you need to know that your land Registries are protected you need to know that your Vital Records have been been preserved and web3 tools can help do that and the last piece that I would mention and I alluded to this earlier is that we need to be using web3 systems to preserve evidence of war crimes and atrocities unfortunately there are war crimes being committed in Ukraine and it has been very challenging in past conflicts to ensure that you have a clear chain of evidence regarding the validation of those crimes and and we can now use web3 tools to have a much higher degree of confidence in the information that's coming out of War zones and ensure that it's protected against future deletion 2022 has definitely been the year of hacks in crypto with over three billion dollars lost to protocol exploits the industry went through the 580 million dollar hack on binance's BNB bridge and the 326 million dollar Wormhole attack even though Market maker wintermute lost 160 million dollars after their wallet was compromised tarun had some Choice comments about the team so winter mute by the way has had a couple ups that have been epic and they generally tend to come from the fact that like you know when you look at like the top tier defied trading firms like the svps of the world they never make dumb mistakes like this so I think this is actually winter mute sort of technical incompetence not I would not I would not uh qualify this as a uh it's kind of like oh like we should feel totally bad and like oh it's great that they like gave us the truth on Twitter that's not true this is incompetent it's like there's a cve out like you should be like changing your systems and monitoring stuff so which means first up was when they were supposed to be a market maker for optimism and they didn't initialize the gnosis safe on optimism as they did on mainnet and then like someone figured out again a kind of like a way where like you could figure out what the sort of private key was more efficiently where you deployed to that address and you own it right they kind of up on these cyber security stuff like left and right there's a bunch of examples with them so like this is actually them being kind of like incompetent putting to runes comments aside the largest exploit of the Year happened in March when the Ronin Network and ethereum side chain used by popular web 3 game the axi infinity suffered a 624 million dollar loss unbelievably the team didn't even notice that it was missing over half a billion dollars until six days later here's Arjun bhuptani founder of connects and a bridging expert explaining how it happened the Runner network is an ethereum sidechain that is built to host the the axi ecosystem which is one of the largest like played earned games in the world right now the Ronin uh chain itself is like run by a decentralized set of validators but then Ronin has its own Ronin Bridge which connects ethereum to the Ronin chain um and the hack specifically was a hack of the Ronin bridge where Ronin Bridges you know as as nine validators and uh requires a five out of nine professional World signature to to be able to like complete transactions between chains and five all five of those validators were compromised uh leading to 650 million dollars being stolen from the bridge itself around the same time Kevin so was calling out Terra Luna saying that UST could depeg and go into a downward spiral the day this episode came out Luna was at 105 senior age based kind of like Supply contraction Supply expansion type of designs that don't have any external backing underneath it or any kind of external collateral I think pretty much those will all fail one month later Kevin was proved right if there's one event that set off the crypto contagion of 2022 it's that Tara a blockchain founded by Korean developer dokwan and valued at over 60 billion dollars at its peak collapsed to zero in a matter of days here's aceb explaining what happened Sarah for those who are unaware it's a layer one blockchain built on Cosmos and the core the core asset of Terra is a stable coin called UST and essentially on I think it was May 9th over the weekend and kind of going into Monday the Terra UST stable coins Peg broke the market was more broadly declining due to some uh macro events that were going on a few about interest rates and as the the price of Terra started declining so price of Luna which is the kind of quarter layer one asset that backs UST started declining in price uh the USD Peg broke and one thing led to another the there was basically what we call a death spiral meaning that as the peg lowered the confidence in the system lowered even further there was more and more algorithmic minting of Luna and expansion and supply of Luna which resulted eventually in Luna hyperinflation over the period of that time uh Luna ended up expanding its Supply by 18 000 times it basically underwent a Zimbabwe style hyperinflation event UST ended up cratering to something on like 20 cents or less on the peg I don't know what it's trading at now it and we saw within the course of a week the first time I've ever seen this in crypto an asset dropped 100.0 percent on in terms of the unit price on coin market cap literally the the price had gotten so low that from the high of sixty dollars before the unwind Tara ended up cratering to fractions of a penny such that um it had to get delisted from all the major exchanges nobody none of the major exchanges anymore trade Tara the Terra meltdown due to its size and the fact that so many retail investors were involved with UST attracted the attention of mainstream media and Regulators in Washington Alta andoni general counsel at Eva Labs shared her opinion on Unchained the question how do we regulate stapled coins and what we do as an industry after this USC Luna collapse I think in my opinion they're completely distinct and super different from each other I think that if we're referring to the USC and Luna collapse probably we have to address the majority of the questions should be how can we stop this sort of large-scale financial fraud that is happening in the space but I think that summarizing the the two probably is not going to be fair for for our industry Tara Luna was the first Domino to fall next people became concerned about Celsius a centralized crypto lending and staking platform on June 11th CEO Alex machenski tweeted Mike do you even know one person who has a problem with drawing from Celsius why spread fud and misinformation on June 12th the very next day Celsius paused withdrawals a month later it filed her bankruptcy here's Mika hakan solo I think you have to take a few steps back here and one of the words being used all the time right now is Contagion and how things affect each other and this problem probably really starts from the the Luna UST debacle and it's likely that they were quite exposed to that that means that there's some amount of money that they expected to be tied to the US dollar that simply went to zero and based on how large those losses are mixed in with some suspected D5 law set that they have they've had over over the last year that's what really put them in a bad position so it really comes down to risk management Within These firms and it's just that this company doesn't seem to have done a good job and and it's really as simple as that all the due diligence for understanding that what the downside case may be with Luna and UST that was available there all the issues that STDs may have that was all available there it's just that I think during the bull market no one was really doing too much due diligence everyone's just jumping into things and this is the end result when things become adverse and suddenly not everything goes up and you have to really think about what should be the correct price for some of these assets do June 17th Bitcoin at twenty thousand seven hundred dollars and eth at eleven hundred dollars Celsius was followed by another Domino as crypto hedge fund three arrows Capital also known as Vic went bust the fund was run by two former Forex Traders Kyle Davies and suju who were living in Singapore and turned a single Millions fund into billions of dollars however its exposure to the Terra Luna meltdown hurt the hedge fund significantly and after losing some high leveraged bets they filed for bankruptcy haseeb explains why the 3ac Meltdown was bad for the industry they lost tons and tons of money but it turns out they didn't just lose their own money normally and I want to make this clear because I think a lot of people don't understand why the three Arrow story is so bad normally if you get a big trade and you lose a bunch of your own money it's fine it's not a big deal right funds go to zero all the time if you went to zero somebody else made the money people do feel better against each other it's it that's how markets work right but three arrows was borrowing tons of money from other people and they were also not telling their counterparties exactly how much leverage they were taking on and exactly who they were borrowing from and so it turned out they borrowed so much of other people's money that they lost uh so much money that they went into negative equity meaning that they owed more money than they had and that is really bad that is way worse than going to zero because when you go negative that means that now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet somebody else is absorbing the loss that you took by gambling like crazy and the people who are absorbing those losses are basically the crypto lenders or you know you can sort of think of the lenders as the crypto banks these are people who are basically involved in the act of money creation and so some of their big lenders include blockfi Genesis Voyager U Celsius also blender to three arrows highly likely highly okay yes highly likely and so it turns out that a lot of the money in crypto a lot of the lenders in crypto we're extending credit to three arrows and this credit was under collateralized and so now they're massively in the hole so when the banks lose money this is extremely bad because this now means that the banks need to control their risk and the way they control their is because they now realize they're down a ton they need to start recalling their loans to other people because they don't know who else got hurt they don't know who else is down so they start recalling loans everywhere a bunch of people suddenly start getting margin called and these people are getting margin called they might not have the cash on hand so they need to start selling some assets in order to meet the margin call or to go repaid alone and in this situation you get a bunch of people selling at the same time and not only that but liquidity is worse because the market makers who are who are managing the liquidity and keeping markets liquid they're also getting their loans recalled they also have less money so they can't keep markets liquid and the end result is just a meltdown and so that's what we saw over the last couple of weeks we saw this massive fear around exactly how bad was three arrows in negative how much money did the banks lose how much of these loans are getting recalled and how long is the selling going to take and that's caused an absolute wreckage in the crypto markets where at times we actually saw Bitcoin and ether sell off more than the alts which is extremely rare and that's a sign basically that what's happening is forced it's not a people have lost confidence in Bitcoin and ethereum it's that something really bad has happened in the market and now you have for selling three AC's implosion also had some contingent effects in fact Voyager digital had to Halt withdrawals as well and subsequently filed for bankruptcy after 3ac failed to repay a 650 million dollar loan what's the most important thing about crypto it's not

further August 18th Bitcoin at twenty three thousand dollars eth at eighteen hundred dollars another big story this year was the sanctions by the U.S treasury Department on tornado cash a decentralized virtual currency mixer that enables private transactions crypto Advocates protested since the authorities did not ban a particular group or address but instead banned an entire smart contract last week we saw Treasury and the office of foreign asset control also called ofac they issued the first ever sanctions against a smart contract those not tornado cash the company it was not the people who are involved in tornado cash but rather the sanctioned entities include tornado cash quote unquote which is not a legal entity it's just the name of a project and then specifically the list of a certain number of contracts in tornado cash which are mostly on ethereum natural cash actually has other contracts on other chains so Trader cash exists on BSC it exists on arbitrum they were apparently not sanctioned but the ethereum contracts itself were sanctioned the sanctions also highlighted how a lack of clear regulatory framework as well as regulation by enforcement heard the industry tree and kicked off a debate about whether the government overstepped its bounds Jerry Brito explains I think ofac made a mistake here for several reasons right so one reason I think is that they may have overstepped their Authority as I was just saying so number one ofac is authorized by Statute and executive order in its own regular regulations it's authorized to designate persons and entities yeah and adds up to the sdn list and what a entity is is defined in their regulations and then once you've designated a certain person or entity their property is blocked or Frozen without going through too much detail because we'll do that in our in our extensive analysis it may be the case and I think it's a very good case that these immutable smart contracts that make up the tornado cash application are not an entity right so they're not subject they can't be added properly to the SD analyst September 16th Bitcoin nineteen thousand six hundred dollars eth fifteen hundred dollars while this year brought no shortage of bad news bankruptcies and hacks one event brought momentary relief in crypto following years of hard work ethereum successfully transitioned from using proof of work to proof of stake what was for many people one of the most important technological achievements in the short history of crypto Justin Drake explains his significance so the fact that the merge was successful for one second is already a huge breakthrough the fact that it was successful one minute is a huge breakthrough 10 minutes a whole day a whole week a whole month a whole year and I think if it can survive the next few days the next few weeks next few months this is a high high confidence that you know this is this is reliable I must also highlight that the proof of stake chain has been running for a very long period of time it's been running for you know over a year and a half now it's the most secure blockchain in the world now it has 20 billion dollars of Economic Security and also unlike proof of work chains it has the ability to recover from 51 attacks thanks to slashing and the ability to identify and remove attackers if and why when there is an attack the merge going seamlessly was a major milestone for ethereum with the additional changes in each monetary policy many said each could challenge Bitcoin as digital gold Arthur Hayes disagreed I think people in my opinion don't understand what ethereum actually is ethereum is not money because money has no use ethereum has use you use it to use to power the applications on this network Bitcoin has no use it's just money just like the dollar has no use it's just money and that's why it's a good form of money because its value cannot be conflated with actual utility of other stuff and so because ethereum's goal is to be this decentralized compute for you know this this digital existence let's say that the deflation gets so severe that it becomes so expensive that nobody uses it because gas prices gets too high because of the inflation rate well guess what's going to happen they're going to change the inflation rate because it doesn't it contradicts the goal of ethereum being a decentralized computer that people can actually use October 18th Bitcoin at 19 600 eth at thirteen hundred dollars in October six months after the blow-up of Tara dokwan came on Unchained to discuss his legal case whether he was sorry or not the moment of the USD Peg what happened with all the crypto held by terraform labs and the Luna Foundation guard and why he doesn't want to talk about his location this clip is from a trailer we released of the interview a South Korean court has issued a warrant for your arrest and even said the Interpol issued a red notice for you why have you not returned to Korea I haven't been living in South Korea so it wouldn't be accurate to say returning to South Korea so these tweets would seem to imply that you are still in Singapore are you in Singapore or are you not it's not in the interest of let's say being on the run or something like that that I don't want to disclose where I live and this is what he had to say when I asked him about his arrogant tweets so I I think I got too much carried away with interacting with other people on crypto Twitter so like the industry lingo for this is called ship posting right so I think in retrospect I should have held myself to uh sort of a more stringent standard so you know just because there's Anonymous cartoon characters that are shall we say more liberal with the words that they're using does not mean that I should have followed suits in the tarot Wipeout thousands of people lost their life savings and at least one person committed suicide while many believe that dokwon was responsible and is also a fraudster it could also be argued that Terra Luna simply failed still Quan offered an apology whether you believe him or not is up to you so you said that you take full responsibility I didn't hear words like I'm sorry or I apologize but do you want to offer an apology oh yes I I I am sorry I I think and it could seem you know with the way that we've been responding to allegations and use reports and things like that that were being defensive or something like that but that is absolutely not the case I believed in the stability of USP and I do understand that my beliefs and statements about how stable and safe uski would be led a lot of uh you know Traders and you know holders without the tools to understand the complex economic mechanisms uh underpinning UST to gain confidence in a system that ultimately failed and I I do apologize and I do own up to you know the full responsibility of that the only thing that we are attempting to do is that in the process of people dealing with disgrief uh there's been a lot of people making allegations like you know it was a fraud or dopon probably shorted UST or there was theft or investment going on while it is easy to think this entire thing crashed because it was a scam or to point fingers to you know somebody and just assume there was some theft going on or something like that that was absolutely not the case November 1st Bitcoin at twenty thousand five hundred dollars an eth at sixteen hundred dollars this fall we saw a trend of nft marketplaces eliminating Creator royalties in October magic Eden the largest nft Marketplace on Solana announced it would give buyers the option to pay creators however much they wanted in royalties the decision kick-started an interesting debate on whether craters should earn royalties on secondary sales and whether it's even possible to enforce that on ethereum nfts Legion spoke for the pro-royalty side I think the raison d'etra of nfts in general is to support the Creator economy nfts were very much envisioned as this new monetization method for the Creator economy that allowed creators to tap into digital scarcity for the first time ever and to be able to monetize based off of something that could actually be scarce and so it's like the entire Market's appeal has been to creators to Independent creators because of this and I think undermining Creator royalties is kind of like biting the hand that feeds you it's undermining the reason why people are there in the first place and over the last few years a lot of web 2 platforms have realized that they need to be more Creator friendly because they've they realize that the entire value chain of their social networks of their content platforms start with creators if you don't make creators happy if you don't feel if creators don't feel like they're being taken care of then ultimately they turn and that leads to the demand side the user side churning as well and so I think the entire value equation here in the nft world also starts with creators obviously and so we need to do everything in our power to ensure that creators feel like they're playing a fair game that they're being taken care of that the marketplace isn't just skewed towards the incentives of the buy side however here has he presents the other side of the argument the idea of enforcing royalties it reminds me a lot of um do you guys know John Deere the company that builds like tractors and you know a lot of farming equipment so there have been a lot of famous Anti-Trust cases against John Deere because John Deere what they do is they force your tractor to only be used by you which kind of destroys the resale value of your tractor right so if you have a track you want to stop somebody tough  like you have to do all the stuff I believe this is how it works right there's all the stuff that that John Deere forces you to to do in order to actually resell the tractor which makes the resale value of the tractor plummet right because you just can't sell it as easily as you could if it was just an unbranded uh you know piece of hardware this is the exact same thing that empty royalties are and a few royalties are a way of saying you cannot buy and sell this freely if you do I will extract a tax now if you can enforce that fair game okay fine you can enforce it but if you can't enforce it I know exactly where this is going every single time which is that people will find a way to to win out of this pressure that you're putting on them in the market November 9th Bitcoin at sixteen thousand dollars ethereum at eleven hundred dollars as we are approaching the end of the year things are settling down a little bit and then came in November 2nd that day coindesk's Ian Allison published a story about Alameda research Sam bankman Freed's trading shop which showed that alameda's balance sheet was quite illiquid and not only that but about 40 percent of it consisted of ftx's token ftt after this Revelation Finance CEO Ching Fang Zhao announced he would sell binance's Holdings of ftt which triggered a bank run on FTX and here I'm using air quotes since technically a bank run shouldn't be possible on a crypto Exchange within a few days Sam bigman Freed's crypto Empire collapsed essentially Sam pengman freed has took or had two companies when was the trading firm Alameda research and then the other was the exchange FTX and for the longest time you know the last time he was on my show I did ask him about you know this kind of apparent conflict of interest and he said you know they're two separate entities yes I own both but there's like a wall between them and actually other people that I've interviewed um who interacted with them like third parties said that their interactions were that FTX and Alameda were very different in their minds so that was really interesting of essentially a few weeks ago coindesk reported on the financials of Alameda and it showed that alameda's balance sheet was heavily reliant on ftt tokens which were tokens created by the FTX exchange they offered kind of like discounts and stuff for activities you would do on the exchange and it was you know to the point where it showed like basically this is a very illiquid balance sheet you know if they were to actually try to recoup what they're showing here value-wise on their balance sheet it you know it wouldn't work and CZ uh the CEO of Finance happened to have 580 million dollars of FDT tokens on finances balance sheet because years ago he had invested in FTX and once they became competitors Sam bought him out of his stake and part of the payment was an ftt token so CZ tweeted that he was going to be selling his steak and Caroline the Caroline Ellison the CEO of Alameda research tweeted I will buy your ftt from you at 22 and so of course because it's crypto Twitter everyone's like what's the importance of 22 dollars yeah so essentially um sees me said no we're not going to do this in a closed doorway I'm going to sell all the tokens um on the open market and the FDT price kind of held up for a short while but then it began to collapse and people became concerned about their funds on FTX so there was a bank run and later Sam said that it was five billion dollars of customer deposits that were being withdrawn on the Sunday alone which was Sunday I guess November 6th and he during that time was you know saying things like assets on FTX are fine The Exchange is fine we're just processing withdrawals blah blah blah and then we all woke up last Tuesday morning to the news that things were not fine and they actually needed potentially binance to buy them to you know resolve their one of that time maybe people might have thought were liquidity issues then ultimately um after binance backed out it became very clear that this was much more than than something like that and not only that it was insolvency but it was likely fraud here's what Eric Voorhees and Kobe had to say as the situation had only just begun to play out private parties trying to get good deals and make a profit on the deals with their own property is one thing and I'm not so concerned about like a conflict of interest between those two firms there clearly was because they were grown by the same people to a large degree the problem here is lending out customer money without telling the customers and then going a step further and acting as though you're not and and dismissing others in the industry for doing the same thing that was being done at that moment that's that's the egregious Behavior here it is appalling that Sam would be speaking to Regulators about like counterparty Risk and the safety of customer deposits while at the same time being insolvent with his own customers that's like um sociopathic behavior and and is just downright fraud yeah yeah I 100 agree with Eric like the the other stuff you mentioned you know like opening markets so that Alameda or other entities close to FTX like friends um Can hedge these bags that they've got cheaply they can you know effectively proxy sell on purpose coins that they have locked and not supposed to sell for four years to take advantage of you know this High fdv type low float setup is maybe anti-customer or the markets are much more useful to insiders than they are to uh like retail Traders but it's just a totally different degree of thing than just stealing customer deposits and lying about stealing customer deposits and part of the reason I'm I would say this I would never have guessed they were insolvent is they sort of had the game rigged in their favor right so like they were able to do these things with these markets that allow them an advantage over any other Market participant such that they should just be printing so much money all of the time like they had the exchange they owned the venue they had all the data for people's positions on the venue they had markets that they wanted to hedge their own positions like they were off venue and somehow they still managed to lose 10 billion dollars like it doesn't make sense they must have been the worst traders of all time FTX then filed for bankruptcy and SPF stepped down as CEO to be replaced by John Ray III a restructuring expert who oversaw and runs bankruptcy instead of FTX never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information has occurred here Kevin so founder of galwa capital who by the way lost a huge amount of assets on FTX described warning signs he saw from the very beginning I'll even share a really kind of random story about when we met we met Alameda first before they started FTX sometime in 2018 late 2018 or early 2019 and I actually distinctly remember talking to them about accounting systems and this is you know before FTX existed so this is just for alameda's accounting systems and you know what they were saying is that yeah you know at the end of the day you know we do our best to try and reconcile we spend you know some time half an hour or a couple hours I forget exactly how much time they said but they spent some amount of time at the end of every day to try and reconcile the records but then they're like you know at the end of the day sometimes you know you just can't get to the right number and you know if it's plus or minus 10 grand 100 grand which back in the day was a lot of money right you know they said well you know let's move on to the next day right so I think you know you know looking back there were so many different signs like that that I think in retrospect were sort of uh clear warning signs and signals for the risks that were to come but at the time you know we didn't really think too much of it right so it's just you know it's one of those things where hindsight is um you know definitely 2020. the collapse of FTX sparked further contagion one of the firms affected was Genesis and its parent company digital currency group or dcg here's Sam Andrew's explanation of the situation the second problem is with dcg now usually how companies organized you have separate entities each one is ring fest with his own assets and his own liabilities and that provides some form of security for all these different entities it operated that's how dcg is set up as a parent company with its various assets however there's a key problem here and that is what was revealed in a tweet from dcg CEO is that there's actually 1.6 billion dollars of loans that went from Genesis to dcg so that creates another problem is that if Genesis were to go bankrupt right which it's potentially on the path of doing then Genesis creditors enforce on genesis's assets the largest asset on genesis's balance sheet is alone it made Genesis made the dcg so all of a sudden by enforcing all that asset dcg gets brought into Genesis bankruptcy proceedings that is why these two entities are now intrinsically linked is because if one fall the other one Falls and that is I mean critical to understand as to how these two entities are now tied together the Doom of one being Genesis will impact the fate of dcg the final big news of the year was the criminal charges against Sam pengmanfried and his arrest which I discussed with Arie RedBoard Monday night Sam bankman freed the former CEO of FTX was arrested by Bahamian authorities at the behest of the United States Tuesday morning which was the time when SBF was supposed to testify in front of the house committee on Financial Services the Securities and Exchange Commission the commodity Futures Trading commission and the department of Justice's southern district of New York all either unsealed or published their charges against svf can you walk us through all of these charges I mean normally we see one of the types of things that you just mentioned right we have multiple Regulators taking action you mentioned the cftc which really is talking more about Market manipulation you know the activities that SBF undertook at um at FTX uh you know what what impact did they have on what what the cftc calls the Commodities market right more sort of the Bitcoin ethereum ecosystem then you have the SEC which is slightly different right the SEC is the Securities regulator so what they're talking about is potential Securities fraud what representations did he make that ultimately defrauded investors and manipulated the Securities market and finally and and in my opinion you know having spent a lot of time at doj sort of the most interesting is the criminal indictment that was unsealed this week that includes eight charges of wire fraud Securities fraud that talks about actually um uh campaign Finance fraud and really sort of laid starts to lay out what a case here will look like and one of the reasons I say sort of most interesting is is a lot of people are sort of wondering well how do all these cases happen at one time and how do we deal with this and the reality is that those those regulatory cases the the Civil actions those are about money they're ultimately enforcement actions about sort of trying to you know get restitution for victims or ultimately a fine those will take a back seat to the doj criminal prosecution because that case involves you know potential incarceration deprivation of Liberty the types of things that sort of go first and and SBF has constitutional rights and one of those rights is sort of not to necessarily testify but that would mean that he couldn't do depositions and couldn't provide interrogatories in the civil cases so those will take a back seat uh as these criminal charges progress December 20th Bitcoin at 16 900 an eth at twelve hundred dollars while crypto is still in the depths of a bear market and 2022 was the year of cryptocarnage it's not all doom and gloom if you are here listening to this podcast you probably believe that crypto is here to stay and that all the failures this year will only make the crypto industry stronger Chris berniski put it best here's a more uplifting note I was thinking about this earlier so one thing is the cause of like the last decade or you know I've seen some people saying it'll be six years until we have a new high or whatever I think those will ultimately be looked back upon as markers of like the sentiment bottom of like how horrible things got I think that the and and this is where you know some of my training comes from Kathy Wood where like the rate of change that we're seeing in the world is so fast and we kind of forget that but that underlies a lot of the protocols and companies you know within crypto within AI within Tech at large and so like I don't believe in the last decade I don't believe in six years until another boom so that's one thing I want to say the other thing is I think a decent way to stay sane in Bear markets is to stop looking at dollar amounts or dollar net worth and look at unit amounts of the crypto assets you care about and I try to never really fixate on like dollar net worth of course like how I manage placeholder I have to like produce uh results for for my investors but but specific to myself personally I'm pretty much always thinking in units of the assets and that's what I care about and maybe that's where you know I'm just I I drink the Kool-Aid enough where like like I'm stoked to be building significant unit position sizes of certain assets and so then I don't really care what the dollars are that that would be my advice I guess to people is like focus on the units you want to get to if you want to make yourself happy you can always say if all these assets got back to their former all-time high then you know these units would be worth you know a certain dollar amount you know that's like some hopium not all assets will get back to their all-time high but the quality ones will go multiples of their prior all-time high right and so that's where you have to pick carefully but just focus on the units focus on the units and stake and you'll be fine and and the last thing sorry the last last thing is I very strongly believe that like crypto has years for buying and for selling and so I don't even think about selling this year next year whatever like it's just not even not even an action I'll really take I just think about buying and on a year like last year I don't even really think about buying in the public market that much I just think about selling and so you know kind of and that's a very kind of glacial way to move Capital but it keeps me more sane as opposed to like trying to time every single thing and so it's just like oh things go down more there's even more opportunity I can stack even more units and I guess that's one way that I keep myself optimistic and happy in this current environment thanks so much for joining us today and thanks so much for joining us throughout this year to learn more about what happened this year in crypto I guess you can just listen to the archive and check the show notes for this episode
