not a dividend It's A Tale of Two fun now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet generally speaking airdrops are kind of pointless anyways um my name's trading firms who are very involved I like to have the ultimate D5 Protocols are the antidote to this problem all right hello everybody Welcome to The Chopping Block every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry insiders perspective on the crypto topics of the day so quick intros first we got Tom the D5 Maven and master of memes next up we've got Robert the crypto connoisseur and captain of compound then we've got tarun the Giga brain and Grand Puba at Gauntlet and finally you've got myself a massive the head hype man of dragonfly all four of us are early stage investors in crypto but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice legal advice or even life advice please see choppingblock.xyz for more disclosures all right so it has been an interesting week because markets for the first time in a long time are actually up we've seen crypto and ALT rally really significantly basically about 30 plus in the last week which has been uh you know it's been down only essentially since you know the since fall and this is the first time that we've seen some signs of life in the markets uh there's been some macro Tailwinds so you know broader uh growth assets are doing well but we've seen crazy run-ups especially in alt at once like Solana you know on one of the previous shows we were talking about how Solana seemed to have been put in its grave after the collapse of FTX Solana is now back up to where it started up Aptos is up over 300 uh liquid steak and rotors are up like crazy the l2s are are driving hard what have you guys been noticing in this market and what do you think is driving all this I just want to say I'm happy that I I on this show said that uh Solana hit it going under 10 was their eth 88 dollar moment you did say that you did say that you're always the the Solana you know uh light at the end of the tunnel guy I just think I just think it's really hard to build communities that don't disappear on like the moment the price is down and like they have done that and you you have to like in this industry I think that that goes probably the farthest of anything there's a lot of metrics still look really good right they are one of the most in terms of daily actives one of the most used blockchains still in existence so I was I I was definitely surprised at how aggressively it sold off you know today it's sitting at around like 23 24 dollars and it's sold to below 10 which I thought was just bananas like it became like number 30 or something uncoin market cap despite the fact that it's still one of the only household names among letter one blockchains so now it's gone back and reclaimed its Throne which seems which seems appropriate I mean Solana still has issues and of course defy on Solana has gotten completely destroyed and we now have the you know the mango markets case is starting to play out and so you know I think there's uh there's there's definitely headwinds facing Solana but it clearly should be sitting higher than a lot of of these you know zombie L ones that are sitting somewhere in the top 30. yeah it feels like some of this is narrative driven right with like the Shanghai upgrade coming up people getting excited about it was taking derivatives and you know withdrawals coming up and making maybe making you know some of those um assets more attractive but um part of it also seems to be kind of uncorrelated we were talking a little bit about like optimism's retro airdrop period um stop and so like their transactions just kind of totally fall off a cliff in the past few days and yet the token is still doing quite well so there's definitely a lot of beta there's maybe a little bit of alpha in some of these sectors but and then obviously yeah a lot of the macro Tailwinds it looks like some of it was liquidation driven so yeah all things kind of kind of combined I also want to say I think that 2021 like this is a very boring reason and a reason that doesn't apply to all of crypto but I think a significant portion of crypto which is 2021 taxes probably took people an insane amount of time to do and I think the first time people probably could have like figured out their true ability to make new purchases may have been January 2023. so there might just be some very boring systematic stuff like that because like I know in normal Finance like a lot of people I know basically said something akin to that for like why their funds were like Net Zero in the market for the last six months and then started investing again so yeah I heard you know some speculation that people were afraid of funds being wound down or redemptions that were you know dated for January uh and so now that we're past those presumably past the The Lion's Share of those it just kind of you know there's a certain degree of seller exhaustion that you just run out of people who want to sell and once all the assets rotate in stronger hands and it's like okay well we're kind of done another element of it must surely be that people people were very worried about contagion after FTX and of course we saw some of that with Genesis which we'll talk about at some length today it's kind of like okay well who else is going to fall it's like it doesn't really seem like there's that many other dominoes that are that closely situated at this point it's like okay we kind of know what's going to happen and What markets hate more than anything is uncertainty so once that uncertainty subsides at least to a degree it makes it easier for markets to sort of get repriced uh without people you know being being afraid of uh being in the line of fire so now that said liquidity is still pretty bad and obviously a lot of people have gotten hurt over the last few months so you don't want to be too sanguine a very relatively small moves can affect the market in a very large way with liquidity being the shallow so um you know who knows where it goes from here but it is a it's definitely a good opening to a new year and I hope that things I hope that things continue with this trend because last year was so brutal and it was brutal just end to end right there was almost no respite last year so having a nice kind of 30 rally to to start off the year I think bodes well for the industry having just like a little bit of good news every once in a while I think is healthy but with that good news being acknowledged let's move on to the bad news so Genesis has filed for bankruptcy so the last time we were talking we were um uh we were we were detailing the back and forth between dcg and Gemini Gemini of course is the biggest creditor to Genesis Genesis is subsidiary of dcg and there was this big fight going on and there was a there was a speculation that the creditors of Genesis may decide to negotiate a pre-packaged bankruptcy okay so pre-packard bankruptcy basically means that instead of fighting it out in bankruptcy court you decide exactly how the pie is going to get split up in the bankruptcy what the settlements are going to be but the bankruptcy court itself basically just Shepherds this agreement along make sure that it gets instantiated but everybody already knows what they're getting and how things are going to get done so that allows the bankruptcy to be much less expensive and move much faster so there's speculation that this was going to happen and the way it was going to be structured was some cash paid out of front a forbearance period meaning that people were going to be patient and wait to get the rest of their their uh consideration back and then they were also going to get some Equity conversion into dcg so creditors to Genesis would own equity in dcg and they would get some payouts over time uh from dcg right that that was roughly how this negotiation was going but apparently this negotiation fell apart because Genesis was pushed into bankruptcy we don't know yet by whom uh it could have been you know it's really hard to tell it could have been uh Gemini at this point because it's very clear that even after the bankruptcy was initiated Cameron is still coming after dcg still Tweeting that dcg is acting in bad faith and they were forced to do this because you know they these guys are stonewalling them um but now in in you know the stakes are higher now that they're in bankruptcy Robert you have any any color on like how exactly they were entered into bankruptcy yeah Genesis itself um filed for bankruptcy so it wasn't an involuntary bankruptcy filing Genesis pushed themselves into bankruptcy I see and and so why do you think they decided to file themselves into bankruptcy given that presumably it's worse for everyone than a in you know negotiated settlement yeah it's a great question so you know the first day hearings are tomorrow in advance of that um you know a number of piece of information that documents have been filed I would recommend everyone read them for themselves as opposed to getting a non-lawyer such as myself's opinion on them but you can find the documents at restructuring.ra.croll.com Genesis and there's a lot here already I'll give a quick rundown of my personal read of them which could contain inaccuracies so don't take it as gospel read the documents for yourself inform your own opinions but um there was a huge amount of information that goes through who the creditors are and the rough state of the business this is like in preparation for the first day hearings this was provided by Genesis the business doesn't sound like it's in great shape you know the biggest question is who how many assets do they actually have and how much do they owe people based on you know a quick read of it they had a lot less cash on hand and digital assets than most people would think which means the whole is potentially a lot bigger than has been reported by Genesis by dcg Etc the more interesting thing is that you know there was a you know pre-packaged bankruptcy plan that was filed now this plan is not what the rumors on Twitter were where there would be a forbearance period and that there would be you know some dcg equity and all of this the plan which you can find on the documents um is actually really simple it says either the creditors agree to equitization and they wind up owning this business which by the way the business is probably a worthless husk of a business even if it restarts operations or they don't agree and it's pushed into liquidation if it goes through liquidation there's actually two classes of creditors which get treated differently and having any creditors treated differently is always a huge red flag and pretty weird but it proposes that there's Genesis uh Gemini as a creditor group and quote institutional borrower institutional creditors as the other group and they actually get treated differently so the way it's worded and I can see that this plan is probably not going to get approved because it seems ridiculous on its face but the way it's worded is there's a trust set up with all of the assets to be sold you know to distribute to all of the creditors whether they're you know Gemini earned creditors or whether they're institutional creditors in a pro-rounded basis for the institutional creditors there's still like a to be concluded like dollar amount it's like an empty input field but it says dcg will contribute some unknown amount of money as a dcg contribution on top for the institutional creditors um so that could be one dollar that could be one billion dollars it could make the creditors whole it could not make them whole it's unknown like the outcomes wildly different based on how big that dollar sign is it's probably based on them selling off assets like coindesk and whatever and then using that to plug the hole I have no idea what the number would be and it says for Gemini creditors there be a Gemini contribution so I think it was like deliberately like and I'm not a lawyer but like it seemed like a slap in the face intentionally towards Gemini which is like oh for those other guys we're gonna kick in money and for you you're gonna have to kick in money so retail doesn't get screwed in some proportion you know I don't know who would approve this plan and how I think the idea is that Barry used to work in restructuring and all of this stuff I think the idea is that there's some Game Theory where if the dcg contribution is large enough there's enough non-gemoni creditors to approve this plan and screw over Gemini and come out okay um and then you know Barry can raise his hands and say like mission accomplished you know we did great you know there's a successful resolution and everyone's happy and you know comes out of bankruptcy very quickly but you know we'll see what happens it's you know tomorrows are the first day hearings and you know there's gonna be a lot of information that comes out and a lot of analysis that comes out I think all of our opinions are going to evolve very quickly in the next couple days and weeks quick question just as a a moment of levity who do you think will generate more fees for bankruptcy laws uh SPF FTX or uh dcg Slash Gemini definitely FTX but by like 10 times by far I'm just curious like I was watching the Madoff uh uh you know and Netflix special and like I I didn't realize that the the trustee had a billion I thought they got earned like 100 million so I was off by a factor of 10. so that's why I was kind of curious about your estimates of this because it it is actually a quite a large chunk of change in a lot of cases well so remember that dcg is one of the largest interested parties here so they have a like with FTX FTX was basically abandoned right like all the FTX leadership is gone and so there is really nobody to kind of keep the show orderly right so the lawyers can just kind of they're just you know they can basically just pick it apart and there's there's almost no limitations provided that a bankruptcy judge doesn't think that they're like way out of line so like with FTX there was a story about Sullivan and Cromwell basically like swooping in like vultures and just flagrantly charging massive fees and and you know routing around all these conflicts of interest which nobody could stop right because there's nobody really there to run the show uh besides the lawyers whereas in the case of Genesis and dcg like dcg has a real interest in in maximizing the recovery because of course they're one of the people who are going to participate in that recovery so um Gemini as well so I don't think this is the same kind of situation and the complexity of the bankruptcy is going to be quite a lot lower than FTX right like FTX I mean people are projecting it's going to take multiple years this one is probably not even took a year including my guess you think less than a year that's your prediction I believe so I mean I don't know Robert what do you think I think if people can agree to a pre-packaged set of terms it'll be pretty quick I think if they don't it's a total cluster if there's lawsuits from the WinCo by twins I mean you know if anything is contested I think this you know gets dragged out dramatically um there's already people contesting someone like the very simple facts that have already come out like a number of creditors have stood up and say like hey you got the amount that I'm owed completely wrong like one example is like you know Cumberland came out and said you know oh it says you owe us like 18 or 19 million and like that's wrong you owe us forty thousand dollars like you know like there's already confusion and dispute of some basic facts and you know there's another one that came out another creditor came out and said 150 million dollar you know credit was you know Incorrect and that you know the filing was an incredibly sloppy manner you know in both these cases it seems like they were like potentially overestimating the total dollar value of the creditors uh potentially also underestimating the dollar value of the assets but you know potentially to like you know spook everyone into a rapid settlement you know so I think like there might be facts that get disputed along the way I think people are going to you know have to figure out you know who owes whom what and like if they can't even agree on the basics then this becomes a lot harder um especially as it relates to Gemini earn who's going to be negotiating pretty hard congrats on not being one of the uh top 50 unsecured creditors by the way yeah no one wants to be in the top 50. that would be really unfortunate is that a congrats or is that like a you know would you rather you know it's like you'd rather be in one of the top 50 creditors because it means you know you have more you have more money to potentially recover that's right yeah no it could also mean you were smart enough to remove your money prior to the that's another way to look at it so but but okay actually can we just take two seconds to talk about the list of the top 50 because there were some very weird people like I was like buy bit the Stellar Foundation decentraland like I mean to Central and I guess like if I remember correctly during the pandemic Barry was always showing it on Twitter I I but so I'm guessing he owned a bunch but well they also have the grayscale Mana trust right um right right yeah that's right yeah a bunch of interesting names I mean one there there were two um so the three big businesses are four I guess big businesses that seem to be entwined in the top 50 creditor list so one is van Eck which of course is you know trying to run some of these ETFs uh Abra which is uh you know another institutional lender or I don't know if you call them institutional but they're another lender and then um donut which is one of these um what are they called sort of crypto Neo Banks also why do they call D5 Molotov because it's uh business in the front the party in the back I guess this is maybe the opposite and that it was actually not a D5 mullet and it was just putting on Genesis yeah it was kind of the opposite it's almost like you know retail this is just a buzz cut yeah what's the inverse of a mullet yeah I like I I really don't gains really big bangs really big bags okay well they got banged pretty good at this one well other creditors drw of course has contested ow donor of Cumberland who they say that they're not actually big creditors Mirana which is affiliated with by bit Stellar Foundation another big creditor now a bunch of the creditors are still redacted um so we actually don't know who they are I was actually I was surprised Robert to to your point like you know with FTX there was so much fog of War because the record keeping was so terrible that you know that's also part of the reason why I think you should expect the FTX liquidation takes so long is that there's so little clarity about you know the accounting and who owns what and when were the customer balance supposed to be snapshotted you know Genesis is like a real grown of business they have much better record keeping so it seems like it's very strange that we already have so much uh incorrect information in the filing when this stuff should be really easy to figure out like uh I think Cumberland claimed that they that they liquidated they liquidated the collateral of Genesis like in November or something like a while back they claimed that they had liquidated the collateral and so what the hell is they doing on a January petition but so technically speaking we we haven't seen a balance sheet yet from Genesis but we should get one soon uh to actually see like the real state of of what's on the balance sheet but we do know that they have roughly 5.1 billion of liabilities and about 1 billion a little bit more than one billion of liquid crypto assets that indicates that you know in the worst case a recovery might be something like 20 cents on the dollar but of course there's a lot of other stuff in there you know there's the promissory note there's you know other other receivables that they have one of the big elements that people have pointed out is that there was um a loan to Alameda of 2.6 billion which is roughly half the value of all the current liabilities of Genesis so if that loan is subject to clawback meaning that the FTX bankruptcy says hey guess what this takes precedence this was in the last 90 days so we're going to claw this back because it was not in the ordinary course of business then the Gen basically half of whatever uh half of the dollar value or half you know basically 50 cents to the dollar would be lost from Genesis which might be potentially you know the entire recovery or a significant portion of it so right now it's pretty hard to project what you would get in a Genesis recovery from what I've heard claims or trading at 20 25 cents on the dollar that generally implies you know usually when these people are buying claims you know they're buying looking for like a 2 3x so that means that if you hold it to maturity there's a good chance that markets are projecting you know 50 to 75 percent recovery but at this point there's there's so little that we know it's hard to say and as you said Robert there's very likely to be lawsuits um you know this hill this whole thing between the Gemini and dcg about the account the the current current asset representations about the promissory note that's still up in the air we've yet to see if that's going to be adjudicated so there's a lot of question marks still about this bankruptcy so I I you know I will learn more soon but tarun I do expect that this thing is going to move faster we're going to learn a lot more a lot more quickly than we have with FTX I uh yeah I I when you're speaking of claims I hear there's a new claims exchange to to that's right that's right so what are the other interesting and connected pieces of news is that uh we have a a comeback tour from some crypto villains uh so the three arrows guys Kyle and suzu they were reported as being founders of a new exchange called GTX alongside Mark Lamb the founder of coinflex um so coinflex if you recall was in exchange that went into bankruptcy because of uh uh what's his name Roger Fair that's right um and so uh these guys uh they ended up partnering up together to build an exchange for trading bankruptcy claims because of course that is now the store of value in crypto has moved on from Bitcoin to bankruptcy claims they were lambasted on Twitter the name is GTX which Stan why is it called GTX it's called GTX because G is one letter after F I think that's that's why they're calling it GTX and then after they got skewered on on crypto Twitter they decided to change the name from GTX to something else so they're going to announce later the uh the new name for the exchange yeah I was talking to you Robert you're telling me you guys didn't take the pitch we have not spoken to them yet but I heard that you guys spoke to them right we did we did they told us we were their first call I'm sure you were the first of many first calls um we may have been we may have been I will say when we talked to them I told them like look guys I don't know that this is investable but I I will offer you one piece of advice please change the [ __ ] name for GTX like there's no there's absolutely no way this is a good idea for to name this company GTX and I guess they didn't listen because when the news came out they just got completely destroyed on Twitter for it so but they are changing the name now so but apparently they've lined up the capital and this thing is going to get funded you know like these guys are you know for whatever you might think of them they clearly have a big following and a lot of people uh still find them to be very influential so I can't believe they're gonna pull something off and uh Lord knows the bankruptcy claims and crypto are proliferating so I can see it happening all I have to say is uh coinflex was a very weird exchange I just hope that they don't build this entire thing on bitcoin cash again one of the reasons Roger ver was a large coinflex user before he became a large coin Flex abuser is that they built and did most of their settlement on bitcoin cash wait didn't they have an erc20 yeah eventually but like like they started as a bit how do you think they attracted the the certain types of users that they had what were they settling on bitcoin cash um you're like like 50 of their balances or something were in Bitcoin cash like the majority of their volume was bch for a long time oh so they were attracting that volume but they weren't like settling uh you know uh other yeah but they were attracting that volume because you you had to post bch to margin no but certainly not only bch right not only but not only but they were like bitmex where it was like it was a pretty dominant like their wallets were probably the biggest PCH right so I I just the only word of advice outside of the horrible name is I do really hope that they try to take some lessons learned and exchange Technologies since then yeah well actually it's funny funny enough if someone connected because um of course the three Arrow the three arrows guys they were brought down by the gbdc trade and we actually learned something from the filings about the gvtc trade which is that if you recall um when Genesis was filing for bankruptcy gbtc plummeted in value and apparently part of the reason for this is that um Gemini had actually pledged 31 million gbtc shares to Genesis for Gemini earn which were liquidated and so a lot of these uh they're actually there's a very large overhang of gbtc has already been liquidated meaning that you know it's quite possible actually that in the coming weeks we'll see that there's much less fear around gbtc and some of the grayscale products just because of the fact that uh Genesis has already unloaded a big portion of their gvtc assets that they have on hand supposedly they have another 30 million of gbtc behind that but uh you know basically half of what we initially thought that they were going to have on hand yeah the navgap has already been recovering a bit over the past week I think in part just because those officers in that this for selling right that's like five percent of all gptc shares being sold on the market which is just quite a lot yeah which is pretty nuts um what is the what is the discount now and I assume when markets open on Monday we'll see uh a refreshed price there yeah I think it's around 40 um so still quite large but you know uh up off of high 40s or something like that where it bottom Nature's healing yeah it's your healing I think eth e was like trading below 50 discount it was it was really bad yeah I think it had like a 60 discount at one point 60 yeah yeah yeah absolutely insane so yeah dcg is now exploring a sale as you mentioned Robert of uh coindesk and what I've heard is that you know the the bids they're fetching are like 20 million ish uh which is much lower than what they were hoping to get um it's mostly media companies that are that are bidding for it so despite the fact that public markets have recovered it seems like private markets are still you know pretty icy right now in before Justin's son or Charles hoskinson bid for carton for coindes that is true that is true especially if you see binance step in I think we might see a heartier bid I mean binance didn't they spend so much money on Forbes they paid 400 million dollars for coin market cap well that's a different that's a different story that's that's I feel like that makes more sense yeah they probably made money from that I could I could believe it I could believe it I mean but no no they didn't they bought a lot of press coverage you're you are sort of right but I don't remember I mean the problem is like it's very hard to compare anyone because FTX Shone brightly in spending money on PR more than anyone else so much so that everyone else probably looks like a you know it looks like one of those gpt3 gpt4 horrible memes of like this many parameters and this many parameters but yeah I see okay all right well uh moving on oh sorry the last piece of news connected to this and this is also um a little bit surprising so right after Genesis filed for bankruptcy the SEC swooped in to save everybody at the last minute and slap both Gemini and Genesis with charges of unregistered Securities offerings so we also have the same thing actually happened to nexo a settlement with the SEC for I think 40 million a pretty significant settlement but uh Genesis and Gemini were both charged and saying hey you guys were marketing and offering this to retail customers this is a security it should have been registered and so really hitting them while they're down and protecting basically no one uh the SEC has has come back in once again after after disaster has already been guaranteed so this will likely also play into the expected recovery of course is like what will the you know how will these charges be evaluated and will the penalties be I suspect the SEC is going to be you know the SEC is basically going to say like look this we're going to you know punish potentially dcg and Gemini and get them to throw in more for the recovery of especially retail investors um in the in the bankruptcy that'd be my that'd be my guess of how this is going to play out um but it's too early to say but this may actually sweeten the deal for for the recovery uh and for retail investors who are caught up in this uh but it might also not it's hard to say at this point so one thing I had seen people speculate on and I I don't know enough to actually have a strong belief on this is that Gemini may also be like having to be a little careful about bankruptcy because of like this uh indictment because I think if it goes through and it's declarative security all the earned users are allowed to sue them whereas if it's like a loan that isn't they're not it's like the recourse condition changes and so like if that CC's claim goes through then like Gemini may actually it might be cheaper for them to go to bankruptcy than to try to to fight The Future legal claims I don't I have no clue about the I I again I this stuff is so insanely boring to me personally compared to like real crypto stuff when I just like go actually I don't know you do something um a bit ominous so there's we're talking about GTX earlier and there's already a couple other claims marketplaces out there including one called X claim um where you can trade you and your FTX claim or your block by claim or whatever and it's funny because it's you kind of morbid because it looks like a normal sort of Finance startup kind of thing but they're sort of like green and emojis around like these these bankruptcies and like people trading their their claim to these bankruptcies and they have like a pending section so like they have silvergate and Gemini like stay tuned we're monitoring it's like an upcoming product and I feel like it's just like very you know I certainly hope not I certainly hope there's no uh upcoming product here cheese cheese well but the banks have been recovering right yeah I don't I find it hard to believe something like silvergate but you know who knows well silvergate would be hard to I think settle because they're a public company and it seems like America of the company but a publicly traded Bank yeah yeah yeah yeah the Silver Gate one seems like whoever made this site didn't think very hard about the settlement aspect of it um but you know maybe if we take the glass half full version of this claim stuff is this might actually be the a really good time for the CDs Market to develop in crypto in the sense of like 1994 when like the CDs Market started it was like due to these like large-scale commodity company Banks can you explain what a CDS is sorry CDs is a credit default swap it's like a way for you to bet it's like a banker it's like you know morally similar to bankruptcy claim of course might be it might be different exactly in the structuring but it's a way for investors to bet on a company defaulting and so they they buy these claims where if a company defaults then they get paid out and then people can take both sides of that that at a very very high level of course in the last 10 years have been a bunch of really crazy I don't know if I want to call them scandals or good traits but uh in traditional Finance where people figured out a bunch of very famous hedge funds figured out this idea of go give a loan to a company that you own a CDs on and tell them that you'll give them the loan only if they synthetically default which causes the other side of the CDs to have to pay that side of the CDs and there was like all this type of weird stuff going on I think the cool part about the crypto version of this is that actually this is kind of like prediction market like assassination markets in prediction markets where like you open a prediction record on something and then you're very motivated to kill someone in order to make the prediction Market come true but synthetically for sure for sure get someone to fake their own death yeah yeah so like there's like gso which is like this big product refund and I think uh I forget there's black stone that there have been a couple of these there's this one company called codere which had this like very large lawsuit and I find this stuff more fascinating than the crypto bankruptcies because the crypto ones just seem filled with filled with like less strategy and more Bluster it so it seems but the interesting thing about the credit default stock market it was like it it started right before a huge bull market in 1994 that was like right before the like beginning of the run-up into the Asian financial crisis and uh it was like sort of the new Financial product that caused some of the you know excitement of the time obviously there are tech companies but like post-asian financial crisis obviously was like the run-up into the 99 bull market so I I actually would would would say that there's there's a non-trivial probability that these claims markets actually are I I I hate I now I feel like I hate myself because I sound like one of those like anything is bullish for Bitcoin type of people but I actually think if these claims things get a ton of liquidity they might it might be like the credit default Top Market which caused it but do you think that's a cause or do you think that's just like you just happen to play out that way it doesn't seem like that's a cause for a bull market well I think sometimes when there's this new instruments that people have not figured out how to Value correctly that have a lot of interest and actually have some notion of like guaranteed payoffs uh which you know in this case they're really some payoff for some of these claims right so like there is money sitting there locked and you're you're speculating on it it's not just like a prediction Market of like I'm speculating on this purely since that I am speculating on this pool of cash and the percentage that gets distributed so what you're telling us so Darude what you're telling us is that three arrows is going to kick off the next bull market with GTX sounds like that's what you're saying sounds like you should invest to be honest I'm not saying that I'm not saying that uh I'm not saying anything of that form I'm just more pointing out that this type of product could actually you know if we look at different points in financial history you know after some certain types of crashes like this type of product can be that sounds like what that's what I think that's what I'm hearing I'm not I'm not I'm not saying that uh that's haseeb's uh he's an interpretation I'll I'll let I'll let anyone interpret how they will but but I I think this claims thing will be very interesting because you can structure them you know as you're seeing the difference between like X claim and claims Market I think this is the two like live ones they're the exact payout structure is different and settlement's different and I I think these have a little more legs than your normal prediction Market because again you're speculating on a real pool of cash right you're not just speculating on like I'm hoping that there are enough people in the future who want to speculate on this that there's a larger pool of cash to get distributed right you've I you've gotten rid of that there is actually there are assets and so you know in that sense it's like a very clean prediction Market type of process and I think obviously this industry is set up to build things to speculate on that so that that's sort of a a glass half full I mean that is precisely the story that the GTX guys are telling which is that look you've got this proliferation of assets which are all these bankruptcy claims right and like you know people don't have cash anymore interest rates are high everyone's gotten wrecked but they do have these bankruptcy claims and most of the people who have these bankruptcy claims are degenerates and they love crypto trading which is why they lost all this money in the first place so if you can give them away a place to monetize that one asset they have left you can bring them back into the fold of crypto trading especially if prices start to recover you know you can you can you can get them to use it as collateral you can get them to sell it and get cash and then you know give them incentives to trade and so that's that's the story of GTX if Kyle and Sue are listening to this they owe me a tithe for giving them the Blythe Masters thing because I I feel like that was like a Bike Masters sort of famous she sort of gets credit for inventing the CDs I think like there's it's a little bit disputed but I think I think I I owe the tithe if I gave you the year that tarun is asking for an advisory role at GTX in case anyone's listening I'm just saying you know provenance okay just put just make sure you put tarun's face right on the center of the GTX homepage endorsed by tarun make sure make sure that's there ideas cool but but I I I think like how do you guys feel about these claims markets I mean they obviously have a huge set of problems right like how do I guarantee settlement how do I lock up the claims people how do I guarantee their payout um how do I like Source liquidity for one side at certain times but like you know just like ignoring the the fact that we have certain people marketing it like what's your what's your sort of like take on the the evolution of that product well I feel like all of the enforcement of like paying out the claims and all that stuff is just legal contracts the old way right it would be a lot cooler if you could use Smart contracts for any of this stuff but it's old school contracts for all of this stuff right like you can't enforce any of it besides just hey contract law you agreed to sell this yeah there's a lot of legal Nuance here but but there's one thing you can do which is the locked Solana owned by FTX and Alameda you can speculate on who gets that and when that gets old there's a bunch of on-chain assets here you could actually speculate on based on what's in the legal contracts and then you use the the change in those as like a settlement yeah unfortunately it's a minority in most these cases of the actual bankruptcy claims uh or the the value of the bankruptcy claims I think for I I think the Solana is actually pretty big it's like 11 right of the fdp what 11 of the FTV oh it's like eight to eight I thought it's like eight it's like yeah it's like it's like almost a billion right now is that right that is a crazy amount of soul no no no no no no no we we should definitely go fact check that but I I'm pretty sure they have like a very large amount of soul that would be great for this claims Market if it is if it is I had no idea that was true I thought it was like half that okay yeah my so my take on the the idea of this claims Market in the first place so obviously we already have some right there is exclaim and uh whatever the other one is so generally speaking you know the the first order as a venture capitalist looking at an investment like that the first thing that you want to think is like okay if this is a brilliant Market that people really want access to they should already be tripping over themselves for the current version of that product right it may be an even better version of that product turbo charges it but generally speaking when you have a product that people really want they're going to find a way to get it even if it's in a sub-optimal form now I don't know that much about xclaim but it seems like it's like okay um decent traction but it's not like crazy now that being said you know the story behind GTX is a little bit different which is that you know the the claims Market is a wedge to get people initially into the market but then it just sort of becomes a crypto exchange right and that seems like an interesting wedge as a way to build up uh you know just you know way to get DJs in the door and get them to start trading uh crypto like any any other exchange the trouble with it is that it does seem like look you know bankruptcies are very they're very pro-cyclical right when the Market's going down you're going to get a lot of bankruptcies and a lot of bankruptcy claims to trade when the market it's going up nobody's declaring bankruptcies there's not going to be any bankruptcy claims and then you're just a normal crypto exchange and you've got nothing in particular That's Unique that gets people in the door so it's it to my mind it sort of feels like a one-time um kind of you know sort of marketing advantage that you can use to get yourself off the ground if that fails you sort of got one you've got one rocket booster and if that rocket booster doesn't get you into orbit then you're kind of just another crypto exchange and you've got to compete on the merits so that that seems to me like the at least probably the the the bear case for the story is that yeah you're gonna get some people who are coming to trade bankruptcy claims a lot of them will just trade once sell for cash and then leave um and then a smaller number of people will actually help you build a business from those deposits that you get or those users who you who come in the door it is um I I agree with this I think I mean I think what is interesting is how many people are clamoring for FTX to be restarted like even after FTX declared bankruptcy it's sort of sort of mildly related where people feel like there is some Gap in the market because they're like look I loved you the FTX ux I loved the cross margining and yet now it's gone and you know nothing is really replacing it and now even John Jay Ray was discussing this week the possibility of like restarting FTX so it's like I agree with respect to like hey this is sort of a small Moment In Time market for these for these bankruptcy claims but like there's no question of like who's gonna sort of come fill that gap or you know our binance and and you know the other big exchange are just gonna develop their own sort of similar products by the way I just looked it up so so FTX Alameda and combined had 50.5 million Soul which is over a billion now and it completely vests in 2028 so I think the vast majority of it is actually because they did those crazy seven years even with their soul what yes and uh so there's there's a lot there's a lot of ecosystem sales those were seven year vests no no I'm talking about Solana that's like the crazy part they they agreed to a longer vest than the default what insane that's so insane crazy that yeah there's like there there's a Solana Foundation blog post talking about the 50.5 million so 54.5 million sold you could definitely bootstrap a prediction Market on betting on what how that gets distributed wow I think that's enough that's enough money to but that also means you need like a trustee for seven years to like manage the liquidation of this soul you know make Madoff was much longer than that so it's not that crazy yeah I do think the whole wind down process has dust that they just like continue to like collect the report on for years and years and years yeah it's gonna be it's going to be painful well with respect to FTX we did get a story that um the the Liquidators identified 5.5 billion in liquid assets uh for the FTX total estate we still don't have a good number on the liabilities so we don't know what that represents in terms of uh you know a percentage recovery but it's at least better than some people were originally anticipating now Sam in the times since our last show Sam has come out with his own sub stack and in the sub stack he's basically doing the same thing he was doing before but with a lot more words and a lot more charts and a lot more home spun Excel sheets uh basically trying to claim that FTX us is still solvent and that Sullivan and Cromwell which was the law firm that was appointed to oversee the bankruptcy that Sullivan and Cromwell basically and the FTX Liquidators have essentially been either delinquent or outright um you know fraudulent in making it so that FTX us uh has has not remained solvent despite the fact that at the time of the filing FTX us was completely solvent um there was a complaint filed by Ryan Miller who was the chief regulatory officer for FTX claiming that there were a bunch of irregularities and or ethical issues with Sullivan and Cromwell the judge overruled these complaints because he said no Sullivan Cromwell is fine screw off but it's raised a lot of eyebrows I think about uh perhaps in fact Sam was correct and that at the time supposedly one of the things in the complaint was the claim that ftxus because it was the most solvent it had the most cash on hand FTX us was used to pay the bankruptcy fees to Sullivan and Cromwell on behalf of the other filing entities but that at the time fdxus may have been solvent but no longer is after all of the expenses paid to lawyers I think it was the other way around I think was Daniel Friedberg who was another FTX lawyer was complaining that Ryan wanted to retain uh snc because he came from I'm sorry I got it backwards and so yeah um and so that was kind of the weird part yeah so there's some circular circle jerk thing going on with respect to Sullivan and Cromwell but it seems that the it seems that for the most part the bankruptcy the bankruptcy lawyer is I'm sorry the bankruptcy judge is just like whatever suck it up it happens so I don't know what to make of it I don't know what your guys view was on this whole drama you know if if um if you uh are uh a Jane and you you you kill a hundred people but uh you accidentally step on a grasshopper you're still probably guilty in your moral in the moral compass of your your particular religion even though the grasshopper may have been like unintentionally killed and I sort of feel like yeah sure there was sort of probably some like not perfect reasoning about something in this case and I'm sure lawyers are maximizing fees but like this is like trying to like just like charade over the fact that like that everything else happened and he has two that the doj has is too close Associates of some form ratting on him so like like who cares like this is just like smoking mirrors in my mind well it's definitely meant to distract from the core issues right the core issues are the collapse of an exchange most likely due to tens of billions of dollars of fraud and you're right like you might find other issues in the process and in some cases the issues in process are more important than the underlying thing because you know when you get processed right or wrong it impacts every future case ever and like sometimes you see things overturned or whatever due to process but you're right like in this case the event is so massive and the process seems so small that like process is a intentional distraction it does feel like part of what's so interesting about this case I mean we're basically seeing one of the largest corporate frauds of the last couple decades play out and any time that you have something that's that catastrophic you just get all sorts of vultures coming out trying to capitalize on that process and you know I I don't know enough to be able to tell whether Sullivan and Cromwell is there there certainly seems to be a lot of smoke I don't know how to evaluate the fire it's it's kind of an education for all of us just to see like when things go this [ __ ] wrong what happens and how many other things also go wrong Downstream you know so that that kind of feels like the story that we're all going to learn from this I I bet you I bet you the same thing was true with a lot of the other cases like Madoff oh absolutely whatever like like I'm sure that like there was some over right like if you watch the Madoff thing like there are tons of people who are like oh the process screwed us because the trustee took too much money whatever right like I I don't think it's possible to have committed such a large crime and and then it's unwinding doesn't cause its own problems but like come on this is just a PR thing like I I do really get the feeling that perhaps in this way Sam might still be somewhat delusional in that he thinks that the pr game that got him to where he got in 2021 is still the correct strategy to be deploying at this time and that like it'll continue it does seem that he's moderated it doesn't seem that he's moderated right like he's not coming on Twitter spaces anymore he's not doing shows anymore he's not doing interviews anymore um he is just like these two sub-sac pieces and then retweeting everything that's negative at Sullivan and Cromwell is basically what he's down to so it does seem like uh he's probably listening to someone's advice at this point but I mean even then like at the you know for instance how many how many how many things have you heard from from Trabuco how many things have you heard from Caroline I I don't think he's really following that he still has this fundamental belief that like he's going to talk his way out of this which I like it at least it seems like it right like it it doesn't feel like he's like acknowledged that and like I agree he still is trying to win over with whatever arguments he has the court of public opinion and most of the arguments I don't think matter you know oh FTX U.S shouldn't have been put into bankruptcy therefore I'm innocent like it's ridiculous but like he's still trying to make you know what he thinks are logical arguments using very long form blog posts which are usually convincing to the average person and bad excels and that Excel scale a lot of people picking on his Excel because that's all he has what's wrong with his Excel skills the Excel spreadsheets look fine to me I saw everyone on Twitter dunking on his Excel tables and I was like they looked like fine to me but if you're all a bunch of management Consultants or something no I just I just thought it was like it was more like he has no provenance in the sheets he just takes like a screenshot of like five numbers written and they're all exactly the same and I was like there's no [ __ ] way you have zero variance between your number and solving cromwell's number and you're not even tracking like that you know what I mean like like just like basic like sanity checks like oh they're exactly equal really like there's a lot of stuff there where you're like I don't believe how could you even believe this or he's like oh these are the numbers as I remember it's like all right buddy yeah yeah I mean the big claimants the most recent post was like oh there's a 400 million dollar Bank bank account sitting somewhere that like you know the Auditors didn't take into account it's like I I find that hard to believe that they couldn't find a bank account which is like you know the easiest thing to find to be fair I will say I I am still one thing I still don't understand and hope to understand as this unfolds it's like where did this five billion dollars come from and like why couldn't that have actually been used to process withdrawals well because there I mean if there's more liabilities than assets right if you keep processing withdrawals and it just a race to the exit so that is where you do want to say and and the withdrawals are in a specific asset that the customer has in their Ledger and FTX for sure it won't match the assets that FTX had for sure but they were claiming that they were like liquid Stables if right like I was actually like if you and I was like a little bit surprised by that aspect of this five billion recovery that they were like very liquid crypto and Stables because you know in November and December all the things you heard were like they had nothing at all well no no I mean we know they had a bunch of ftt and soul and all this other stuff no no this doesn't include that it explicitly States it does not include that it explicitly states that stable Clinton liquid crypto which is like that was what was surprising I see well Seoul is liquid I mean if they have that's a lot that's a lot to have true true yeah the soul might the full Soul might be one once 20 of them yeah but I I just think five billion out of even if it's like 13 is actually a way higher recovery ratio than I would have predicted I agree but it also tracks where the claims are being Priced Right so claims are being priced at like you know 10 to 15 cents which again if you sort of look forward and say okay it's going to take many years to get this paid back you might eventually get 40 cents of the dollar fifty cents of the dollar that's roughly where you know if claims are trading at 15 cents today and then you know the people who are buying them from you make roughly a 3X assuming that things go right that's about how they were being priced from the beginning the one one interesting thing speaking of the the Liquidators so that the Alameda Liquidators were found on chain just like bumbling around getting liquidated like sending a bunch of failed transactions like they just had no idea what they were doing it was crazy to see who are these [ __ ] Liquidators who keep getting liquidated on Ave losing tons and tons of money for all the it's it's like what what is this clown show John Ray's team are not veteran Teachers Pay one Twitter djen just like you know 100 bucks an hour to tell you how Ave works the Twitter region is going to teach yeah don't give them the money just have them explain to you how Ave works you know like this is not that complicated just screen share you know I just think uh there's also this this Factor like stuff like this though does make me wonder how the five billion I would agree with that it makes it a lot harder to trust any of these processes seeing what's going on with the uh the Alameda liquidation as they say it's not real until it's actually cash like it might say it's 5 billion but like I am curious about their process to liquidate that into assets that can be distributed to the creditors because you know if they're counting illiquid Assets in there it's going to be really annoying when people see them yeah you know being monetized you know a a very nice thought experiment that I taught I was I spent some time talking about with some friends who um uh are are more in AI type of stuff and was you know anthropic this machine learning company that Who series B was done by Sam nashad and Caroline 500 million series B which came from the the loans is trying to raise uh like up round and so one question that and I guess that's been publicly reported whatever but one question is like sure like you know that that most all that money theoretically should be going capture creditors but there's also this question of who signs the series C docs if like say all three of them were in jail was it with FTX uh was it on the FTX balance sheet or Alameda technically no but it's in the bankruptcy proceedings because it's kind of like the Robin Hood chairs there was there were C's so like forfeiture style so so it's like I actually am very curious of like the procedural stuff of like how an illiquid asset owned by this thing in this huge nuclear bomb waste that is like because the market is crazy is trying to raise this huge up around I I assume either the bankruptcy court or the you know debtors like if the doj suggestion then it's the doj right yeah can you imagine the doj signing the series C docs well if it's a tarun I remember actually bringing you back weren't you talking all sorts of [ __ ] about the anthropic uh investment and now you know with Claude and gpg3 and all this stuff yeah it actually looks like an amazing investment yeah you're just saying they're about to raise an up round maybe that was the smartest thing that maybe this is going to make the FTX Predators whole you never know I know I know I made a bunch of jokes on Twitter about two weeks ago the irony would just be incredible the irony would be but I'm I'm much more of a of a fan of adept answer out there but mainly because they are uh yeah of course so you're not ready to record you're not ready okay no got it but but if they make if they if they make the creditors hole they'll be hilarious I I really think like Microsoft investing in open AI caused FTX creditors to be made whole that would be like such a funny like human centipede of capitalism Human Centipede of capitalism all right I think we got the title of the show all right well we're up on time so I think with that we're gonna wrap uh thank you everybody and we'll be back soon see y'all hey [Music]
