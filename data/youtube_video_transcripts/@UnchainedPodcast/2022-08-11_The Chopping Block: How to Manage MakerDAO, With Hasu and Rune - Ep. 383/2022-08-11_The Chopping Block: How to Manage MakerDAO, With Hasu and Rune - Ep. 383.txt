not a dividend it's a tale of two funds now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet generally speaking air drops are kind of pointless anyways um unnamed trading firms who are very involved as the ultimate pump d5 protocols are the antidote to this problem all right hello everybody welcome to the chopping block every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day so uh quick intros we've got some special guests with us here today but first we've got tom the d5 maven and master of memes next up we've got robert the crypto connoisseur and captain of compound joining us today we have roon christensen chief mischief maker at mkr and uh joining him and his debating sparring partner we've got hasu the gourmand of governance and finally there's myself haseeb i'm head hype man a dragonfly um so the the three of us the non guests are early stage investors in crypto but i want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice legal advice or even life advice so today we're gonna be doing a little bit of a different structure or kind of a different vibe let's say than than the way we usually do these shows so generally speaking we kind of just riff on what's going on in the news and kind of share with you things happening during the day but we've been really fascinated by all the drama going on with maker dao and we thought what better way to dive into what's going on in makered outland than to bring on two of the loudest voices and two of the bitterest enemies in on-chain governance roon christensen and hosuh so let me let me start before we kind of get into the meat of things let me start by giving some background because i think a lot of people are maybe glancingly familiar with you guys but don't have the full story or even the picture of what's happening in maker land so let me start with roon so roon is the co-founder of maker dao he was formerly the ceo of the maker foundation which is now since dissolved um he's been working on decentralized stable coins for a long time like since 2014 and like the bitshares era he's become notorious for his views within the maker community specifically his vision for how he wants maker to reorient itself in a plan he calls his endgame vision then we have hasu so hasu is a pseudonymous commentator podcaster dow contributor thought leader within crypto he's got a lot of hats i don't know exactly how he describes himself but he's done a lot of different things within crypto he was a former professional poker player which i also was so we've got that in common he's now a full-time contributor to lydo flashbots and he's one of the largest dow delegates within maker dao and he has submitted his own vision for how he thinks that maker maker governance should be reoriented okay so quick background on maker dow before we jump into the meet so maker dao for those of you who have been living under a rock maker doubt is a decentralized landing market that issues collateralized loans in its own stable coin called dye so dye is an over collateralized stable coin it is the largest decentralized stable coin existence today it's also one of the cornerstone protocols of d5 so it's very very important to d5 a lot of other things in d5 use maker dow so people sometimes call it the central bank of d5 its governance token is mkr the stable coin is called die so just some high level stats on maker dow maker now has about 7.5 billion dollars worth of dye outstanding it's got about 10 and a half billion dollars of tvl it's one of the largest protocols in existence by total value locked maker mkr the token the governance token has a billion dollars fully diluted valuation maker dow the organization burns today about 43 million dollars a year and has 115 full-time head count so it is a large and very expensive organization now it's not exactly is it a dao is it an organization how exactly to describe it i think is one of the key things that roon and hasu will be talking about today so maker doubt in particular is a fascinating case study in on-chain governance as i mentioned roon was originally the shepherd of the maker foundation makerdad was originally a swiss fan or originally had a swiss foundation but that foundation has since dissolved and now the core teams which work on maker now which are called the core units they're all given budgets and they're funded every year by the dao itself now nobody is happy with how maker dao is governed everyone kind of finds something to be unhappy about it's kind of like congress i guess but roon and hasu each have different qualms with the way that makerdai works today so roon has generally critiqued its overwhelming and opaque complexity well hasu critiques its lack of vision and strategy now i'm sure they both disagree on male investment or just you know other things that at the margin maker now could be doing better but there was a particular vote that took place recently which was the impetus for us to want to bring these two guys on the show and it's unfortunately taken us a while but we finally got them here so this vote took place in june it was one of the landmark referendums in the history of maker dow where the largest highest turnouts in on-chain voting ever with over 30 of the mkr supply voting on the question which is about 300 million dollars today worth of mkr was voting on on this question the question itself was a little esoteric and we don't really need to go into it it proposed the creation of a new lending uh a new lending core oversight unit but the spirit behind the question was exactly the spirit of the question that roon and hasu disagree on which is whether to create more streamlined leadership and decision making within maker dao which is hosu's vision or to keep maker down more amorphous and move toward roon's stated end game for the protocol so the vote on the yes side came hasu and many of the vcs like asics indian paradigm on the no side came roon and many of the early maker team the community itself was split but it was roone who ultimately carried the day with about 60 of the vote against the proposal but this conversation this disagreement about whether maker dao's leadership should become more streamlined or whether it should maintain its amorphousness and move toward more toward dows and subdials that is the disagreement at the heart between roon and hasu so with that preamble out of the way roon i want to first give you five minutes and i will be counting to state your vision for maker down and where you disagree with hasu yeah so i mean so i think the the first and most important thing to talk about is this i mean i call it i call it an endgame right the concept of an end game but it's in the past it's been referred to as governance lockdown for instance or even ice age it has many different names over the history of maker it's always been the sort of this ultimate long-term goal and the idea is you kind of you want to get like something is decentralized you want to get it to a point where it stops changing over time right you really want to to have a certain reliability so you can really count on this like an infrastructure that doesn't randomly like rock pull or pivot to something else right and that's particularly important for a stable coin right because that's really something people need to be able to rely on and need to be have stability literally everyone agrees with that i think where i maybe have some i guess more extreme views is that i think that if there's even sort of a tiny little sliver of kind of a centralization sort of slippery slope towards centralization in any kind of sort of ossified or sort of near like sort of a state that starts to to reach this kind of like lock down situation where it gets hard and harder to change things then uh in my view then you're guaranteed to basically get some complete centralization right because you can't always count on on basically like pioneers and and founders and sort of uh thought leaders to just selfishly kind of like you know work to remove themselves out of of a position of power basically instead what you're going to get is you're going to get just this sort of natural you know human process of of consolidating power right so that's that in by itself is like that's a huge challenge i think right it's a huge um problem and i think basically it's the the only thing that's really um like justifiable to really work on to change things right so i think like all um decisions all changes all sort of um attempts to to really uh change the status quo maker has to move towards some kind of coherent vision a coherent plan for how you're going to get this end game right this lockdown and why that's going to be decentralized and why it's going to be safe and why i want a slimmer slope into capture of some sort and then i see basically two ways this can happen right and so the first way is i mean it's sort of the classic vision for maker which is what i call sort of i mean very early on maker we were just obsessed with this concept of like how blockchain had huge potential fundamental value right like more efficiency faster settlement and transparency and security and all that stuff right the reality is you can actually build stuff with blockchain that just runs automatically right and i actually still believe that's possible so that's why one of the things i'm sort of pushing is this possibility of what i call symbol die which is basically pretty much take what what exists in the maker today and then get rid of the entire workforce essentially and then just let it run by itself of course a few people need to remain but basically what's there today runs itself for the most part and and then you have this massive workforce on top of that which was driven by a kind of desire to grow and decide to innovate and break barriers and break limits right and and this gets into a new frontier that we didn't consider early on in maker which is you know it's not just about building some fundamental value like you build it in the overcome right but it's also about intangible value having a brand having growth having sort of a growth strategy and and that's some i mean in the end that's something i'm i'm even more excited about than just sort of fulfilling the original vision of some thing that just works and then that's it but i believe that to do that you really i mean it's an incredible unbelievable challenge to try to figure out how to do things like organize humans and organize what i call meta which is basically this of the context of how humans and the community how they work together and then that's sort of this big vision i've come up with is using a tool called metadows which basically recognizes that you simply cannot have 130 strong workflows in the down it's impossible can't it's not going to work it simply it's a total failure right it descends into like crazy politics turf wars power struggles but if you and the reason is because the context for all these people is incompatible like they all come from different sort of walks of life in a sense right they've all been onboarded in some kind of random fashion so what i believe is there is a silver bullet potentially to this is to split it up into many essentially like siloed independent dials that are still tied together economically through like a tokenomics and and all this sort of intangible um value that all together i call it metamagic because you can sort of really do some complete sort of a hex almost right over like hacking human psychology with all these tools available in blockchain got it okay so you've presented your vision for maker dao hasu i'd like you to present your vision and where uh if you if you can where you think that roon's vision falls short of the way you think maker doubt ought to be governed um sure i mean i don't think we really disagree very much about uh the vision for mkhitaryan sense you know what it should be doing and i can briefly go into that i mean there's a lot of different voices in maker and also in the community surrounding maker so maker i think we all agree maker is a decentralized bank but that alone doesn't even tell us very much banks over the centuries have pursued many different business functions i mean custody payments consumer lending commercial lending corporate finance investment banking so when we say you know something is a bank it can still mean um you know vast number of combinations of the above options and so i think before you can really do before you can it really even makes sense to start about governance you need some alignment about what your project what maker should even be doing and i think yeah that's why for example i suggested so let's create a constitution for maker in order to figure out what we even want like i'm i have i know what i want but i don't know what everybody else wants and i can see that there's a lot of different visions and i think it would be better if we would all run in the same direction no matter what that direction is instead of pulling the dao into you know very different directions that sort of oil neutralize each other so what i would like maker to be i mean i think maker's most powerful vision is to be a shadow bank i mean that's how it's already used today and i think that's where it has its highest potential so make us product is dollar denominated demand deposits i mean jenny like listeners from tradfi also called the euro dollar uh not tied to europe it's just your um sort of dollar denominated deposits that are created outside of the the u.s regulated banking system and this product has a huge target market it's extremely important to get right there's huge demand to hold us dollar exposure outside of this existing legal system we'll get to this i assume but today we saw another example of why that is um just us regulators can sort of at will you know freeze any any deposit that is sort of in their domain and they cannot do this with dollar deposits that are outside of the us legal system however the problem with these shadow banks has been traditionally that they are not uh fdic insured so in the in the past sort of u.s central bank is just sort of let them fail and let them sort of yeah fail on their customers but now these sort of things have become so big so systemically important that you know um in the in the last 10 years the fed had to bail them out uh with swap lands anyway so i think maker has this huge target market it has many advantages over traditional shadow banks because it doesn't actually need this kind of deposit insurance um it can just hold liquid collateral and i think that's something that for example we are we super agree on like make us should only hold very scalable very liquid collateral that we can always liquidate when we need it right but for example this view it's not it's not like consensus inside maker you know what we should be doing so i think before we can even talk about how we should do it how we can get there and how we can design a system that achieves this purpose i think we need to kickstart a process about defining sort of a common constitution a common mission statement what the the dao is supposed to to do and to be and i fully expect that i mean 20 30 percent maybe of the people involved maybe of the votes are going to disagree with any vision that is chosen and they will probably go and leave and that's totally fine right because at least now then they have the chance to to go and do and pursue something else because for example they know that that their vision of like for example a rye or an lusd version of maker that's that's not on the table and i think stuff like that has never really been communicated for maker you already touched on it very briefly but i think so the main way that my proposal differs um from runes is sort of it focuses on very specific tasks it identifies very specific tasks that need to be done and create specific roles that they're not dedicated in order to fill in these these objectives and this includes setting a strategic direction for the dao setting an annual budget sort of observing you know setting like a risk management policy for the dao hiring and firing core units monitoring the financials and setting it like a legal strategy and basically so providing like high-level strategy but also oversight for the workforce yeah so because i thought that this is all things that are currently missing from the dao and i think that it would be really important that there is a dedicated role uh in order to steer the dao from this like very high level perspective right because what the tokyo does are they can vote on individual decisions but what they're explicitly not good at is like zooming out and not thinking like what do i think about this one decision but what do i think about like what is that even the design space for decisions and what do i think about this decision in the context of what other possible decisions that are not even mentioned here and so i think like steering like system as complex as make as ambitious as make us just completely impossible if you're like so low level and that's why we need something like i call it the council council of makers to like take a very like deliberately bird's eye view on the system and steer it from there okay so if i can try to summarize very briefly the the two opening statements so roon it sounds like basically your view is that look you know when we started maker we had a very simple idea of what we wanted to build and over time it's become more and more i wouldn't say politically captured but politically complex it's become this big spider's web full of all sorts of stuff that doesn't necessarily need to be there and your vision is one of hey let's return back to kind of a minimal viable maker you know there are ways in which we might want to be more aggressive but the first and number one thing is like let's simplify a lot of the complexity that has landed within maker down haas of your vision is that you know look right now maker dao is basically being decided by token holders but token holders don't have sufficient direction and alignment of vision to be able to build the right thing and everything in life is about building the right thing so you propose that they create a constitution that describes what the goal and broad vision for maker now is and for there to be a an elected or some kind of council of decision makers who are responsive to token holders but it's not token holders voting directly on individual decisions yeah so that sums it up yet awesome um sorry robert you were gonna say something to flesh out the surface area of agreement and disagreement just a little bit more you know hustle one of the things you said was that you know you wanted you know dye to be backed by liquid collateral one of the things that i've seen happening in maker now is that the collateral base of dye over time has been moving in two directions one is towards albeit liquid collateral like usd coin which is you know comprising a larger larger portion of the backing of dye as well as less liquid you know collateral or things that aren't as on-chain accessible which you know really falls into the more real-world assets camp which is you know there was recently a treasury you know approach to start including treasuries and corporate debt is the backing you know for the system as well as you know real world assets loans to banks and other you know off-chain entities you know how do you each see that backing of die is it positive is it negative you know haase you specifically said that you know you want to die to be outside of the control of you know the u.s banking system and you know regulatory system you know but all of these things that are increasingly backing dire directly controllable by that system how do you each see this transformation that's occurring i really think that um like so first of all i what one part where me and hastu definitely agree i mean i think beyond this just this sort of sense of there needs to be some stability but i mean and that's what the constitution has talked about also brings to the table right sort of ground rules that basically put the ground rules in place and then you play by those rules instead of constantly trying to sort of meta game and change the rules so they favor you right which is kind of like what happens if you don't get some some stability uh into the political dynamic right and i mean and then there is a sense of like how do you really like how do you agree on a constitution what what's going to cause you to agree to some ground rules rather than try to game them for your own benefit and that's where i really it goes into this concept of what i call the meta or the the culture the sort of the context of the um the sort of humans basically involved right because i strongly believe that a dow simply cannot function if it's purely for profit like if it's simply a sort of a money-making enterprise it it you can sort of logically show that it's simply is never going to work and that's because like the definition of a dao is that it's not a legal entity right there's no legal protection and one of the consequences of that is things like corruption and embezzlement and theft and none of that means anything in a doubt right it's perfectly it's it is sort of if you can do it then uh the dow sort of wants you to do it right that's that's the whole concept of i think that's sort of the cornerstone of decentralization right and so in a situation where people only motivated by greed the the problem is that that you know there's never this sort of shared vision in that case right it's really always just an individual vision of i'm interacting with this thing to maximize the value i can extract out of it and that's gonna then sort of permeate governance right so people vote for whatever benefits them personally but even worse it goes into it sort of impacts the workforce it impacts the management uh if you have something of that right and and it's just gonna be i mean that sort of endless free-fall and and then that's why i think you need what you always get is you sort of cut through the insanity and establish some kind of real hierarchy real centralization and then turns it effectively into something with real legal protections right and the solution to that is some kind of vision that goes beyond just making money and and just uh being in it for profit right which is um and i think i mean i think you know we sort of also like alluded to that right it's about having people that are lying about this is not we're not just here to make money we're here for some bigger thing and and not everyone can get aligned around that but that's it's so important to have that alignment that it's actually worth it to basically find something where enough people can be like now there's a real reason for us to be engaged and and uh contribute to this in a way i think it's most altruistic right actually vote what's good for the whole dial right what's good for for our vision for our our purpose roon it's such a that's such a fascinating claim i've never heard that said before that like in a dow there's no such thing as embezzlement because a dao is a is an extra legal concept it almost sounds like what you believe is that in a dao people are just like it's pure state of nature people are just doing whatever the hell they want they are kind of you know stealing at the margin wherever they possibly can do you actually think that's how people behave within maker dial i mean i don't so i don't think that we are i mean maker is already sliding in that direction but we haven't even seen the beginning of it right like i mean it would it and then and that comes back to this cause i mean again i really find this term meta the sort of the context the the the second order um of what's happening it kind of uh it can have a certain momentum right and one of the things you can do it can deteriorate right so corruption in an organization spreads because you see everyone else doing it and then you start doing it yourself and and it's i mean in maker there's nothing like that right you don't have like anything like real embezzlement or real corruption or anything like that but what their what was happening for a long time was this mimification of decentralization as we're calling right so once upon a time decentralization was considered very was taken very seriously but then for all the people that have to actually do things it's so super inconvenient for them to constantly have to deal with all this like decentralization maximalism and larping and and over time it started to sort of slide as a principle right and then you actually started opening the door to things that could really sort of irreversibly centralize it now and i think the exact same uh process i mean will certainly play out for things like like accessing budgets right like at first you're sort of thinking about i'm gonna get this budget for what's best for the whole organization and i'm all about you know doing considering value but then if you see everyone else sort of um you know building up a fat buffer and a fat budget and there's no i mean you it's it's just you're getting that's naturally gonna you can actually work in that direction if there's no counterfalls against that and that counterfalls it cannot be that we're here to make money because there's just i mean that's exactly the thing is gonna drive that kind of sliding right it has to be some kind of greater purpose and so i mean so what i've pushed in the past what actually was my first realization that this is so important was clean money right so this idea that you can have the collateral itself of die and sort of what die actually in a sense physically is you can have that be the purpose right and and have that be sort of the the reason why um it has to be die that should succeed right and what has to be died that people should work for and volunteer and contribute to right because you can literally create a currency that that produce positive externality right in the same way that the current financial system is like destroying the world right and producing negative standards all over the place you could actually reverse that process and create something that just makes the world better sort of automatically right driven by the power of blockchain right and i think with something like that in place you're gonna have actually the possibility of creating like a real like ossified constitution right where you're going to get the system to a place where everyone's involved because it's doing good and because they think there's some real purpose for this beyond just making a bunch of money so they're not they'll not accept somebody coming and being like oh let's mess with some budgets let's do some stuff over here like some let's do some pulls and tricks here and there right regardless if they try to like bribe people or do some propaganda all this stuff that that absolutely will help i mean happens and will happen endow politics right because in the end there is some there's a tangible sort of upside that goes beyond just what's in it for me right and and i think that's how you really get yeah i think that's how you get this sort of stability and i'm to draw a comparison i think that's something like that's what for instance makes bitcoin totally you know unassailable right everyone's just like they're not just in bitcoin for the money i mean it's a big part of it even the maximalists right they of course they're all there to speculate and so on but there is also that like sense of like freedom and sovereignty and living in the mountains out of reach of the government right and that causes i mean that creates a meta where the exchanges are not gonna you know the miners and exchanges they're not gonna collude because they know that like the entire world is going to be against them right the the second order sort of feedback is that that everyone else knows that nobody else is going to mess with bitcoin so nobody's going to try even if theoretically they could forget and introduce inflation or whatever right but it simply won't happen so rooney it sounds like a lot of your view about maker dao and doubt governance generally is driven by this skepticism about human nature let's say and about kind of the purity of incentives quickly getting eroded when there's power to be had when there's money to be made what is your take do you disagree with that or do you do you largely think that roon is basically correct but you think that the the solution to this problem is different than what roone's presenting i mean i thought the original question from robert was more interesting so let's go back to the original question you were asking about collateral right i mean i i can briefly sort of there's a bunch of things we could like we could talk about but i i thought the original question is very interesting just because it's so timely like you were asking about the what whether like we should have real world assets in in maker and such right and like um stable coins backing the die i think might be interesting just for the audience to hear about this briefly like because this is actually something that i think roone and i are in complete agreement about and june actually had this like super insightful tweet about this earlier i would call it like this this decentralized stable quencher dilemma almost you can have a coin that's stable solvent you can have a coin that's backed by non-us dollar collateral and you can have a coin that's that's scalable uh you can have only two out of these three properties but you can't have all three so any stable coin system needs to sacrifice uh one of the three sides i mean maker has has decided that it wants you know to be a stable coin it wants to die to always be at a dollar there used to be a huge debate about this in the past but um sort of the site that wanted um diet to be one dollar one i think that in hindsight that was a very good decision it does sacrifice you know trustlessness of the system necessarily because you have to then like once you made this decision you need to decide like do we want non-usd collateral in maker or do we want maker to be scalable and from from from that point on like basically we have to pick one of the two sides and make up shows from scalability because in order to like for maker it's not just enough to be like you can make a system that's useful very useful for a few people or you can make a system that's you know potentially useful for the whole world and um i really think it depends on what your like your objective function is and i think roone's vision lastly the vision of the maker community is to create a global currency a currency that is accessible to anyone in the world and for that it needs to be you know very liquid and it needs to be have wide distribution and so on so and then there's only one way to guarantee that so die deposits if you use a traditional sort of asset liability model then you know die is a liability of maker and right now it has sort of on the order of like five to six billion dollars of usdc um backing these demand deposits so anyone can take uh one die you know go to go to maker and you know draw one usdc for that and that's really important in order to you know create stability at the pack in order to basically create this guarantee that that that people can always withdraw one dollar of collateral for one dollar of die and if you have dollar denominated liabilities then you need dollar denominated assets backing that and so the you know the amount of available collateral wait why i'm going to interject why ether is not dollar denominated per se right it's an arbitrary asset right ether has exchange rate risk relative to the us dollar it's wild and it's great collateral so why do you have to have dollar denominated collateral for this to work okay so there are two ways to create die um the first is uh and this is how maker used to work in the early days and this is you have someone who deposits collateral such as ether and then they borrow die against that collateral and by doing that they go short if usd because they have a sort of they borrow usd against eve and then they sell the usb so this this is one way that dye can go in circulation but this this way of creating die is sort of extremely you know it's purely dependent on the demand to you know borrow or die against usd which is like really small and it's not at all matched with sort of the demand to actually hold die so you need a way for the for the demand to hold die and for the demand to to borrow die against eve you need these to be uh sort of in some kind of equilibrium with each other and so the much more scalable way of actually meeting the the big global demand to hold eye is to allow dye to create it from other dollar like stable assets and this is what the psm does in maker the pack stability module which is if demand for die ever goes above let's say like one dollar one cent then it becomes profitable for arbitragious to deposit one usdc in the system to mint one die and so the one die for for one usdc and one cent right and then profit one sent so you basically have infinite scalability as long as you have dollar collateral backing this but like we don't want usdc like we want don't want the current um dependence on usdc that we have like we want to replace usdc not just because it's a huge central point of failure but also because usdc doesn't pay us any yield right on this so circle is making uh three to four percent on all of these deposits that they hold in the bank and maker is getting zero of that so maker should in theory uh i mean it does allow you to expand the die supply without dropping interest rates right like and i think that was you know part of the whole thesis which is like um you know yeah yeah that's a that's a good point tom yeah so it does have some benefits i mean it does on the other hand side it introduces a lot of sort of existential risk um and creates the narrative that like dies just rap usdc and such right so i mean in theory like instead of just usdc maker should be backed by a range of different coins and that all have profit sharing agreements with with maker on the year that they generate from the money that is ultimately sitting somewhere in the banking system and then makers should also be backed by commercial bonds and governance bonds because these are you know some of the these are some of the sort of safest and most liquid us dollar denominated sort of yield bearing assets that they are and i think you know this is something that like nothing that i said is sort of controversial among i would say like 80 percent of like mkr this is like something that i would say that we all agree on and sort of anyone who disagrees with that is sort of already well in the spirit of this being a debate let's maybe try to zoom in on the controversy which is why we brought you both on i think it's also important that like people understand all of which is not the controversy because i did see today on twitter like a lot of people saying okay so like this proves that maker can't be backed by usdc uh maker can't be backed by reward assets et cetera et cetera so just want to make like for like these reasons clear that yeah that's not i really like to dive into like you know rwa stuff and uhtc at some point but i am kind of curious like i think so far you know you guys have been talking a little bit about your respective visions and i think also your your blog posts go into a lot of detail or the forum post rather go into a lot of detail around how you sort of see the world and like what you want to see but i'm curious like what more specifically you disagree with right like there's one thing to say hey here's generally speaking how i think you know makers should go you know here's procures kind of want to do with metadatas but like i'm curious and this is for both of you maybe starting with roon like what specifically do you you know disagree with most in in hasu's uh post and pastor's point of view i mean i think what i would what i think i can respond to is like what has it was just saying which is like so i think i agree with like i think the way it has related is like i agree with this that it's like that's the most what i would say um but the most uh i don't know right this is an enlightened kind of like this is the obvious kind of um business as usual where we're making we've already been seeing maker going it's like of course like there's this whole thing about uh just like eath is a perfect collateral but it doesn't scale getting bonds on chain getting like stick like getting access to the yields and centralized stable points that unchain all of that stuff is like it's amazing like if you could build something on that and just scale it up and and you know become sort of the the stable kind of stable coins or stable coin of bonds and it's all unchained like that is that's an incredible product and unfortunately i don't think that um it's gonna you know i don't think i don't think it will be a stable equilibrium essentially right i mean because or rather it's like it's not guaranteed that we're basically allowed to exist right i mean we're already seeing in the u.s i i think it's basically been decided that um they're gonna they're gonna stomp on the on the stable coins basically like they're gonna like not just not just die actually even uhdc they're gonna they're gonna turn it into something like e-money in europe which is like an unviable business model basically uh i mean of course we can hope that this uh the latest stablecoin bill whatever it doesn't pass right but but it's it's being brought forth for like the momentum of you know that's like what they decided to turn luna's collapse into right they're basically trying to sort of not actually ban but practically ban stable points um so i think and i mean in europe they've got we've got mika mika is actually really really awesome because it accepts uh maker specifically it nukes pretty much everything else but maker which is like in in i would not argue in its current form or something very close to its current form where it's fully decentralized it's being actually accepted and actually gets into a very nice spot but the same thing is is happening where there's all this discussion around well how do we actually kill it because that's what they actually want right and and i think increasingly i mean they've been moving further towards actually let's just kill it that's that's the sense i get in in both in the u.s in europe and we've seen like struggling economies around the world they one of the first things they like to do is is to um ban all crypto right and and as things gonna get worse in in the west we'll see the same kinds of things right so i think first of all the first thing i that i wear sort of um i mean i basically disagree with hassou that it has to be only liquid like or rather i mean this maybe not the way to put it but i think that what i call clean money is basically collateral where you deliberate you deliberately use stuff as collateral that you wouldn't use purely for financial reasons and you use it essentially for like i mean well i would call it for meta for for meta reasons right but for some pr and political reasons not to mention internal governance reasons right but essentially we need to like prove to the world why they shouldn't shut us down right and why the politicians uh should understand that they'll actually get more votes if they if they allow something like maker to to exist rather than if they shut it down because we are able to sort of uh show to us regular people that there's some real value for them in this right such as here's a technical solution that can help with the huge coordination problem of climate right but beyond that i also think we need to be like properly prepared for like a full um sort of failure of these legal systems that right now we feel very uh like it's very convenient to sort of rely on and increasingly build on top of i mean not just these political attempts to destroy uh stable coins but i think even like a social breakdown right because as i said earlier once you start to see the cracks showing in an economy they're gonna they really crack down on crypto that's one of the things that they do and and i view that's really what i view like die should really be you know the currency that that doesn't die in that situation right so you know the old good old die or die right that um we need to figure out how to navigate past that and i think to do that we have to tap into these like not just the basic fundamentals of efficiency but we have to figure out how to all like how to get the community to come together basically and how to tap into these these new frontiers of what you can do with blockchain and web 3 and metaverse and intangible value and and and you know the ability for humans to organize with all this stuff and and so roone how do you how do you think hasu's idea of there being a sort of council of elders for maker dad how do you think that plays into those political risks that you're describing yeah i mean so i i mean i think also like so i actually um i sort of amended my own uh plan to actually include something called councils just because i think it's like a great i think it's great term it's a great term right like i think i think it's like a completely um like i i don't think it's viable to have a single council basically like that sort of directly goes against what i believe is sort of uh possible i mean or rather if you have a single council well either you will have like you will literally just have all value going to that council like they'll basically sort of embezzle all the value in the system or more likely they'll do that and then there'll be some kind of backlash scandal type of thing and then that's going to result in some sort of legal framework being imposed on this identifiable group right so the solution as i see it is you have a ton of like many councils and you also kind of um you know you put checks and balances in place to their power so you make sure they they uh you know they they set the high level they sort of help with setting they provide expertise for the high level direction and implementation and sort of what what conforms to the constitution and what doesn't and these kind of very important high level questions but you you know you sort of balance it out so they don't also sit and and are involved in like i don't know making deals or engaging with counterparties to the point where they can build up yeah some i mean yeah something called private entanglement but basically a kind of power like a kind of leverage that you can get in a dow that makes it very difficult to kind of undo like once you build it up it's very hard to to unwind again and that's one of my biggest fears and and why i come back to this thing of like you have to put in place something that is so decentralized it can be cracked because any kind of crack you know once it starts happening it'll it'll only go one way i think so so let's get your response it sounds like roon believes that your proposals don't sufficiently take into account the political risks both of the existence of a single council but also the political risks that are imposed on maker dao's just continuing existence yeah so i think we both agree that something has to be done that there are sort of i mean large inefficiencies in mecca are not just inefficiencies but also sort of large voter apathy and like entrenchment of the token holders and the borrowers that all of this stuff is sort of you know it leads to a sort of a slow death for maker and it also makes it much easier to capture by regulators so i think something that both of our proposals tackle in their own unique way instead of how can we create strong checks and balances in maker so i think both both sort of proposals have at their core something close to sort of i like to call this like owner operator separation where sort of the the owners of the dao that okay our top models no longer have to be the ones that are operating at day to day and this was already sort of kicked off with the introduction of delegates but it would sort of be taken further with the introduction of one console or several consoles right um but once you once you start to delegate and sort of say okay so i'm appointing an agent to you know manage the dar on my behalf or at least like this small sub part of the dao then it it's really important to get you know the sort of make sure that you know the print you have you keep the principal agent problem in check you know that that you keep the incentives of the two parties uh aligned with each other and that's where i think actually that my like that the simple makeup proposal that i put out is um actually i mean it sounds simpler but i think it's actually is it much cleaner and actually does this job better because it's it's way easier to provide oversight on one console for mkr token holders than on 20 consoles like you need way fewer eyes need way fewer people to be engaged to observe sort of the output of one group then of many different individual groups why do you think it won't be the case that this council will not just embezzle or you know uh enrich themselves from their position as council members well so there's a couple different reasons i mean for one in my vision the council can only make recommendations to token holders so it can create i mean it can create proposals that then but these have to still be voted on every single proposal still has to be voted on by the mkr token holders but it's sort of presented in a much more high level way so it becomes actually much easier to to for the token to understand what is actually being voted on so for one they never give up control but they also gain sort of so much context and like bird's eye view on every decision that is being made because the council only makes like very rare uh occasional sort of very high level decisions so for example when the council would create a budget once per year instead of sort of continuously or maybe once every every six months then it have it would have to you know in all of the the budgets for the different core units and the different initiatives that make us they're all presented and negotiated at the same time and sort of anybody can look at say oh yeah i think you know is this like are we spending too much in total or not uh like where does this money go like and if i want to give more money to this credit then i have to decide i want to take it away from this other core unit and so on so i think and that we're actually making the decisions much more transparent and actually much easier to oversee and that we are adding um a lot of accountability to the mkr token holders which don't exist today because i agree that this does not make sense on paper right but what i've seen in reality play because i mean actually i think the same logic you could almost apply the same logic to the coordinates themselves right that like in the end they i mean they can't push anything through and they have to come back to to get their budgets renewed and so on right but what i really think is a central issue like a really big sort of corner we backed ourselves into is that yeah again it's the it's the context of this right so the real context right so on paper they're supposed to blah blah serve the dow and all about decentralization and all about cutting costs and so on but when push comes to shove you kind of see this like the way the dynamic actually is that that it's like you know here's the thing we worked on and it's great and here's a budget there's a bunch of money and we need some here here and we made it and you know we were chosen because we're the smart ones that know how to do this so here it is and basically you know this is the thing right and then if people sort of push back it's like oh my god you know you're mkl does you're no clue what you're doing you always just want to cut budgets and you know cut and that's going to harm growth but you have no sense of thinking about the long term right i mean there will be this i remember these cases of like people coming into the the discord right and and sort of um asking why the hell is the budget at 50 million right or 30 million or whatever it was at and then you had like one guy asking why is the budget so high and then immediately get like 20 to 30 like full-time employees right who's a full-time job is this stuff swarming and being like budgets are great for growth you know budget budget budget but right and and and nobody wants to participate in that kind of situation right like no one wants to be like the volunteer sort of idiot that's carrying all the other free riders that are not even speaking up at all right and then you have to fight politically against like 30 full-time experts who live and breathe this stuff right and i mean the only thing i can imagine is worse than that is like going up against like a council of like the seven makers right who's been sitting on this post last ten years right and you think you're coming to whatever right like in practice even if someone sort of had the like the power to kind of i mean so let's assume right i mean of course it's a hypothetical scenario right but let's imagine they're like super corrupt and they've been there for like a decade and someone's like able to kind of like get in there and figures generate some kind of leverage just like okay now you know like finally i can like i don't know replace one of them or something like that right it's just it's like and of course i mean i know that of course um this is i mean okay this is an unfair i mean i recognize this totally unfair example right but the point is like i think that like if you're already seeing all this that everyone's just looking out for themselves like what's gonna cause you to then do it for sort of the greater good and to undo all this corruption like i really think the people would do this so they could get a cut right so you may be gonna replace someone on the council but the person who gets in there it's gonna i mean it's gonna be like russia or something right and the new king or whatever will just take over the the you know the ability to to extract value and i i think the the only way to get out of this is to basically i mean so i know we disagree on this like this um agent owner separation right that i mean there has obviously there has to be like experts because mp analysts can be the experts because but but i think you actually must have what i call um i mean basically like volunteers like like a semi-altruist i call it right like people who are sort of they're in it because they can benefit through appreciation of the mkr token but not for some kind of special interest they have right so they're really just looking out for the token and then because they're looking out for the token they're looking out for the users the die holders because the token is linked to the die holders right and we have to build systems where you can't get comfortable and lean back and and they'll work even if the employer holders are totally out of it that's kind of what i mean that's what i discovered like that's why i got back into it like uh six months ago is because i noticed that there's literally not a single person active that wasn't getting paid in some shape or form right so the whole like the the inmates were running the asylum right there was actually nobody watching out at that point like because you can't you know you can't go toe-to-toe with with people that are full-time professionals especially when the whole thing is set up to sort of give them the momentum and give them the initiative and so that's what i believe we need to do we need to build something where you sort of put them care holder a pedestal in a sense right like the people who actually volunteer who are not getting paid who are there sort of to to uh simply vote and participate and and basically sort of do that duty almost like jury duty or something like everything must be set up for them and for them to be able to actually interact anywhere they want and for them to kind of like match all the the full-time professional actors in terms of like the ability to to politically clash in a sense right well let's give let's give haas an opportunity to respond yeah i mean i i basically completely disagree that you know mk alda should be put on a pedestal or that they should that they really have like a ton to add to the operation of maker dao i think the project is way too big too important and too ambitious and too complicated like for anyone who isn't sort of a full-time employee or like a long-term expert in in the field and that's that really is a very small sort of intersection um of people that sort of even qualify for you know steering make a dao in a meaningful sense and i i just think like the intersection of like these groups who are also then you know large mkr holders is basically zero if the project is supposed to have any future then i think we make it we need to make it possible for experts to drive maker dial and we need to make it extremely easy for mkr holders to hold these experts accountable and to audit the whole system from different angles so for example the council or councils i think they should not just contain mkr holders for example or like not just like shouldn't just like contain like people who make like strategic decisions or financial decisions etc you should also have sort of you know someone in there who represents for example die holders and one who represents the interests of borrowers and maybe one who interest you know has the interests of like the underlying blockchain like the ethereum ecosystem for example in mind i think definitely you should sort of factor in all of these different viewpoints and that's something that we also do at lido it's sort of the dual governance approach and optimism does with that do their you know house approach and i think that's that is really the future like having strong division of power but sort of in in at least like one side of it have sort of experts driving the ship and then everybody else you know gets a really clean look at you know what the experts are doing and um that they are steering in the right direction and along with that comes the you know the ability to to fire the console you know at will right i mean not just um approve anything that the console does everything needs approval but also sort of the ability to like unilaterally like replace council members or fire the entire council i think yeah i mean i i think that this stuff is really important to get right sort of the checks and balances and this is actually where we get to my my biggest sort of problem that i have with ruins and game vision and that is that it's too complicated for me to understand it's i think it has now sort of five posts i um i read the summaries summaries alone are like there are five summaries there together like over 100 pages and for me it's just it's just too complicated like i can read it but it's too complicated for me to like look at the whole system and say yeah this is definitely going to work like this is definitely you know not going to be exploitable and it's fundamentally not the way that i would you know design a system i think my approach to system design is you know the first define sort of the objective function of the system decide where we want to go then think of the design space for you know what are sort of the different governance systems that you can put on top in order to get us there and really keep it as simple as simple as possible because complexity is such a big risk and such a big danger the biggest unspoken danger of all you know systems that pride themselves on you know their resilience and such and i think for maker it's extremely important that it it is resilient that's one of its most important features for me i couldn't vote for you know this proposal because of its complexity to me that's sort of its big shortcoming and i think a lot of work like roon you have to put a lot of work you know into greatly greatly simplifying it before i think it becomes sort of viable for you know many voters like me yeah that's also feedback that i've also you know given you already sort of um six to nine months ago can i ask one question about the end game plan that jumped out at me from it that i really liked and i'd love to get hosus thoughts on this as well so one of the things that i found really exciting about the endgame plan was to mention that you know eventually make or dao could move beyond a simple synthetic dollar asset which was you know part of the original vision of maker dial that got me excited years and years and years ago to creating new synthetic assets you know whether it would be like a synthetic euro or a synthetic ether or synthetic bitcoin or synthetic you know equity index or whatever roon like you know do you think that that's crucial or core to the vision of maker now and hasu do you think that that is crucial or core to the vision of makerdale so there's a whole bunch of stuff to talk about with that with synthetic assets because that's actually been like that's been that was part of some of the vision from the start right so that's and actually i would say nowadays synthetic assets is part of what i call a trinity which is this concept invented by frax that there's this sort of natural law of gravity around what are the obvious once you reach a certain level of complexity of governance you do risk management you have this trinity of stuff you you kind of always want to build out both me and hasu we're basically saying look we need something that is possible to kind of like audit and control and and have certain guarantees around it and in order to get that it needs to be simple um and and complexity is the enemy right and then the main difference is that so i think the real like i don't think that 100 pages of sort of technical design or constitutional design uh or even 200 pages or how many pages you want i don't think that is complex at all compared to the complexity of human incentives basically and not just human incentives not just like selfishness but even like you know irrational malice you know in terms of interpersonal conflict and you know beef and insanity and and mental illness and you know this whole this good thing around like the number of ceos that are psychopaths and all this stuff right that's what i think is like the challenge that um that the mpr hosts need to be able to deal with like i'm not so not even close to worried about mpl as being able to risk manage i mean that's also a crazy challenge right of course risk managing liquidation of of assets that have some massive scale but dealing with with people right and and especially dealing with people in the total absence of legal frameworks of shareholder protection you know like fiduciary duty that's what i think is like the almost impossible challenge right and so to bring back to to um what has you talked about with the council right then you put someone who represents die holders you put someone represents eath holders into the council right but i mean i'm assuming that those people will still get paid right in which case they're not they're gonna represent the bureaucracy right i mean that's the reality of how human behavior works it's like literally one of humans one-on-one right and i mean more than anything else they're going to be subject to this very good old thing called iron law of bureaucracy which is that you know which is again this the context of an organization or resident like a bureaucracy or an organization is created to do x but the internal dynamics in practice sort of empirically you just we know that in almost all cases what happens is this sort of individual replacement of people and individuals or power struggles or people in a in an organization in a sense sort of represent the organization itself rather than its purpose uh gaining power right simply because it's again something like a loss of like a gravity natural law in a sense right so i think that you would have like someone representing die holders someone representing ethel or some representing whatever um the ethereum blockchain working together with council representing real world assets above and and they would all like what they would do is they would like secretly collude to produce propaganda making it look like they are whatever whatever the peop whatever they think will keep people to basically shut up and let them do their thing and then um they'll you know they'll like their objective would always be to just maintain sort of um uh like uh in dispute like i mean sort of risk like their goal would be resilience but it would be their own resilience right and and i think the only way to prevent that is to build up something i mean that's basically more like it looks more complex in terms of of sort of mapping out all the pieces but it's but what we're doing is we're making explicit the structure that becomes sort of you know let's implicit in a in a in this kind of structure where you sort of count on people taking care of it i mean so i would take the other approach and say um you know let's not just say that shareholder protection doesn't exist in a darwin can't exist and that fiduciary duty can't exist in the dao and that doubts can be transparent etc because i think we can just design the dao in order to have all of these properties and then you can actually have managers in place um and like people steering the dao on behalf of the token holder and they are accountable to these token holders you know that that they are working for so that is that was kind of that was my starting point um to be honest like that you can have these things in the dao and that you can design simple systems that get that that create them and that you can tune these systems over time as the need for that arises and i mean what i think we completely agree on is that we want to minimize the service for governance you know as much as possible right we we both want to build a system that can grow to you know trillion a trillion dollar and die uh circulation um and you know there is a lot of tail risk from something going wrong i think the like the risk from something going wrong and die is like um you want to minimize sort of that that risk a lot because you're dealing with people's savings here and you want this currency to be very very reliable and and you want it to be resilient to internal capture but also to capture by nation state attackers and so so i think we completely agree that we want um you know the core maker to ossify as much as possible and then sort of have a lot of expansion a lot of initiatives on the edges right and um i mean i think and like i haven't seen sort of an actual spec for the concept of a metadata and what that would look like i don't think it exists yet but i mean in theory this is also an idea that i think has been discussed before and that i'm high level supporting right like a metadata just being sort of the high level idea that you have um you know an organization that for example from for maker gets the ability to mint die up to a certain debt limit but it has to put up some of its own collateral first um and so if they if something goes wrong with that die then you know they are on the hook first before sort of it affects the the maker community for me that that looks for example also like a good scaling model but then you still need like you need a central in the central hub you need someone to pull you know the strings and like set okay so what is the risk limit for that metadata are going to be and and if we have sort of this budget you know and there are 10 meta dollars applying and which three should we fund etc so i think you you do need someone taking the central position because it does exist and you you very aptly described earlier what happens if that doesn't exist which is you do see budget spiraling out of control because of course for token holders every new proposal from a core unit looks amazing and looks like we need to fund this thing now but it doesn't factor in the next three budget proposals and the previous three budget proposals to be honest like a lot of mistakes have been made in maker's governance systems not predicting these things which to like for me coming in late is very hard to believe that for example it could be allowed that the the budget isn't decided you know once every six months for oil core units that there is this that they even is this like rolling window of approvals for all of these things and i think we i mean this is like the really really low-hanging fruits that we should clean up first yeah and i mean and i think that comes back to again what i call the context or in this case i mean you could say sort of the culture right that once it's like oh we're just doing some budgets you know then as long once you open the door to it it's all over the place and i mean one of the other interesting observations of this kind of thing playing out is something around like what i think it's called like the contingency buffer or something that the the core units had like a contingency buffer so like they sort of loaded up on like a buffer and then that buffer was supposed to kind of like yeah give them a buffer right so so if something happens they have some extra money but they sort of loaded up over it over a budget period and then i think literally every single core unit they rolled that over so that buffer just so so at one point the the finance core unit then one day they like did the numbers and they were like oh there's like 20 million dies sitting out there in these buffers that has been growing and growing and growing right which is exactly like if i mean if one one part is doing it then then everyone's going to do it and it's like yeah so i mean as i agree like that's and this what i talked about in the very i mean what i really keep coming back to that like it's a slippery slope kind of thing where you have to have this like it needs to be completely impervious right which is again what i think why you need to like spell it all out have really every single thing of like if this happens well then you you know if you see this kind of behavior then uh you know like uh like secrecy or any kind of like um like whatever right like like something that basically is like in the moment maybe could be justified as how we're getting some things done you know we had a quick uh you know this is the one i know can do it they just did it we didn't go through the open transparent process we did it the fast way right and maybe that makes sense in isolation but it has this second order ripple effect of suddenly you open the door to this kind of stuff right so i totally agree that like you can engineer something that looks like um like a fiduciary duty kind of thing because that's also the big problem it's like in maker today it's like whenever we see this small sliver slope uh you know little sliding things like all we can do is like basically well we can fire we're gonna be like oh you just you know didn't publish some message so that wasn't transparent so now you're fired right not just you in fact your whole core unit has to get fired right we can't do anything less than that currently so and that's a terrible dynamic right so then what happens is this opposite behavior where then actually the incentive is for the pia holders to like close their eyes and look the other way and be like oh nothing's going on right everything's fine because it's not like they can shut down a core unit because of some random small thing and so that rather just make everyone else think everything is fine to try to pump the price essentially right so you get this very bad negative dynamic that goes against trying to enforce this right and so with the metadows right so just to this example you were talking about right the whole idea is to have basically like instead of having like individuals like humans having the their political drama interaction with each other and with their holders so basically have like entire like taos do these interactions right so so i mean it's a bit yeah so like so that's like different classes i call them of the metadata right and so they're basically some that do the sort of the actual work and then they're the ones i call governor dallas and so the governor doubts they're the ones that for instance like run the councils and run the core units and then the idea is that the the metadata is the one responsible for kind of like adhering to the the best pro like the constitution essentially and then so and then everyone who works in some a core unit or council or whatever for a particular metadata they get a bunch of tokens for that metadata so they don't get mpr right they get the metadata token which is then sort of indirect explosion mkr but also exposure to the metadata itself and then if there is kind of um like if something goes wrong there's a best practice didn't wasn't followed or even there was maybe corruption or something ridiculous like i mean but but it could even be something like some kind of like small thing of like going down the slavery slope then maker can basically uh put penalties on the on these governor downs right so so suddenly the dynamic is flipped where it's like super easy for me to be like oh we don't it's you know is it like well here's the problem right let's find any kind of tiny flaw and let's go for that and be like smack a penalty on you so the gov so so suddenly it's like the dynamics flip it's really easy for maker to to find reasons to basically say something's wrong and then suddenly the core units the councils the metadata like their main concern is always how do we like absolutely do it one trillion percent by the book because like that's the that's the starting point for doing anything is to really just like adhering to the constitution basically and that brings us back to this kind of like really solidifying um this stuff right and then you have so let me let me let me pause you there it seems like the crux of what you guys are describing and i want to i want to wrap up on this it seems that the crux of what you're describing is how do you do management in a dow you know for a lot of very early dows you didn't really need management it's kind of a trope that in startups you don't really need management when you have like seven people because everyone kind of knows what to do everyone everyone kind of feels like they're part of the same team but as organizations grow they become more complex they require more hierarchy more structure more different kinds of affordances that we don't really have a handbook we don't really have like uh you know when andy grove from intel wrote high up output management that was like one of the bibles of how you manage large organizations and we don't have any concept like that for daos and one of the largest and most complex and and as you pointed out roon one of the most bureaucratic taos today is maker now and we're seeing i i feel like what we're seeing play out between the two of you is this fight over the soul of how do you evolve a bureaucracy to prevent the bureaucracy from becoming um stale in different ways and i think each of you has a different kind of fear about what can go wrong in a large complex bureaucratic organization but it's pretty clear that the answer is not that the complexity goes away because maker dao has irreducible complexity if we all agree that maker down needs real world assets if we all agree that it needs to continue underwriting new collateral if we all agree that there are all these complicated questions that need to get adjudicated by experts within maker dao that this is a really hard problem and there's no simple solution to it that being said i want to give each of you kind of uh as a very kind of a cute last word um i want to have each of you give one sentence of what you think was the best counter argument by the other person toward your side so roone i'd like you very briefly to start what do you think is the best counter argument that hasu has made towards you in one sentence yeah i mean it's obviously that complexity is very expensive i mean so what you just said haseeb of like it has to be complex i don't necessarily agree with it so and now i'm sort of getting in on that early on that i i think that there is a possibility that we have to just cut back our ambitions for how how much stuff is going to be going on in maker and and i believe that it's like either you do you know a massive workforce you do good the whole way and you actually make the like what we were just talking about this thing about decentralized fiduciary duty and all this stuff and if you can't do that i don't think you can go halfway like and and that's what i would basically yeah i mean but no but but the point is going the whole way that's very very complex and and it may not be possible but i mean i i think it is and i i hope it is and i think it's worth it like really what would you say was roone's best counter argument for your position i'm very bad at thinking on the spot so maybe i think of something better um later but i'm i mean i really like the emphasis that that runes proposal puts on you know creating strong checks and balances for the workforce okay well look obviously this is a this is an evolving conversation it's one that's not ending anytime soon so we look forward to uh having this conversation continue in the maker governance forums so for those of you who are listening if you haven't already you should go
