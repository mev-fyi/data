coinbase is launching a new layer 2 on ethereum called base what does that mean Jesse Pollock head of protocols at coinbase explains bass is an ethereum layer 2 blockchain that's the on-chain home for coinbase products users and assets and also an open ecosystem where anyone can build but coinbase is the on-ramp for the Fiat world to the crypto world and most coinbase customers are not transacting with blockchains from their own wallets they generally trust coinbase to manage their own private keys so what does it mean that there's a layer 2 that as coinbase puts it also connects to the exchange's 110 million users we have coinbase wallet which is self-custodial and then in the coinbase app we have the DAP wallet which is also a fully web3 native experience and so base is going to integrate into both of those people are going to deploy their applications on base and then users are going to be able to access those applications through coinbase wallet into the coinbase app dap wallet there's already a bunch of layer twos so why would a developer choose to build on base as opposed to on an existing layer too bass isn't ethereum L2 like optimism and Arbitron the thing that we think is going to be really different about faith is because coinbase has this Suite of products like our developer tools and our consumer front ends like coinbase and coinbase wallet we have the opportunity to bring all those things together around base and make it so it's really easy for developers to build and then it's really easy for those applications that the developers do build to actually get access to the users that are coming through coinbase clients whether or not this launch takes off or Falls flat like coinbase nft is anyone's guess let us know in the comments whether you think bass can help coinbase capture crypto natives again or whether the djans have already moved on
