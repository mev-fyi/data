not a dividend It's A Tale of Two fun now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet generally speaking airdrops are kind of pointless anyways um I named trading firms who are very involved I like to have the ultimate D5 Protocols are the antidote to this problem hello everybody Welcome to chopping block every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry insiders perspective on the crypto topics of the day so quick intros first we've got Tom the D5 Maven and master of memes next we've got tarun the Giga brain and Grand pubot Gauntlet today we've got a special guest with us Ilya who is the founder of near so I actually for today because we're going to be talking about AI I got gbt4 to write some intros for Ilia and you tell me which one you like first one is Ilia the near Network's Noble Navigator Ilya the brilliant blockchain Builder behind ear introducing Ilia near protocol's pioneering pilot Ilya the founder and fearless Frontiersman of near that one doesn't remember that's fine uh and then Ilya the near protocol Pioneer with a Visionary vibe uh welcome to the show Ilia uh Chad gbt welcome to you as well and then you've got myself I'm perceived head height man and dragonfly so uh we are early stage investors in crypto but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice legal advice or even life advice please see chopping block.xyz for more disclosures I should also mention before kicking off the show dragonfly we are investors into near protocol tarun are you also an investor engineer we are these are Okay cool so just just so that we're all fully disclosed Ilia and us go way back and so uh he's a good friend and uh we're excited to have him on the show because in addition to all the crazy news that's been going on there's been a lot of hype around Ai and all the advances in machine learning large language models and we wanted to finally get a show to cut through some of the noise with somebody who who knows about this more than almost anybody especially in the crypto industry but we are going to get to that first I want to get through some news because it you know the last couple weeks have been all about this banking crisis been going on in the U.S things are now winding down and so we're going to take the first half of the show roughly just talk about the news and then we'll jump into a deep dive on AI so let's update what's happened over the last week that's significant on the crypto side so the first thing was that uh Signature Bank was one of the banks that was wound down and there was this you know a broad discussion within crypto about is signature being headshot because of its proximity to crypto and its crypto making activities so there was a report that FDIC uh went after it took over uh the the auction process for Signature uh was requiring bidders to wind down the crypto business and then uh so this this was reported widely and then crypto was like oh my God it's happening operation choke point 2.0 was this really true um and then FDIC official denied in a public report that this was the case they said look that's not true this is a this is a bank we want to get the best value for the bank uh so you know any activities that are Revenue producing feel free to take them over uh then yesterday uh which was Sunday it was announced at signature uh was was in a purchase agreement with um New York Community Bank so New York Community Bank it was announced is going to be the buyer for Signature although the deal is not fully closed yet and New York Community Bank is winding down the crypto business so now is was this off instruction of FDIC uh I think not only winding down the crypto business meaning probably Signet uh which is the 24 7 real-time settlement system for Signature but also they are going to be debanking the crypto clients so they're going to be asking the crypto clients take your money buzz off go somewhere else we don't want you here so one this this again begs the question was this FDIC kind of you know nudge nudge saying hey if you want the spank like get rid of this crypto stuff or was this just you know in your community bank just not liking this thing and saying like look after silvergate I don't want crypto deposit money it's not worth a headache and it seems to invite more trouble than it's worth one way or another this seems to be an indication that whether it was FDIC directly or whether it was indirectly through the treatment of all the crypto Banks and the fact that like you know all the stuff is in the news now and you can't help but notice that banks that bank crypto clients get a lot more attention from The Regulators than they otherwise would like to um that this is causing this kind of uh this uh stigma around banking crypto clients that's likely going to continue in the U.S what were you guys perspective on this story about about signature and the debanking of uh signature crypto clients yeah I think um part of it is definitely a narrative that is being I think propagated in a lot of press Outlets with respect to oh crypto caused these you know these Bank runs and crypto causes banking crisis and you know I think there's not a lot of Truth to that but obviously it's a great narrative to tell um I think we'll happen see what happens with SVP obviously SUV is still looking for a buyer um there weren't a big crypto Bank like you know crypto is a very small percentage of their business but um if whoever buys sdb also winds on their crypto business there might be more to the story but this feels maybe a bit um sort of isolated in some ways so I know there's actually some other big banks that started de-banking crypto companies even before SUV's kind of case started so it's not like that that message was already there and kind of banking Regulators I think were already propagating that message so I don't know if it's FDIC itself but like I think it's it's already word on the street that crypto banking kind of is risky and people should stay away from it on the banking side yes sir Nick Carter made this point when he was uh he wrote this blog post that's gotten uh you know at the time it got some attention now with the intention on this blog post has exploded where he describes this operation show Point 2.0 which is basically this kind of full court press from the executive branch to try to put pressure onto anybody who touches crypto from the banking side and you know it's now really manifesting that we're seeing bank failures this is a perfect time to you know paint crypto as a scapegoat as as you said Tom what I'm curious about so one obviously there are banks that have are starting to position themselves as being crypto friendly obviously these are mostly smaller Banks because you know they can afford to take more risk obviously as a small Banker more like a startup and you're more willing to like try to do something risky in order to win a big business so cross river is you know sort of effectively a startup bank that is that is doing this um and there are a few others that have positioned themselves as cryptofriendly a lot of the banks are in Europe are taking the office attack Europe doesn't seem to be quite as aggressive Ilya I mean I know you're based in Europe at the moment what is What is the live you're seeing from the European side with respect to crypto making is this purely a us thing or is this uh spreading to Europe as well because obviously with credit Suites and all this stuff obviously Chris has nothing to do with crypto but there is a broader banking crisis going on in Europe now as well yeah I mean I haven't seen anything on the European side per se I mean Switzerland has been always very welcoming I think they're even more welcoming right now as this is kind of unfolding UK is also trying to uh set up kind of a better rules around crypto they actually as far as I saw adding uh crypto on tax returns explicitly so that you know I don't know if that's being friendly to cryptos which is wanting your pound of Flash from crypto as soon as soon as you put like you know if you if you say hey you should be paying taxes from this like that means like everywhere else like this is you know now is in accounting software it's in all of the systems so like now what rates are going to be taxing on that's that's the other thing but I actually think it's like a way to you're saying that you know we'd in many U.S states is the same as crypto the UK basically is there a tax returns on on wheat no now they ask you directly and a lot of State filings where it's legal yeah I think uh the UK is finally up to like 2019 IRS rules which I think when when it changed do you think Switzerland is going to continue to actually be positive after this current stuff they have yeah why not I I mean uh like for them what's the difference well I just feel like they their banking sectors probably consolidating is probably like means that the smaller Banks don't survive and like the smaller Banks were the ones just like here that gave a lot of the crypto company stuff like what was that bank seba SCBA or whatever that did like a lot of the 2017 layer one Ico stuff I I'm just curious if they think they'll survive because so in in Switzerland they have an inch weird system where like there's Canton that Banks which are actually can just like have all their deposits and not lend them and so and Canton is a really one business they really want people to come like when we were looking for foundation Canton governments were emailing me called cold emailing me which was like I'm like what government does that fascinating well okay so amidst this broader banking crisis there's been one story that's been dominating Twitter basically Twitter just can't stop talking about this which is uh a good friend of the show Balaji who is on the show uh I think a little while back um so he has made a bet and his bet uh is basically a million dollar bet or a million dollar in USD terms um he's basically betting a million dollars to one Bitcoin that essentially he believes that one Bitcoin is going to go to a million dollars within 90 days essentially Because he believes that the US dollar is going to hyperinflate so he's claiming could very loudly and very aggressively on Twitter that the banks are insolvent that uh the bank term funding program which is the sort of you know liquidity injection that uh the FED is providing to banks that need uh you know uh the need liquidity on some of their uh hold to maturity treasuries and and mortgage-backed securities uh that this program is pure quantitative easing and that in this banking crisis we're just gonna extend everywhere in the world all the banks or the majority of the banks are in solvent already the FED knew it all along they're going to hyperinflate the currency in order to you know kind of prop up the dollar system and that Bitcoin is going to go to basically Infinity um or you know a million dollars and so um curiously is making two of these bets so he's uh made one already I think he's gonna make another one or has he already made it I don't know um but so he's betting I guess 2 million USD uh that he's putting up against uh people's you know sort of Bitcoin in return and um this is it seems uh a little bit crazy I've gotten a lot of people hitting the oven being like hey what do you think about this biology thing do you think he's right like should I be worried should I like take my money out of the USD um what what's your guys uh what's your guys take on this apology end of the world that maybe many observers have made the same point but it's a great marketing spend at the very least you know Bitcoins already moved up like 10 10 plus he already owns more than you know 10 million worth of BTC which is very likely he's already sort of EV positive um I think the other thing is that this is the type of thing where it's directionally correct like yes there is going to be like I mean just look at the overnight banking operations changes uh over the weekend for the all the central banks coordinating to provide liquidity that that's a little bit that's very 2008. uh and I think directionally this is correct like there is just like a ton of operation there are a ton of operations that are basically quantitative using 2.0 3.0 whatever I don't know it depends on how you want to index it there's a sense in which such a bet will cause you know if enough people glom onto it will cause things to move in that direction even if it's negative EV and right now all he's doing is basically recouping costs but as long as Bitcoin still goes up you know 10 to 20 percent he's fine okay so you take a cynical view that you think that he doesn't actually think bitcoin's going to a million but he owns enough Bitcoin that if he can meme a price rally in Bitcoin which you know obviously Bitcoin is rallying outperforming everything else right now uh that it pays I mean it's not just a pays for itself it's also that it's directionally correct so like even if it doesn't hit a million he's always going to be able to be like look Banks did hyperinflate they even if I I made the wrong bet I got the right direction and I just didn't hyperinflate enough it has a little bit of like I can fall back on that it's not just like oh I got it wrong yeah I got the magnitude wrong I got the direction right all right yeah I agree with that I think it's one of those things where you know even if you're off by like a few folds you can still sort of claim victim jury it's kind of people who thought you know there's me a million people dead in the US from covid and like early 2020 I was like okay well look you got you know that the time frame wrong and like the numbers wrong but like you were sort of right and like ringing the alarm Bell I think that's kind of what he's going for but yeah I think I kind of disagree with his yeah his interpretation of what's happening with like btfp and yeah it seems more like I mean we're talking about in The Show everybody's talking about it it's actually very difficult to get that to get that kind of earned media for like a million dollars that is very true Super Bowl ads uh are a lot more expensive than that and I don't think they have the reach of this as much as I think uh Gabriel Laden was uh who who founded limit break is a marketing genius on the internet I'm not sure I would call the seven five to seven million dollars or whatever I spent on the digi daigaku ad on the Super Bowl very good whereas this is like the most persistent marketing for a million bucks like if you compare it it's like it's it's unreal how good marketing this has been yeah it's very very very fair point I guess yeah the the issue that I take with it is that like a million dollars is a 60x increase in the Bitcoin price right this is not a this is not a directional oh Bitcoin went up and now it's worth you know 35 instead of 20. it's like oh you're still off how many how many claims in marketing 9x are like we're gonna improve your life by 1.5 if you buy this product no they're all like we're gonna improve your life by 5x if you buy this product and this is just the same time 60 I I again but 60x is like it's just a big hurdle you know but anything else would not make people pay attention right even if it was actually 100K if it was 100K people like yeah it's kind of plausible you know the Bitcoin and Twitter would be like super excited you know crypto Twitter would be like that's interesting and it would kind of die away 999 999 would not have memed right like you would not have got the attention and you would not get the Articles like like there's also this fact about choosing the number it's all it's like astrology like choosing the right number somehow like I guess I resist the like Justin Sun kind of energy that you guys are ascribing to biology here but I think again it it's it's a directional badge right like it's not 90 days it's you know two five years but like it you know if if the system doesn't fix itself right there there's something gonna break it's a little more like microstrategy meets Justin's son yeah it's uh people I think it was mad at me was saying you know if you really think Bitcoin is going through a million dollars you should probably just buy spend that million dollars and buy Bitcoin instead of uh you know buying Bitcoin for a million dollars today um but it sort of Misses like the reflexivity of Bitcoin as a market and sort of almost manifesting like the price increase by sort of putting this idea into people's heads like there's a sort of a core reason why you would see that kind of inflows but you sort of create this meme around it and and that can sort of uh self-manifest yeah I mean look it's hard to know if it is like okay the counter factual is hard to tell right obviously at a time when you know the expectation of interest rates are cratering and banks are failing like okay yeah that's good for Bitcoin so that that Meme was already happening before biology made this pad so it's hard to tell like how much of a lift was biology's bet and the earned press as you guys put it I mean it does seem like it's having some impact because so many people are messaging me about it that I have to assume this is kind of you know it's drilled itself into people's brains that like hey maybe you should be worried about this um the interesting thing is that you know unlike most of the rallies all coins are not following so it's really just a Bitcoin breaking way ahead of everything else which maybe lend some Credence because most of the rallies we've seen in crypto especially around interest rates have been pretty broad like everything kind of followed together now Bitcoin is really breaking away in the market and that maybe again it's hard to ascribe uh something that'll say oh well this is because of this thing and you know like who knows markets are kind of crazy so okay let's take the this kind of Showmanship of the BET aside what about the claims in the bet so you know one of the things that that biology and a lot of people on Twitter are arguing about right now is whether or not the bank term funding program which is the the sort of you know the credit line that the FED is offering to to banks on their treasuries um is it QE and if it is QE how stimulative is it and should we be thinking about this as hey the FED is totally about face now they're doing QE again and you know like we're basically going back to uh you know the kind of profligate uh stimuli of stimulative monetary policy that we had for the last you know 10 years if you asked someone in 2008 if this was the last failure every time there was a failure they would have said yes right there's sort of this like you're living in the fog of War you don't really know what's going to happen central banks seem to be incompetent at communication right now I only say that because of like this weekend stuff I mean did anyone watch the Credit Suisse press conference that was a little embarrassing for the Swiss government I'm not gonna lie that was like that that did not sound good like the media had some pretty Hardball questions and then like the banking officials whether they were from UBS credit Suites or this was government were just like yeah we don't know it's fine we'll figure it out like in the very like non-ploosed way that did not give anyone any confidence for instance you know one of the biggest things people thought about in the US bailout last time was like oh do people get paid bonuses or do they get clawed back and there's a reporter who asked you know hey it seems like you're not like calling pay of any Executives you know are is that planning on changing it they're like no no no we just agreed on it we're like never going to change this and like then there was this huge uproar and then they were just like oh well maybe we'll change it and it's like well I guess they're making their decisions live at the press conference you know it it just like it didn't really Inspire confidence and so I I think this fog of War thing is also really true so it's kind of hard to make such a strong claims let's be what I'd say I mean I so with this with this Banker funding program I think a lot of the assumptions people are making around it claiming that it's QE and it's kind of you know this broad you know paradigm shift and how central banks are approaching the situation like almost all the assumptions I'm seeing about is Arthur Hayes had a piece uh who you know we just had one recently where he talked to I think it's called kaiseki where he talked about like hey this is actually kind of disguised QE and you know qe's back on and central banks start printing again and I think almost every every crypto take that I've seen about this that basically calls a QE is assuming that this program is going to keep rolling over um like the reality is that uh the difference generally between QE quantitative easing and this Bank term funding program is that in in normal QE you buy assets from the market you generally buy toxic assets and you often buy them at a premium and you just hold them on your balance sheet for some uncertain period of time like you might uh you know hold them to maturity or you might you know if they're like other assets you know like mortgages or whatever um you might just hold them for a while and then eventually sell them back when the market stabilizes right but you're basically you're providing a lot of liquidity to the market and absorbing toxic assets for an uncertain period of time that is not what the bank term funding program is doing ostensibly right in this case the program is explicitly for one year it maybe rolls over for two years but you know it it's in this program instead of buying the assets outright what they're doing is they're allowing you to borrow against it so they're basically saying like look I'm going to be a pawn shop for you you've got these toxic assets I'll let you borrow a lot against it right I'll let you borrow it at par even though the the market value of these of these mortgage-backed Securities or these treasuries is down and I'm going to charge you five percent I mean basically charge you the prevailing interest rate right so this is not cheap it's not cheap borrowing but um you know you can you can borrow from the fed and you know basically you have a year to like kind of tie it over your liquidity needs and if at the end of the year like you can't figure out how to make money or satisfy your depository base you're done you're you're not going to make it right it's okay you can argue like well are they really gonna let the banks fail a year from now if they didn't let them fail today like what's really the difference I mean I would argue a lot of what the FED wants is no shocks they don't want shocks they want sudden things to happen but if these Regional banks are just [ __ ] if they're just horribly mismanaged and they took a lot of risk and you know they can't get recapitalized and they need to get bought then okay you've got a year to figure that [ __ ] out right like the the thing that markets hate is uncertainty and volatility if you can smooth that volatility that's kind of the purpose of a central bank is to smooth that volatility and basically say like hey let's give people a year to like buy each other acquire each other reorganize their assets make sure that you know we don't have like sudden collapses but if these banks are not viable they're not viable and like I don't think the US is is fundamentally committed to Never Letting another bank fail like Banks do fail like it's not that uncommon for banks to fail the problem is Banks failing at the same time that's the thing that the FED doesn't want yeah I uh I agree with your points respect to the difference between QE and and uh ptfb in terms of like okay you know Banks don't actually want to use PTFE unless they have like an immediate you know liquidity constraint and the nature of and the scope of it is pretty limited I think um something that is somewhat different about about apologies argument too is that like unlike 08 or maybe even you know 100 years ago is the proliferation of social media and basically the ability of that to instigate Bank runs in a way that is an order of magnitude or two faster and greater than it was back then um which you kind of saw with svb with all these you know group chats and all these people dming each other and busy within 48 Hours everyone trying to withdraw their cash from the bank and that basically creating a credible strain and a need for liquidity and those tapping into btfp pushing more dollars into the system and I think that's kind of where he imagines the uh hyperinflation coming from but I also think the hyperinflation thing is a little uh maybe maybe melodramatic like I see a lot of crypto people um getting excited about the million dollar bed and oh yeah you know [ __ ] the banks [ __ ] USD um I don't think anyone actually wants to live any world where the US is undergoing hyperinflation it would be extremely bad everything would go to [ __ ] even if someone needs to buy enough Bitcoin to make pathologies easy greater than zero on this BET right and those are the people who are buying it so I I mean look I I do think that Bitcoin is going to do well and I think it's plausible that this has I mean I think it's obviously this program is not uh it's definitely stimulative to some degree right obviously it's providing more liquidity um but it's not you know it's not pure stimulus in the way that that QE is it's more subtle than that but I think it is gonna be good for Bitcoin and I do take biology's point that like probably there's going to be more inflation obviously the FED has to back off now and interest rates are pricing in that um you know the FED is not going to raise rates all the way to like five and a half or whatever it was already originally they're probably going to back off before the end of the year and that's going to make it harder to Tamp down on inflation so probably yeah inflation is going to be elevated in the US for for some time now for those who don't know hyperinflation is when you basically get into like a reflexive inflationary Loop where inflation just increases and increases and increases and there's no psychological way to kind of stop the expectation that the money is just going to get debased further and further so tomorrow it's going to inflate more and the day after that it's gonna inflate more and so you just want to get your money out as fast as you can and nobody wants to hold dollars anymore that kind of event has happened before you know it happened in Zimbabwe it happened in Weimar Germany happened in Ukraine in the beginning of night that's right I remember buying bread for ten thousand hundred thousand a million was in like span of a year oh wow nothing like logarithmic scales it does happen right but it happens mostly in failed States um and it happens you know maybe once a decade or so there's like a hyperinflationary event the US dollar hyperinflating would be absolutely like just batshit crazy this is not a prediction you should take lightly as like oh you know the central bank is gonna not lower interest or they're gonna lower interest rates too fast so it's going to hyperinflate this is also why it's very clearly a trade not a a real philosophical bit but I think there's an interesting question of like confidence of dollar right like that you know there's uh maybe like nobody's counting this but there's like a global confidence in dollar quote unquote you know latent score that like all the outside of U.S countries are putting confidence this is you know how much the indexing their reserves into this how much of the economy is kind of transacting in it and is like is the events have been happening gonna help us this confidence know right so like it's definitely gonna reduce index which means this assets like the central banks the kind of economy the companies need to go somewhere and given those receivers other countries like a lot of them have similar problems right and so there's an interesting question of like yeah what is the confidence you know where like let's just say it's not a zero sound but you know that conference needs to go somewhere and so that's I think what at least like if I was Bloody that's what I would be banking on it's like hey like here's an asset where you can put confidence in the rules are known the supply is known the like you know a bunch of people already have it like it's you know so far still easy to come and go in it and you know if if a lot of people even put a fraction of their kind of value into it it's gonna actually be like then hit this reflexive state where people see it going up and they're like oh actually we need to go because palaji said it's going up right and so like I mean there's like a huge reflexivity in crypto in general right and obviously I mean Bitcoin has like less if you considered just being bigger but you know just kind of kick-started by like world events and so the amount of attention right now on this is is huge you know actually the the reason I was laughing about this is my my friend who's uh who's that who's had open Ai and like because maybe it's a good segue for our AI uh segment and you know he's been in AI stuff for like maybe a decade okay so my friends in the SF scene uh especially EA people are actually getting freaked out by the biology tweets I literally got that while Ilya was talking so all I have to say is amazing marketing right there's no way you're gonna for a million dollars you get anywhere near this level of dispersion that is very true yeah somebody on Twitter said it's like biology paid two million dollars to be the main character for next 90 days on the Bluebird app it's and it seems to be working I mean like I I just think like people who aren't even paying attention to crypto or suddenly like oh my God what is this guy saying okay well as long as we are kind of taking sides let me just register that I don't think the US dollar is going to hyperinflate but I do think Bitcoin is going to do well over the next 90 days but uh but let's let's take that segue and kind of transition over to second part of this conversation which is about crypto and AI so obviously AI has been on the rise you know chat gbt large language models diffusion models everybody is going nuts now over this idea that AI is is just it's the next massive technology Wave It's a platform it's deflationary it's going to change everything um so Ilya the reason why we brought you on the show is that you are kind of the natural person to talk about the intersection of crypto and AI so just a quick way of background so Ilya you were originally at Google you were actually working on tensorflow and you also were right before you left Google you were the one of the co-authors on a very famous paper in AI uh called attention is all you need which is the paper that introduced the Transformer model which is the model that is now used to train almost every large model in in AI it's basically kind of revolution you know basically uh uh machine learning at a scale that we've never seen before um and so originally before starting your protocol you were starting a company called near.ai which was an AI company where you were trying to build a sort of GitHub co-pilot type thing back in the day obviously you didn't have the resources that GitHub has they still own the domain and pan was very much intended I'm sure it's going to go for a lot more today than it did at back in 18. uh and then 18 you pivot into blockchain and um we I remembered uh the coffee shop where we originally initially met and you pitched us on the very very v0 version of near protocol uh which was totally broken and made zero sense uh but you guys were uh you and your co-founder Alex were some of the most brilliant guys that we'd met working in the blockchain space so I I'd love if you could um kind of talk us through what have you seen so you were at you were at Google basically at the seat of this when we were just starting to turn the corner on a lot of the problems that were seemed to be in Super Bowl back in 2018 2017 right people people were excited about oh hey we've got things that like kind of sound vaguely like humans or you know uh we had we had all these back in 2018 every single problem in AI whether it's like you know syntax parsing or uh you know to understand a natural language or machine translation there were all these individual models that people were kind of training and fine-tuning on individual problems and basically that is gone that it's not completely gone but a lot of it has just been like kind of Blown Away by the generality of these large language models talk us through what was that what was it like for you seeing that evolution in your time at Google and Beyond uh since you came into the blockchain space for sure yeah so my my journey in kind of neural networks deep learning started actually so I was playing with this stuff like when I was in high school and I always thought it was interesting but it didn't work right like the kind of the neural networks back then were like basically you know just a basic classifiers that you can could not use for much and then I remember reading the paper which was Andrew Yang and Jeff Dean training using a large at the time GPU cluster inside Google and they were pre-training Model uh to you know re look at the image and output image back and kind of create a representation inside and they found later inspecting it that it had the neuron that would recognize cats and so that like it's kind of called cat neuron back then and that was like for me was the signal that I need to go into this so that's when I applied to Google research and kind of joined the team because this was kind of the first time you we did not teach machine to recognize anything specific it wasn't a classifier it was just for training and it found something that like relates to human Concepts at the same time I I always believe language is like images there is you know thousands of species in the world that can actually like navigate world you know look at things and have eyes Etc there's only one species in the world that speaks language and so I always thought that language is a way to kind of actually train those models and and get them to actually understand and reason and and make logical uh conclusions and answer questions with all this and so that's what I worked on now back then state of the art was recurrent models and recurrent models means you kind of one word at a time pretty much read the sentence and you kind of process it and so first of all it's highly inefficient right second because of kind of the way these models are trained it's actually very unstable model and so-called kind of gradients explode when you try to train it and so it was really hard to train them and even harder to put them in production there's no recurrent models ever put in production uh kind of at Google scale because it would take you know seconds to like actually query out of it and Google you know optimizes for millisecond response time and so what we would do is we would then take and dumb down these models to just words independent words without order and kind of training the dumb down model that does not know anything about order in a sentence to then output the same prediction and then try to launch that and we've launched a bunch of stuff like that and so then there's a concept of attention came in and so that actually helped a lot with kind of training these models because it allowed to bypass this recurrence right this kind of step-by-step evaluation and kind of look back into a sense like let's say if you're doing translation look back into words in the sentence uh you were translating kind of when you outputting the answer and so that was the concept of attention and then there's like few papers that like tried self-attention as well and so combining all this right we knew that kind of bag of board models were actually kind of okay without order self-attan kind of attention and then self-attention was an interesting concept um and we needed something that's way more efficient right to train uh this all kind of came back came in and uh Jakob uh kind of our manager lead at the time came this idea it's like why don't we try just not kind of putting them in sequence but just processing all together but then attending back into the whole sequence and using that to output and so for machine translation for example task uh output in that and so that's what kind of how Transformers started and the idea was I like to describe it for people who watched the movie arrival instead of you know like we usually say one word at a time the aliens were outputting the whole sentence at the same time and that's that's what that model learns to do it's way more efficient and effective which means you can train it longer more and it's the same time kind of the gradients like the the actual training methodology is more robust and so that's what we kind of we had first prototype and that's where uh I left and kind of the team continued and got in like amazing results and published that but the interesting thing is like that model architecture started to work for everything else right they started applying it for images to start applying it for other tasks and it just worked like without changes uh and that's where I think people started like experimenting more and more and and why it's now I think over 60 000 citations because now everybody's just leveraging that kind of as a basic building block as as only going to make one comment which is uh you said there's only one species that has language but there are dolphins go on yeah um all right next time we're gonna do a dolphin to human language translation model coming up next all right powered by New Year yeah but yeah I think that and then the big change that happened is this idea of pre-training which I mean which existed like we all pre-trained a lot of models before but they kind of applied at like a huge scale pretty much just feeding the whole internet to this model saying like I just predict the next word using this model and then we can condition you and sample from it like and kind of try to Output what would you if you had just seen this prefix would uh produce that's what you know this GPT uh free training team kind of and you know started to explode really because at a reasonable scale that models started to actually create representations similar to that cat neuron example started creating presentations of World Knowledge and being able to make reasoning because it's seen so many times how people reason about things so I remember you know I was following um opening eyes work from the very very early days when they first you know with gpt2 and then eventually of course g53 which is the one that took the World by storm and I remember being absolutely [ __ ] amazed that with unsupervised learning just basically just feeding lots and lots of text into a model that it could figure out such a wide variety of tasks that seem to be incredibly idiosyncratic right and so I think a lot of people internalize there's this great essay by Rich Sutton called The Bitter lesson where he describes like basically the history of machine learning was lots of people trying to solve these individual problems and thinking that the way you saw these individual problems is you as a human being as sort of like the the architect of the AI you have to encode into that particular AI idiosyncratic features of this problem right so like oh just understand a face well there's like a nose and there's two eyes and there's some Symmetry and there's all this other stuff that that like the model needs to know that we know about the world and only if we encode that into the model is it going to get anywhere near the right answer and that's what a lot of old school machine learning approaches would like embed kind of human human known features of the problem into the problem and what we've learned over time uh especially within the last like three to four years is that that just doesn't scale the thing that scales and gets to like the real state of the art for most problems that we have today obviously there's like some you know extrasia fine-tuning that we do for most these things but most of the way that you get to these world scale today is just throw [ __ ] loads of training at it just like lots and lots of data lots and lots of training lots and lots of money and if you just do that enough for almost every category of problem that we can think of the machine figures it out way better than we can and in a way like the human fine you know the human kind of symbolic craftsmanship just ends up being actually worse than just raw data input which seems to you know the belie anxiety that a lot of people have now about AI which is that okay now it seems more and more that the AIS just kind of need us to sort of like shovel it oil which is data I like it yeah there's some fine tuning there's some extra okay maybe we you know tweak the the [ __ ] you know training algorithm or whatever uh but for the most part we just need to generate lots and lots of training data and the more training data we generate especially you know with the tragic BT and and uh reinforcement learning with human feedback a lot of it is just like the way that these models are getting better and better is like they already have huge corpuses they already have all the writing on the internet that we're feeding to it the big thing is that we just need to train it to like not lie to us to be kind of friendly to follow instructions we like we have these gigantic you know 11 dimensional monsters and we're trying to like use you know just raw hours of human training to make it nice and and be friendly um and so yeah more and more I'm seeing this nervousness from people about this new state because it was beautiful before this idea that like oh we teach it about the nose and we teach her the eyes and then the machine figures it out and it's like no no don't tell me anything just give me lots and lots of pictures and like I'll figure it out I don't really need you I don't know what your what your perspective is on that yeah I mean I think that transition was happening for the past 10 years like again that paper was in 2013 that like hey you don't need to like handcraft things just throw just like it's a basic model right back then it was just a convolutional network now it's just Transformer and it will build representation that it needs to solve its task and then this representation that actually extremely useful across many many many tasks and so there was there was this thing thing embeddings which still exist actually uh inside gbd models and everyone everything else which represents pretty much meaning of the word it's you know fat like 100 200 numbers and these numbers represent meaning of the word and like people were training the model to get this embedding so then using the synthetics and a bunch of other tasks that was like you know we were doing that in 15 16 and it was extremely useful because um the kids would capture lots and lots of different dimensionality of of our world without like even you know us teaching it anything and then we could use that dimensionality to then decide oh is this a city or the person it can be like you know is this some words that mean similar things etc etc and I think this is just kind of continue expanding but we should remember this is still tools this is not a thing that has like a you know I want to do this this is like a tool we give instruction to and it does things for us and so I think it's important to kind of understand like at the you know at the base of it it's a thing that like it ingested all the World Knowledge it has the common sense now it has some you know resemblance of logical reasoning although not always correct but it's a tool that we kind of feed the input to produce output now it's a really powerful tool and kind of the way people will start using this can be extremely dangerous right that's why like you know teaching it not to do bad things is good but like people keep finding ways to kind of go around the teaching right and like you know they close the one level now people like pretend you're someone who is who is pretending that you're someone that uh doing something right and like that that now jailbreaks kind of the system so like it's a tool that you know people will be using for things and so we should look back again at people and how this can be used and what things that people usually do with tools you know good or bad and just magnify that by kind of the abilities of the systems so I actually you you brought up Sutton before let's see a sudden sort of a famous author in that he he sort of coined the term to some extent reinforcement learning which uh you know in the 80s but you know one of the reasons I think people missed the sort of like hey we can throw more parameters and we don't it'll eventually will figure itself out is that it's not just the idea that we were encoding like hey we need these features that are human interpretable like a nose but it's also that statistical Theory still to this day doesn't justify over determine systems like this where it's like hey we have way more models than even data points by like orders of magnitude and there's really no way to know if like you can ever have something that's stable like if I throw in one new data point it doesn't completely destroy the model but the last sort of 10 years have been a resounding set of examples that hey these models are sort of robust in a way that basically none of the existing you know literature could ever describe correctly and I think to some extent maybe the the limits of such models that are over determined is that you you can't really stop them in the sense of like you can't really figure out how what types of constraints to put to like avoid these types of jailbreak scenarios be precisely because you're like okay well we're willing to just have like way more directions to search in the model space than there are actual possible queries and so there's always sort of some some way of of getting to whatever outcomes State you want and sort of the opposite philosophy of crypto which is like how do we restrict the number of output States like quite dramatically I mean what I've seen from open AI is that they seem confident that if you just do more more and more more reinforcement learning like eventually you will you will get it to you know sort of enclose that output space more and more such that like you kind to find these nooks and crannies that people are exploring by try to jailbreak the system or get it to like tell you how to hotwire a car or tell it you know how to hack a bank or whatever all these all these things that people have managed to get chat gbt and Bing and things really of Sydney uh get Sydney to to tell you how to do and like the reality is that we're at the very infancy of this stuff and it's only going to get better right it's gonna get better it's already gotten better insanely fast and no doubt that is going to accelerate as people realize the the economic value that is you know going to be Unleashed with all these large language models I think this is where it's interesting to think about so open AI went from you know hey we're gonna build it and open source it and everybody can use it to like Hey we're gonna control it because we're afraid of what how people will use it right that's really kind of the transition and you know Ilia so it's Kevin actually mentioned that like hey I was wrong like if you have such a powerful tool would you really give it out to everyone to uh leverage and this is where I think think coming from a crypto you know blockchain web3 perspective and honestly open source like I've always been doing open source in my life like open source always wins like there's no so far like products that in in long enough term open source did not take over I think like the only one so far is search and this may change actually because of this models and so the the reality here is yes open source will be lagging maybe like one model like one year of modeling behind but for anyone who is like following open AI footsteps right now it totally makes sense to open source it because they get so much street cred for doing that and like they don't lose anything because like well open AI has uh kind of there's not and we already see like a bunch of them are open source like like some of the models you can run on your laptop uh that like you know reasonably powerful like this obviously not not near gpd4 rgbt even 3.5 but you know they're starting to get there and the reality is like it doesn't matter what you what open AI does to train it like there will be models that will be used in all kinds of ways and did Facebook get street cred that's my question for you yeah that was a very I was about to bring that up as well so Facebook they invented this model called llama which is much smaller than in terms of the number of of Weights than gpt3 gpt4 we actually don't know now opening I won't even tell us how big the model is but uh gbg3 we know it's I think 175 billion parameters and um llama uh they release these models that are significantly smaller the smallest one I believe is seven billion um which is which is you know enough that you can run on your laptop mobile phone mobile phone even oh wow uh well they demonstrated that actually if you instead of like blowing up the size of the model if you just train the model for longer actually you can get a significant increase in performance that approximate a lot of what you get from you know something like a gbt3 uh but not only that there was a more recent paper that came out from Stanford called alpaca that showed that if you basically use in conjunction the outputs from a bigger like sort of more robust better trained language model you can actually approximate that model really really well as long as you have kind of a big enough uh model that you're training on and so you can sort of Imagine like the kind of gigantic blob Big Brother gpt4 training this like little llama model running on your on your mobile phone actually can get your mobile phone to really closely approximate the big monster which is like surprisingly cheap I think they they said like you know roughly on the order of like a hundred thousand input output examples which is crazy which basically means that the edge of having a gigantic model that's like you know hidden behind a wall and that you know nobody can access and the weights are secret and the size is secret that actually that moat just might kind of Melt Away uh if in fact this kind of uh you know sort of a co-optive training can be done at scale because you never know when you're talking to somebody is this person training another model to steal my internal knowledge and that might really change the economics for how these large language models end up interacting with each other yeah so this is actually exactly what we're doing to launch staff at Google we were we would take expensive model and then we would train a way cheaper like bag of words or whatever model just by feeding the input to the bigger model and kind of training uh the smaller modern output so like this is like distilling or you know there's few few different terms how to call in that and that's part part of the reason the other part yeah that you just can query out kind of uh information out of this bigger models even if they're closed uh source so that's why I'm like open source will win right it's it's like real get this out and and smaller models can approximate very closely indeed this so I think the the mode there is again it's it's just like it's people multiply by compute multiplied by data but I think the the most interesting mode is actually product it always was right like at the end if if everybody believes chat GPD is the main thing where you find kind of best state of the art everybody goes there everybody talks to it everybody feeds data to it that data then kind of improves the models like that becomes kind of still ahead of everything else because it just don't get this flow that's and that's what Google being Google being not compared to being in other search engines because it became kind of stated like state of the art like people kept feeding it you know queries and clicks and there's queries and clicks then fed back into improving the model and so there was no way to kind of turn that around again unless you completely change how this thing isn't kind of interacting and so I think the industry mode open AI has is in product land not in like model architecture or or purely like data like it's it's in this feedback loop that they built okay so I think this is a good place for us to bring it back to crypto so obviously AI is huge everybody's thinking about it and so naturally given how hype driven crypto is there's a lot of people who are now trying to take the two and mash them together and see what you know is there some is there something that we can do with crypto or blockchains to enable AI to be fair to be fair every cycle has had a lot of oh yes non-reputable scam versions of this but I I think we're our goal in this conversation is to focus on the actual real ones not the marketing just does that disclaimer to anyone who is listening who is like oh you missed AI coin and it's like well AI coins get repos null so okay well so there are a few threads that I think we keep coming back to and to be clear this you know this this isn't just with the Advent of you know uh PT in these large language models I remember when I first started getting into crypto investing in the 2017-2018 cycle there were also a bunch of AI hype driven blah blah blah you know type blockchain projects but I think we keep coming back to a few core ideas and I want to get your take on you know what what you think about the intersection of crypto and machine learning so three years in particular I think that are the most they get the most attention the first one is sort of private machine learning uh whether it's like using zero knowledge or fully homework encryption or multi-party computation one way or another finding a way to make machine learning training uh happen in a way that is privacy preserving the second is decentralized training so obviously you know you've got the all these companies spending huge amounts of money on training these models is there a way to decentralize that and do a kind of peer-to-peer you know folding at home kind of thing uh and then the third is what if you just put the [ __ ] model on chain and you do inference on chain which obviously is you know you you want you wouldn't want to do training on chain because training is super expensive but inference is so much cheaper so it doesn't make sense to just put models on chain and you know query them that way which of these approaches do you think are the most interesting and why walk us walk us through them if you can so let's start maybe with the car the current state right so the current state is these models are trained on super computers which are Bill built out of a purpose-built hardware which is called Nvidia a100s and there's a new version which is h100 or tpus at Google or there's like few other like trainium and few others uh in in other organizations but kind of generally speaking this is like when when it says Nvidia GPU that it's not the GPU you have in your you know play a game box uh to render Graphics it's especially designed for uh for AI training uh gpus they cost thirty thousand dollars so you usually use about this like for gvd3 ish model you would use a thousand of them for three months so this is about a million dollars worth of kind of cost to train a model like that so there's not that many like kind of companies right now that can afford this and so this gpus a thousand of them are interlinked with uh kind of very high speed connectivity and when I say very high speed this is like six seven hundred gigabytes per second so this is faster than the connectivity between the GPU itself and the local Ram like the memory on the computer itself by like or like almost order of magnitude so it's literally easier to send data to another GPU than to sit and like reconfute something later then to save things and load it back so that's the current state of how this models are trained and so when somebody says like hey let's do decentralized training uh on like a network that you know barely maybe can push like one megabit one megabyte per second and we're talking about you know seven eight hundred gigabyte per second uh we we're way way more you know orders of magnitude away from this actually happening right and plus like people generally don't have this kind of Hardware uh people have you know let's say people have leftovers from the GPU mining that we're doing for ethereum well that's like you know or orders again of magnitude far away from what usually these chips uh are used right now so can you do decentralized training with the current setup with the current training the answer is nothing closely to what you need to train any of these models like for real right and again we're talking about let's say again dvd3 because we know the parameters 175 billion parameters right you need you know I think like 20 20 30 gpus 32 gigs of RAM uh each to just like store that model in on this thing right and then being able to pass through it so like that's just like coordinating that making that it's just so so not effective and so anybody who is doing this like really right now will not be using anything they like they don't even want to use custom Hardware that doesn't work with either xla or Nvidia right now because if you're betting on custom Hardware or custom setup that's not kind of in the common it's just something that like nobody who's right now rushing to build better models and kind of out-compete each other will be doing because like they're willing to spend more money even if like if it's to to just be in the same kind of setup that is like reproducible and doesn't have risks so I think that's probably the main like when everybody's like hey let's do decentralized training let's do private training similarly right well private training is done either on secure enclaves which don't have any accelerator accelerators NPC possible but like you know you you're adding a huge uh kind of overhead on just like you know Computing Parts aggregating like it's it's gonna be probably you know 10 200 times lower and you still need the same level of compute right you'll still need uh and and like synchronizing between between different clouds for example would be huge so I think at the end where I think was you know if we call decentralized training what does make sense right now is this Marketplace of Hardware itself of the super computers is completely closed like if if I want to change something and I do have a million dollars I need to call up Amazon I need to call up Microsoft and then you could tickle up Google maybe like a few other organizations and negotiate with them a rate right and so I think that where you know what blockchain is really good at is opening up marketplaces and so what we can do is opening up Marketplace as a super computer so you can kind of have a better product discovery on where is the super computer and and having better resource allocation like that you know kind of auctioning offices compute around the world where people are building these clusters but but like you said you know the the kinds of uh gpus we sort of you know gpus and name only the kind of gpus that you use to train these models are not consumer gpus right these are not things that people running a node at home are going to have and you cannot actually buy them so you need to be a large bulk buyer I think you need to like I don't actually know what's the minimum buy but like Nvidia will not sell you like can I buy a couple we can back estimate this based on the fundraise sizes of like a depth and stuff like that like so so I don't think they actually bought their own Hardware though so some of them claim they will so you only know one startup that has access to this like everybody else is like literally you need to be a cloud like a billion dollar Cloud level to buy this I know on the Lambda uh which uh is able to buy them from Nvidia and they've been they've been doing this like I've known them doing this buying gpus for past like almost 10 years that's why they probably have the access I I will say that um having seen a bunch of these fundraising decks between staple diffusion and the depth 90 of their fundraising decks said like 80 of our funding is going to build our own clusters so and they they actually are really trying to convince people right now so I I what I'm saying is like Nvidia is not gonna be like oh yeah like this like billion dollars of money raised we can't sell to that I think they're just gonna probably charge them more and it's pretty clear they're going to charge them a lot more but my guess is the minimum order size is 100 million roughly based on the probably yeah and you and remember that it's like you buy gpus and you need to buy all the other stuff like there's networking stuff for sure yeah yeah I agree I mean I mean the uh the the the like SLI infiniband stuff itself is probably as much as the gpus but yeah and you need an engineer so then can like maintain all that okay so all right so tldr any kind of anything that's going to be an impediment to training either one like you don't have the money or two like the even the the kind of machines you would need to train in a decentralized way are so expensive very few people have access to them so I think blockchains work well when you're coordinating resources that lots and lots of people have and you know the the distribution of these resources are very decentralized this is not the case for like you know a100s from Nvidia very few people have them and so you know you don't need to block you and coordinate them just go call up like the three big cloud guys and they're the ones who have all these it won't it won't stay that way though like there's no doubt that someone will actually try to break the Monopoly here and obviously AMD has tried and it has failed so far but I I think like there's there's going to be there's going to be a day that like some of these other accelerators are good enough and they're cheaper right but it it's hard to imagine that it's not going to be the case that the most cost effective right like the most kind of energy efficient and cost efficient approaches to training are going to be basically gay kept by the people who have the economies of scale but maybe not for these distilled models right if you're bootstrapping off of just like training a smaller model off the open AI API true true yeah so if we're talking about smaller models here it's totally a different story right and I mean you can potentially get like a in you know a server with a few gpus kind of consumer grade and and train it so and people doing that right like researchers yeah so today you have a model on your phone that approximates one of these large language models fairly well and you can do fine-tuning of that model through some Cloud gpus that maybe you know are not quite uh you know sort of state-of-the-art grade is that a case where you think that okay in this kind of situation you can imagine having some kind of GPU Marketplace and maybe you know there's enough there's enough demand there for this kind of consumer level fine-tuning of these kind of miniature models that the economics can work what's your take I think the question is like if if it's enough to have like few gpus right getting them off the cloud is actually pretty easy uh or getting like a buying a server was like you know four gpus plugged in like kind of what's the reasoning right it's not it's not that you need it generally speaking uh to be decentralized and so if it's a roundable resource it'll be a ton of demand and clouds are not able to satisfy the demand that's when it will can start spilling over and like people buying this you know maybe servers can offer it for rent that that means like you know clouds need to really like not satisfy the demand or start censoring someone from using it right like that's that's the only reasons why this kind of would start this movement would start sure I would say I think uh I mean like a few marketplaces and obviously a decentralized compute verify verifiable compute has been like kind of a part of it's been a meme in crypto for a long time um but the other meme right has been um owning your own data and data permissioning and you know data marketplaces and like I feel like that's been the other point of contention or sort of debate with these llms is you know they're ingesting your images and text from from the internet yeah training training these models on them and you know especially for like diffusion models and uh you know image output artists feel maybe deceived or hurt that like their work is then being trained to use to train these models that they don't really see even I mean any benefit from I believe Getty image is actually suing um open air stable diffusion uh for basically training their models on Getty Images um even though they're not necessarily like licensed to do that I'm curious to get your thoughts on like you know sort of this this again this crypto meme of like owning your own data making people pay you or advertisers pay you to actually access your data and train on it is there sort of a new uh life to this this idea you know with sort of the rise of lom's or is it just still just kind of impossible to actually do this in practice obviously being like being uh on the crypto side I want this to work right but practically speaking we still don't have tooling to do that right and so I also think I think it's the stability uh the two Cloud whatever that content was train the models and they were pretty much kind of same quality and so uh generally speaking it's it's like un unless we actually flip the script and actually start creating provenance for all the content we create that is crypto traffic that is potentially also enforced by law that you need to kind of have include provenance as you kind of process this content further like we will not be able to you know just like by the by the current systems will not be able to use uh this data and if data belongs to to users and versus limited I would say lines kind of regulatory enforcement so I think this goes back into like what we need to start doing is that the content that we produce and I mean AI as well but especially uh humans produce needs to be cryptographic as indicated it needs to have provenance it needs to be leveraged and and I think this actually will become even bigger problem uh because this models are kind of effective tools to create insane amount of content right um and so one of the kind of core issues is that all of the kind of societal systems actually run on language right they run a language the you know you file things with language you you know you read news you you look at like what candidate you know their platform is you know or video of that and so like all of the systems are highly kind of susceptible already to manipulation right like you don't need AI to manipulate them people manipulate them all the time AI just gives you this extreme kind of Leverage to to create this and so like you can be reading a book which is literally has all the same characters and all the same kind of overall story and completely different narratives like and you will not even know that right like you can be going to you know this website and and like seeing the same titles the same author the same everything and completely different narrative and so like that's already possible to do now to kind of create this deceptive content so we need authentication path for everything otherwise we're going to actually live in this like everybody will see a its own version of reality that's completely different from what you think you're putting out so you know interestingly um I I remember when when gbt3 first came out and certainly tragedy PT people started really worrying like oh my God how will we ever know that a human being wrote something and then you know with stable diffusion it's like oh how will we ever trust an image ever again and you know and obviously this is gonna when we have good video models as well people are going to say this about videos you know how do I know that's you know Barack Obama making out with Mitt Romney or whatever you know how do I know that's real and um I think a lot of these things are a little bit a little bit of an overreaction right like we've had Photoshop now for like 20 years and things are fine we kind of you know like obviously Photoshop does affect uh people things and you know fake media does end up getting uh going viral sometimes but uh for the most part like human like it's not like Civilization has collapsed because Photoshop exists right we find ways to you know figure out chains of of provenance and authentication of what's real and what's not and I think we're going to adapt like because that's what that's what Society does society adapts to technology period every every time it does that being said I do agree with you that we do need to have better authentication of raw inputs that come into society right so one of the things that um one of the most obvious things is you know how will we know that a an image that comes from a camera is actually a raw image from a camera and has not been uh manipulated right and so if you have some kind of physically unforgeable signature from you know the camera itself that verifies that this image was taken from a camera and maybe there's a small number of Transformations that were applied to this that are not you know manipulative as you know the color was tuned or it was cropped in such and such way like already I think we're starting to see Hardware that can con you know I'm sure they're going to see this with video as well as just cameras and and audio as well you can verify this thing came from the real world and it was physically produced and we and we can have some certainty of that and maybe someday your browser when you right click on something it'll show you like ah yes this thing came from a you know a Nikon D7 blah blah whatever on such date that I think is the path that this stuff has to go in order to co-evolve with the speed at which um you know uh generated content is going to compete with real content and and I think it's it's plausible that blockchain crypto is going to have some role to play in how that information gets authenticated stored tracked Etc or maybe it'd be way simpler than that maybe there's you know you just hit the Nikon API and you know your your browser just knows like the Nikon keys or I don't know something like that um what's your what's your take on this question of like physically verifiable data yeah so I think some cameras already do that like there's a secure Enclave that signs uh photos on some cameras I think like Sony added that and like few others and there's like actually it's you know a metadata on Nikon and everything um I think similarly needs to happen for you know let's say you know we record this video like we should all co-sign on it that indeed this is a video that we produced and we talked about right uh so things like that we kind of need to make this at almost like a a new normal a new habit and I but I totally agree like we will adapt this is not like we have all the tools it's not like an unsolvable problem we just need to do it and I think the kind of the more things that will be breaking the more we'll be fixing the faster we'll be fixing them so I'm kind of introducing new habits around this uh where again like you know our our identities are you know have cryptographic information and so you can like co-sign directly on the YouTube that like hey yeah you know yes I recorded this video or like I have participants video or this quote is mine on on uh inside a newspaper article right and so that kind of creates this like provenances and then browsers show robustly I think the the important part though that some people like oh you know we should enforce fingerprinting in the output of the AI models I think that part is like you know just not gonna happen like people love like people will always go and remove that fingerprint in the code and just do it without and so I think authenticated content as a source yeah is the right way to do it Okay so we've talked about the things at the intersection of crypto and AI that maybe don't work or are not likely to work anytime soon what are you bullet on at the intersection of Krypton AI what do you think is going to work so I can say one thing that been working is data collection so data collection in general right is a how to get a lot of people to contribute data for some income some reward right and this is literally what you know blockchains are really good at coordinating a bunch of people doing some work uh one one may call it proof of work uh and uh so actually on there there's been near crowd a community-built project which been running for past two years uh where one to two thousand people every day has been working and labeling data like virus tasks and creating like a massive data set from that so that part is I think very very straightforward it's like fits the you know it's micropayments and kind of coordinating people kind of a Marketplace of tasks and and people and so that that works really well and I think that kind of continues scale and like used in more different ways because you can introduce that as part of some experience right you can introduce like because as Tom mentioned right data has value and so like as people do something they can receive reward for that data then flowing back into the model but then it does need to be like fully authenticated and kind of Unchained for that to happen so I think that that works I think there's interesting examples of like this model that can run on your device uh so like more on edge Computing that are applied to your data and so that that will be interesting kind of again more in in the conceptual website not like specifically crypto world is uh starting to have like a personalized model that like fine-tuned on your stuff without leaving this and like for that you don't actually need that much compute right you probably don't have you know millions of data points anyway so you just kind of uh run a few uh back props on that I think there's interesting question that like I'm always being excited and that's why we're doing near AI is on coding there's an interesting intersection of like decentralized data right data that belongs to users decentralized Services meaning they're like open accessible they you know they're not going to disappear and coding which you know if we think of this like end user coding where they're not going to probably build like complex stuff but they can mix kind of by describing what they want they can mix existing services and existing data and it's really hard to do that in web 2 because the services are closed you know they're like apis are not always known the source code is closed like all those things here that three we actually have everything open and so saying like hey did you build me a front end that you know combines Ave compound and unit Swap and like creates me a 10x leverage right that's actually like possible now to do because like the smart contracts are public and all the services like you know to full data public and so it can like create that front-end for the user at the moment pretty much kind of in a custom way and like I'm really excited about that that kind of is a vision of what we were trying to do originally and I think that that kind of can attract a lot more attention as well to how people you know interact with Services because now there's like UI problems may disappear or like may be reduced as well so I I really like that and it augments a lot of the way that I view the intersection of crypto and AI which is that um they may not like the way that crypto and AI intersect in my view is probably not going to be that there are going to be large tokens that you can invest in that are going to make a lot of money that are the AI tokens and those are going to pump right obviously there is right now there are a lot of AI tokens that are pumping as you know the the AI trend is is getting more and more exciting but I I think the two are interlinked in more subtle ways um these are one of the examples you mentioned is the fact that okay obviously as cogeneration and AI has become better at writing code and building front ends that's obviously going to be good for crypto because crypto will have better front ends and the you know the programming will be get will become more efficient and cheaper and you know eventually you're going to have I mean already there have been examples of chat GPT sort of quote-unquote auditing code and finding you know Common vulnerabilities so I think all these things are accretive right they sort of make human beings better and making human beings better makes blockchains better because blockchains are made today by human beings I do think I wrote a tweet story about this a little while ago one of my Theses about the intersection of kryptonia is I think a little bit more uh forward-looking which is that you know today I think you mentioned this earlier earlier is that most of these models are almost all of them that we're interacting with like the large language models we sort of make them kind of look and feel like people but it's a bit of a sleight of hand right these are not actually agents they don't have any kind of persistent preferences or desires or anything like that we sort of make them pretend to because that's what human beings like yeah but eventually we are going to have more agentic models that have long-term memory that are going to be you know goal directed and are going to try to be doing things in the world and when we have those kinds of AIS and they're so far away I think to have them realistically Beyond just like video game environments um when we have those kinds of AIS I think you know those AIS are going to want to solve problems that involve shared resources and we know how to solve problems that involve shared resources we use money money is the way that we negotiate access to Shared resources whether it's a you know whether it's a message bus whether it's a you know uh whether it's you know turning into a lane whether it's asking somebody to do something for you that's easier for them than it is for you the way we solve all those problems are huge category of problems is with money and so AIS are going to want to use money uh but they're not going to be able to use Fiat money because you know Chase is not going to open a bank account for an AI they won't even open a bank account for a crypto startup so they're definitely not going to do one for an AI um but the fastest way to get onboard onto money is just by owning a private key if you can manipulate a private key which in pretty much any AI can figure out how to rent a you know if you can rent a cloud GPU and stick the key in an enclave and then give it instructions boom now all of a sudden you can use money just like everybody else and you can coordinate with other AIS you can you know get Nai to work for you you can end up employing somebody else to work for an AI or an AI driven organization and so I think the ways in which these two things are going to intersect I think is not that okay there's like some big maybe there could be some applications certainly that are going to be blockchain uh accelerated right like you know potentially decentralized labeling and uh this you know uh maybe generating training sets but the biggest thing is going to be that AIS are going to want to use money and they're going to use crypto because it's just faster it's easier it's digitally native and that I think is going to be an accelerant maybe in a scary way for how these AIS suddenly start interacting with us in the world and so you can imagine someday instead of biology making this crazy bet it's gonna be like some very poorly calibrated AI That's making bets on Twitter there's a very famous uh crypto investor who I won't say who it is but they the one of the first times I met them I remember they told me their vision of the future in 2016 or 2017. which was um you know the world's richest entity in 50 years will be a broken Tesla because a Tesla that's broken and can't be used to to to be a cab will have to train itself because it'll have all these gpus on board to basically become an investor because it like can't do its normal function as like a Tesla and then it becomes the world's greatest uh investor on that zone trust me I was like what I did not what what who who this was an investor who told you this is their thesis a famous crypto investor that you everyone in this this uh call knows Tesla wait is this is tell me this is Kyle I don't even disclose on the call yeah yeah okay uh but but it it was that that that sort of matches what you just said for the record a little bit uh I don't know if I'd say that matches I wouldn't endorse that but killer thesis that we're all going to get beaten by uh in our investing prowess by a broken Tesla but uh you know I've been I've been proven wrong before but I think the the general idea that blockchain is a place for autonomous agents to pretty much interact with the child and and the world in general is true and and we actually actively building more and more ways for them to do that and I mean there there's already agents interacting right they're just very basic like maybe they don't they use basic machine learning to you know predict prices for Arbitrage and you know do a few other things but like as there's more and more externalities for the blockchains and there's more and more ways uh to do this right I mean imagine a very simple uh system where the model indeed is trying to you know beat the uh the market uh by investing you give it a thousand dollars and you give it access to also like ask people to do stuff again on chain which exists you know there's like a job market on chain and so now it can like decide you know buy buy a crypto coin you know sell a crypto coin or ask a you know human to do something and so it may start like invest and they start to actually suggest people to start its own project that it's going to pump you know by posting stuff on decentralized social media that's that's actually possible now no I what I'll actually have is this broken Tesla starts doing nft scams that is that is absolutely how this broken Tesla is going to end up making all this money yeah it generated generates nfts with mid-journey and then yeah exactly but anyway but like this is this is totally possible now this is like if this is not science fiction this is possible now yeah interesting but the question is like who who put it together to do that right like at the end it still was a will of someone I'm waiting for someone to make broken Tesla Capital which is their entire thesis their entire thesis is we're investing in the future of of the broken Tesla that that eventually becomes the world's greatest investor I feel like next now next Bridge hack I see I'm gonna be like [ __ ] was this a broken Tesla then after this bridge all right I think we're we're at times so we have to wrap Ilia thank you so much for sharing your your font of wisdom with us uh I hope that uh next time we're having this conversation we can just generate you and we don't have to bother you out of your day but um for now we appreciate you showing up in person that's it everybody thanks everyone see ya [Music]
