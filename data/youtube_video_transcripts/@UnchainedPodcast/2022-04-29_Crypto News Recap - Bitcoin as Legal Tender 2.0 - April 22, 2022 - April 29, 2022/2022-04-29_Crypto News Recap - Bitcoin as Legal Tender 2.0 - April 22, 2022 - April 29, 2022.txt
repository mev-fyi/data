as legal tender within its borders according to the afp news agency car president faustine arkans tuadera signed a law legalizing all cryptocurrencies and recognizing bitcoin as legal tender this week finance minister irve nboda was proud of the country's move he explained to bloomberg there's a common narrative that sub-saharan african countries are often one step behind when it comes to adopting new technology this time we can actually say that our country is one step ahead cer is the first country to legalize bitcoin as legal tender in africa and the second in the world joining el salvador notably the cer news came during the same week that former bitmex ceo and noted analyst arthur hayes made the case for the doom loop in his most recent article arguing that bitcoin adoption at the country level would lead to a one million dollar price per coin he wrote flags meaning nations will pursue a savings policy mix that includes storing commodities and purchasing gold slash bitcoin the fact that usd and eur assets are not part of this mix combined with entrenched real goods and energy inflation puts the doom loop into motion the doom loop will usher in one million dollar bitcoin and ten thousand to twenty thousand dollar gold by the end of the decade elon musk is buying twitter here's why that's important for crypto twitter is set to go private after formally accepting a 44

electric car manufacturer and the musk led spacex holds btc on their balance sheets adding twitter to that list does not seem crazy especially considering the app has already integrated lightning payments musk made it clear that eliminating bots will be a priority for twitter under his leadership this will be a major user experience upgrade for crypto twitter as imposterbot accounts frequently
