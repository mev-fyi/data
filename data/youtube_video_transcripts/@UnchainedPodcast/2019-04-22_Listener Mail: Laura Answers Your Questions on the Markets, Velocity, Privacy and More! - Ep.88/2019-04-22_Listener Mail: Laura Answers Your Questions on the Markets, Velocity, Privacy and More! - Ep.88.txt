address free month crypto collateralized olt lending dot-com last week was an Advent full week for me I gave a TEDx talk in San Francisco and I will say not feeling the need to be humble about it I think it went well and I'm really proud of that because I am typically not being asked to speak I get on stage and I ask questions and a lot of people said to me before the talk oh you must be so used to this and no I was not I was super super nervous before I started and I had practice a lot but based on some feedback I'd also made some last-minute changes that meant that even the morning of I was forgetting pieces of my talk because I literally just changed them in the 36 hours before so in the end it all worked out I just practiced the parts that were giving me trouble in the hour before and did finally get it all down so thank you to TEDx San Francisco and I will be sure to you know tweet out a link and maybe even tell you guys about it on the podcast when the video comes out the other thing I did last week was I started the interviews from my book in case you missed the news I got a book deal to write about events in crypto in recent history and so I started on a number of interviews and it's going well and it's really exciting and fun you know for those of you who remember back when my main thing was writing writing always was and always will be my first love and so it was just so fun to be in reporting mode and to be imagining what I might make of the material and then the last eventful thing that happened was I got involved in a Twitter debate between Nouriel Roubini and Vitaly crater and not actually in the debate itself but I saw that Nouriel and for those of you who don't know he is he's an NYU economist and he had been featured in the Senate testimony on cryptocurrency on Thursday along with Peter Van Valkenburg of coin Center who is a previous guest on the show from a couple years ago and actually soon amaz of token daily and I discussed the hearing ever so briefly on unconfirmed last Friday and professor Rubina you came out pretty strongly against crypto for various reasons and what is telling sunnah was that what i think is really fascinating is that when i listen to him much of what he says actually is factual sometimes he does get facts wrong but by and large he appears to understand crypto which is not always the case with other people from the traditional financial services world who talked about crypto however he takes the same facts and then concludes that the technology will never advanced beyond where it is now which i think just is a strange conclusion to make I was telling suna that I feel like the whole story of human history is that we invent technologies and then improve them this is not to say that crypto will work out if it fails which it very well could you know I don't I don't get that a super high percentage but I definitely know it is a distinct possibility obviously then I guess he will have been right however I find it really interesting that he is entirely convinced that that is what will happen I feel like it's way too early to know for certain but anyway so I saw that he tweeted that he would gladly debate Vitaly boo Turin in any public forum and I you know because Unchained as I'm pretty sure the most popular crypto podcast I thought oh you know I have the natural platform for this and I emailed him and we did at both of them about this and Nouriel wrote me what is quite possibly one of the meanest emails where he called me a shill hack and care person for the crypto industry him he tweeted about me as well it was a less hateful tweet if someone asked me oh are you okay I feel totally fine honestly my main reaction upon receiving it was that I just felt stupid I hadn't predicted he would react that way because I realized in hindsight I should have been able to foresee that but I think the last comment I want to make about this is that in some other forums someone sent me his appearance at the Milken Institute last spring I believe it was or maybe early summer and it made waves at that time but I ever never watched I actually never watched the video at that time and I did watch it again or I did watch it this weekend and again like I said earlier much of what he says is true you know he talks about how mining in crypto is pretty centralized he criticizes it for like low throughput which is what a big part of his testimony was about certain things like that so it he appears to have studied up on this and so in that since I actually think a lot of people in crypto can learn things from what he's saying and frankly I think a lot of his criticisms are not that different from the criticism I hear from the actual believers in crypto who are also critics of the space so I have had a couple of skeptics episodes I've called them there was one with Preston Bern and Angela Walsh that was in the spring only two in the shownotes and the other one was with meltem Damaris and Jill Carlson and that was from the summer I will also link to them so I think certainly there are a lot of valid points he makes I did notice on Twitter he also has been tweeting misleading facts and or they're not facts but you know just things that are not true but but by and large a lot of what he says actually is true and and I think there's a lot to learn from it so without further ado I will just say that for this listener mail episode I am doing this basically because I with everything going on the book and the TEDx and everything I really just did not have time this one week to do a traditional episode but I will try to answer as many questions as possible today thank you to all of you who did submit questions and I apologize in advance because I already know I can't get to all of them a few other notes before we start which is that nothing I say in this episode is investment advice legal advice or any other kind of advice as always hopefully you know from my work and from both my podcasts and my articles that you should always do your own research and you know I can have guests on here and they may say misleading things and if I don't happen to catch it in the moment then you know it behooves you did not rely on things that are said Earth's rely solely on things that are said in the Unchained or unconfirmed podcasts yeah other than that I will go to the first question which is from no-name this person says can you disclose your Long's and shorts so for those of you who closely watch me you may know that when I worked at Forbes I owned a bit of Bitcoin and ether and when I quit in Forbes has a policy that if you cover something that you own you just close it I had a feeling when I quit that I would not be able to hold on to the bitcoins and ethers for very long and indeed I wrote a few freelance pieces for the New York Times as a condition of writing them I did agree to sell or give away my the the coins that I did own so now I am a no corner I do hold a very tiny bit of Bitcoin ether and some of the coins on the circle app because I was too that for when I did the the circle interview I can't remember a fight I feel like I tested something else recently where I did buy something but I'm blanking on what that was but anyway so you know the amount that I own is like probably I don't know it's like $200 worth or something that's just for me as a reporter to still you know make sure that I understand what's going on in how to use this technology I love using it it's probably I still get a thrill out of using it okay next question is from Rebecca Jones how early to achieve broad adoption of Bitcoin what level of understanding and education is needed on a global scale this is a theme that's come up a few times in recent episodes particularly in some panel discussions but also actually in some of the interviews I've done I think and frankly I'm actually seeing this also in some of the medium posts and other blog posts and tweets forums and whatever that are going around online I think a lot of people are thinking about usability and I think that really is one of the biggest hurdles right now and I think that will be unlocking that will be a huge step toward a gaining broader adoption and and this goes back to what I was saying about how Nouriel had some really good points because he was I think this was in the Milken thing he was talking about how when you use a bank you can trust that they will keep your money safe for you and that's their job and they're better at it than you would be if you had to keep it you know on your in your house or on your person and I think by and large we're seeing that in this early stage of crypto where so many people have lost their private keys they've thrown them out they've had them fished the private Keys fished from them they've had them stolen via the phone hijacking scams where the hacker will call a telecom and say and pretend to be you and saying oh I want to you know switch my phone from Sprint to t-mobile and so then once all all your phone calls and text messages are going to their phone then they will change passwords and maybe go into your coinbase or your other other crypto accounts and move the crypto out to their wallet and then you know there's no bank of the coin that you can call to reverse that transaction so you are just out of that money so there's been you know so many instances where we've seen that these basic usability issues are one reason that people are losing their coins or they don't understand it or you know you even had and during the ico phase all these people trying to buy into I see owes from a coin base account not understanding that then they wouldn't receive the tokens so I think there's just a lot of like I said basic usability and understanding amongst the general population that needs to happen in order for you know mass adoption to occur the other thing is that for those of you who didn't see if there was a really great post on the USB blog where they talked about how everyone is saying that right now we need to invest in the infrastructure layer and that that is what is going to kind of build out all the infrastructure and then apps will come later however they pointed to numerous examples throughout history where the app came first and then the infrastructure was built to support that app so one of the first examples they gave was the light bulb and they talked about how the light bulb came first before the electric grid and another example they gave was airplanes and about how that came before the this network of airports and air traffic control and all these things so I think that we're already maybe starting to see some of this interplay between apps and infrastructure and it's a really great blog post because they have all these graphs on how it's sort of ping pongs back and forth like you get this one breakout app it causes this certain infrastructure to be built and then that infrastructure enables this kind of next-level app which then Spurs the next level of infrastructure and so on and so forth and so perhaps an early so it was a probably the very first example of this here of course is Bitcoin the currency is the app and and well okay so Bitcoin the currency Bitcoin the network sort of grew at the same time although I guess you could say like you know the growth in the network really happened because people were interested in the app of the digital currency and maybe another kind of app that obviously took a while there are a couple one is maybe icos where there was a lot of demand to try to do these investments and we saw it we've seen we're seeing now that you know my ether wallet and my crypto are kind of trying out new ways of managing or new features for those systems that could help people trying to do those things there's also crypto kitties which came out which was a popular app and for those of you who listen to the crypto kitties episode we talked about a lot of the difficulty that people had buying the crypto kitties and when I asked the CEO how much bigger he thinks crypto kitties could be if it weren't for all the difficulty people had with like you know buying on coinbase and then using their meta masks and dadada he was like oh a hundred times bigger so like he was saying that when they watch people go through the flows like 99% of people just couldn't even get all the way there so the last example of this that I can think of is one that I'm watching right now which is there's this journalism platform called civil which is trying to it's sorry it's a blockchain journalism platform and they're doing an ICO and with interesting as they worked with token foundry which I don't know for those of you who maybe didn't haven't followed what token country is doing but what's interesting to me as they've come up with these guidelines about how to structure token sales and they're really trying to make it seem less like an investment and more like a product which i think is super fascinating and they really you know write these guidelines in a way where they want you to have an understanding of what you're buying however I think you know that really has its intended effect which is to the speculators and so what's interesting is that civil had a minimum that it was targeting which was eight million dollars and they last I heard were not quite at two million so and the sale closes this week so they may not even hit their minimum target which you know I I'm not sure what they'll do at that point if they'll refund everybody's money or what but that just goes to show that you know it really is difficult to participate and you know during the ico craze because everybody wanted to get rich there was a huge amount of motivation for people but even despite that it probably could have been a lot bigger if it weren't for these hurdles so there's a lot more education that needs to happen there needs to be a lot more ease of use I think that's another huge issue and you know in terms of how all that occurs I really think it's just like gonna be a lot of different efforts in a lot of different directions across the industry the next question comes from Russell Lloyd what's one thing in the crypto space you've changed your mind about since you first started covering it and there is a related question from Katya how did your personal perception of the space evolved since the first day you learned about blockchain and/or a Bitcoin every person goes through different stages while diving into this rabbit hole I wonder what your journey looks like and most importantly where you are today compared to yourself see in 2017 and 2016 well the easiest answer to this question is that I started reporting on this in 2015 when the mantra in the space was blockchain not Bitcoin and I actually wrote the first large magazine story magazine feature with a cover line on blockchain being used in financial services it was quite possibly the longest email email the longest article that Forbes magazine has ever run that's what my editors who had been there for 30 years where were saying I mean they didn't definitively prove it but they they thought it might be and the article featured chain the company and talked about how essentially you could use this technology to improve the back ends of a lot of existing financial services and that those companies could then also now offer new products that they were not able to offer before with existing technology and the funny thing is that at that time also so the way I got into this was that I reported the Forbes FinTech 50 list with another reporter she and I divided it into categories and I took digital currencies and so I was vetting all the companies for that category and want to interviewed coinbase they were the kind of one holdout and I was asking them oh well you know how are you going to get adoption of Bitcoin and they were like well you know it's cheaper than using a credit card credit cards like three percent and this is much less so retailers could offer discounts of 1% for using Bitcoin oh it's just like this is so not compensable in which is funny because coinbase is truly the winner today I think we could all safely say so anyway clearly I was wrong about that although - Mike - in my defense this is just when I was learning about this like literally I was learning about it in that moment so I think the other couple thing or well the other main thing may be that I might mention about where I am in my journey or what I've changed my mind about is something that kind of interests me is I find myself going back and forth on icos a lot and what I mean by that is that obviously there has been a lot of talk about the inequalities that we see in our system and you know I mean I have lived in places like New York and the Bay Area which talk about you know I've been confronted with wealth inequality on a daily basis this they're kind of like the prime environments where you will see both ends of the spectrum every day so in some respect ie I kind of like the fact that I SEOs are sort of democratizing however I covered so Finance for many years and I also view i ciose as a way for people to easily scam other people and for unwitting investors to lose a lot of money and so in that regard I really do think that there is a reason for all these regulatory protections and that there is a reason that all of this regulation has been built over the decades yet at the same time I do recognize that it does in a way perpetuate these inequalities especially with something as a blunt as the accredited investor rule which essentially a you know for those we don't know what that is it says that you have to be to invest in certain investments you need to be an accredited investor which means that your income needs to be oh sure I'm just forgetting of its 200,000 250,000 annually or and then also or you can have net a net worth of more than a million dollars and I was just talking about this with very silver after we wrapped the recent episode I did with him and you know he was saying that he's always thought the accredited investor rule wasn't wasn't very well built which I definitely understand and I've heard multiple people talk about it being sort of similar actually to the token foundry situation where it should be sort of knowledge based which makes more sense to me and that could perhaps be a really good solution because that would then you know enable it to be more democratizing without while retaining sort of that protectionist attitude which I too think does serve a purpose so anyway yeah I think and of course there's another reason why I'm less bullish on ICS which is of course that there's been so many scams and just really unsavory things going on with all that so hopefully that will die down as we're starting to see this speculative mania pass a little bit the next question is from blockchain or at crypto creeper with two R's or I guess four R's total on Twitter I love your podcast and listen to all to them all just wondering how's your view of it there changed in the last three months so I don't actually don't know why he he or she is asking about the last three months I don't know if my view on it has changed per se I think I maybe have more of an understanding of its pitfalls or what it cannot do simply because we are of course seeing these new smart contract platforms that are coming out to compete with it and so when those projects talk with me about what they're building very many of them will reference aetherium and say like essentially oh you know we're solving for this problem on aetherium so in that regard maybe I just have a more nuanced picture of kind of the pros and cons however by the same token I would also say that I continue to be amazed by how many projects are building on ethereum for those of you who are regular listeners you've probably noticed I'm doing this sort of like decentralized finance series I had zero X on Dharma dy/dx trying to think of what are the other ones but you know all these projects are building on aetherium the most popular stable coin maker Dow or well actually sorry this but the one with the most hype probably at the moment because the most popular one is tether which has super super shady history or at least will not give it will not consent to a full audit so there's a lot of questions around tether but I see a lot of buzz around many of the projects that are building on aetherium and so in my TEDx talk I talked about the parallel world of Finance that I think is being built and frankly a lot of those projects actually are building on aetherium although I do know that many of them would probably switch there something better came along so in that regard I'm not certain that this will be you know that this first mover advantage will really amount to anything in long run I think there's a long way to go there's a lot of it's I mean it's just such early days in the space so ok next question Jonathan Chou 20:17 bull run gave rise to icos how do you think 2018-2019 bull run will manifest again what I'm saying here is not investment advice I cannot in any way shape or form predict the future however I can't tell you a little bit more about what I was talking about with Barry silver after we finished recording he said something like so I don't remember exactly what he said but he essentially implied that he thought we were gonna see prices go up again in 2019 and I was frankly surprised at well okay so maybe you didn't he must not have phrased it that way he must have phrased it in some other way where I essentially took took his point to be that the whole space would sort of like legitimately grow into its valuation because when he said that I said oh you know I actually feel like a lot of the technological hurdles that need to be built are going to take a bit longer than that these problems are you know ones that will probably take I don't know more than a year really to solve and he said oh yeah yeah yeah what I mean is that I think we're gonna see Wall Street money institutional money come in in a bigger way and then I said oh okay so maybe we're gonna enter in that same kind of situation we were in at the end of 2017 where the valuations got ahead of the technology and some indications that we have about institutional money coming in have come out in the news recently where for those of you who might have seen the information which is a great little boutique publication they focus exclusively on tech and have recently launched a crypto vertical they reported that several university endowments I should have looked this up but I'm pretty sure it was like Yale Harvard and Stanford had all invested in crypto in some way shape or form recently and so you know that's the kind of vetting that that those institutions do that those endowments do I think you know says something about kind of where the spaces out and obviously we have backed coming online in November I'm not sure what effect that will have though because for those of you who listen to my episode tour damn Easter he was saying that that he thought that that would lead to the price is rising I said oh well you know everyone said that about the futures but obviously that isn't what happened so how will this be different he didn't really have a good answer so this if if any Wall Street people listen to my podcast and can explain to me how that could have a different effect on the market than the futures then I would be interested talking to you because I frankly I don't understand Wall Street super well and I really am interested to know will this be another situation where the hype you know did not manifest or really will it really be different and if so why like what is the mechanism by which we will actually see this have a positive effect on crypto prices I I don't know the answer to that and I'm very curious to know so yeah so Barry you know at least things that we will see Wall Street money coming it oh and actually to just add a little bit more there about Wall Street money coming in a couple of reasons for that are probably going to be that we're already starting to see that our custody solutions you know bit Co has its custody solution and and they're what's called a qualified custodian Mike Bell she discussed that on the podcast earlier this year I can also link to that in the show notes and a coin based custody I believe is also qualified custodian there are a few others I'm just blanking honestly the TEDx situation points I know this stuff was happening and I'm sorry that I don't have the details for all of you but but because we know these products are coming online that probably is going to give institutions more comfort with a crypto space and so in that regard we could see more of them oh and the last thing I will say is that I was talking with another source who said the the type of institutional player that they're talking with is different from previous institutional money which might have been like smaller before where was like single family offices and now it's more like multifamily offices or as you know I just mentioned endowments in this case so who knows I don't know what will happen but those are some of the theories floating around next question David Erickson how do you think bitcoin will behave in a serious recession slash financial crisis I mean at some point years or maybe years from now we will see another recession slash crisis I'd imagine haha yes I agree with you on that point so mmm how well bitcoin behave in a serious recession or financial crisis well if this is one of those questions where in the absence of any other factor it's basically impossible to predict because you know is this gonna happen like a year from now or is it gonna happen five years from now is gonna happen 10 years from now you know depending on your time frame it could happen at a time when we're in a similar phase infrastructure wise where there's a lot of basic usability issues around Bitcoin that would prevent it from becoming a safe haven in a financial crisis however even if it were you from now maybe in some limited fashion we might see some people turn to it because obviously there are at least pretty decent consumer facing on-ramps like coinbase frankly you know it's just really the easiest place where you can just go straight with your bank account and buy a little bit of Bitcoin either a few of the other kryptos so who knows I mean if it were more like five or ten years from now then perhaps at that time when the usability issues are more resolved it could become even more popular but then it's a question of well by that point the space will have matured so much that will there be another crypto asset that will be a kind of more of a safe haven than Bitcoin you know I don't I don't know there's just really no way to know I think the only things we can point to are that certainly in places where money doesn't work well we have seen in limited fashion that some of those people's some of the people in those economies do turn to Bitcoin or other crypto assets and so perhaps that time we might see the same thing next question from Chris Belmont what is one surprising thing you recently learned so I literally I could barely think of anything but I was really interested by this study that Shane Ellis is released and fortune did an article on I came out last week that showed that Wales account for four point six percent of all bitcoins and that they busted the myth that the Wales are kind of like negatively affecting the price and they said that they actually largely helped stabilize the market as somebody who doesn't feel like you know I super understand how these financial systems work or how financial markets work that was something that I found interesting so I figured I would just point to that okay we're gonna take a break to discuss the velocity problem and other issues but first I'd like to take a quick break for our fabulous sponsors a startup that completed an IC o---- and looking to leverage aetherium for working capital a minor looking to buy

trial today I'm taking listener questions for today's episode the next question is from Joshua Weiser you seem to be skeptical of some claims by your guests are you willing to be more explicit about which parts of the industry you think will blossom in which you think are complete types or scams are complete hype or scams again I'm not giving investment vice do your own research some of the areas that I think could possibly blossom I will just probably be obvious to anybody who listens to my show but certainly the first is just I think we're gonna see a money come out of crypto we're already starting to see that in a limited way but Bitcoin you know as I mentioned earlier was really kind of the first app and it really was the first thing that helped people understand the potential in this technology so in that regard I would be surprised if out of this technology we did not end up with something that was money like and already there are a lot of contenders for this mantle in addition to Bitcoin there is Bitcoin cash there's like coin there's - there's e cash there's Manero so I think we will certainly see some kind of money that comes out of this you know whether or not that ends up competing in any significant way with a fiat currency I have no idea and because we are likely to see digital fiat currencies at some point I really don't know also how that will affect these crypto currencies how popular they can get you know there's just way too many factors to try to to make any prediction there but I would be surprised if we don't see some form of money in whether it's in a limited fashion or a wider fashion that does take off using this technology another area that I think is probably going to thrive is going to be privacy and when I say that I mean in particular privacy coins and that is for a few reasons so as we've seen with technologies over and over again frankly many of them take off because they criminals find you start looking at them and that I actually you know to go back to my little description of the app and infrastructure I guess you know play between them they interplay between them like one of the apps frankly was probably Silk Road for for Bitcoin so in that regard a lot of those criminals found out the hard way that when you have a transparent money then your crimes will be more easily traced back to you so if you listen to the very first episode I did with Katie Hahn who used to be a federal prosecutor she's now one of the general partners at Andreessen Horowitz and she leaves the a 16 C crypto fund with Chris Dixon who was on the podcast this summer you guys should check out that interview but in her initial interview with me when she was a prosecutor she talked about how she was able to solve a few crimes using the Bitcoin blockchain where they realized that there were two federal agents that were stealing the bitcoins from this lil croud investigation so I think certainly criminals are figuring out that maybe having a privacy coin is a good idea however those aren't the only people that are going to find such a thing useful Z cash is a privacy coin that it's technology is now being incorporated as far as I understand into JP Morgan Chase's blockchain quorum and that's because financial institutions also don't want to be broadcasting their transactions out to the world and for you know for competitive reasons so I think we will probably see privacy coins or privacy technology take off and frankly we actually we're already seeing that the last area that I could probably pretty confidently say will probably blossom is the smart contract area and the reason that I say that is because a theory man's already blossomed has proven to attract a lot of interesting ideas to it that do take off rather quickly for instance the Dow which those of you who aren't familiar with that that was a venture fund that was labeled the DAO it decentralized autonomous organization it was meant to be a decentralized venture fund that would invest in various projects that the token holders would vote upon and it raised a hundred and fifty million dollars at a time when like barely anybody even understood crypto let alone owned ether I mean it was just really incredible that all went bust unfortunately because there was a bug in the code however the whole ICO phenomenon also took place on etherium and in general I find you know as I mentioned before a lot of people are building on etherium and are looking to to build on smart contract platforms and we're seeing a lot of competition in the custom art contract space I think probably because people know that this is going to be a big thing and sure a theorem has the lead at the moment but it's so early that a lot of people want to get in and compete because they know that this is this game is not over in terms of what areas anything are complete hype slash scams I don't know if I couldn't say anything is complete hype or a scam but I will tell you some of the areas that I'm less sanguine about and I would say one thing that I've never fully understood is this concept of existing centralized companies doing coins so like when the kik news kick launched a crypto currency called kin and they were saying that they were trying to do this like messaging ecosystem I didn't I just I don't know there was something about that I just really either didn't get it or just really didn't think it was going to work and I did not look closely at the telegram white paper but that was another one I was so busy at that time I don't remember I didn't so I didn't read the white paper and anything like that but I just remember from what I could glean from it it just felt a little bit like a I want to say a me too but now that has a very different meaning what I mean is just you know they were kind of glomming onto this trend and as far as and as I understand they wrote their white paper extremely quickly so you know it's different from some of the other projects that we saw earlier raising money VI cos like T's O's which had published its white paper in 2014 you know I think telegrams came together in a in a few months similar to that I don't understand the so ripple as I think a great company doing great enterprise blockchain work it's probably one of the most successful in that regard but I don't understand this kind of situation with XRP that they're trying to do where you keep the middlemen like you keep the banks but you also have a coin as far you know I just feel like when I dive into these projects a lot of times the ones that make the most sense to me are the ones where you remove the middleman but the way that you coordinate the global activities to provide services in the same way that you would want you know as if this network work company is to have a coin that incentivizes those behaviors so so I just fundamentally don't understand how you could keep the middlemen but if they're all agreeing to do all these things with each other then I don't feel like you need the coin so and frankly you know they have full-on admitted that their ex rapid solution doesn't need XRP it works without it so so you know I think I guess they would agree with me on that point I'm also not a sync went on enterprise blockchain since I mentioned before there I did write an article about some work being done in that regard so there I think is a joint venture being launched by Maersk and I'm just linking I think it's an IBM and then we saw that news about Walmart tracking the provenance of lettuce on unof blockchain and I do think there are some other applications where of course it's I'm not saying this won't work I'm just saying is it going to be revolutionary I don't really think so I think it's just a way for existing companies to provide their services better which is great for all of us but is it gonna change the way things are done it not really next question is from Phil Gomes most people are surprised when I tell him that the Nakamoto white paper was published ten years ago on Halloween many audiences blanch at hearing this since they feel it must mean they are further behind the times than they thought when they walked into the room so what would you say to this group I imagined they would be potential listeners if they felt they weren't already late to the party what I would say is the sector so new there was a survey in March that said that only 8% of Americans own crypto and as I was mentioning earlier I mean just fundamental questions about usability have not been resolved so there's so much work to be done if you are someone who's interested in this and and kind of feel like you can vision some future where this technology would be used in some way you know if that's the case then I think there was plenty of room where you could jump in and say hey I can help build something here and the other thing I would say is that in the crypto kitty's episode we were joking about the experience of trying to buy a crypto kitty and I was saying that what they weren't describing to me seems like a very pre al experience and so yeah in that regard I think there's just a lot to be done and the other thing I would say to that audience is that it's not just coders that are needed from what I understand talking to the various groups they are looking to hire people with non-technical skills I myself have been approached so many times by various teams wanting me to work for them and I'm like no no no no no however that's only to say that I do know people even like me who have zero a technical knowledge you know can be useful or at least these these teams are looking for people with those kinds of skills and I think in particular because especially with the situation with the ICO is where you become not exactly a public company but I mean yeah essentially you know you you have this dark relationship now with your investors there a lot of kind of community management that needs to go on which is very much more of a soft skills type of job so so yes I do think there is plenty to do if this mace interests you there's a lot to learn there's a lot to be built so there's room for a lot more people and frankly also when I talk to these companies they're all like oh my god we're hiring do you know anyone so you're interested I imagine there's a lot of opportunity for you next question is from Adam Sadowski he actually recorded at this so I will play this tape hi Laura my name is Adam I listen to your podcast on a regular basis and I enjoy it very much so I was listening to one of your podcasts that featured Jimi song and my interest was piqued by the short conversation on Oracle's and the concept of the Oracle problem I know that Jimmy has some firm and outspoken views on how he believes blockchain technology will evolve but I felt that he was unfairly dismissive on this matter in fact I think that the vast majority of interesting and potentially world-changing smart contract use cases requires them to be externally aware and interoperable with existing financial and network infrastructure so my question is this why does the conversation about a solution to the Oracle problem seemed to be so casually swept under the rug I'd like to hear about some of the approaches to tackle the problem and which approaches you feel like are most likely to succeed Thanks so Oracle's I don't know if I quite agree with part of what you said here in your question where you said that sometimes the the question about the Oracle problem seems to be casually swept under the rug frankly a lot of sources will talk to me about how hard it is to do such things and to get even something as simple as like an accurate price for ether I mean so this is you know here we're talking about a crypto a crypto asset itself and they're saying Wow to try to figure out an Oracle for the price of aether is difficult because think about this like what are you gonna do you know every single exchange in the world plus I'm not sure with the look what the equivalent of local bitcoins is for either but I'm sure there is one plus all the OTC does like how do you do that and then if you have this situation like we had on Chi Dax shoot was that in the summer of 2017 I think it was where there was a flash crush in ether because some trader placed a huge huge order a single huge order on one exchange and the price you know crashed down to like 10 cents per youth I don't remember how much it was at the time let's say it was like you know 300 bucks or more I really don't know I mean then then what is that does that really contribute to the violent price of ether if you're using this Oracle like I mean it's it's it's a really naughty issue it's not seller authority issue it's really something that takes a lot of thought and there there's a great little medium post that talks about the Oracle problem and I liked this one quote from it where it's that the Oracle problem is just a statement that at some point you need to trust some outside source to accurately give input as to what the state of reality is and the the post is via as someone named Alexander it's think off and I wrote my college thesis on Nietzsche who will talk about this problem about like how there is no one objective reality so I definitely fully agree that yes sometimes something that seems quite obvious wait like you know a so-called fact is sometimes just really hard to verify that doesn't mean that there aren't solutions out or being proposed out there one is that you could use a centralized solution you know some kind of Oracle that comes that is a specific company that will ensure the veracity of that data you know then of course the question is well then it's a single point of failure what if some wouldn't you know somebody could easily be motivated to commit fraud using on that company or within that company to manipulate the markets in some way to their benefit so then how trustworthy is that you know that's a big question there then we have something like auger which people vote on the truth and so there they actually I think do kind of use a somewhat centralized Oracle process but because then people vote on it that kind of helps to ensure the accuracy and they have a whole mechanism by which you can raise disputes and for those of you who missed it you should definitely check out my episode with Joey Krug of auger where we discussed this but as you can hear from my questions to him I could imagine you know as a journalist obviously been following this whole fake news thing there are some people who are just so vested and their alternate effects I guess you could call them and for that reason they they just will defend that alternative universe to the death and so auger has this situation where like of a certain percentage I'll agree on on that then they can like essentially split off and you know there are so many instances where we've seen in our recent political history where you know you have these people that claim that like Obama was important in the US or something like that or that Hillary was running a prostitution ring in a pizza parlor in New York or in DC and they really really believe that like they really I think they really believe that so who knows when you start putting money to these things like will when we end up in a situation which we've seen happening with the corrupt assets where there are a lot of Forks like I have no idea I'm just trying to point out that yeah this is one way of trying to resolve these issues via the auricle process but is it going to work I don't know in some ways I could see it working in other ways maybe not another what kind of solution that's being put out there is using a process where Oracles have to stake money and their reputation and that they have skin in the game and you know that that might work I know that when I interviewed Danny on of trust token they have some similar mechanism where essentially they they want to be able to put real-world assets on the blockchain including it you know I guess like tokenize real estate or something like that and so I was saying well you're not going to have people checking on all these apartments or you know buildings all over the world that are being put on this blockchain and he was like oh yeah but you know we have these local people and they can build their reputations by verifying this and you know I did point out ok well then at any given moment that means that you will have some percentage of fraud on the network before before it gets caught so you know there's at the moment I don't really see any perfect solution to this Oracle issue I think it is a really really difficult one super super super challenging whoever solves it first probably will become one of the leading smart contract platforms at least until all the others adopt it and then I was applying field again all right my next questions from Katie my questions about the velocity problem in etherium can you explain it and is it true alright so the velocity problem Chris Byrne SK explains this really well on my podcast from I think roughly a year ago gosh time flies I don't remember when he he came on the show to talk specifically about how to value crypto assets but I think we discussed velocity on that show and essentially velocity is how quickly money passes from one holder to the next and the more quickly it passes the more of a sort of depressive influence it has on that price because you don't have people holding on to it and therefore kind of like artificially reducing supply in the sense that at least for the amount of buyers out there there there isn't you know a lot that people are willing to sell so in terms of whether or not this applies to aetherium I think the main thing at least at the moment to mention is that a theorem is at some point going to move to a proof of stake system and in a staking system that means that the validators have to put up a certain amount of ether and lock it up in order to become validators which for those of you who have more of a Bitcoin reference validator is essentially a minor and that effect of or the that mechanism of locking it up will have a should have a positive effect on the price in the sense that that reduces velocity right because it sort of forces this mechanism of holding or Hotaling that that introduces velocity so whether or not applies to a 3min particular I can't say simply because also a theorem has a slightly different monetary policy that isn't necessarily fixed they did recently vote to ratchet down the inflation so the block reward was reduced from five ether to three ether and 2017 and then more recently to two and you know reducing inflation is a similar to the way that the Bitcoin system has been having its block reward every four years right now it's twelve point five bitcoins that are released every ten minutes and at the next having in 2020 it'll be six point two five and so in that regard that's also I think another way of essentially you know keeping the velocity from from being high because there's like I said less new ether being released into the system thereby making making it harder for those people who want to purchase ether but like I said I'm not sure if the velocity problem applies to ether in particular I think it's actually probably worse with other coins a related question comes from Dan tahini hopefully I'm pronouncing that right this one came in actually super last minute so I didn't get to email him to ask him how to pronounce his name but he says assuming ether doesn't become a store of value and token velocity sands it's priced out to the cost of a marginal transaction with a not compromised the security of the network under a proof of state consensus in other words does ether need to become a store value to ensure the security the network under proof of mistake so I'm gonna flan admit I have been talking about proof of steak a little bit but I'm not a huge expert on it however as I just mentioned in responding to Katie's question I don't think velocity will sand its price down to the cost of a marginal transaction as long as we do switch to as long as the theorem does switch to proof of steak basically the main thing is that the price of ether Justin just needs to be high enough that the cost of staking more than 51% of the supply in order to stage a 51% attack needs to be expensive enough that it won't deter people from doing that and that you know is basically how the network will be secured so because stinking is essentially kind of in in some ways easier than proof of work where you need you know hardware there could be a lot of people that are that look to get into the staking business and so in that regard I think we could see quite a large amount of ether stakes you know I really have no crystal ball there but it's just something that I'm guessing and then about your question about whether or not ether needs to become a store of value to ensure the security of the network I don't think it needs to become a store of value in order to keep the price high enough to prevent this 51% attack you know as long as the price is just high enough to deter that attack then I think the network will be secure and as I mentioned because I think staking is going to be a little bit easier to get into then then mining proof-of-work we could maybe see quite a large amount staked but I'm no expert and proof of stake so again take everything that I'm saying in this regard with a grain of salt all right wookie 25 asks me one area that I hope you can talk about his privacy coins including the different technologies how each technology approaches privacy and security so he had two questions or she it's terrible it's terrible so for some reason I always assume these anonymous ones are are men but they could very well be women I should know number one which is the most private coin okay so I'm really only going to talk about the two most popular ones fuzzy cash and Manero as far as I understand I don't think this is really an apples to apples comparison I think there's just trade offs so Manero is more popular on the dark web and it's quote-unquote private by default but Munro isn't exactly private and I haven't as longtime listeners you may know I have not done an interview yet with Ricardo espana our fluffy pony of Monero he's actually one of my favorite people in the space and he's helped me a lot in various ways of the years but I still haven't done an episode with him so I cannot claim to be an expert on Manero but from what I can glean it you know like I said isn't exactly private it just associates information so it will mix in individuals transactions with other peoples so it's not clear who owns which address and then it'll hide like balances and and create one random one time addresses that can't be associated with a particular person publicly so the funds aren't associated with the original address and and yeah it it basically enables this privacy at the protocol level because I think these are mechanisms that people could try you know using a one-time address but I mean oh Monaro is sort of automates this however it's not completely anonymous and there have been vulnerabilities that have been discovered they've been patched since but one of them did leave transactions that occurred before February 17 2010 tafolla so in contrast ecash I guess has stronger privacy technology because it actually does encrypt the data but it's a much more taxing coin from a processing perspective and for that reason a lot or probably a number of reasons users very seldomly choose to make transactions private only 13% of transactions are private and for those of you who listen to my episode with Zuko of of Z Cash I was mentioning to him that I feel like when you choose to make a transaction private it does kind of cast suspicion you and unfortunately because of how few people choose this it turns out that less than one percent of all Z cash transactions involve both a shielded sender and receiver so I was asking Zuko if this means that Z cash can be solved like a pseudo GU which he denied but you know I I think it remains to be seen because essentially all the other transactions are pretty much just like bitcoins where you know you can figure stuff out so one of the other issues with Z cash is that they have this thing called a trusted set up where they undergo this process in the beginning to create the network but it relies on a small number of people and you as the user have to trust that those creators did not create counterfeit coins and they when they go through this process they do a lot of things to try to build at that trust that that's not what they're doing but I know some people take issue would see cash for that reason oh and then the last thing I just wanted to say was you know my comments about how it's pretty when you do choose a shielded transaction which is one of the more private transactions it's pretty processing intensive they are upgrading that technology so perhaps in the future we will see more transactions on Z cash being done in the shielded fashion the second question is what is the status of government's tolerance of privacy coins so this isn't something I've looked into super well but I did some noodling around and found that the Secret Service did as Congress earlier this year for help in tracking and inhibiting enabled cryptocurrencies there's a quote here from the Deputy Assistant Director in the US Secret Service offices services office of Investigations Robert Novi he said we should consider additional legislative or regulatory actions to address potential challenges related to anonymity enhanced cryptocurrencies and you know he mentions that these cryptocurrencies are clearly ripe for illicit use in an effort to subvert legitimate law enforcement inquiries although it is more difficult to trace the movement of illicit proceeds using these newer and anonymity enhanced cryptocurrencies it is not impossible and apparently Japan and a few other countries are putting pressure on exchanges to delist privacy coins one thing I did notice was that in the Senate testimony that Peter Van Valkenburg of coin Center did last week was that he didn't he kind of talked about how a lot of these public machines are audible and have transactions that are traceable he did not mention privacy coins which probably was a conscious decision on coin centers part but you know I think because both the cash and Manero do have this viewing key option which is what enables the user to selectively reveal their transactions to whoever the whomever they choose you know perhaps we will see that there's some way in which even privacy coins will take off in some fashion that is not look down upon by governments all right I'm going to try to do I have I know that I'm running out running over time but I'll try to do a couple more questions Mike magloan has a question how enduring is that 2018 trend and lower prices volatility and shifting focus to stable coins notably tetherin um now number eight on coin market cap seems this trend should be the future of kryptos that may actually be used for peer-to-peer transactions so in general I would say that I don't think any price trends we're gonna see over the next like five to ten years will really endure until the technology becomes fully mature I know for those of you who follow my stuff you'll know that I really liked this book by Carlota Perez technological revolutions in financial capital I think it's called and in it she describes these sort of like boom bust cycles where when a new technology comes in we see this sort of like speculative fervor and then during that time when a lot of money sloshing around the technology kind of gets built and sort of proves itself to a certain point which then Spurs another wave of speculative fervor and investment which then allows the technology to mature further and you know on and on this cycle goes until basically it becomes like really entrenched and the pitfalls of that technology become apparent and then that sort of like opens the door to the next wave of technology to come in and and take advantage of you know whatever the downsides are out that technology so it's it's super interesting but anyway for that reason because the technology is so far from being anywhere near mature at this moment I don't think this quote-unquote 2018 trend that you were that you reference here with lower prices I don't really think it's like a trend unless you just look at it from a longer term perspective and say that it's part of the trend that we've seen so far in cryptocurrency where there's a bull run huge run-up in prices then there's a big crash which lasts for like a year or two years and then there's another big run which then leads to a crash which probably lasts for roughly the same amount of time again so you know the the two main ones that I'm talking about which people will know or may know are in the fall of 2013 I think China started getting into this and that's when we first saw the price of Bitcoin exceed $1,000 and then eventually you know right after that was the mount Cox hack and then the price slowly declined until January of 2015 when it like hit below $200 it was like 170 something I think was below and then it just sort of kind of traded sideways and $200 range for most of 2015 until towards the end of that year and then 2016 you know sort of gradually increased but it was really 2017 obviously where we saw a similar hype cycle to the end of 2013 and there was that massive bubble and then again I think this year we're sort of seeing this kind of like more a sober view of the market right now so anyway so I think that's kind of just going to be part and parcel of the space for the next couple of years in terms of your comments here on stable coins I would say that there's definitely significant momentum building behind staple coins apparently there's no like around 100 stable coin projects that are either alive or in the pipeline stage and some of these that were recently announced like the Gemini US dollar and the paxos if it's stable coin they had approval from the New York Department of Financial Services which is which is pretty big deal and one of the biggest pieces of news around stable coins in the last month was that a 16 Z crypto did invest in maker dows MK r tokens those are not the actual stable coin they're kind of like this other coin within the ecosystem that enables governance and I did an episode with Rouen Christensen of maker Dow on unconfirmed that you guys should check out if you didn't listen to that but certainly maker has a lot of women behind it I've done other episodes with Danny on of trust token who I mentioned they have a stable coin called shoe USD and I think in general you know it's simply because we all live in this world where we're used to using the dollar as a reference point I do think stable coins will be key to helping the get more people into the ecosystem and comfortable with you know trading and putting their money into into crypto so in that regard yeah I do think the stable coin trend what if you want to show out trends is one that we will see more of in the future and I am so sorry you guys but this is like going on way longer than I expected and I'm not getting to the rest of these questions is just there's there were too many and unfortunately it took me a lot longer to get through what I
