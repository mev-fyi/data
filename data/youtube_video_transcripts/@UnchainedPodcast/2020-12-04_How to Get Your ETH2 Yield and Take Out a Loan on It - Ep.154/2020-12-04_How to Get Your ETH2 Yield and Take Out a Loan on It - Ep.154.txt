liquid snake and dharma capital welcome james hi there great to be with you the big news this week was ethereum 2.0 beacon chain launching which happened on tuesday december 1st as exciting as this was it presents a little bit of a conundrum for people who may want to participate how would you describe that challenge and how does liquid stake propose to solve it the i guess the difficulty of the challenge is is that um as somebody stakes the ether they are unable to remove it for the next and we're not an undetermined amount of time but let's say it's 18 to 36 months so you don't have any access to that but you are earning rewards as you're staking and so what we um what we did at dharma capital and liquid stake is basically just come up with a an offering that enables people to stake through what i would just call world-class validating uh service providers and then we provide loans or a swap contract that enables them to then gain liquidity so they can continue to use that asset you know let's say for um you know d5 projects or call it pay you know pay your rent anything uh it just basically means that they're able to have their you know to be able to stake and then be able to have liquidity and so walk me through how it works from the perspective of a customer who comes to liquid stake so um and so we have two two different types of customers the first liquid stake would be an individual and they want to stake they may or may not have chosen a service provider and a service provider is a team that's created the software so that you can actually validate um blocks right and so they would go and go into our website go through an aml kyc process after they're approved then they would um either choose this validating service provider we've we've partnered with bison trails consensus and figment and uh so they would send the ether in we would stake it through that validating service provider and we would hold those keys now i'll explain why we we do that and and we would then go and stake the the ether onto uh go into the deposit contract you know onto the beacon tray and as those you know so then it's dharma or liquid stake basically holding those that ether and being responsible for all the validating of the blocks and then from there they would go to a dashboard that would say here's how much your assets are worth and they would be able to then um gain a loan from that and how much can they take uh 35 and uh and basically over time as the market moves they'll be either be a margin call or as the asset grows in value let's say either from price or from um additional accrual of rewards then they can take out additional monies if they want and so for that instance of when the dollar value of someone's stake drops below the amount that they've borrowed what happens so that's the the difficult part here so as i was leading to that that we hold the keys to to the ether so we we have to be able to do that so that we can actually control this uh staked ether in the deposit contract if the market had dropped and we had sent out different you know margin call requests um you know the the the user wasn't unable to to supply any more collateral it would go through a liquidation and liquidation for this type of contract is a little bit different um and it does sound severe um and it's basically that if the market goes down to that level we have a min uh an immediate uh liquidation event and and the reason for that is that the ether is all locked up there isn't a trading market for this and so once it touches that goes down to that level what we're having to do is we're having to basically journal over those assets to our fund meaning that we're purchasing them and then we're in the open market uh potentially selling uh freely traded ether so it's a little bit different than if you had a freely traded asset that goes down to the liquidation level uh then they're able to work it out a little bit a little bit easier like you would see different prints on an exchange or over the counter so their entire stake is liquidated uh the amount of of whatever their loan is it's basically it's not that they lose their their assets i i just when i say severe i just mean that it happens immediately at that price level but um it's obviously we're only entitled to get paid back the the loan amount um so it would just be that you know the rest obviously would get delivered back to them once we reach uh phase 1.5 or basically ether is able to be removed from the deposit contract okay so dharma capital gets the eth that is liquidated right so we we purchased that we we purchased that um during that liquidation process and is that the main way that liquid stake and dharma capital are making money from this or do you also charge fees in addition yeah that's actually we don't we don't expect to make um much money off of that and and uh i mean on both sides of it it's not we're not looking to have all these great liquidation events i would say our perspective is that as um eth2 gets validated that's going to be very positive for ethereum it's going to continue to grow the ecosystem and i would assume that that would mean you'd have a market appreciation right so so rather than thinking that we're going to have a severe uh you know downturn i think that this would actually as this gets validated more and more it you know it will increase the value uh for us we just charge an interest rate so um you know currently we're charging 13 and a half percent and uh and the difference in in how we're lending uh the money is that typical lenders in the market receive assets they give out a loan and they take those assets then and lend them out to somebody else right and then they earn a rate off of that uh for us obviously because these assets are all locked up into the contract can't be lent out we're we're not doing that other side of it so rehypothecation isn't occurring um and and essentially what that just means is one we don't have that other counterparty risk but also we don't gain the benefits of being able to reward you know charge interest rate off of that and how do you determine the price of eth to both make a loan as well as to liquidate so obviously the the biggest driver is the the cash market of of ether and and what we do is we take a discount to that cash market so we use a a 15 discount to that and and what that is is basically because the ether isn't tradable and whoever does buy that has to hold it until phase 1.5 there's these encumbrances on it right um and and so um currently that's what how we're what we do is we take the spot discount it by 15 and then that's the value of of the ether uh staked ether collateral and how are you determining what the spot price is uh so what we do is we take the midpoint of um four different exchanges so we take uh binance coinbase gemini and kraken and we use that the mid midpoint price um as the value for for what uh ether is trading at and what if there's like a flash crash or something in one of those exchanges um if there is a flash class i mean uh every you know long tail event um it's it's it's part of what we have to to look at i mean if all four of those exchanges all did go down to you know a low level we would have to liquidate um i i would say inherently in our structure because we have that immediate liquidation if it were to go down severely let's you know let's just say uh you know 99 percent um somebody's already been liquidated much earlier than that right they've been liquidated at that 15 point you know uh decline um so it is it is a risk actually that that we take on uh for for doing that but uh but obviously if we saw something where it was like this in a few seconds and basically comes up that's something that we're just gonna we'll have to look at as it uh what goes on in the market so in a moment we're gonna discuss the institutional offering but first a quick word from the sponsors who make the show possible crypto.com the crypto super app that lets you buy earn and spend crypto all in one place earn up to 8.5 per year on your btc download the krypto.com app now to see

yours now in the crypto.com app back to my conversation with james slawsis in addition to retail customers you are also serving institutional clients what types of institutions can stake using liquid stake in dharma capital an institution under the cfc cftc guidelines is consol called an ecp an eligible contract participant and and it basically equates to a similar idea of what accredited investors are and the institutions uh so in in from a jurisdiction standpoint obviously as long as it's not a restricted jurisdiction any institution would be able to to participate dharma goes through the process of reporting to the regulators we use the the cmes swap data repository as as a way that we supply all that data to the to the cftc and i would say that the um so the the differences of why one might use liquid stake versus dharma capital is that we offer to the institutions a swap contract and so swaps have been around for a number of years and they have a good clarity on regulatory and tax uh treatment can you define what a total return swap is a total return swap is essentially just you you have two counter parties one's paying a uh a return and the other one is paying a let's call it a competing return and and the net of those two makes the payment uh payment flows so in the in this scenario you would have that someone is staking their ether let's say paying an interest rate on a loan amount so that's their pay side um from the dharma capital side we're paying out the return of the ether state uh and so what we do is essentially just have that contract those two payments net out each other and we obviously assume that there will be a larger amount of payment out of the rewards that are earned from from staking and you mentioned that there's more tax and regulatory clarity uh for these total return swaps can you describe that sure uh so the the um obviously staking and rewards is a very new topic for treasury irs and so um there's a lot of different groups within the community i would say one the proof of stake association posa has been called leading the charge of being able to help define that and today as you stake it isn't actually clear that if you move from ether one to e32 is that a taxable event right and so you can just imagine people owning ether at a dollar that's a huge impact if that becomes a taxable event additionally when is when are rewards treated as um income or are they treated as income even so is it as you earn them the next taxable year or when you dispose of them um again there's a there isn't there isn't clarity today and and so that was really the genesis uh from the institutional side of of why we came up with the swaps uh it was basically to say we can take that on um and uh for dharma capital we're based in puerto rico uh so we we actually don't have a capital gains tax and so we're able to take on that side of the risk and um and then we provide that you know that format to to the institution and why did you decide on usdc as the stablecoin that your loans will be denominated in and i would say today it is uh usdc we're we're definitely looking at other other ways of providing the the financing for us it's really been a lot from a regular regulatory perspective everything that that drives us is first what's the regulatory clarity and then we start to look at the asset itself so usdc we felt very comfortable i i would just say that it's it hasn't been clear and uh with tether uh so even though it has a larger market cap and and maybe used more it just it was easier for us to do that with our our funding groups and so what other stable coins are you looking at adding potentially uh you know there may be something with uh maker maker dao and and die i would also say given um called the stable act and and uh and things that are going on there i assume we'll see a lot more um banks being involved in the in the stable coin market we actually have an initiative that that is enabling banks to do this that we'll be bringing online and so i think that you'll you'll have those kinds of stable coins being issued uh more from federally chartered institutions versus uh people spinning up a different kind of stable you know just a stable coin you know group yeah and just to be clear for listeners the stable act was just proposed by congresswoman rashida tlaib and um yes it would uh put a lot of different requirements on stablecoin issuers but it's just a bill it's just a proposal at this point uh nothing's been passed aside from liquid stake and other centralized solutions there are also decentralized ways for people to get a loan on their staked eth2 what are the pros and cons of a centralized solution over a decentralized one so and we and we looked at how to solve this uh and obviously we were looking at this well before the genesis block and so it was essentially how do we ensure that we reach that 259 000 ether to launch genesis right and and so we looked at this and saying okay we know that the the time period is going to be a year and a half maybe it's three years uh so it's a shortened in my in my mind it would be a shortened trade um and how to just help facilitate people to get in um and that's where we just said here's a centralized solution it enables people to be able to stake early and we can you know and can go forward that centralized i i would say it was basically it got us to market quickly um the decentralized versus centralized side of things um so dharma uh is a regulated entity and so for us to touch decentralized type of products is is basically non-existent um minus our underlying asset itself and um and so as we you know work with different institutions again it becomes for them to be able to invest in these types of products makes it more difficult so um as you have different decentralized products it's great from i would say the individual community being able to have different choices on how can i get this done as we have different groups that are much larger institutions being involved in the market again having that regulatory clarity uh being able to invest in certain types of assets it just was fairly easy for us to say well great here we have a standard swap contract that you know it's under an isda agreement through open law very um almost very commonplace just the underlying is different i know what does that mean and is the agreement through open law uh sorry um so um i'm i'm a derivative head so i just i skip a lot of those a lot of those type of things um so is the uh is the international swap dealers association agreement and so you can look at this as lots of swap dealers have gotten together and standardized a document that drives this swap agreement so that that is the um you know is a i don't know it's probably you know 40 50 60 pages and and so that agreement basically is a driver for everybody to start from the common ground and then obviously the terms are changed what we've done with open law is that open laws is a group [Music] that has been codifying uh legal agreements so it's basically taking all of those terms and then you can have smart contract functionality i.e a margin call if price hits here and it can be driven right off of the contract um and so uh aaron wright who who had set up has been fantastic we uh we've we've put together a great structure that drives this from a an onboarding process and then an ongoing process with what the what the agreement writes and there are other crypto systems that you are partnering with file coin figment networks and luca can you just briefly describe how you're using those as well so the the what we call we reference as vsps validating service providers um so today we work with bison trails uh consensus is codify and and figment um for that that software that actually stakes the ether all right so they're the ones that are really managing that process of um validating blocks you know and we've already even seen you know not not from from those three but we've already seen slashing events occur because people have been trying to you know to validate on the youth chain and um and basically had had tried to propose two blocks at the same time um we also um we work with filecoin um filecoin basically takes the open law uh agreements right and then puts an encrypted hash on to the uh you know onto their network and in addition to that we we actually have a a swap facility for filecoin and it's it's basically to help encourage uh miners to be able to borrow filecoin because today the the rates are astronomically high and so we basically are trying to help the that network to continue growing and not not be so uh so expensive um another another partner of ours is luca luca ha really has been driving a ton of our regulatory reporting side of things and that's basically again as we start to touch all of these different regulatory issues they've just been key for for helping us in navigating that uh and i would i would have to absolutely say that um probably the one of the biggest partners that we've leaned on a lot is balance our our custodian and i actually think to my knowledge they're the only ones in north america that are able to hold uh the bls keys the the withdrawal keys in the deposit contract for us staking ether is a little bit more complicated you have this um validator key you have the withdrawal key um and that withdrawal cree obviously isn't going to be touched for the next year and a half to to three years or so um so they've um these are they have also been phenomenal in in helping with us liquid stink is not registered with the cftc nor is it a member of nfa the self-regulatory organization for the u.s derivatives industry how are you able to do this from a lending perspective from a regulatory perspective sure so and and that's where so dharma capital um issues swaps right and then so those derivatives are um all they all come from dharma capital liquid stake isn't entering into any swaps they are [Music] basically just loan contracts to individuals so it's a we we make sure to um i guess called bifurcate which you know which is the counterparties and the the loan documentation or the swap documentation and then um we're able what we do is we um provide these usdc loans in jurisdictions where it doesn't have to be a registered entity and how much money has been staked via liquid stake so far so we won't start lending um until the 15th um and so currently it's just been uh dharma putting ether in to to be a part of the the genesis block um but what we've done is we've allocated 50 million dollars to the lending facility so that'll either and that'll be a component both of um swap and and loan contracts all right great well it's been great having you on unconfirmed this has been great thank you don't forget next up is the weekly news recap [Music] thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap first headline ethereum 2.0 beacon chain is live on tuesday at noon utc the ethereum 2.0 beacon chain launched after years of anticipation ushering in the blockchain's next era the beacon chain launch is phase zero of ethereum's multi-step upgrade to a more scalable blockchain there are still many technical hurdles to surpass including sharding and rollup adoption before the chain will be fully operational however as of press time there are almost 1 million each staked almost double the number that were required for the launch if you're wondering about staking's risks and rewards for staking one eth validators are currently earning around 0.14 each per month or 8.50 with the amount expected to decrease as the number of participants rises however any ether staked on the chain will be locked up for months and potentially even years sticking also entails software risks as well as the possibility that you could lose your initial deposit if you fail to keep up with the network despite some suggestions that current d5 rewards may be a better bet exchanges are already intending to support ethereum 2 staking coinbase has

institutional investors are the ones pushing the price up when tracking the bitcoin price against notable events of institutional interest such as microstrategies and squares purchases of bitcoin paypal's integration of bitcoin and well-known traditional investors bill miller and stan druckenmiller expressing confidence in bitcoin a clear trendline emerges another data point showing or supporting the theory that institutional investor interest is driving the price up is that there is a lack of public interest in bitcoin compared to late 2017. the amount of bitcoin related tweets is far below levels at that time and has been relatively flat for the last two years media mentions and searches are also at lower levels than during the previous bull run neil ferguson writing in bloomberg cited the pandemic as a catalyst for increased adoption in bitcoin this year he noted that the explosion of stimulus dollars underscored bitcoin's value due to its scarcity and he said that this was all happening already amidst a shift towards digital payments he went on to say that the incoming biden administration should not seek to develop a quote chinese style digital dollar but instead quote should recognize the benefits of integrating bitcoin into the us financial system which after all was originally designed to be less centralized and more respectful eventually of individual privacy than the systems of less free societies metrics show bitcoin and ethereum activity is heating up online metrics are showing an increase in activity on the bitcoin and ethereum networks the blocks director of research larry cermak posted a comprehensive data summary to twitter showing quote almost everything we track is reaching all-time highs total on-chain volume increased to 51.5 percent to a new yearly high of 204 billion dollars in november with minor revenue growing 48 over the previous month for bitcoin and 22 for ethereum stable coins in particular have more than tripled in 2020 with cermax citing d5 and tether collateralized derivatives as main factors a study by blockchain capital surveyed by blockchain capital also shows increasing awareness and adoption among the general public more than one in three americans interviewed said they're likely to buy bitcoin in the next five years and 41 of americans found it likely that most people will be using bitcoin in the next 10 years next headline us congressional bill would require bank charters for stable coin issuers in the us congress has presented a bill that would require stable coin issuers to

responded to the news on twitter saying quote forcing crypto fintech and blockchain companies into the enormous regulatory burdens of federal reserve and fdic regulation and supervision is inconsistent with the goals of supporting innovation in the fair and inclusive delivery of payments that comes from stablecoins next headline visa partners with circle internet financial to connect to usdc next year visa's card network of 60 million merchants will be connected to stablecoin usdc visa will be the first corporate card to allow businesses to spend a balance of usdc visa does not plan to custody the stablecoin at this time although effective immediately circle will begin working with visa to integrate usdc software with its platforms according to visa head of crypto kui sheffield we continue to think of visa as a network of networks blockchain networks and stable coins like usdc are just additional networks so we think that there's a significant value that visa can provide to our clients enabling them to access them and enabling them to spend at our merchants next headline crypto news roundup more than four billion dollars worth of cryptocurrency including 3.8 billion
