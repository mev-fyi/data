thoughts on the future direction of Unchained and enter the giveaway today's show is the recording from my panel at the Oslo Freedom Forum which I have to say is one of the best conferences I've had the honor of attending since I started covering crypto I'm always incredibly humbled and inspired by the people I meet there this year I learned that 4.1 billion people 53 percent of the world's population live under authoritarian regimes that's 96 countries and 25 of the 30 poorest countries on earth are run by authoritarian regimes the human rights foundation's mission and its interests in using cryptocurrencies to further that mission is what made my panel in which we looked at the relationship between finances and freedom even more meaningful discussing the topic where bitcoin author and educator Jimmy song Alain of Renova head of strategy at Casa and coin Center founder Jerry Brito several attendees told me afterward that they really felt we had a lively debate so based on that feedback I think this one is an especially good listen enjoy the show Kraken is the best exchange in the world for buying and selling digital assets it has the tightest security deep liquidity and a great fee structure with no minimum or hidden fees whether you're looking for a simple Fiat on ramp or leveraged options trading Kraken is the place for you cipher trace makes it easy for exchanges

economy by keeping it safe and secure hi everyone welcome to our panel about finance and freedom my name is Lauren and I'm the host of a couple of crypto podcasts Unchained and unconfirmed and with me here to discuss this topic are Jerry Brito the co-founder coin Center Elaine of Renova the head of strategy at kasam and Jimmy song Bitcoin programmer and educator and as I was prepping for this panel this morning actually was reflecting also watching some of the sessions earlier that actually in my family history I have the story of my family gaining freedom because of money so it kind of got me in the mood to discuss this and I also believe that Elena has some personal stories on this issue so Elena can you tell us a little bit about your experience living in a regime where people didn't have a lot of financial freedom I was born in the communist regime of Czechoslovakia where uh several hundred people were sentenced to death and many thousands people were shot at the borders trying to cross out and everyone had the same nothing right everyone had the same small income and basically that kept many people from just getting out of the country and also the regime will try to put down the the entire decent by disallowing them to do their jobs so we had vast love Havel that you may know that was then in the in later on our president and a lot of other dissidents that were not able to do what what they're educated for and what was their actual profession and so several of these dissidents created a circle and they they published a work that was called parallel police a concept of a parallel world that you have to create if you cannot live under the oppression of the regime and if you cannot fight it openly then you have to go and create your parallel economy parallel you know media parallel exchange of everything even education they would homeschool their kids about the truth one thing that they were missing though was a good money sound secure peer-to-peer money that would not be controlled by a central authority right and now fast forward we have Bitcoin which is a peer-to-peer money not controlled by any central authority and that no inspired me so much that I'm dedicating my past I know nine years to developing the ecosystem and helping people interact privately and be the more sovereign as individuals so one other theme that's kind of interesting is so here we've got this sort of pure digital currency and yet at the same time there is kind of a an overarching trend across the globe where more transactions are happening digitally as well but in a very different way not with cryptocurrency and for those of you that went to the sessions this morning we did see that in China you know obviously putting these weekers into concentration camps but another thing that is becoming more prevalent there is this surveillance state and I don't know how many of you are we're probably actually many of you are aware that a lot of transactions in China now are happening on WeChat which is you know something that the government has visibility into and your financial transactions are actually a very intimate look into what's going on in your personal life if somebody goes missing like one of the first things that investigators will look at is what were their last trip financial transactions which indicate where you know where were they what was in their frame of mind like what did they purchase you know did they buy a train ticket somewhere did they you know where they plan - did they fill their car with gas like whatever it might be so what do we think about kind of this surveillance date actually that's being built and not only in China but actually also being exported other countries well the thing is it's it's not it's not stopping just there where you mentioned it's going a little bit further it's going into managing the crowds and if you're a disobedient citizen well you will not be able to buy a train ticket for example right and so while I think that digital money is important and we'll get going into cashless society it's still very important who can control the money the issuance and the flows as well so and then another layer that we could talk about this privacy but I think that we then have the space right now I mean one thing you have to understand is what we mean when we talk about cash right so in China as you were saying in 2008 you had 93 percent of all transactions were done with cash today it's less than 15 percent and so what is it about cash that makes it worth talking about when we talk about cash we're talking about a system that is person-to-person so if I want to transact with Laura in cash I take out a hundred-dollar bill I give it to her now she has it now I don't and there's nobody else between us right it's permissionless so I don't if I want to send her we pay transaction I need permission from we pay number one to have an account in the first place but number two to trap this transaction go to her so with cash you don't have to ask anybody for permission you can just use the system and last is private right so nobody has to know about this transaction except us two maybe even just one person if I go to a donation box and I drop a hundred-dollar bill only I know about that transaction so cash is permissionless it's censorship resistant person-to-person and it's private and so as we move to a world that is increasingly intermediated where 93% of all transactions in China are electronic we need to retain the form of cash because at some point and it not to this in the future in China and in Norway we're not gonna have any more paper cash everything's gonna be electronic and so we need to retain a form of electronic cash and that's Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies like it yeah I was just gonna raise the point that countries like Norway and Sweden are also becoming largely cashless and so you know I know like even at dinner last night I was talking with some people who are not American and it was brought up that I have access to all these kind of fancy credit cards that offer me points and and that they cannot do you know they were telling me all about the problems were they up there with their banks and stuff which I actually I don't experience frankly so but when we you know so if you're if you're living in like Norway or Sweden and you're living in the society that is becoming more cashless it may not be totally apparent to you kind of what the downsides are and then I would also say and we kind of mentioned this with WeChat but even in our countries I would say like the issues with corporate bad actors which was brought up in the previous panel with Facebook Google like in the u.s. there was news made recently about the fact that there is a page in your Google account where you can click it and Google has a record of all the purchases that you've made recently because if you use Gmail it's getting the receipts and it collects them and it like makes a little list of all the stuff you you've just bought so then on the flip side let's move to cryptocurrency because you know both of these sort of seem digital but obviously they're they're not and you've kind of started to talk about the differences but so let's talk about like how we think that it is that cryptocurrency can help bring about financial freedom oh is that to Jerry or me it doesn't matter anybody can work so I the the big thing I am concerned about the privacy aspect and that's certainly a way in which the state controls you know its citizens but more than that I think the bigger issue here is that there's a wealth confiscation component to it we were in the previous panel they were talking about rule of law property rights and one of the big things that I think a lot of people in the world don't get is that when the state issues money when they are responsible for print uh you know printing and management of the money supply when they are the sole arbiter of you know who you know how much money there is and you know like you know what at what rates they get loaned on and and so on they have an enormous amount of control and as a result of that what happens is that not only do you not have privacy about your transactions but a lot of your wealth can be confiscated away from you now usually it's sold as well we we want to take it away from the drug dealers and the child pornographers and so on and if you are accused of that they'll just sort of take your take your bank account away and just sort of freeze it and put it into litigation and so on but the the flip side of that is that you also have the the authoritarian governments have the ability to seize your bank account if they don't like you right yeah it's sort of like this right to be a jerk basically and the government gets to decide who's a jerk now when you have a good you know somebody that you agree with in charge that's usually fine they will get rid of the people that you don't think should have that money but when you have somebody that's opposed to that's exactly the conditions under which you have a lot of financial oppression and this is the big thing that I think we have to be fighting for in the next stage of digital cashless societies is that if you do have a completely centralized system well it's kind of like a central bankers wet dream like they can monitor every single transaction that ever happens they can tax everything they can they can prevent every kind of transaction because there's always an intermediary somebody that's always able to say okay no you can't do that and that might be good if you agree with the people in charge but as soon as it's not the people that you like what's going to happen is that you might be the one that's on their oppression and the alternative is Bitcoin write something that's decentralized that doesn't have a single point of failure where you are sovereign over your own money where you have property rights over your own money and that's a giant difference and that's why it matters so much for freedom and the thing is like what a lot of people end up wanting is some like some like half-assed thing that's actually impossible which is we want to get rid of the bad people using it but we want complete freedom for ourselves that's not how reality works if you have somebody in the middle they can oppress you they couldn't they can get rid of the bad actors too but at the same time you know like they might be oppressing you if they identify you as a bad actor so you either have a central authority or you don't and I I'm of the opinion that the only way this works is that you get rid of the central authority and you know be that as it may it makes for a more free society sorry another aspect to to you know money issuance money control is that actually if you ask yourself what is money there's many answers right but in fact it's a it's a tool of power it's a way to control the entire economy the way we interact as states with other states but also to to basically control what your citizens can do and so one day we may live in a nice society and everything looks good and the other day that the establishment may change even in countries that seem stable even if you're presidents are telling you that everything's fine and there will be no monetary reform like it happened in 1953 in my country and the the other day people lost over one to thirty two of their of their savings just by central authority being able to print more money or being able to confiscate the money that you have and so that's very limiting to the freedom of people I would also say that what digital cash like Bitcoin allows people to do is to compete with the corporate money systems you were talking about or with government and so you know in China there's very little distinction between the corporations and the government it's you have WeChat and Ali pay and they surveil you know because they're in the middle as you were saying their intermediaries they can see everything that you're buying and that information feeds directly into the social credit system that the Communist Party is developing and that's going to affect your life in the Western we're all in the US you've got corporate surveillance of everything that you do which can be co-opted by the government at a certain point or could be used by these corporations to manipulate you in certain ways and you know we've seen some examples of how the intermediaries can be co-opted by government most recently in New York you have and this is really breathtaking if you think about the Constitution order that we have in United States and forgive me for being u.s. centric but that's warm from you have the governor of a state governor cuomo who basically does not like this particular nonprofit that advocates for gun rights right maybe we don't some of us don't like guns but you but it's a perfectly legal thing to have a nonprofit that does why it's an association of people that speaks on behalf of another constitutional right which is the right to bear arms and he doesn't like them they're his political opponents and so he ordered his financial regulator to tell all banks FinTech companies and insurance companies that do business in New York which means all of them that they have to stop doing business with this particular nonprofit that means a death sentence work because without a bank account without access to payments we thought we'd get donations you're out of business and so you know there's a lot of efficiencies that come with having intermediated payments so you know when you have a credit card company that intermediates your payments they can prevent fraud they can help law enforcement fight real criminals that we don't you know want they can know your your purchase history so they can better extend credit to you those are all great things but we always have to retain a way or if we want to make a donation to a nonprofit that the governor doesn't like if we want to buy a book that maybe is taboo we need to retain a form of cash and so while I agree you know maybe we can live in a world in the future where all money is completely sovereign self sovereign at the moment I would just love to see a system where it's like cash and what do I mean by that 99% of everything I do is intermediated but I have the freedom to have some cash with me and I can choose to use that when I want so this is so interesting because after Jimmy gave his very impassioned to libertarian speech I actually saw this expression on Jerry's face and totally expected that because he lives in DC and he works with regulators all the time and he has this nonprofit that you know is focused on kind of like buttering up the regulator's I thought he was gonna take a slightly different stance and here instead he's joining livered her inside but I know from our pre panel call that there was actually quite a bit of disagreement about certain things and the kind of dream that you guys are talking about of this like peer-to-peer system where you know everybody's transacting directly with each other and there are no intermediaries frankly in the world of crypto is like super far off yes it is well with cryptocurrency but the vast majority of people already are still using these intermediary intermediary platforms like coin base or well frankly actually a lot of people are just speculating so they're actually just using exchanges and not even like you know using it in kind of a utilitarian fashion so within that regime right now there's kind of a lot of frankly storm and wrong maybe is the best way to describe it where there's regulations either that already exist governing these companies or they're coming and there is kind of a lot of debate within the community about how that should go so why don't you guys maybe just talk about sort of some of the different regulatory policies that you think are maybe the most or at least effective and I know KY caml know your customer aunty Monday money laundering laws was a big point of contention before we spoke so why don't you talk a little bit about how that's being implemented and and why you guys differ on that so I don't think we differ now I think that the the point of contention is this is that I I have incredible respect for Jimmy Allen and what they do because what they're doing is that they're building the tools that will allow a future where these regulations are impossible right and where you're gonna be completely free to transact however you want whenever you want without being surveilled that's wonderful I what my contribution is to this world is that I'm trying to keep this legal make sure that they are never regulated as people who are simply building software right and so I have to work within the world of the possible and so when I talk to regulators I mean it's pointless to have a conversation with regulators that says what you're doing will be obsolete in twenty years time what my conversation with them usually is something like they don't listen to this podcast but anyway that's fine that's fine but I think they understand where I'm coming from because what my job is and I think it's one that they appreciate that I do is I say what's your challenge today your challenge today is that you're trying to enforce the law you know you're trying to figure out how to protect consumers protect investors how can you best accomplish your goal while preserving the freedom to innovate and keeping this the ability to build this free and so to do that in and I'll just say this you know we I don't take a position on whether a regulation is you know beneficial right whether it protects investors or protect consumers more than it harms people what I'll simply say is this is that the only regulations that make sense is when you have a entity that presents a potential harm or risk to investors or consumers or other third parties and so if you're not in the business of holding funds for customers you're not putting yourself out as a trusted party you should not be regulated we can then say okay if you are gonna be regulated because you are putting yourself out as somebody who is holding custody of consumer funds we can talk about what that regulation should look like but if you're just building software if you're just writing code that's a free speech Act you should not be regulated at all yeah and you you bring up a really good distinction and I think you you alluded to this Laura like a lot of people that are in the coin they are in it to get exposure to that particular speculative asset class and that's a very different thing than storing your wealth in it and having controlling your own keys and being salt sovereign over your money and that's exactly what bitcoin is meant to be doing you can own your money and no one can force forcefully take it away from you like they can with pretty much every other money the the regulatory component almost always comes in on the fiat side this is a US dollar with the know your customer you know anti money laundering laws and things like that and almost every regime and generally the more authoritarian the regime the more restrictions they have on this right like they they force you to do even more due diligence on your customer or whatever based on however much they want to control things and my view you know I'm very much a libertarian my view is that they shouldn't be doing that but you know if they are then we need to come up with better systems that can basically not have to deal with that kind of regulation so there are decentralized exchanges peer-to-peer you know networks and things like that I mean block stream just released liquid which lets you do atomic swaps of like Bitcoin for gold or some other currency or whatever digital representation of some other commodity is and you can you can do atomic swaps with that which can be very useful and they purposefully made it so that all of the jurisdictions of the nodes that are validating it are in a variety of countries so it makes it much much harder to regulate even if one government says hey you know you're not allowed to do that well there's like 11 other ones that are in other countries that that that let you do that so that's that I think might be more effective but the the point here is that you I don't think regulation is really the answer and that and this was something that was kind of frustrating watching the last panel it was all about we need more laws or we need the right laws or we need to do these things in this way well thats as good as it as far as it goes as long as you have a ruler that's actually or ruling party or ruling faction that you agree with that that are virtuous that want to do the right thing as soon as that party changes then all of that infrastructure you've built to make that can be used against you and it is my contention that what you actually need is a decentralized system so that you you don't you're not subject to that yeah that does allow certain people to you know do things in an evil way or use it in some way that maybe you don't like but that that's part of the bargain right like you you either have regulation and some intermediary or you don't have regulation and you have no intermediary then and that means that some people might use it in some way that you don't like so to me that's that's at the heart of the the financial freedom issue because people want both things they want the bad people to go away and they want complete freedom when it's good people doing it the problem is there's a lot of subjectivity as far as what's good and what's bad and the person in charge might view things differently later on did you know that if money-laundering were an economy its GDP would be the size of Canada's large volumes of tainted crypto assets move through financial networks often below the radar of banks cyber criminals use unregulated crypto exchanges to avoid detection no wonder governments around the world are rolling out tough new anti money laundering laws for crypto currencies complying with those laws isn't easy banks and exchanges need the best crypto currency intelligence

bring up the financial action task force rules which I think are going to be implemented in June and that's something we're basically now all these different crypto exchanges and wallets will need to keep track of the information on the different parties in the transaction which has not really happened before some curious to know how that's affecting you and what you guys thinking about because these rules are coming I mean in already I mean already there's a especially in us there's a number of them so here's the thing prior to Bitcoin I spent 10 years in the traditional finance working for big insurance companies and 2012 we've been implementing the new European anti-money laundering directive what happened is that the entire country spent a year and a half on implementing these in order to protect the consumer right we spent hundreds of millions on implementing the new rules and everything and the end result was that in fact there was no better consumer protection we still have big big you know mafia laundering money and we solved nothing but wasted resources KY caml was supposed to like protect the consumer against like big big evil players and when you look at the news you find out that the big banks even small banks are laundering not millions not hundreds of millions but billions of dollars right right through those banks that have been designed and that the KY CML has been designed for that now if we apply clear icy naml know your customer and animal anti money laundering - crypto I think kyc in crypto is even more dangerous because all of a sudden you have these Bitcoin exchanges with you know 25 million user accounts you have 25 million information on those people's names home addresses and that they actually have some cryptocurrency some Bitcoin I think it's a it's a ticking bomb and so we we should rethink the entire regulation in this in dissent so we should look at ok does it do what we want No if danske bank laundered just one-off is one or two hundred thirty billion dollars it obviously doesn't work the way we intended so can we do something better can we do for example privacy by default and use the open traceable ledger public ledger of Bitcoin to focus on finding those criminals and not doing a blanket surveillance because that's basically what's happening in the banking system today yeah and and this is something that I've noticed over and over is that the state almost always when they want to take away your rights sells you some sort of law as a means of safety right you're gonna be better offers more secure as a result of this law even the most despotic governments will pass laws that are completely invasive and take away your rights by justifying it by saying it's supposed to be safe for you yeah I mean this goes way back right French Revolution what who are the people using the guillotine the Department of Public Safety right like that that's how it's always sold to us and and we have to be very careful about all of these laws that people people are trying to pass because almost always they're subverted for the enrichment of the power of the state and that that leads to oppression that leads to people like being arrested and you know like having the rights taken away and all sorts of evil and this and this is something that I've talked about very often that is the real friction in the economy today is that is is the regulatory burden the state's control of a lot of people's activity and like if you can release that if you can take the power of money and power of regulation away from the state and a lot of these cases you'll have a lot more innovation a lot more economic activity a lot more people doing things that are better for the world instead of relying on you know like people to hand them food right like it's it's it's a better way better thing for the entire world if everyone has their rights rather than sort of like a nanny state that's you know like keeping you from touching your hand on the stove all the time so as far as the the fad of rules in particular that you asked about it's funny because so number one their recommendations to try to harmonize laws around the world and what the particular thing you're talking about what they're doing is that they're recommending that the rest of the world follow what is already the law in the u.s. right whatever is whatever Eddy is the rule in the u.s. which is called a travel rule and what that means is if I have some Bitcoin on my phone my it's my you know I have my own Bitcoin and I want to send it to Laura I can do that and she can have it on her phone and because I'm just doing it myself I'm an individual there's no regulation on me I have no obligation but if you are let's say a a crypto currency exchange where you're holding yourself out as a position of trust where you're holding people's money for you for them so let's say I use an exchange and I have some Bitcoin there and I send to Laura to her account at her at her exchange the different exchange the rule requires my exchange to know that I'm doing that that I'm sending money from one for my financial situation to another financial institution and send along my personal information and her personal information along in that transmission and that is very difficult that impossible to do with Bitcoin and with other crypto currencies because the whole point of Bitcoin is you don't have information travel to transaction and so as far as I know in the u.s. today exchanges even the most upstanding regulated ones simply aren't complying with this rule and you know the the Treasury Department hasn't made a big deal about it they constantly remind the exchanges you have to do this I think exchanges are working on solutions but they're not quite there yet they may not be able to technically comply and so at the end of the day this is a sort of Damocles that hangs over right over exchanges and if it were ever to fall and we were to have real enforcement of this rule where they say you can't do business unless you're following this rule this interesting cuz I think what you'll end up is it's a couple of reactions I think number one if exchanges go away I think you're gonna see consumers move to custody in their own funds and the Treasury and the government will lose visibility into the system so that's really something they want to do they want to press this issue what are they gonna gain they're gonna lose visibility the other thing is if you won't you know if the government's were to enforce this rule and say you're out of business you can't do this once you follow this rule that's going to incentivize these exchanges to challenge the laws under which these rules are promulgated in the US constitutionally why does the government have a power to require the financial institutions surveil their customers on behalf of the government it's not clear to me that that's actually constitutional but there hasn't been a real reason to challenge that at court yet so there's so many topics that I want to dive more into but out of the many we've just discussed I actually want to touch on one first before we move more onto the technology because this point about how the regulations might actually spur more innovation and the peer-to-peer sector is one that I'm seeing a lot in the cryptocurrency community today like victaulic booter and just read a blog post about this I saw another reporter former Wall Street Journal reporter Michael J Casey also wrote about that but we're gonna get to that in a second because the one thing is all the questions and and like discussion so far has kind of focused around this idea like that the state is a bad actor and it's going to oppress you but we have seen some instances where there were some authoritarian regimes that were using cryptocurrency to try to further oppress their people one was kind of a failed example which was Venezuela they created this cryptocurrency or I don't I don't even know what you call it yeah it probably doesn't quite fit that definition because I don't think it works but they attempted to do this it was called the petrol and then North Korea pretty is known for actually doing a number of different attacks in order to obtain cryptocurrency probably the most famous of those is the wanna cry ransomware attacks that kind of swept the world last year and you know of course North Korea is the kind of place where because of the super super tight control they have over their country basically the people there they're not connected to the Internet like how are they ever going to get access to Bitcoin like the fact that the government is the one that's enriching themselves and you know because either trying to evade sanctions essentially in that I think that's a big problem so what do you guys think about and how should we deal with that in these systems first of all stealing is bad I think we can all agree about that so even if you're a sovereign of North Korea you should not hack and steal but other than that you know I of course and issuing your own new cryptocurrency as I said before the truly good money is the one that is not controlled by a central one issuer so yeah Facebook can do the Facebook coin and and you know authoritarian regimes can try to issue their own cryptocurrencies but those that are collecting actually Bitcoin I think they're doing doing a smart thing because when I first realized that there's something like Bitcoin and I was thinking I was writing a thesis on international monetary system in the current imbalances and trying to find a better form of money and then I was thinking ahead and I realized well if this is the only money that is limited in amounts that is scarce by design by definition then it definitely will gain on value and will be eventually considered a good store of value so it is just natural that we will see state actors hoarding Bitcoin into the reserve into their currency reserves right I mean I'm not saying that North Korea isn't smart for trying to get Bitcoin what I'm saying is that they're using that wealth to imprison 25 million people in their country I mean it's like yeah I mean I'm I don't have the numbers in dollars how much dollars have been you know used to for criminal activity so it's it's not about the tool it's about the people right so we cannot blame someone for killing people with the boot because everyone's wearing boots right so North Koreans when they were doing the one I cry ransomware they also used email in the perpetration of that crime and but we don't say that it's email that's a problem here that maybe we should limit the use of email and permission so that only you know you know right now is an open system you don't need permission anybody can use it so bad guys use it we could say well no we should have a system where you can only get email from regulated email providers and we're gonna make sure we have no your customer on email providers and you can only you know have a fad of recommendation that there's a travel rule right so we don't do that about email the reason we were talking about it in regards to Bitcoin is because the coins a new thing it's a new innovation and what's interesting though it's kind of like what Jenny was saying this is the deal any new innovation like this bad comes with good right and in listening to the presenters this morning it occurred to me that there's a real tension here when when when it comes to Bitcoin because with Bitcoin cryptocurrencies allow folks who are fighting authoritarian regime to do is to be able to transact autonomously and privately where they otherwise would not but that also means that authoritarians can use that technology in a way that would evade sanctions what a lot of folks this morning works were we're talking about were was making sure that authoritarians were subjected Magnitsky act sanctions and that's going to become harder to enforce the same way that's gonna be harder for those authoritarians to enforce controls on our population what was that what act Magnitsky oh ok which is so it's you know you identify authoritarians for a list of different reasons and governments Kansas's can say we're gonna sanction it basically it's a sanctions long yeah this brings up a really interesting yeah but wait before you do that I just want to push back a little bit because I think the comparison with email and Bitcoin isn't exactly the same because sanctions don't say like you cannot communicate with you know do you not I'm saying it's like sings recruit literally it could hit money and fit quite as money right but but what I'm saying is I think the reason why bitcoin is V and why I think the comparison isn't really commensurate is because email isn't what's prohibitive right over communication isn't what's prohibited but Bitcoin money is what's prohibited yeah my point I think his point still stands he's talking about whether or not you have an intermediary in there and the reason why sanctions work right now is because there's a dollar hegemony around the world right if you do any international transaction almost you're either going to use the dollar the Euro or the yen right that it's always settled in those three currencies and and the dollar has its privileged position why because a post-world War two you know Bretton Woods state they decided to make sure that all all international transactions went through the Fed which is in New York mostly and this is why the US has so much more wealth than everybody else in large part because they're rent-seeking off of the entire world right everyone has to keep their reserves in in US dollars because otherwise they're not going to be able to get oil because that's now then denominated in dollars so they're there's because of that sanctions are very effective because now you can say well any any international transaction involving this particular country or this particular country will just cut off entirely now it might be like humanitarian aid that's trying to get in there in which case you know like they you still can't or it might be you know like you know ransomware or something like that in which case that also can't get in but it's always the same thing if you have an intermediary well it key it's it's kind of like you know chemotherapy right it'll kill off some of the good along with some of the bad and and you know whether or not that's worth it it depends on who's actually administering it and what their intentions are if it's a doctor trying to help you then yeah it's probably good for you but if it's somebody that's you know trying to kill you then it's probably not good for you right so my the position that Bitcoin holds in this sort of economy and the reason why you know North Korea is trying to go and grab more Bitcoin is because they don't want an intermediary of the United States and they're able to use it now that that's one of the side effects and yeah I agree it's tragic because of course they are oppressing a lot of people but it's an evil actor not an evil system there are lots of other good things that are happening as a result of Bitcoin and you know there there's a lot of people around here that can tell you about how Bitcoin is changing things in Venezuela and Iran and all these other oppressed places where you're able to get transfer value and that opens up all sorts of possibilities of freedom and you know people being able to have property rights over things in a regime that doesn't really allow them to do that but that's that's the point right like it's it allows for good it allows for evil but it's a tool and this tool in particular makes it very hard for authoritarian regimes to sort of abuse it to oppress their people now they if if they're the sort of consumer and you know we do have the dollar hegemony over the entire world well now now they're subverting it but for their evil purposes but you know I mean let's not let's not forget why Bitcoin like what put Bitcoin on the map was in 2010 WikiLeaks got their PayPal account completely cut off right and Julian Assange said you know what let's use this new new currency called Bitcoin to take donations because we don't have a bank account anywhere we can't do anything with it this was the US government's way of cutting off all access to somebody that was protesting right this is the kind of oppression that is possible when you have an intermediary that's always there this is why it's so important that we have a decentralized form of money without any intermediaries yeah I would I would still say though I mean I think like it's a little bit ironic here we are at the human rights foundation and you know North Korea is like one of the kind of problems that's discussed here and we're sort of on one side saying well you know we don't think like regulation is great but then at the other hand we were when it comes to bad actors using Bitcoin we're a little bit like well the technology's neutral you know I feel like there needs to be some kind of other solution but in the interest of time let's move on actually because I think this point about how the regulation is actually kind of pushing people to use the technology and more peer-to-peer fashion is super fascinating and I don't know how much kind of background the audience has about the different kinds of possibilities that you know can arise the further this technology is developed so I know you know Elena with Casa you guys are like their whole motto or their mission is like self sovereignty over your finances so what are some of the ways that technology could be developed that you think are promising and actually I know also I want to get in privacy so let's be sure to touch on that I've got two minutes to do ok great ok well let's get to it since it's a peer-to-peer tool it allows you to be your you know sovereign individual and what that means is you take ownership it comes with certain responsibilities but also with amazing opportunity so what you can basically do is stay away from the traditional financial system and build up your parallel economy your parallel world you know you can have people from countries or women in Afghanistan for example learning to code and taking Bitcoin as a payment by the way earning Bitcoin is the best way for for you to get there and the best way to help locals in your countries to start getting afloat or to start getting better financially so they can then do their endeavors in life so earning Bitcoin I would say is the next big thing that we should focus on and if you want to help to spread Bitcoin in your countries I would probably look into that how to allow people to get a Bitcoin pay and what have you said something about how you can have privacy built in but yet also I think was it that you said you can have a window or what regulars can I have a window in Orono was you you said somehow the you could have privacy by default but then people could also see something on the ledger what what did you mean by that so so privacy by default by that I meant do not touch the usual regulated institutions that do kyc AML that's that's the point of the choking point basically right for so not using a product sale coin when I hear privacy by default I think of the internet we have today which is not privacy by default by default it's completely open and public and everything that you do want it is visible to people on a network and so we're keep trying to build these privacy layers on top and that's very difficult if you build a system as completely private by default you can then selectively reveal things about you as you want or as you are required to by governments by regulators so in theory you can have a Bitcoin wallet on your phone it does it doesn't ever ask for your name for your address where you come from in practice though you use the phone from Google right or a Google Play Store or something and and that's then your privacy is gone right but it's still very important that we try to achieve parallel new system new mesh type networks for example where we use encryption by default where we use self-governed identity where we keep our data our private data encrypted on our home devices and then we can use those identities you know in platforms that we want to log in without revealing names passwords without revealing anything of your privacy so this is I think where we should go in the future yeah and this points out something that's been happening for a while now is that there's a there's a giant centralization of information on the internet and you know we've talked about Facebook I think at least a little bit and Google and all of these other giant companies that have this enormous treasure trove of you know data about you and what you do and your financial transactions and all that stuff to me that is a an extension of the state in many ways because a lot of these companies made got so big in large part due to governmental loans by the Fed right like they they get like very cheap interest front loans they get they get funded essentially by by their bigness and being able to control the flow of money the Fed gives them what like giant well through commercial banks gives them giant loans that they can use to expand in such a way as to get scale and then they use regulation as a way to defend er defend their business against smaller competitors and so on but they these these are really extensions of the state at this point right like when you think about Facebook and Google and all these others and I I think that's a large part of why China is trying to wall them off because kind of like a an extension of the US government and their their suspicion is that really they're they're going to spy on their own stuff as a result of doing that and you can kind of see the rationale even if you don't think you don't agree with their authoritarian nature why why they're doing it it's really a state versus state thing more so than it is oh where we're going to oppress our people and salary so is we'll see yeah this goes but anyway thank you guys so much this has been great thanks everyone [Music]
