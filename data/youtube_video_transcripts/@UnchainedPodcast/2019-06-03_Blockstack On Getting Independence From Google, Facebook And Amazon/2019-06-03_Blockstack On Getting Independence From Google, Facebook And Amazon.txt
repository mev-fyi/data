many can you tell me the story of how you and Ryan started working together yeah Ryan and I we basically met at the computer science department at Princeton University I was doing my PhD there and Ryan was running the Entrepreneurship Club and it was kind of funny how I would turn out to be the only grad student sitting in the meetings of the Entrepreneurship Club and that's how we started getting to know each other I personally knew that I'm not gonna run for a faculty position because I wanted to go into startups and so the team came first and Ryan and I we really wanted to work with each other so we started exploring a couple of ideas that we were really passionate about and so Ryan how did you guys come up with the idea for the company that eventually became black stack yeah I mean we as many of sudden you know we started with the team and we just started working together and we said we're gonna start exploring different topics and settle on a project that we're really both excited about that were passionate about a certain space and where we think there's a real viable business there and we tried out a few different things and then at one point we just were so frustrated with the state of the Internet in the way that we as developers were so dependent on other businesses for the things that we really wanted to do and also we thought of this from a perspective of us as consumers and how we were so restricted with a lot of the the platforms that were dependent on like Facebook and Google and Amazon and we actually at that point we said to ourselves that there had to be a better way and there had to be a way that would allow consumers and developers to have a direct relationship with one another in a way where users could own their data and where anyone could just innovate permissionless lee so at that point we decided to go out and build a decentralized application platform a decentralized internet and from there we boiled down the idea to one simple initial initial thing to build out and that was that there was a decentralized identity system and then from there we launched the first version of one name and then started building a block stack into what it is today well so let's unpack a lot of what you said there so a lot of times when I interview people in the space they say that they learned about Bitcoin and blockchain and they came up with what their idea was after that but it sort of sounds like you guys had a thesis about what was wrong with the internet before and I know you guys have explained to me in depth kind of all the ways that you think that fundamentally the Internet is broken can you break down for readers what you think is wrong with the current Internet and what problem it is that you're trying to solve yeah absolutely so I think if you look at Internet the first thing is that all the users they actually don't own any of that of their data right so you let's say you want to use a website like Facebook you would make an account on it and you would end up all the data that you're generating it's basically kept with Facebook and Facebook and use it however they want same with Google and a lot of other companies right so in a way like all of the social graph that you have generated on a company like Facebook as well you can't really use it outside of that one company and obviously there are certain ways where Facebook would try to make it easy but again it's a single company that is sitting on on on this data silo so I understand that that is in theory something that's problematic but when we look at the way that people so easily sign their rights away to their privacy and their data even after something like the Edward Snowden revelations people they you know that made a lot of headlines at the time but people sort of shrugged it off afterwards and they continue to just click accept on every single privacy agreement or Terms and Conditions that comes their way so do you do you think that this really is something that people care about and want to do differently yeah I mean I think it's really something that people care about it's just you know there are certain realities that we have to live with there's a lot of cases where consumers didn't really have an actionable path in front of them where they could say okay well now I'm going to make a change to my life in order to take back my data we're very much of the belief that we have to give consumers a real viable choice we need to be able to give them a situation where they can be in control of their data and at the same time do the things that they still want to do right so that comes to switching from Facebook to something where you don't a shoddy social network with a bad product where you don't have all your friends well yeah no one's gonna do that so it's important to think about this from the perspective of how do we actually build the best products out there that can compete with products like Facebook and at the same time give users control of their data and privacy and security and the way to do that is to make sure that users have that same experience and and we've this opportunity here where we can actually help bootstrap these early networks and allow users to have early utility otherwise it's not going to happen so I think it very much comes down to the realities of the choice and it's not like I don't see it like I said in theory that there's some kind of value proposition there but I just wonder it when you in particular if you if we're gonna use the example of Facebook where they have so much momentum a have so many users how would you get people to switch to another version of Facebook good to centralise one where they have control the date of their data is it literally just saying hey it's the same thing but you can control your data do you think that that's enough to get people to switch yeah so where I was going with the Facebook analogy was that Facebook that company ended up building certain core infrastructure components that should actually exist in a decentralized way in the Internet itself right so what are something because like so one of the example is this having a universal username for example like you don't have a universal username on the internet the one you can use to basically just log into any app and no single company should be in a monopoly position to have a username system like that and same with your social graph like if you think about how Larry and Sergey were able to write you know web crawlers and basically study how the web graph works and they were able to innovate on top of that developers like Ryan and me today cannot do that on top of the social graph that Facebook has right so the social graph in a way needs to be decentralized and and and that would actually lead to a lot more innovation on top of the system and that was a core idea behind blog stack initially and as you mentioned that we started work on this before block chains so we had a solution to implement a decentralized social graph without using block chains but block chains actually make it a lot easier and that's why we ended up using blocks for this so let's actually go back to that story because um as you sort of hinted that you started with something called one name and now you guys have switched to block stack so tell me what it was that you started with and how you evolved into block stack and how they're different yeah I mean so as we've said really the this is really born out of the ashes of our desire to give users and control their control of their data their social graph every piece of data they produce and we saw this opportunity to build an identity system as the first layer of this application platform right and we launched that initial product in March of 2014 it was this is actually one of the potentially the first like real consumer facing application that was like not just Bitcoin payments where you could own something on top of the blockchain like own your identity on the blockchain so at the time when we came out with it it was like a really it was pretty groundbreaking we saw we got a lot of attention and interest front like on Reddit and from several publications and and when people came said they signed up that was the first time that they could have a profile an identity that they owned with just their private key just like they owned their Bitcoin with just the private key so we built that out and we got thousands of users tons of excitement people were saying oh this is what blocks blockchain apps are about this is the promise these are the things that we've been talking about and blocks that showed us the way right and and then we you know we built that out we kept working on it and we started building out the other layers of this blockchain application stack so we started building out a storage layer we started we were building on top of namecoin at the time and we there were certain problems that we ran into so we were also building out a more bust domain name system and discovery layer so that you could discover people and applications and over time we kept building building these things out and that led up to us with releasing our fully integrated developer platform for the identity near the storage and and the payments and everything and we released this in a comprehensive package with the block stack browser so that was really the path that that we took to get here and so when you talk about how you first released one name and how everybody was so excited about using identity as like a blockchain based identity and how they felt that that was a perfect use case for blonde chain technology why is it that it hasn't really taken off yet you have 70,000 use or 70,000 names registered on there which you know given that it launched three years ago is obviously not a lot um what what is kind of like keeping it from being widely adopted yeah I would say um I would say we have you know we've gotten some pretty interesting interest and and sign ups from just the core initial identity products that we came out with with one name but since then we've shifted over to our full platform right we're still in the pre consumer release phase with this new product we're currently just releasing it to developers really it's in a it's in a like quiet slow release but we really expect that as we bring this out to the wider public that we're gonna have quite a bit of uptake in the signups both on the user side in the developer side I mean we were already seen like so many developers building a type of block stack to date quietly just joining a lot you know we came out with the twenty five million dollar signature fund recently we got over a hundred applications from developers for building apps on our for him so we've definitely seen tons and tons of growth on that front and the the user the next phase for us with block stack and the block stack browser is to obviously do our token and then also to come out with the consumer release of the block stack browser how many developers do you have working on block stack right now yes our our open source community is around like five six thousand developers right now and one thing that I think is important to understand is a block stack is the open source technology and the platform and that was there since the beginning one name is just an app right it's it's it's like a GoDaddy registrar that we build up just to make it easy for people to register their domains or user names on the platform right and and since then the browser that Ryan mentioned that's the direction that we're heading in where you download the browser and you register your user name or domain yourself on the platform so one name app is a very small component of the entire ecosystem and and block stack has always been the the main open source technology so Ryan's started to go into all the different things you guys are doing with the storage and obviously you've got the names and you talked a little bit about kind of the DNS system so why don't we just dive into like what is block stack I think a lot of people have already kind of this idea like oh Bitcoin is you know peer-to-peer payments and or digital cash and aetherium is this worldwide virtual machine so how would you explain block stack to to illy person yeah so you can take a block stack as a new decentralized internet and the focus is really on the app developer development platform so developers can actually build decentralized apps and publish it on this new decentralized Internet and users can actually very easily start using these decent-sized apps yeah and I would say that we've really been focused on the types of tools that developers will need and that all applications could use right so we're really trying to build all of the middleware between users and applications and make it really really easy for developers to build anything from a social network to marketplace to something for healthcare data to a voting system etc etc right so we've been really I think pragmatic and our approach there and we've seen it really pay dividends with the applications that are getting built on block stack so you guys keep using this word decentralized but I also know that your system sort of works on this like two-tier layer where there's both like a decentralized layer but then also there's an aspect where users or or through that decentralized layer they can also access centralized services can you describe for me how that works and why you built it that way I think with that you're referring to our storage system Gaia and it has the ability for users to kind of like plug in any cloud storage provider that they already use into the system so we can repurpose existing cloud providers and put encrypted data there and that users kind of like bring their own storage but I would actually push back a little on on the decentralization aspects of this system because I would argue that it's actually more decentralized than any individual decentralized storage system that you can think of because we can plug that storage system into this broader almost like a like a file system so if you want to for example put your data on BitTorrent you can with with this approach as well or if you just want to put it on a combination of Dropbox and Google Drive you have that option as well so it gives you like high performance and more options for where your data is actually being stored and why is that it sounds like you're saying that it's higher performance then maybe something that's totally too centralized like file coin or or SIA or something like that is that kind of what you're implying there and if so why so once you start getting into like decent five-story systems a lot of the folks who are working on on these problems these days are quite young and they if they haven't been like if there has been a long history of people attempting to solve these problems like 10 years ago or 15 years ago 20 years ago and there are some common hard problems that are you can say that any project that would that would succeed in this space would have to overcome and those problems basically show their head or once you would reach a certain scale so it's almost like you don't notice them when you're small and you only notice them when your system actually starts getting real the users in real performance so our approach here has been that we have been engaging the research community of like the first wave of peer-to-peer systems people who are working in this area and the 90s like late 90s early 2000 and we've been trying to learn from all of their lessons and building our system in a way that it can actually scale out and give you the kind of performance that people are used to when they use centralized services on the existing Internet and so then let's describe for the listeners exactly how it is decentralized then because I think it's confusing to say to them hey you can still use Google Drive or Dropbox or whatever cuz they're gonna think oh well then how is that decentralized so describe how that works it's it's decentralized in a few different ways right so one is you have complete optionality that means that you can bring any storage drive that you want you can use Dropbox and Google Drive at the same time if you'd like or you can use the self hosted drive or as we've said you could use BitTorrent you can use ipfs you can use sia storage you can use any of these things you can use s3 you can choose which ones you want you can easily migrate from one to another and you can use multiple at the same time that's a very very important characteristic that means it's completely under your control and all of these storage providers are completely commoditized right second thing is that the data is signed and encrypted right so what that means is that anyone who has this data any of these providers they can't see the data and they cannot manipulate the data right and because you have backups that means that also deleting the data doesn't really do anything right because that can always be restored from your local backup or from any of the other drives so really at the end of the day what's important is that the user has the tools to take control of their data and it is completely under their control so it's essentially like bring your own storage and when you have that case that's really as decentralized as you could possibly be right because you can even as a user decide to put it into some other thing like like a that's what's on and the important thing with in terms of discovery is that we're building off of a decentralized domain name system so really if you think about it the most important characteristic of any decentralized system is the entry point so if the initial discovery point is centralized then that's a really bad system it's not really decentralized now if you have a initial discovery point that is completely decentralized you can run that decentralized discovery layer over individual centralized components and you will get all of the benefits of decentralization so it's a very important thing what does that mean exactly that means inside there's a private key system for your identity which then unlocks the different centralized services is that how that works I think like one way to think about this is imagine that you're buying hard drives so you can just go buy a hard drive and put your data on it in your own right this is the system that we are encouraging that users are paying for storage and they can choose any place where they want to keep their data but it's their data and it's their hard drive where they're keeping the data it could be a linux server that they're running in their house whatever they want the most of the other models are basically trying to rely on their friends or random people on the internet that hey can you store like bits and pieces of my data on your computer which historically has really bad performance and really bad reliability because you can't trust that data to stay on someone else's computer without without a proper reason yeah I mean know what no one would say that like hard drive storage is is not you know user owned enough or decentralized enough because that says that's as these around as you can get because there might be only four large manufacturers or hard drives in the world but once you purchase a hard drive and it's yours and you're putting encrypted data on it like that's and and all the users are doing that then that's a very decentralized system yeah I mean important thing to think about when you store your data it's like it's either stored with you or it's stored on other people's computers right and if it's stored on other people's computers and what's most important is that you have that data encrypted inside and that you have the ability to control how it can be synced and written and updated and all its other stuff so that really is the important characteristic that we should think about within each of these storage systems not whether we're using peer-to-peer networks or not so basically even if I store my data on Google Drive or on Dropbox I if I'm using block stack then you somehow it gets encrypted on those servers so even if Google Drive or Dropbox is somehow compromised my own data won't won't be is that how that works yes it's correct yeah okay and another thing is you get an added benefit that there's also you in a lot of these cases if you have data that's like let's say data that's encrypted and stored on a bittorrent for example that's still out in the public right even though it's encrypted so there are concerns with using some of these peer-to-peer networks because it's gonna get replicated many many different times it's not gonna be able to be decrypted for now at least but maybe in the future there's some cryptographic break and so having your data on a peer-to-peer network might not actually be that good of a thing let's pause here for a quick word from our fabulous sponsor or on-ramp if you're starting up a new project or it needs some design or branding help on an

podcast and all of our listeners so something else that I wanted to ask you about was scaling I saw some of the video 10 sadly but I did see some of the videos for the blog stack summit and you talked about how existing block chains are thinking about scaling in the wrong way when are they getting wrong and how do you think block chains should scale yeah the summit was amazing we miss you there I think like obviously I'm biased but I think it was probably one of the best events in this space but the good news is all the videos are online so I think you can check it out so yeah there's you've been great I've really enjoyed the ones I've seen yeah so in terms of scaling I think we can we can try to consider an analogy right like imagine that you you think about a block chain as a mainframe computer right and it starts getting more users and you are hitting some sort of a scalability limit and then you try to get more compute power or more memory for your mainframe so you you get a bigger mainframe but it's still a single computer and it can only process like one thing at any given time right so this is basically called like scaling up that you're just throwing more resources at something and but it's it is still a single machine and you're you're you're bound by certain things in that design and you compare that with scaling out which means that you stop using this single machine for all of your computational or data storage needs but you use it for some things which are very very minimal and then you go off to other systems or other computers from there right so this is called scaling out that you don't use the blockchain for every single thing you don't use it as a general-purpose computing platform like a world computer but you use it for a very minimal task let's say I just want to discover what is the public key for Ryan and then the rest of my application actually doesn't touch the blockchain at all or if I want to chat with Ryan like that thing is completely outside of the blockchain and our our app can run that way so this sort of goes back to what we were discussing about the different storage about how or how you guys managed storage where basically you you use a decentralized layer to access different services some of which might be centralized and that enables people to get the benefits of a centralized system which might be like greater speed or efficiency is that is that the thinking yeah I think it's it's similar that we this is this is more just for for scalability of long chains that there are obviously fundamental limitations for how much data you can put on a blockchain or how much how many transactions can be processed by a blockchain so we are trying to put only the minimal amount of data and processing on a blockchain and basically move everything else out but it goes hand-in-hand with having these decentralized storage systems as well okay so now let's dive into the three main areas of your system which are be storage and then payments or your token um so so far you know we discussed before about how you've got seventy thousand people who've got these blot block stack IDs I also and one of those so what can people do with their ID now and how does your identity solution compare with something like Civic or what like Microsoft's doing or net key or you know any of the other there's so many of these blockchain based identity projects out there so tell me how yours compares yeah sure and I think this also builds off of the last discussion as well a big part of our philosophy when it comes to applications is that the vast majority of apps out there are data based they're not actually they're not actually focused around financial instruments if you look at things like social networks Facebook Twitter etc you look at marketplaces like Amazon like uber like Airbnb you look at tools also marketplaces for ad advertisements like what we say we have with Facebook and with Google AdWords and then you look at tools like search engines and so on their main their main fluid if you will in the application is data it isn't actually it isn't money or derivatives or any of these other things it is actually data and the important thing there there's there's different types of data there's data around there's text data there's social networking graph data there's media data for for audio files and videos and so on like we see with YouTube and SoundCloud and when we think about this we should think about the fact that if the vast majority of the most successful businesses in the internet today are centered around data then there's likely going to be the same focus for a lot of the very large portion of the future decentralized applications that take off another side of our philosophy is that most of the time when you think you need a smart contract you probably don't right so in a lot of cases it could be helpful for you to have tokens in your application but something extremely simple but you don't necessarily need the full express ability of being able to build out an entire smart contract on the blockchain we see a lot of these projects that are coming out in they're building their own identity smart contract right into their application or they're building out their own smart contract for discovering data for keeping registries and so on and so forth a lot of these smart contracts really use the same components and they're reimplemented the same things and they have tons of bugs they're making the same mistakes right so what we have done with block stack is we have said okay well what are the core things that decentralized applications need to succeed right what are those what are those very simple components that we can build out and build it once and allow for a very heavy configurability of course and build that once for all of the decentralized applications to use and make it really really simple for developers to integrate in a comprehensive API and developer libraries and so we've done that for identity we down that for storage and in the future we're going to do that for payments and tokens right and so that's why we look at these as the three pillars of block stack and underlying all of that is the discovery layer the domain name system layer that Maps names to keys to routing information and that's really you can think of that like a registry or directory for domains slash applications for people right for you can you can use it for IOT devices for licenses for really anything you want so it's this Universal discovery layer registries directories for anything and in thereat alone is something that would prevent websites are being hacked is that the effect that that would have yeah that's that's a component of it specifically in order to prevent that there are a couple things that we need to build out into our browser going forward to give the user additional context about the websites that they're visiting but in essence what it does is it gives applications complete control over their site and over their domain and it gives the same thing for users so to some extent you can think of domain names they are they're essentially yours there they're kind of under your control somewhat they're not because we do know that I can and is is an organization that manages the entire domain name system and and Verisign is a single corporation that runs for example the dot-com namespace and other namespaces so there is our levels of centralization there but more on the side of users there's not really any system where you can own a user name and own an identity and have it completely under your control so really the big big benefit that we get from this kind of discovery layer has that it can act as the discovery layer for people and it can allow people to - to securely connect with one another and for people to securely connect with apps so a great way to demonstrate why this is needed is if you look at apps like whatsapp or signal right if you ever look at these they what they try to do is that they try to implement it's like intent encryption in a secure way but it's not fully secure because at the end of the day you still have to trust the signal registry to attest to the mappings of names of people and phone numbers and keys right and so if users aren't the Masters of those mappings then at the end of the day you have to trust that central systems registry and what these apps try to do is they'll say like hey like this user changed its security number or aka its key they'll try to warn you and things like that but a lot of times users just blindly accept those warnings and they don't actually manually check the the keys in another channel we can't expect users to do that that's a terrible user experience so really what we have here is this Universal security layer for people applications everyone knows that they're talking to the right person every everyone knows that they're visiting the right application that's the goal and so how do you ensure like once I secure my block seg identity but how is it that you keep it from being hacked I mean like what if my private keys get stolen then then I can lose it that way right yeah exactly so you can you can actually lose your key so we can do a few things there one we can we can ensure that we have a multi device model so that if you lose a single device and your keys are compromised on a single device your accounts still fine you can still regain control your account that's really important you phone your computer we can use pairing there the second thing is some kind of like multi hmm the second thing that we can do we're gonna go forward in the future with is allowing your your network your friends and family to help you secure your account so that's something that's really important going forward for example you can say like oh I lost my account then you can go to your mom and dad and maybe they can help you reset your account we got to make this really really simple great user experience so it's super easy for everyone to use and it's not confusing and then the third thing is that even if someone like even if all of these systems fail and there's still a key compromised then the user can unlink all of their other accounts on the internet they can unlink their Twitter account unlink their Facebook account etc and then people who look at your profile will be like oh wait a second these identity proofs are no longer valid maybe this isn't the same person anymore maybe this person's account was compromised so we can use other pieces of context all over the Internet to still allow the user to recover from that key compromised scenario but with the all the other components in place we can prevent that from happening for a 99.99% of users on the Internet we and so I can unlink from Twitter and Facebook because what if somebody hacks my Twitter and unlinks my my blog stock ID then we'll other people start to the fact that my blog second idea has been compromised so I think it's basically you are kind of like distributing your risk let's say you have these these proofs that you're posting on like Facebook or Twitter or your domain or github they are kind of like Atta stations that you're saying that I am the same person who also owns this Twitter handle this Facebook account this github account right and the probability that all of your accounts get hacked at the same time is actually pretty low so if you lose access to one of these accounts and unless your phone number is hijacked in which case you could lose them all at once sure I think which is something that has been happening a lot to people in our space but anyway right so I think then that really comes down to the security of your private key and and as Ryan was mentioning that there could be very sophisticated ways in which you can actually save your private key and that is your primary way off of that is of owning your identity on the new Internet and I would also like to take a take a step back and differentiate between someone's private key getting hacked because of their fault because they got hacked versus you losing data or your passwords because some remote web site got hacked right because that happens more often these days because most of the times when you'd see like Oh Yahoo got hacked and then everyone's passwords are now online or this other site got hacked and all of your data all of your passwords all of your private information is now online that happens more often because these websites they're there they become like honey pots for data and that's the thing that we are completely removing there are no passwords there is no private information that these remote servers or remote websites have on you and to hack a user someone will have to go and hack that particular user so if someone is targeting you that doesn't mean that my information is at risk as well so let's actually talk about your token I know that previously you guys were not interested having one and in fact maybe even a little bit someone against having one so tell me how and why you guys changed your mind on this I don't think that we change our mind on this I think we were just very careful about because with the blocks act system by definition actually it requires a token there is a token even today that token is Bitcoin so it's more like I think we when we saw a lot of projects which were just raising money on by putting a white paper on a website like that was a little bit alarming just in general in this space that these projects are they haven't really built anything they they are just going ahead and raising money for the sake of raising money so I think maybe some of the some of the earlier conversations we had with you were more along concerns for the general industry instead of specifically a token in the block side netbook yeah I mean also you know we've been we've had plans for over a year now for building out really building out the block stack blockchain and we've we've actually been slowly over time building up more and more components that allow block stack to be its own independent network so for example the Atlas network that's a really important component so block stack actually has its own peer-to-peer network for replicating routing information it's it's unstructured which allows it to be fully replicated allows it to be very reliable so that's what does that mean exactly that means making sure that when if I go to like cnn.com that there's multiple ways to get there is that what you're saying well you can think of it like um there's certain data that's stored in the blockchain right you can have a very low number of bytes for example you can have a hash write which is a way to represent a larger piece of data it's like a some form of digital signature or a way to secure data outside of the system so you have that hash that's stored in in the chain and then you can have a additional information that corresponds to that hash stored in a separate peer-to-peer network and that's that's in the Atlas Network so what that means is that we can reduce the resource requirements that are on chain and still allow for the same level of of Universal resolution for the domain name system right so that wasn't that was an important component and then and then the other thing is you know we we have thought very hard about for over a year now how we can improve block stack and how we can really accomplish many different things but you know improve the scalability characteristic so you know improve on on the on the domain name offerings that we have allow for incentivizing users and developers to - to join the system really bootstrap early network effects and that is what has driven our interest in coming out with a a block stack a token right it's not it's not driven at all and by by any kind of sale like a lot of these other projects have been no as mentioned we have been interested in doing this before any of these sales even existed so it's very much been something that has been core to the idea of block stack yeah and going back to the token going back to the token a little bit it's basically it's a mechanism for spam protection and security of the network because without a token any spammer could just go and register a lot of domain names for free or just abuse the resources on the network that's why in the in the very very early days in 2014 we were using the smaller block chain called namecoin that had a token and then when we introduced our virtualization layer on top of Bitcoin again there there's the token that is Bitcoin that people need to use to effectively buy these domain names and a spammer can't just go around and like register tons or millions of domains for free so similarly there's a there's a scarce resource on our network that needs to be protected and the token is the way of doing that so since you're not really looking at your token as a way to fundraise aside from preventing spam what are some of the other behaviors that you want to incentivize in the blog stack system well really I mean at the end of the day we're growing a two-sided platform and that comes down to getting as many users as possible as many developers as possible and really facilitating the the discovery of of each other so we can get as many active users as across applications as possible so so tokens get released to developers who develop apps on the platform or yeah so yeah exactly so I mean we're gonna be releasing more details about all this soon but yes an important component is that developers will get tokens simply by having app side box tack huh okay well then so let's talk about this developer fun that you guys are launching what is it and why did you create it especially if the developers can also be funded with tokens yeah I think it's basically we believe that traditional venture capital still has an important role to play in in this decentralized apps ecosystem because they have actually seen startups over over many years they can actually help entrepreneurs with team building and a lot of other things that are needed for having successful applications being built and one thing that we have seen in the recent interest with all these token sales is that teams without any experience are actually raising very large amounts of money without having any real guidance or support from experienced players like these investors so our 25 million signature fund is kind of like our way of establishing this channel between app developers who want to build on top of blog stack and these sophisticated investors who have been thinking about this space a lot and who have some really good ideas about how this ecosystem can develop further and who are the investors in this fund that will be advising the developers who receive these grants so we announced our first set of investors we're working with Lux Capital we're working with open ocean with rising tide with compound and with version 1 and at the moment so obviously we've seen that there is a lot of interest to in building decentralize projects but for now what attracts a developer to develop unblock sack as opposed to something like aetherium which has so much buzz there's a few things there I mean what it really depends what kind of application that you're building so if you are going to build a new system for derivatives if you're gonna build a decentralized exchange then it really makes a lot of sense to build on a theory a theorem is really good for those kinds of complex financial instruments makes a lot of sense for augur to be built on it I'm etherium for example right at least today and if you're building something where you're trying to build a decentralized social network you're trying to build decentralized Airbnb or decentralized eBay you should really think about what is the simplest way that you can build out your system in a way that also has really good performance characteristics has good scalability and will not mire you down in terms of reliability and security issues and also something that's gonna be really like cheap for your users right because you don't want to introduce a new system where it's gonna cost you know tens of dollars or hundreds of dollars just to to be on your platform and with any of these systems if they get scale if they get decent number of users that's going to happen right so when you look at the existing platforms available blocks X really the only one that offers such a comprehensive toolkit in terms of identity authentication storage everything that you'd need to get started with these applications and we have the we have everything completely full stack and to end we have the browser available we have a system where you can set up your identity users can set up their identity in their storage we have those libraries we're coming out with iOS and and an Android apps in due time right so we can really cover all the bases and give that developer a great experience and give the developer the ability to bring a great experience for the user and you can't really say that for any platform out there today and can those developers also incorporate their own tokens onto the apps that they build on your platform yeah this is only we're looking at ya later on and I think so to build off of what Ryan said if you look at applications like for example our team actually uses a to-do list app that is built on top of block stack and if you just take the example of that simple application writing a smart contract for a to-do list app just sounds absurd right like Why Why should there be a smart contract for first up or something like that to do this app or if I'm adding an item to my to-do list it shouldn't impact anyone else on the network like there shouldn't be any transaction generated that now needs to be processed by thousands or potentially even millions of people down the road so I think that kind of like speaks for the architecture that we have built out where developers get very quickly very easily build out applications like this to-do list app and and have it scale out like we can get like a million people for this app today and it wouldn't have any scalability impact on the core of the network just because of the way these applications are designed yeah I mean we can really just repeat the mantra that most of the time when you think you need us more contract you probably don't okay but in that case like the reason is that every user on that to-do list even if it's all shared across a million people they're kind of like owned to dues are being stored on their own storage is that is that good why is this exactly it's scalable because I think think of this as like imagine that in the early days when you bought a piece of software and it shipped to you on a cd-rom drive the and someone locally installed something and they keep their data on their own computer and they can use the software and a million people can use that software without impacting each other and then the model changed later on where with cloud computing a million people would sign up on a remote server that was operated by that company and if suddenly a million people started using an application those servers are getting a lot of load and then you need to scale that up and so on and so forth right so these are when you enable people to own their own data on their own storage on their own software and do things as much locally as possible this is a model that can actually scale out to hundreds of millions of users without impacting other people because there's no central bottleneck there is no central mainframe computer that everyone needs to connect to just to be able to use a simple app okay and right now you guys are using the Bitcoin blockchain do you plan on supporting any other block chains and also how do Forks affect block stack oh sure yeah I'm just gonna build off and also a previous question that you mentioned which is um in terms of users being able to actually developers on the platform being able to issue their own tokens that is something that we are building towards and we're gonna be releasing more details about that soon but an important thing to think about is that right now the de-facto way for developers to create tokens is on aetherium and and I think that's unfortunate what we want to do is give developers another choice and something that integrates well with the block stack platform you know we talked about the simplicity of giving identity and storage solutions and we're gonna absolutely do the same thing for tokens but and what about this but the Bitcoin blockchain and how any Forks affect you guys yeah absolutely no planning any adopt other blockchains yeah so how locks act works is that we have this virtualization there and so our blockchain called virtual chain actually lives on there above traditionally what people think of as block chains and we use underlying block chains just for like storage we just want to store certain pieces of data in the underlying watch and right now we use the Bitcoin blockchain it's very easy for us to write these drivers for block chains like for example for C cash it's a there's already a bounty on our github for for that truck for that driver and it's actually minimal changes from the existing driver that we have and Bitcoin and then you can plug in the Z cash portion as well same for etherium and and other clock chains and it's it's something on our road map it's something that we already have bounties for on k-dubb so any open source developers who want to contribute resources there they can but in general we don't have any specific timeline for when these features will actually go live so in terms of white listeners can expect next from you it sounds like the token sale will be coming up next what are some other things on your roadmap yes so there's the there's the token distribution that we have coming up that's a big one and then really we're building towards the new version of our browser that we can release to consumers so you can if you're a developer you can download it today if you're a user and especially ambitious you can go and try it out on our website at block stack dot org but we have yet to release that real consumer ready version so that's gonna be coming out coming out soon and there's gonna be a lot of exciting updates on there right so those are really the two things that we're building towards great well how can people get in touch with you guys well you can join us in our slack you can go to block stack org and go sign up for our mailing list and send it for our slack group sign up for a forum come chat with us in there you know we're we're always in
