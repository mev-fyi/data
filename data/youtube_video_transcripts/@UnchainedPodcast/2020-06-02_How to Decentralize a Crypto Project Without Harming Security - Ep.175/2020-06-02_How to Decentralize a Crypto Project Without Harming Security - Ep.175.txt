or digital dollars stellar is easy to learn and fast to implement start your journey today at unchanged stellar org today's topic is how projects should decentralize here to discuss our Jessi Walden founder of variant and Robert leshner founder of compound welcome Robert and Jessi hi Laura I think the topic for today's discussion can be centered around one basic problem which is the fact that when teams are building decentralized projects they start out as a team which means that the project will start out as centralized so the question is how do they eventually be centralized and we've seen a number of ways that various teams have tried to solve this conundrum but before we get into that let's dive into your backgrounds so people have an understanding of where you're coming from on this topic Jessi do you want to start sure yeah so I guess I first got involved with crypto as a founder of a project called media chain back in 2014 and our goal was to build what we called sort of a universal media library so kind of like Bitcoin aims to be a universal store value we wanted to do the same for a different type of digital asset instead of a financial asset we wanted to focus on images songs and videos or media assets and make them discoverable anywhere they were distributed on the internet and that project was acquired by Spotify in 2017 where I went on to lead bacha ard and I was there throughout the sort of crazy run-up in the markets in 2017 and then left to join entries and Horowitz where we spent on a dedicated crypto fund and I worked on the investment team for the for the last two and a half years and now with variant I'm planning to work with entrepreneurs at the earliest stages in their journey and help them solve problems like the question about how to decentralized and Robert you were on Unchained before and you did talk about your background then but for people who didn't listen to that episode especially because it was a while back how about you let us know what your background is in crypto and and before yeah so I started my career in the traditional finance space I was an interest rate economist and I was focused on you know traditional financial markets I started compound in 2017 to create interest rate markets for crypto assets when I was on the show last time you know I think I probably was forward-looking about the ideals of decentralization but compound as a protocol was in a very early phase where it was still being worked on by a core team that was taking it from the very early stages of being an idea into the first working prototypes of being an application that the community can start to use since that point you know we've seen widespread growth in the compound protocol it manages hundreds of millions of dollars of assets and it provides interest rates for many different applications in the space that are looking to earn an interest rate on the crypto that their applications hold and provide additional functionality to decentralized applications so now let's dive into the details of our topic and talk about the difficulties of building a decentralized project just that you wrote about this in your progressive decentralization playbook so how would you describe the challenge here yeah so I think you touched on it earlier in saying that there's sort of a dissonance between you know building a product and and then the the sort of ultimate goal of crypto networks which is to become sufficiently decentralized such and and I think it's important first sort of addressing the question why encrypted projects you know aim to be decentralized in the first place and from there sort of back out how to get there so I guess maybe to start the the reason for decentralization in many of these projects is that decentralization is sort of a proxy for trust you can trust that a crypto network is going to behave as specified if there's many sort of independent parties running code on independent machines and that's sort of what's at the core of you know networks like Bitcoin and the Furion as you as the community starts to develops or more complex applications there tends to be a shift from deterministic protocols or protocols that conduct sort of verifiable computation to protocols that require or applications that require more subjective inputs and human decision-making and for those types of applications compound being being one of them there needs to be a sense of sort of community ownership over how those decisions get made and community ownership is important because it means it allows for the community to ensure that their sort of interests are being reflected in the decision making that goes on in these applications and that's very different from traditional Internet platforms which are you know owned by investors and shareholders whose interests are not always aligned with the with the interests of end-users so that's all to say you know decentralization matters because it's it's a way for the community of users who build on top of these platforms or use the applications built on top of these platforms to feel as if the platform is aligned with with their own interests so that's been my decentralization matters and then I'm gonna argue that the path to getting there isn't an immediate one but rather sort of a step-by-step process and and breaking it out into these three steps isn't obvious to everyone there are a lot of projects especially back in the early days of crypto that strive for decentralization out of the gate because it offers the benefits I just described but to start I would argue that teams really need to think about first building a product that people actually want and they're you know the the goal isn't very different from that of a traditional startup because without a product that people want you don't really have much to work with and and you probably will have a hard time building a community that ultimately wants to sort of you know take control or build on top of what it is that you're building so so yeah the first step is finding product market fit building a product that people want and and thereafter building a community around that product such that you can get to the third and final step which is turning ownership over to the community and I actually just for a moment want to step back to what you were saying about the differences between a decentralized protocol versus a decentralized app or application yeah I just so you did say in your PlayBook that blockchain protocols are or that they were quite quite and I'm gonna quote you here that they require sufficient as such decentralisation from inception in order to be useful so why is there that distinction again you might have explained it briefly but I just want to explore that a bit further yeah so so my playbook is really sort of really aims to speak to entrepreneurs and founders building at the application layer and and and that means you know applications built on top of smart contract platforms like aetherium at the lower layers in the stack so you know layers like aetherium or other smart contract platforms arguably you need decentralization out of the gate in order for the platform to be useful and that is because you know platforms like aetherium the promise of the platform is that they do computation that can be trusted and again that trust arrives from decentralized network of physical machines that are running all over the world that result in this single virtual machine that developers can build on top of knowing that the code that they write and deploy to the platform is going to execute as specified because if one machine goes rogue there's many other machines you know that that will sort of behave correctly and ensure that the application that a developer writes continues to run as specified so at layer one you sort of need decentralization and those many machines running the network to get those trust guarantees that make the platform usable by developers who need to build applications or who need that trust in order to build useful applications like compound and so earlier you did go over the stages of decentralisation starting with product market fit and also going into community participation and then eventually reaching this stage of sufficient to specialization and I was curious to know about some of the ways that teams are moving along these stages like for instance one of the ones that you mentioned in your playbook was something called Kelvin versioning and I just wanted you to maybe kind of describe some of the ways that teams are trying to move from stage to stage yeah well I mean I think Robert is is probably even you know the best person answered this question because he's been living it over the past couple of years with compound and he can give you you know his his own experience but but maybe before I turn it over to Robert to answer that I would just note that recently reddit sort of reddit sort of made up play in the crypto space that I think validates the hypothesis of this playbook which is you know they've just announced community currencies and so a couple of subreddits I think one is called our fortnight VR which is the big fortnight subreddit and then then our cryptocurrency are both getting their own subreddit currencies I think bricks and moons respectively and what's interesting is those crypto currencies did not launch sort of in a vacuum they launched after reddit built product features that they felt had product market fit with those those communities namely the ability to tip and sort of access premium features in each of these sub reddits respectively using those currencies so reddit I would argue some built a product that they felt had early signs of product market fit of course there was sort of a robust community in each of these sub reddits already and so there was you know a good amount of community participation and then at the time that they actually launched these community currencies and they effectively are now in the process of turning ownership of the community over to the to the contributors directly through this token and so I think that's a very good example of what sort of high profile platform executing this playbook step by step and Roberts been doing a similar thing and I think and probably speak best to how he's been thinking about it and actually Robert before you start I just wanted to ask one more thing which either of you can answer but so reddit and kik are somewhat similar and that both of them did have these communities to start with and then introduced a token and is the main difference simply that kik had an ICO and that reddit didn't or what would you say is the distinction there because obviously as we know now the sec it has gone after kik and they're still in a court battle yeah i think that's a that's a big one i think you know tons of projects not just kicked they started out trying to achieve decentralization through a token cell that is sort of seeding a community by by issuing a token and distributing it you know in exchange for for funding and and i think you know what we've learned is not only that is that a way to potentially trip regulatory wires it can also be a way to sort of invite a community of speculators rather than community of real contributors or people participating in a productive way and and and so my view is that if you start some product first and and build validation around product markets it and you sort of naturally move from there to a sort of active community whom you can then confer ownership to and and that's a better way to some build a community of engaged participants who are excited to sort of an inherit ownership of the platform and and sort of take it over from there and that's a healthier way to grow a community from from inception rather than the other way around all right Robert why don't you talk about compound and how you guys are trying to decentralize yes so I think this question starts with why decentralize in the first place why build an application using a blockchain and smart contracts when you can build it alternatively using a database and by acting as a centralized business and I think there's an important difference because you could build a compound like product not using smart contracts there's a number of companies out there that have the same you know types of you know financial use cases that aren't built on a blockchain and aren't built music smart contracts I think long term the biggest advantage of decentralization is that it allows an application to run forever to be censorship resistant to be open to users anywhere and to be able to be improved and expanded on by the community but obviously starting there is extremely hard launching a decentralized application is difficult from a coordination standpoint I'm just building it is hard and you know as Jesse touched on earlier with you know the decentralization playbook it's overkill in a lot of ways you know unless there's a reason for an application to run forever it doesn't need to be decentralized when there's no users it doesn't matter whether it's fully centralized or fully decentralized and so at compound we've always viewed a decentralized product as being the end goal then it can be the very best version of the product possible if it's fully decentralized we started with a lot of components being centralized the development of compound and the control of it and the governance decisions so in our experience what we've done is over time step by step by step and month by month we've tried to shed as much responsibility as possible to the point where we're now in a position where the protocol is actually run by a governance system that's coordinated through a governance token instead of through a centralized business and the protocol is upgraded and improved through the governance process and so we've had a lot of steps and we can over you know this interview drill into different steps that we've experienced but it's really been this gradual transition where we've iterated into removing as much responsibility as we can over time and the way that you have decided to more progressively decentralize is to now introduce a governance token which has that take our comp why did you decide to go that route so there was really two guiding principles on in creating a governance token to run the protocol the first one was to remove our team as a point of failure you can think of this governance token in the aggregate is like a giant multi-sig that's required to make changes to the protocol I'll be very honest and I say I don't actually like having administrative control over something oh you know I don't like worrying that someone's gonna come up to me on the street with a wrench and try to steal a key having you know a huge community share of responsibility for approving changes to a protocol prevents right out of the gate a huge amount of accidental or malicious errors that can occur the second reason is it allows a much wider audience to actually suggest changes a centralized team only has so much creative throughout throughput and engineering capacity you know if it was left to us we can only make one or two changes to the protocol in any given month week quarter year etc by rolling out governance to a much larger audience and designing in such a way that the community can actually suggest and implement changes themselves it allows a much wider surface area for creativity and improvements and we're already seeing you know stakeholders in the community actually implement and merge in changes to the protocol itself and so I view this is like the tools required to allow it to run forever and to continuously upgrade now that there's you know a lot of applications and users that care about seeing the protocols succeed and one other thing actually that I just wanted to ask about because it almost seems to go in the opposite direction of your arguments is that as we all know recently there was a hack of the lund FME protocol and the team behind that d-force appears to have a copy the original compound code and in a discussion that I had on unchained about that attacked some people were saying you know essentially that the compound team was you know really up on security and that was why you had prevented something similar happening on compound because essentially like certain technical decision set the d-force team had taken is what enabled that attack so in that sense it almost seems like you were able to protect yourselves because you are still somewhat centralized would you agree with that or what's your take on it yeah that's a great question so and it's one of the most important trade-offs as you start to decentralize and start to hand off responsibility for the community so I do think that because our team has historically spent so much effort time and money focused on security that we were able to prevent something negative from happening we now have a responsibility of teaching and handing off those expectations to the community and aligning the incentives such that the community that winds up taking over the protocol demands the same rigor before a change is implemented you know I'm speaking personally as an individual not as somebody a compound but when I vote my comp tokens the first thing I look for is has the code been audited and peer reviewed and is it safe or does it not make any changes to the code of the protocol at all and it's just changing a parameter doesn't need to be peer reviewed and ordered it in the same way you know my first decision as a token holder and whether or not to approve a change does come down to security and I hope and expect that over time the community starts to enforce the exact same standards as they vote on upgrades to compound yeah yeah yeah there's this concept there's it's got Linus's law which is the idea that given enough eyeballs all bugs are shallow so give it a given that compounds now in this mode of sort of open development you you know you and assume that it's not just the eyeballs of the core team but the eyeballs of all those who have a say in how compound moves forward when reviewing any proposal made and presumably more eyeballs the better in terms of security yeah something that blew my mind a little bit about that story is that that attack vector was written about the previous summer sack happens so um you know was widely known so you know you would have thought the team would have by then absorbed the lesson and known to not allow your er c77 tokens on on on their contracts but anyway and the other thing that is remarkable is that it took so somebody that long to exploit it but anyway um so just to go back I also wanted to ask you Robert so when you guys were deciding for compound to further decentralize like what metrics were you looking at to say to yourselves okay this is now the time to take this step or that step like you know was it something about your developer community or the the community in general or you know what were you looking at to make that decision that's a great question so we were looking at protocol being you know in a position where it needs to harden and become more predictable for the applications built on top of it you know when a team has complete centralized control they can change a product or take it in whatever direction they want and a compound we really think of the primary user as an application developer another exchange or custodian or wallet or extremely creative product that someone in the communities building and you know I actually look at Bitcoin is you know in some ways the best you know analogy in that it's very hardened it's very predictable you know exactly what you're getting it's you know something that's worthy of developing on top of because you know where it's gonna be next month we didn't want to really hard in compound until it was out of place where we saw that there was widespread adoption for us a lot of the decision came down to seeing a number of applications built on top of compound before deciding that you know it needed to have the sort of guarantees of decentralization and so for us you know it was really like do we want to you know create something more predictable and stable for the developers and that was the lens that we were using version one of compound lived for about a year and we actually saw almost no you know widespread adoption and developer integrations of it even though that was the goal all along and so for us we said well we need to improve the underlying protocol we need to make changes we need to you know modify the way it works you know and have the nimbleness of a centralized team and we put all of that into version two of compound which launched almost exactly one year ago today saw the adoption saw the integrations occurring and say said to ourselves now is the time that we're able and should and we need to think responsibly about handing off that control to the developers built on top and so what is the system of governance and compound today well it's based on simplicity so it's actually a relatively straightforward governance mechanism there's a number of comp tokens currently we're testing the cop governance system with a limited number of stakeholders there's about 60 or 70 and the way it works is anybody that has a hundred thousand comp that they're able to vote with can propose a change to the protocol changes are you know actual executable code it's not a suggestion for a centralized foundation or team somewhere to go and do something it's actually like you know a modification to the protocol and then over a three-day period anybody with comp votes can save for or against that's the only parameters you know yes or no and if a minimum threshold of votes as well as a majority of votes or cast for the proposal it goes into a two day waiting period where if you don't like the change you can opt out of being a user and after two days it's executed and the protocol is upgraded you know we've seen a number of proposals some the first one was proposed by our team we've had two others proposed by members of the community and all three passed and were executed and modified the way that the compound protocol operates over the last six weeks the only additional layer that makes this even more exciting is out of the gate the governance system runs on this concept of liquid democracy and delegation so anyone with the cop token can either participate in this governance process themselves they can propose changes or vote on proposals or if they want to take a more passive role they can delegate their votes to anybody else in the community um this could be an expert this could be an application this could be a dau this could be Laura Shin this could be anybody that you trust with your votes that you think is going to be more active than you and it allows people to participate as much or as little as they want and channel good decision-making to the place where they think good decisions will be made and that's the system in its entirety it's a core part of the protocol itself and so it in itself can be upgraded through governance so if the comp token holders say hey we can optimize this or calibrate in some way that's paws also a year from now it might work in a slightly different fashion but the system is designed for simplicity and it's currently live and it's completely transparent so anyone out there listening to this show can actually you know look at the governance system of compound see every vote that was cast see every vote that's ever been delegated see all of the participants in the ecosystem and see how its operating it's available at compound DOT finance / governance and it's a really cool system that's extremely transparent and liquid one thing I have to ask you about is that the governance proposals need to be submitted in code I believe is that correct that's correct although we've created a GUI or a dashboard that makes certain proposals extremely trivial for a non-technical user so you know the last proposal that was created was to change one of the properties of an asset market you know how good is the asset as collateral and how does an interest rate work with it and it was as simple as dragging and dropping so to speak for the individual that created the proposal there was no code written by them and they were able to go to a dashboard that's only visible to those with enough votes to create that proposal okay I'm sure you know where I was going with that because as a non-technical person myself I was like oh my gosh she's like this is a huge it gives a leg up to tell everybody fluent in a smart contract coding but all the non coders are sort of shut out but then there's but then there's delegation right so like you know in spite of the fact there's a dashboard but but all its separately you know a non-technical person could could delegate votes to someone more technical to propose something and I think that's a really great way to sort of scale governance because you can have people specialize in different areas that they're strong that's exactly right all right so in a moment we'll talk a little bit more about how compound is decentralizing and also talk about some other

think Hellman back to my conversation with Robert leshner and Jesse Walden so how have you been distributing the token yeah so in creating the distribution of the token we've held a couple principles in mind and some of the pieces you know we're saving for future announcements but what we've done is we've decided to allocate the tokens between those who originally built the protocol and the users of the protocol so our goal is you know very soon to begin distributing over half of all tokens to the users of the protocol and we believe that you know by aligning those who are using the protocol on a daily basis with governance it will lead to the best governance of the protocol the tokens not an economic token there's no cash flows associated with it it's purely for the purposes of governing how changes are made to the protocol and we believe that you know by splitting it between the original developers and the people that back the original developers and the community it'll lead to a long term incentive of those who want to see a succeed of you know folks that want to see it upgraded in the right ways to maintain the stability if their protocol and no we said what ways the things that you did just to make sure that the token would not run afoul of regulations so we believe that regulators have the right intention and that projects can learn a lot from what the regulations are and why they exist in the first place and we've done a number of things to try to fit in to the expectations of regulators perfectly so the first is that we waited until the governance system was fully built the protocol was fully built and that the token could be used to participate in governance before introducing it you know for us this meant introducing a token three years after beginning the project the second is that these tokens aren't used as a fundraising device we're not selling them we're creating them after the protocol is fully live and they're really you know being distributed in a non fundraising mechanism and lastly we're distributing them to users only once all the pieces are in place so that users are able to further the decentralization of the protocol and of the token and so the end result is one in which the protocol should be able to run with community input community management and community control with no reliance on the original developers at all and be able to effectively run the protocol and just don't curiosity sue once you achieve your goal and compound is decentralized what will happen to compound the company yeah that's a great question we get asked that a lot I see us continuing to build on top of the protocol but not building the underlying protocol itself similar in a lot of ways to you know if if we were Satoshi and we created Bitcoin and then we went out and treated corn base you know we want the community to be solely responsible for the protocol itself how it operates and to participate as just any other member of the community on a completely fair basis with no advantages but to build some new things on top of the protocol now that we've assured into it into existence interesting all right well let's say now just talk generally about other ways that projects can decentralize and this sort of goes back to some of the things that just the outlined in the playbook but there are these other ways that projects are trying to keep their gaps sort of like alive and yet some of them also run the risk of opening the way for a competitor so for instance if a DAP starts charging fees can you just outline the pros and cons of doing that and how it is that such a project could prevent any other open source project from coming in and just sweeping away all their users by lowering or dropping the fees yeah so yeah they're I think it's it's helpful to think of crypto networks as as marketplaces you know Bitcoin for example has a fee associated with every transaction and part of that fee you know is is used to reward the miners for ordering the transaction in the blockchain and of course in Bitcoin and the theorem there's also minor rewards to sort of subsidize the fee but but over time those rewards are meant to diminish and and at the end of the day what you're left with is is a marketplace where users pay fees and and those operating the network earn those fees yeah there's there's many anyone can come along and fork the Bitcoin network or fork aetherium and and what they're doing is they're forking the code and and sort of the state of the network but they're not necessarily forking the community with it and and that when I say forking the community that's sort of a social idea you need to get all the people all the humans that use this network to move from you know what they view as the canonical instantiation of the Bitcoin or aetherium network to to your fork and and there's a cost to doing that that the social cost of coordinating everyone is a switching cost and the concept of switching costs is nothing new when it comes to marketplaces or networks you know uber Airbnb traditional web to marketplaces that the value of those marketplaces is due to the switching cost of moving to an alternative so anyone can build the competing air B&B you know service or a competitor that uber but it's hard to get all the users that those platforms of a mouse to switch over and so the switching cost is what's at the core of defensibility of web 2 platforms it's also what's at the core of defensibility of crypto networks now so switching costs are lower in crypto because everything is open source so you know it's it's you can't take boobers database of drivers and and fork it over to your platform you can do that in crypto but there's the cost of forking is still nonzero as I mentioned you have to get all the people involved to move over and so that switching cost does allow for some margin of defense ability that allows for these marketplaces to extract a fee and I think so hopefully that highlights that the business model for crypto networks is actually quite similar to web 2 but what's different about about crypto networks is there's this new potential to take that fee stream and distribute it directly to the users who generate the network effects of a platform who make the platform valuable in the first place and and if you do that effectively you reinforce the network effects because now the users have a stake in the platform and want to see it continue to grow and and so I think that is that that sort of validates the idea that these networks are marketplaces they they have a business model which is fees and the new thing is just defensibility is created by distributing that fee stream to the actual users and that's very different from web - yeah and it's something else that we've kind of been talking about here and there but not really dived into is the issue of token distribution you know some of you have mentioned it like in some of your answers like about reddit or about how compound is doing it but um you know as you mentioned earlier some of the ways that team have been doing this have invited speculators so what are some of the best ways to do it in a way that's fair but also in a way that invites real users and what is also a fair amount to allocate to the initial team and cap table yeah I mean I think it's it's gonna vary case-by-case on depending on sort of the specific application and the specific community in question that that said I think you know what you don't want to do is sell all the tokens upfront to a community of folks that you know may may not have any interest in actually using what you've built and so I think one of the things that compounds done really well is you know first find a community of developers to build on top of the protocol understand their needs adapt the protocol quickly to make it more useful to them and then sort of promise a distribution of ownership over the protocol over time so that that community can feel confident that the rules of the platform are not going to change from underneath them and and that gives them sort of you know increases their incentive to build and contribute so so I would encourage again sort of you know selling out to unknown community of speculators at the outset and and that's of course what happen in 2017 that said the I think that you know speculation isn't all bad in that you know it does it does give the community members a way to just sort of have a stake in platform growth and I think that's ultimately sort of the big unlock that that crypto enables it sort of surfaced this late and demand that you know everyday Internet users actually do want to own a piece of the platforms and services they interact with every day and tokens are a way to sort of effectuate that because we can now move value in the way we move bits of information so some degree of of ownership by the community is important it just needs to happen at the right time and and sort of in in response to real contribution and again that will depend largely on the application in question in the community you know communities values so it'll be different case-by-case Oh Evan for something like the allocation to the initial team like there's no kind of convergence around what is the proper amount I mean I think I think we're starting to see more more teams sort of break it down where it's it's roughly you know 50% goes to the core team and and investors that's a bootstrap and thing and 50% to the community and then over time that that split may shift for example through you know increased inflation over time but maybe that you know you start sort of 50/50 and and then the role of the core team sort of diminishes as the community sort of takes over and and new tokens are minted and again this is something that that the community has a say in because you know for example on compound the community can change pretty much every aspect of the system through governance so you can imagine that over time the community decides you know we need to start rewarding new contributors to the protocols opposed to the initial team and and one way to do that might be by by allocating those new contributors additional tokens and so one thing that we've talked about here and there is regulation but we haven't actually huge the exact regulation that a lot of people are concerned about and I feel like this is this has been a theme basically since the early days of cryptocurrency even going back to the first event that we would now call an ICO even though that term didn't exist in which was master coin and at that time even people were concerned that the tokens would be considered securities and the way in the US that that is determined is by something called how we test hopefully listeners know what this is by now but if you're new I'll just say it's this four-pronged test in which a token would have to meet all four prongs to be considered as security and those four prongs are number one it's an investment of money two into a common enterprise three with an expectation of profits and four dependent on an identifiable third party so in your work with teams are you seeing them like actively trying to build their strategies in such a way so as not to hit the four prongs and in general like you know what are some of the kind of maybe rules of thumb that are emerging when it comes to thinking about the Howey test and how it applies in these situations well yeah I think so with Howie you need to you need to hit all four prongs I guess in most cases in order to trip the securities regulation and you know there are good reasons that those regulations exist you know that it's to protect investors and you know what comes with that though is there's a ton of overhead and and generally it's a lot for for early-stage startups to manage being sort of a regulated security and and it's all that sort of overhead gets in the way of building a product that people want so it that's why I think it's advisable for Roly teams to you know not worry about a token from the outset especially when the there is sort of a large dependence on the efforts of others namely that of the efforts of the core team and so you know as Robert mentioned you know start when he started out when others started out it's really important that the core team is able to iterate quickly and at that point you probably don't want to have a token because you might then trip the the Howey test and and so the I think the the prong to really zero in on is this prong of the efforts of others once you can sort of demonstrate that the product or service that you've built is in fact owned and operated by the community and and thus no longer has a dependence on others or the core team at that point you may not be running afoul of securities regulation and you you you then don't have to necessarily deal with with the overhead of being a regulated security and that's great because it means that the community can can start to contribute and add you know add value without having to you know file all kinds of you know regulatory paperwork and so on it makes the system much more some internet native and and I think that's really important for innovation to continue and so then what do you say that it seems like one of the rules of thumb is to not issue token before the network is live like when you said early definitely I think I think the the right time to do it is again once you once you've built a product that people want demonstrated that the community is is sort of excited about it and that the way to measure that is whether they're building on top whether they're contributing ideas or code and at that point you might want to stand up some sort of governance process where and you can demonstrate that the community has in fact taken over control of the of the project from the core team and there are there at that point you know there is no dependence on the core team that the project is hopefully sufficiently decentralized and at that point there there can be a token that doesn't trip this prong on the efforts of others all right so let's talk about some of these controversial issues that have come up with how decentralized or not decentralized certain projects are one of the ones that comes to mind is the recent bzx attacks where after the attacks occurred people were up in arms about the fact that the bzx team had an admin key which they used to pause the protocol and i guess this was a surprise to some people who thought bzx was decentralized so what's your take on what happened there like what would have been the appropriate action for the team to take and should in that case do you think that team should have had an admin key I'll jump in on this so I believe that any system should be documented and transparent I think you know the incongruence that you've highlighted is that the community didn't know how it worked and so their expectations were shattered I think whether or not there's an admin key is not the important piece it's is it documented do people know how things work is the code available to inspect an audit and does the community have a general understanding of how it works you know there's always gonna be an incredible gradient of decentralization but you don't want us for there to be a mismatch between how decentralized the community thinks it is and how decentralized it actually is I think the way they responded was probably totally appropriate causing the protocol when there's a horrific loss of funds makes a lot of sense I think they should have prepared for that by documenting their systems more and being more transparent yeah I agree with that I think you know being radically transparent about the state of the system is actually a way to build trust even if it's the case that the system is still centralized at the outset again you know in the early stages of a product it's all about finding product market fit and at that point there probably should be no pretense of decentralization you should just build you know focus on building a product that people want to be transparent about where control in the system exists and doing so it was actually a way to build trust with the community whereas if you obfuscate the control that exists in the system you know once it's on earth you will very quickly sort of undermine any trust that that you might have built on false pretences so I think you know transparencies paramount and and part of how you build trust towards progressively decentralized in the protocol this is this is an interesting perspective you guys have I did see that Eric wall had a tweet storm on admin keys and this is also really interesting his perspective here but he said that people tracking the dphi teams with admin that people attacking the dphi teams with the admin keys and saying that they're no different from centralized exchanges that that attack is quote the cheap boring fast track to crypto twitter woke Ness he his stance was that a defy key to pause or freeze a contract was not really like a centralized exchange because it would not allow the team to confiscate individual user balances and he said um and you know I didn't talk to Eric but just from the way that tweets were phrased it seemed says he seemed to be saying that these types of admin key are probably okay at least to him he said you know some admin keys have built-in time delays so that users can withdraw their money from the contract before any change goes into effect it lists such as an upgrade and so he said that that's obviously different from a centralized exchange and he said that some other smart contracts are opting to not have admin keys at all and instead require that if they make an upgrade that everybody moved their funds to the new contracts so what's your take on any or all of these options and you know what it is that admin keys should be used for so this goes to the progressive decentralization and this come for even a single project evolved considerably I'm a great example is when compound launched you know there was an admin that could make any change to any contract with no notice at will and that's because when there's very few users the stakes are low and you need to be flexible and over time there's lots of tools that you can use to decrease the potency of an admin key so one example is a time delay for any change where a user as you mentioned could have helped out that is a significant improvement in reducing the potency of an advocate the second is changing what an admin key can do you know reducing the ability to make a unilateral change is an improvement so there's all of these steps along the way not having it I'm in key at all is even better right we're finally at the point where you know any change to the protocol not only requires a delay but also to go through a governance process and there's no admin key that can you know make a unilateral change the codebase right now there's all these steps in-between and any team can in some ways pick and choose and mix and match you know how they reduce the potency of an admin key starting from a very centralized point and leading all the way to a very decentralized point and every team has a different set of standards well one thing that I am so curious about is as we're seeing these defy protocols are very interoperable and there's constant change and new developments and so as the technology oops improving we're just gonna end up with a lot of situations like the lend of me attack where you know we have this new technology the ERC 777 token that when it operates with older protocols introduces a vulnerability and I can't imagine that that's not going to happen time and again and as we get more like this it's just the the the sheer proliferation of new defy protocols like it just means that it's gonna be incredibly difficult for teams to keep up to make sure that their project doesn't interact with another project in a way that introduces vulnerability so like the idea that you would get to the point where it's not upgradeable a little bit like what are we gonna see just like every single time there's a new defy project like a bunch of projects they're like we're gonna shut down for you know like two weeks or whatever and then switch everybody over like how is this gonna work well so I think zooming out you gotta look at the big picture and what you're describing is sort of you know an ecosystem evolving through what's called you know composable building blocks where you know each application or each t5 protocol is a building block that other developers are building on top of and extending and sort of adding new functionality to and and the the positive view of this is you know that's awesome because it means developers can build way more with fewer resources because they don't have to build everything from scratch they can sort of build on top of the work that others have done the negative view is well that means that there's all these dependencies on the work that others have done and if there's a vulnerability you know the whole thing can come crashing down I tend to think that that sort of that that negative outcome is you know certainly something that will happen you know there are bugs in code but over time these these protocols the the good ones will demonstrate that they're actually resilient and trustworthy and the the sort of positive sort of sort of effects of the ecosystem composing one epic to another and you know compounding innovation more rapidly will far outweigh the sort of short-term negative effects of these of like bugs and creating you know negative depend or dependencies that weaken the system overall so so long term I think this is a much more resilient ecosystem because of the composability of these protocols and it's it's it's it's a system where you can trust that what you build on top of is not going to get yanked from underneath you because again all the codes open you can trust the codes going to run as specified because it's running on a decentralized computer and that's very very different than the the sort of web 2 error that came before where you had a similar phenomenon of developers building on top of platforms like Twitter and Facebook and Spotify and there were these rich developer ecosystems but eventually you know each of those platforms had admin keys and decided you know what we're gonna we're gonna shut up change the rules shut off our api's and bring down these entire developer ecosystems to bring all that product innovation in-house so you know that's that's the the risk of having admin keys or having controlled by one central party and I think you know the long-term risk of of that single point of failure is much greater to developers than that then the risk that that short term there's a bug that that that you know that they can ultimately be fixed over time ok but hopefully during that time nobody's funds will be honest that's true I mean I'm not saying there won't be there will definitely be painful you know painful problems along the way but I do think the sort of fundamentals here are stronger and over time these these protocols will prove to be more resilient than then then platforms that came before all right well one other thing so in the days before recording this podcast TB TC had to pause deposits for 10 days which basically means they're just gonna drain the funds from the smart contract and I presume they'll just try again later because the key that they had only allowed them to pause the call once for that express purpose of draining the funds and they made it so that they could not upgrade the contract and you know we did mention that it is possible to create upgrades through governance so like why is it that some of these teams are opting to not make their projects upgradable so I think there's a lot of reasons why and it also comes down to the fact that every project is unique and different and I don't think there's a one-size-fits-all solution because different projects need different governance mechanisms and in different ways right if you're building a platform that you know is meant to be a very simple building block you might want less upgrade ability then a platform that's meant to evolve a little bit over time and so I think for something like T BTC where they're creating asset it makes a lot of sense that you want a very limited amount of upgrade ability if you're building a tool that looks more like a decentralized financial product and so has more complexity to it you might want there to be some upgrade ability even if it's only for simple purposes a great example in some ways is compound you know there's certain assets that we need to be upgradable that need to be able to have governance there because the assets can evolve in unexpected ways so you have to have the ability to make changes and make improvements but if we were building something it was a very straightforward building block like Bitcoin on aetherium we might have elected to have almost no upgrade ability all right so one last question I want to ask about a specific project is just develop block one clearly this was a token team that somehow did things right block one or more depending on your perspective I don't know if rightness the exact word but anyway black one raised 4.1 billion dollars in an ICO and they only had to pay the SEC a penalty of twenty four million dollars for conducting and unregistered securities offering so what is it that block one did right I think they told a really good story and and narrative is really important when you know building a community you got to get the community excited about about the journey that they're gonna go on with the the product that they're using so if they did anything right I think if they told a really good story about some community owned platform and they got the community excited about buying into own a piece of it now that doesn't mean that the the platform itself the technology is is you know the best or the winning one but but I think they did a good job of galvanizing community interests and getting the community to buy in I would argue that you know today you you can take the narrative piece go build the best technology or the best product and then give the community ownership once you've demonstrated that the product is in fact some best-in-class and the community is getting real utility out of it I'll take the opposite view real quick I don't know if they you know did anything right because I measure what's right by usage and adoption so I think you know time will be a true test to judge whether they did things right by building a blockchain that is a platform for lots of new applications and usage and it's possible they did do things right it's possible it becomes an extremely successful blockchain and it's possible that goes nowhere I think you know we have to reserve judgment for probably a few more years yeah yeah clearly when I said right I meant because I think most people were shocked at how small the penalty was compared to how large their by cos alright well so going forward what trends or experiments are you guys watching in terms of how teams decentralize and are there any particular projects or strategies that are intriguing to you I think um so at layer one I think that the solo team just launched main net recently and I think they've done a really good job of progressive progressively decentralizing their community and their product they you know they have a core team that built a layer one blockchain and then they they recently ran a sort of test net incentivized test net program where validators who run will run the layer one blockchain could register to participate and to earn earn tokens at the point that the main that actually launched so I think that's that's a good example of you know build the technology build the product that people want build a community around the product namely the validators in this case and demonstrate that the validators can actually stand up the network through a test net and once you've done that and demonstrated the testaments running then you move to main net and effectuate the distribution of ownership through tokens to the validators that actually are running the network and and so that all that just happened and I think it was it was executed on really really well and so now of course the next step is to see beyond the validator community can you get a community of developers building on top of the platform so I'm actively watching to see what happens there robbery well I'm excited by the pace of education around governance increasing exponentially I think teams are getting a lot faster at decentralizing I think they're also getting to the process of you know giving tokens to users directly more rapidly I've seen a number of dphi projects in the past couple weeks embrace the idea of distributing tokens to users through their protocol and I think we're gonna see more and more projects you know run by the community in a shorter amount of time you know I don't want to say we've done a poor job but it took compound three years to get to the point of legitimate decentralization and I think a lot of other teams are gonna be able to stand on the shoulders of giants and get there a lot faster you know having seen what works and what doesn't work ingredient yeah one thing I would add to that is I think this phenomena is likely going to play out across many more verticals so of course it's happening in in defy today and compound sort of pioneering the best practices but but I do tend to think that this phenomenon of community ownership and can control over you know internet products and services is going to play out more horizontally so it probably starts with you know more technical communities the communities that Bitcoin and atheria more are largely technical communities I think you could argue that still today defy its its its technical technical folks and financially oriented folks that are maybe sort of more quantitative driven but but over time we may start to see this play out in more consumer facing marketplaces for example you know why isn't it the case that that hosts on Airbnb or drivers and uber can't own the platform or own a piece of the platform and have a say in how it evolves you know crypto tokens I think make it way easier to distribute value very granularly to users of Internet platforms and services at internet scale and and so I do think that this phenomenon is going to play out you know beyond just technical crypto communities but but eventually across all sort of consumer marketplaces and so that's that's sort of the exciting thesis on where all this goes yeah we'll have to regroup in a few years and see if that turned out to be the case all right well it's been great having you both on the show thanks
