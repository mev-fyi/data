owners of board apes crypto punks me bits and other nfts should know here to discuss are stewart levy partner and co-head of technology transaction and intellectual property group at skatin arps and marta belcher general counsel at protocol labs and chair of the final coin foundation welcome stuart and marta thanks laura great to be here so let's just start talking about how yuga labs the creators of board apes recently acquired crypto punks and me bits from their creators larva labs at that time it was really big news and seen as a victory for the model in which the creators give some of the intellectual property rights to the buyers of those nfts however stewart you reached out to me to say that you felt that there are actually a lot of misconceptions over what rights the owners of these nfts actually have so that's the premise for the show but before we actually dive into that story and this full topic let's just make sure everybody understands all the definitions so let's just go over terms like trademark and copyright commercial rights etc so um just between the two of you why don't you just explain what are the different kinds of intellectual property rights that are or could be associated with nfts marta do you want to take that or do you want me to uh you can go first and then i will follow up on that okay um so there are a couple of different rights that um percolate around nfts so the most commonly discussed and probably the most important prevalent is copyright um copyright is a body of law that protects works of authorship it includes visual images moving images um text music content like that um so that's one category so you can imagine how in nft piece of digital art piece of music a video clip all comes under the rubric of copyright law but but closely related to that in the world of intellectual property and nfts is trademarks and trademarks is a as its name implies through a mark that indicates a source of origin so nike uh well-known trade markets you see a brand name and you associate it with the originator of those goods or services so that's um trademark law the other piece that um doesn't come up with every nft but it's important to keep in mind particularly particularly if you're doing anything with celebrities or athletes or personalities is rights of publicity um that attach to that um just being able to use someone's name image likeness is a right that you need to get but i think for the main when we talk about nfts we're mostly talking about copyrights and as we'll talk about today trademark rights as well and i would add to that um a couple things i would add to that i thought that was exactly right stu and i think um a couple things that are of interest to nft creators and nft holders um one thing is that you get a copyright in a work automatically so if you scribble down a doodle uh you will automatically have a copyright in that work you can go register a copyright and you'll get some additional uh sort of um protections but anyone who's created a work will automatically have a copyright in that work um and those copyrights those rights that copyright in that work um those rights can be transferred to others so if you have a copyright in a work you can using a contract uh transfer those intellectual property rights to someone else um or you can also license that work to others so what you can do is you can say well you know so and so can use my work uh in the following way but not this other way um and that's all governed by contract law so that's really just whatever you write you and the other party agree to um you can transfer rights or give others rights in your work that way um and that's a really important piece that comes into play when you're thinking about nfts and copyright okay so now let's talk about the back story to the recent board ape slash hugo lab news which sparked this episode before before the most recent acquisition we had kind of seen this evolution in the way um nfts and their intellectual property rights have evolved with you know starting with nba top shot and like kind of some of these other projects that have come out so why don't you just talk about that evolution and how different crypto projects have treated or different nft projects have treated this issue um yeah alerts it's a great question so um i feel sometimes uh if you're at a law firm you're almost like the canary in the coal mine because you see um you know everything that people are thinking about projects that are happening from a lot of different vantage points a lot of different kinds of clients so we see a wide range of different projects but what's been interesting over the past you know call it year to 18 months or so which i feel like is an nft time but feels like you know decades and uh or much longer but it's been really not that that long there's been this really interesting evolution in how people perceive what commercial rights they should get or intellectual property rights in connection with the nfts they purchase um so what i mean by that is you know you alluded to nba top shots and that's still the model for a lot of um what i sort of look at is iconic brand type nfts which is when i buy the nft i own the nft itself but i just have a limited license to the intellectual property to the graphic to the video to whatever it might be that's the nft that gets displayed and most of the terms of use say pretty clearly you have no commercial rights so i have the right to display it i have the right show to my friends um i have the right to display it in order that i can sell it but they're pretty clear that i have no commercial rights to that as well and that existed again in nft time for just for just a few months but then as projects started to come out especially the profile picture projects but some other projects there was this groundswell within the community you know a term we often use in the nft space to find that as you will um are people saying well i don't know i feel like i'm part of the project the whole idea was we're building community here that's the whole idea of web 3 of decentralization if you hold all the intellectual property rights at the the issuer or mentor the nft you're not building community i should therefore have some commercial rights with the nft that i purchased and we now see a trend so i think there's a couple of different streams out there so one stream is the stream that's always existed which is you don't get any of those rights you just get the personal enjoyment right but there's definitely this stream that's evolved by providing the owner of the nft with some type of commercial rights and where it gets really tricky and this is you know part what spurred this podcast is people lump together people look at it as very binary i either have no commercial rights or i can do it whatever i want and the second category is dramatically more complicated than sometimes people um who describe this space talk about so that can range from um you've got full commercial rights but no right to use the name of the project when you use your nft so um we'll get back to board apes in a second but you know that's a model um so i can put the picture of the nft on a t-shirt but i can't put the name of the nft project on the t-shirt um some commercial rights limit how much you can um spend or how much you can earn sorry on an nft um and i think punk 6529 when he was on your podcast made the really good point that it's not even clear how that model works unless you're really just doing something for a few friends you know no one sets out to build a commercial enterprise thinking i'm only going to make this much money and even if you have that in mind what if all of a sudden i don't know you're doing notepads or you know or physical trading cards and all of a sudden it becomes the hottest thing you know how do you shut it off because your commercial rights only allow you to make a certain amount of money but that's that's an interesting issue in and of itself um but then there's some that just limit what kind of commercial rights you have maybe it's physical merchandise but you can't do an animated series or maybe you can do certain kinds of um physical works physical objects but not others so the commercial rights are really complicated and really get down into what that license grant is within the commercial rights and then we have to get into the whole morass of where does that license even appear and how does it even apply to you but at the main there's this evolution again from no commercial rights to commercial rights um but what that means is really complicated and marta did you want to add anything on that sure yeah absolutely so i think just to really underscore what stu said there there's really a lot of misunderstanding about what you're buying when you're buying an nft um and really the headline here is that ownership of an nft is not the same thing as ownership of the copyright in that nft so you certainly can transfer ownership of the copyright to an image along with an nft but you don't necessarily need to do so um similarly when you buy a copy of a book that doesn't necessarily mean that you've gotten the copyright to the book itself right um and so what you're buying when you buy an nft is sort of to be to put it um pretty simply is that you're being publicly associated with a particular file that's recorded on a particular ledger right and so along with that as stu is saying you can get certain ip rights um and that's really entirely dependent on the contract that goes along with that nft so um often in that will be in the terms and conditions of the platform where you actually bought the nft so i guess to put it another way um when you buy an nft you're getting a token that shows ownership of a digital asset that's reported on a ledger um and then you're also getting any other rights that are explicitly given to you um in the terms and conditions of that platform or in whatever other contract you effectively have entered into with the creator of the image that is associated with an nft so if the terms and conditions of a platform say that the seller transfers the copyright to a particular image to the buyer um and you know if the buyer and the seller agree to those terms and conditions then the copyright will be transferred to the buyer but if the terms and conditions say that the buyer gets a license to display the image only in certain circumstances um but the copyright in that image doesn't transfer to the buyer then then that's what the buyer gets and that's what stu is talking about with all these different ways that you can be licensed to um to you know all these different things that you can be licensed to do um you know it's not just either you have the copyright transfer to you or you don't as as soo saying it's not binary you also um could have very specific rights that are laid out in a contract um so just to give you an example you know laura you asked about sort of how this has evolved over time right and so you know sinking back to you know some of the earliest super popular nfts um that were i think in many ways ahead of their time crypto kitties right so crypto kitties if you buy a particular cryptokitty um you don't actually get the copyright um to you don't own the copyright in that image of that cryptokitty um but you actually do get a license to use it in certain ways so you can display it on social media and you can even use it in certain commercial ways but only for commercial purposes that net up to a hundred thousand dollars per year um and so you can see it's highly specific um what rights you're getting and it's entirely dependent on on the contract um and uh you know i think that gets particularly important when you're talking about things like um you know nba top shots right which was uh you know extremely popular uh in the middle of last year is uh if you're the nba you want to make sure that when you're selling an nft of a particular moment that doesn't mean that you're going to be giving the rights to um someone to be able to advertise or market or sell things using that you know that moment of you know nba history um and so in fact um you know when dapper labs created nba top shots um they they limited that ability um and so um just to add on here the headline here really is uh transferring uh ownership of an nft is not the same thing as transferring ownership to any intellectual property rights and that can happen separately and is entirely governed by what you want to put in the contract so now let's talk about the recent news the acquisition by yugo labs of crypto punks and me bits so what are some of the misconceptions that you've heard that some of the uh either the owners of these nfts or just other people commenting on this acquisition um have and then how does that compare to the reality sure so this is where um a couple of different issues sort of come together um and it's really sort of a reaction to you know people say well you can do anything you know board apes you can do anything you want to without exception uh when you own one and i will say that hugo labs announced as part of the acquisition that they were um going to grant everyone the same rights but they also said they're working with their legal teams to draft new terms and conditions and are going to share those with the community so what i mean by a couple of different issues coming together so one and i alluded to this earlier is that if you go to the board ape yacht club website scroll to the bottom there's the board ape yacht club terms and conditions and that grants you full commercial rights um but is silent on whether you have any trademark rights um interestingly and importantly to remember um you know this is what mardu is also alluding to if you don't get rights granted to you and this is true for copyrights and true for trademarks you don't have them so the default is you get nothing unless someone explicitly gives them to you so saying that i have the commercial rights to use the artwork in board apes or into a lot of nft projects to do the same thing means i now have the copyright right to do that and hugo labs and the initial board apes terms and conditions very broad about the copyright piece all good so far in the mutant api club terms and conditions which is right underneath those terms and conditions same commercial rights granted looks look identical but there's an extra paragraph that says you have the right to your art enjoy it commercialize it we're not going to stop you from doing that but you don't have the right to use any of our marks including board ape yacht club mutant ape yacht club um board aid kennel club you have no rights to any of those trademarks so that means it would seem that i can use my board apes i can get together with four other board ape um owners we could put all four of our apes on a sweatshirt there's a lot of different things that we could do but there's probably good argument that i don't have the rights and again we'll see what happens with the with the new terms and conditions they might do that i might not have the right to use any of those brand names which could impact a lot the value of what i'm offering out into the marketplace like part of the appeal might be that it says you know bi bayc across the top and it's got some cool artwork on it um so that remains to be seen but at least that's that's an unknown out there so that's one one issue but the other issue is and this is the one you know we as lawyers think about all the time and we'll talk about secondary purchasers in a moment because it only gets worse there is okay well how did those rights actually get conveyed to me or not and in this area of the law as opposed to some other areas where you know we often feel as lawyers where it's square pay ground hole to try to apply legal principles to the world of you know web three here the law pretty much matches up and works which is there's a lot of case law that talks about how do you get someone in an online context to agree to terms and conditions and they're courts that have said if i click on something that says i agree you know i've read the terms and conditions click i agree um courts have said pretty consistently the the the counterparty the person using the site has agreed to their terms they can't say oh i i clicked on i agree but i didn't really agree you're pretty much agreeing to those terms but if i just put the terms and conditions somewhere on the website and don't say you have to click on them i don't even say by using this website you've agreed to these terms it's not even clear if you do that that that's good enough but just sticking terms somewhere there's a lot of cases that say you haven't created a binding agreement because the user might say wait a second i didn't have to scroll all the way down to the bottom here with all the like the fine print you know that has things about applying for a job has you know some other information about the company and realize wait buried in there is like a terms and conditions thing i'm supposed to look at and that's going to limit you know what i can and can't do so that's one issue again we're just so now about primary purchasers so that's secondary purchase in a few minutes um that's one area that commercial rights are granted not so clear in all those cases you created a binding agreement with the initial purchaser but it gets worse again if you're a if you're a lawyer an ip lawyer some of these projects grant you the rights on on discord or twitter like they literally will post out and say hey everybody you've got you know commercial rights to do what you want to um you know with our property um you could you could argue yeah well they're not going to come after me if they've said that so maybe um but you definitely haven't created any sort of you know binding legal agreement and again we'll talk about a little bit what the impact of that is um but you also might not know who posted that um we've definitely seen projects out there where someone posted that on discord or on twitter and had no authority within the company to have said that um you know they themselves didn't have the rights they themselves maybe weren't even employed like a mod and they heard that you get commercial rights and now they've said you get commercial rights so there's a lot of ways that people feel that commercial rights have been conveyed but it's being done in a very backwards way for something that conceivably will be incredibly important if people look to commercialize the rights they're getting in the future like it's hanging by a very thin thread in a lot of cases and in some cases maybe no threat at all so just to be clear so what can the the owners have board apes crypto punks and me bits nfts actually do so it would seem and i think there's some ambiguity here which is i think again why um they're probably looking to clear it up a little bit the commercial rights themselves i think you could argue are are pretty broadly stated i don't think there's any dispute about that but i think it's far less clear whether you can use you know as we sit here right now um the trademarks and names and logos of the board you know the yuga family of marx um i think there's a reasonable argument that you can't um but again it's it's pretty unclear just because the way it's been you know presented again it's just in the as of now in the mutant ape yacht club terms it's just you know a link at the bottom um we'll talk about what all what all that means for secondary purchasers but i think that's the big uncertainty out there when people say you can do whatever you want to well maybe but you know maybe with some limits so you can do whatever you want but you can't use the name board ape so you could like have a line of like t-shirts or backpacks or um i don't know snack pouches or whatever using the image of your board ape or your crypto punk but you cannot call it a boarded or a crypto punk yeah so i'll put one one tweak to that um because there's a there's an exception to that but it would probably not apply to the way you know you'd want to commercialize it what i mean by that is if i've purchased a board ape um and i want to talk about that board ape i can use that name in a descriptive sort of what trademark lawyer trademark lawyers would call it non-trademark sense in other words i'm not trying to um sort of glom on to the um the value and commercial rights of the board yacht club in yugo labs i'm just describing my board ape i'm not required to say you know my my ape that is an nft that's really popular um that looks disinterested and you know you connect the dots and realize oh you mean board ape yacht club i can describe what it is um but the idea of let's say you know doing um a set of sweatshirts and calling it the board api club sweatshirt collection um probably again as of now this is where i think it's unclear that there's a good argument that you couldn't do i would add i think i think stu is making some like made i think several really important points here um i think one really important point that stu's made is that there's a total distinction between um copyright and trademark rights um and and those are things that i think as companies you think about really differently um you know if you're a company you know so for example um everything that um uh we do is open source and we um are deeply committed to making sure that we're open sourcing you know all of our code um and you know i think you know for me personally i'm very dedicated i'm also special counsel at the electronic frontier foundation and very committed to the sort of uh coffee left world um to make thinking about making things open freely available part of the public domain available for others to use right and that's really important in a copyright context for me um when it comes to trademarks it's a little bit different trademarks are not about protecting the artist or the creator what trademarks are about is protecting consumers trademarks are about when a consumer buys a product and it's labeled with clorox they know it's from clorox right um and and they are um you know they are able to uh sort of associate the you know qualities of of a clorox product with this thing right um and so when it comes to trademark rights um even as a even as a sort of uh open source ethos um there actually isn't an important place for trademark rights and for for trademarks to be protected to make sure that people understand that when when someone says um that something originates in a particular place it actually originates from there and that's important for consumer protection um and so the fact that that a particular nft platform has super open rights with regards to what you can do when you buy an nft and you have you know gotten rights you know you've had uh contractually had rights given to you um about copyright is just totally distinct from what you can do with the trademark for that company um similarly in the open source context you'll often have um open source projects that again everything is open source they've open sourced all of their code um they're the open sources is at the core of the ethos of what they do but they'll say about their trademark um this trademark needs to uh represent that this is the authentic code from this authentic project um and so if you're gonna do if you're gonna take this code and and use it in a different way um you can use this trademark um uh only to refer to sort of the authentic project um so i think all of that is just to say that i think what stu is saying um is is really important around the distinction between how copyright is used and how trademark is used yeah that's super fascinating i i find that distinction actually really helpful that you described um so one other thing that steve mentioned before we started recording was that there are a bunch of nft creators that are trying to do the impossible where they'll say that they hold the trademark but at the same time they uh also say that people in their decentralized community can use that trademark um so stuart describe what you're seeing there and what the issue is with that yeah so um i would say it's not limited to the nft world i'd say it's an issue that is um endemic in in the web 3 world today which is that um there's from an intellectual property perspective a pretty big tension point between decentralized projects where the creators want to hold on and control the brand name and the trademark but at the same time want to freely allow anyone who wants to to use it in the ethos of web3 and here's the tension point it goes exactly to what marta was just saying the whole idea behind trademark law is that someone sees the mark and can associate with that a certain quality of good and service high end low end whatever it might be they see a trademark i'm protected because i know that brand because of that trademark law requires you to go out there and have some sort of quality control and policing of your brand in order that the consumer is protected and you know this this whole scheme kind of works if i have a trademark and say anyone can use it i run the very significant risk that i've now lost my trademark protection because i'm not protecting it as my own mark i'm letting everyone use it so there's no quality control there's no policing of the mark there's nothing everyone can use it which would be fine if you want to give up your trademark rights and just say look here's a great name but we want everyone um in in the community to be able to use this you know writ large um that's fine but if on the at the same token you say but i still kind of want to own the name for you know the founders group wants to own the name it's hard to really really hard and maybe even impossible to balance those two you have to sort of you know do one or the other it doesn't mean you can't you know broadly allow people to use it but you still have to have some some again quality control some limitations so you can protect the name again if you want to continue to own it as part of the developer group founder group um creators etc so in a moment we'll talk about some potential solutions to these issues as well as look into how the marketplaces are handling them but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible it's becoming clear

conversation with marta and stuart so i know a lot of people have actually brought up the creative commons license as a potential good option here in the nft space um why is that what what is it exactly what problems would it address and how might it resolve some of these issues yeah so um you know i think um creative commons was such a huge step forward for copyright in general um what creative commons does is it allows you to basically take any work that you've created um and again as i mentioned earlier you know anytime you even scribble down a doodle you automatically get a copyright in that work as the creator of that work um and so if you want to be able to share that work broadly with the world and you want other people to be able to do things with that work you have to contractually somehow give them the right to do that um and you have to make it clear what exactly it is that they can do with the work right so you may you may create a drawing and you may genuinely want people to be able to use it in their films or you may genuinely want people to be able to um you know remix it with other things you may genuinely want people to use it in a variety of ways um or you know for example you might take a photograph and really want that news organizations are able to use it so how did this happen sort of pre-creative commons or in a world without creative commons it has to happen on kind of an individual by individual basis um really hyper inefficient um and what creative commons lets you do is have this sort of standard set of licenses um that that sort of um you can very easily associate with a particular work um so for example when i write um you know papers um that i want to put out there i will just put a little stamp on it that says um cc creative commons and then the specific creative commons license that i want to be able to um that i want to be able to use that i want to be able to use for this particular work um and so creative commons you can go to their website and you can see they have these standardized licenses um and then so just to give you one example one is ccby ccby is uh basically you're licensing this work in a particular way but they need to give you attribution so anyone can use let's say i took a photograph anyone can use this photograph as long as they give me attribution as the photographer um and um there are a bunch of these standardized licenses and you can just pick the standardized license you want to use and clearly label your work as ccby or you know some other license that you want to use and then people know that what they can do with that work they know that they can take it and as long as you know they've given you attribution if you're using ccpy um then they can actually um you know use the work in in the ways that the license says and it's this really lovely human they're really lovely human readable versions of the contracts um and so this was a really important step forward in the sort of world of um uh i think ensuring that creativity can be shared um and that um you know when you're creating these works others can use them in a way that's that's really easy um so one of the things that's been really for me interesting in the nft space um from the beginning i've been you know i've seen the i this idea that when you transfer ownership of an nft right like let's say i've created an image and i create an nft of it um you don't have to transfer the intellectual property rights to that um to that particular image right and you can retain them and what that means is in addition to being able to retain them you can license them any way you want which includes potentially licensing it under creative commons so it's this really lovely thing because what that enables is if you're an artist you can sell an nft of your work without selling the intellectual property rights and you can make money from it and then in addition to that you can creative commons license your work and it will be out out there licensed in a way where others can use it um and and sort of part of um you know part of the creative commons right um and and so i think that creative commons has been really underutilized in this space um and you know what we've been seeing is not necessarily a lot of people using creative commons or or other similar standardized licenses um what we've been seeing is you know what we were describing earlier which is typically the what happens with nfts is it's really all governed by the terms and conditions of that particular platform the particular platform where you're buying and selling is you know will have some sort of um you know standard of what what the buyer is is selling and what the seller is buying and that's really what happened um and i really have been advocating for let's use creative comments we don't need to reinvent the wheel here um and if you're a creator how cool that you can sell an nft make money and at the same time contribute your your work um in a you know to the world in an open source way right so you know i said but i want to just add one one point to that i hate to come back to trademark law yet again but the interesting thing is that even the creative commons license which was really designed to put sort of copyrights into the public domain says within the creative commons license itself this does not give you any trademark rights or impact any trademark rights that people have and usually when people think of creative works there's not like a trademark attached to it like a brand you know it's a piece of art it's a piece of music um but with nfts as we've seen a lot of them have brands attached to them trademarks attached to them so if you see a commercial project which says this is the public domain see creative commons license you know click here to see the license and now you want to commercialize it you're left in this limbo world of yeah but can i use the name of the project as well and how lucky do i feel building potentially a big commercial enterprise to commercialize my nft sort of you know worrying as i go to sleep at night but could i use the name of the project the way i've used it i never really got the license to do that and so um marta did bring up how currently uh it's all governed by the marketplaces but i was wondering if you've been suggesting creative commons have other people um been interested in that have you seen any nft projects go that way or or at least discuss it so what i've seen is um there have been a bunch of different um efforts at creating a sort of standardized nft license so sort of like recreating the wheel here where they're sort of trying to create an uh nft specific almost version of creative commons um and so there have been a bunch of these efforts um you know some examples um dapper labs created um the and the nft license um there was a wearable nft license um there was um a project called the nft license project um there is a license agreement called the nft art licensing agreement um babies on creative commons none of these are from creative commons no these are all these are all basically attempts at create solving the same problem that creative commons is trying to solve right so you know you have um uh this problem of we want a really easy way to convey a set of rights um and and so there have been a bunch of nft people in the nft space you know either the platforms themselves or other stakeholders who basically are saying we need a standardized license for nfts right that we can use and so what i the ones i just listed are all um sort of platforms or stakeholders who are trying to create um standardized licenses for nfts that can be used and and you know i think i think the vision there is very similar to creative the creative commons vision which is this idea that there's some standard license everyone uses it you know there may be particular um different types of licenses i will say one thing that i think has been um under appreciated about um so you know i think all of these are awesome efforts the all of these efforts to create standardized licenses for nfts will go a really long way in making sure that um there's a lot less confusion in the space in the future if any of these get sort of broadly adopted um one thing i think these licenses have done have not really thought through fully is how um how important it is for a license to have many different options and to be kind of modular right so the thing that's so cool about creative commons is it's not like there's one creative commons license and you're out there and you say um you know uh i'm i'm licensing this under creative commons period end stop and that you know that's just the license there are many creative commons licenses and when you license a work you say i'm licensing this under this particular creative commons license so the example i gave was ccby i can just stick licensed under ccby you know or just there's a little creative commons image i could just stick on my work and everyone knows you okay you're using the specific attribution license and they can go to the creative commons website and see exactly what that license is and so that i think is what's been missing um or something that i think the licenses in this space should really try to adopt in the future if they're going to be widely adopted and used so um so i think that brings us um to probably the biggest um issue that's lurking out in the world of nfts and and contractual rights today which is so far what we've been focusing on is the primary purchaser so i go um there's a drop i go i go to a website i buy the nft maybe i've clicked on i agree to these terms and conditions you know they're put in front of my face in order to be able to mint or or secure my nft now the nft enters the resale market and the big big missing link in nfts today and something that you know every major rights holder is talking about is how does that initial license grant travel with the nft and today um you know using terminology our engineering friends would use every solution is sub-optimal at best so you know to talk through with some of the solutions out there we're seeing and again none of these really really work so one solution is and you see some of the major rights holders with iconic incredibly valuable intellectual property doing is their nfts are only available within a walled garden the nft cannot be moved to your own custodial wallet not considerably a wallet off chain anywhere else because and this is one of the principal reasons they're doing this they're very concerned about this issue that they're right they never want their ip out there without someone having seen and agreed to a license and so they know if they're within a walled garden ecosystem um the buyers and sellers had to click on i agree to these license terms when they get the nft it's definitely the safest approach one could argue but that's not consistent with the web through ethos because now we've just created these centralized little islands of where you can get nfts but the fact that there are they're so prevalent i think shows you you know why that's such a big issue so that's solution one um solution two is you go to the different marketplaces and say look you can list my nft but if you're going to list my nft um you need to provide some sort of link to my license terms so that the downstream purchasers on your in your marketplace um are presented with these so two problems with that again everything's sub-optimal it means going in every marketplace i mean you'll never get to all of them um because if you know your nft goes from wallet to wallet to wallet you'll never you'll always be chasing it um and a lot of these marketplaces are not set up to do customized you know sort of treatment that way so again i could easily buy an nft and not realize that there's um terms and conditions out there another solution we've heard is we'll put the link to the terms and conditions and the metadata of the nft so it's there so when i buy the nft the metadata said hey when you bought this nft it's subject to these terms and conditions that sounds sort of interesting in theory but no one's looking at the metadata like a lot of engineers i'm sure even buying nfts are not going to study the metadata and remember those you know cases i talked about from earlier courts say if you're going to get someone to agree to something you've got to put it in front of them have a you know reasonable likelihood they've seen it and that they've somehow manifested ascent to that the fact that it's buried somewhere in the metadata unlikely to solve the problem same issue for we've heard that some people want to put the entire license terms in the metadata let's put aside the logistics of doing that the cost of doing that it's the same thing no one's you know going to be looking at the metadata um in order to do that another solution out there again all these sort of sub-optimal is you know most marketplaces do suck in some of the metadata when they list an nft so you could have a solution where you put the language that says i agree to these terms and conditions you know click here to see them and that will always get sucked into the presentation page uh for the nft project and that could work except a in every marketplace works a little bit differently pulls in different metadata again you have the issue of having to always you know chase um chase the you know the platforms and the marketplaces to do that so nothing works well and a lot of people are buying um nfts out there in fact almost maybe in just about every case except these wall gardens where they're not seeing the underlying terms and conditions and just to finish up on on one point so the risk you run is so now i want to commercialize my nft i go to a streaming service and i want to do you know an animated series or something with these nfts you know all of these um distributors licensees they're all very big on rights clearance and they're going to say to you okay so show me where you got the rights to use these nft characters in this project and saying well okay when i got the nft you know there was nothing but you know there's a twitter post that says you know all commercial rights are fine and that's just not going to do it for you know in a lot of distribution methods but finally taking a much more important point imagine if the nft tied to a real world experience and when i bought the nft the terms and conditions said you have to be over 18 to claim it you can you know you have to live in the continental united states you know whatever the terms and conditions might be if that license doesn't travel those terms don't travel with the nft the downstream purchaser is buying an nft not knowing that all those terms attached to the nft they just purchased so it's a huge issue out there they're definitely people working towards technology solutions but as we sit here right now it's almost like you know there's a missing rail on the track of you know nft commercialization and this is it and it's a really big one so i think stu is oh go ahead oh sorry laura do you want to um no go ahead jump in there yeah i think so i think stu is is touching on two points that are um so super important um and really key to clearing up a lot of the confusion in this space and i think everything stu said about this problem of how do you have the right to travel with an nft from both a licensing legal perspective but also from a technical perspective um is is super super super important stuff um and you know um i thought student an awesome job talking through um various different ways that you can accomplish that but really being able to associate the licensing terms directly um into you know a particular work and being able to achieve that is i think absolutely key one of the things that's going to make that from a legal perspective super easy and lightweight is is to have really standardized licenses right for it to be really easy to say um this is uh ccby right licensed and to just be able to put that into the metadata or in some other way um you know maybe record it on the ledger right record that it's ccpy on the ledger like but having that that quickly accessible standard is gonna make this much much easier um just to give you sort of uh an anecdote on that so my um my boyfriend took a picture when he was in law school of a gavel and he put it up on flickr and he just put this is you know flickr makes it really easy to say how is this licensed and they say well it's ccb he said it's ccby licensed meaning you know it's a creative commons license as long as you give me attribution um and that photo so i have um uh i have a i i made the mistake of setting up a google alert for his his name ones and i suddenly just inundated this photo is all across the web because with his name um because um he ccpy licensed it it was really easy for journalists who are writing a story about some legal thing to go into flickr and and search for things that you know check the box is that how is this licensed ccpy licensed and search for gavel and again this you know gavel comes up and it's on you know this unbelievable range of stories across the internet of uh about of of you know about legal things so the headlines are all like atrocious and like i immediately turned off the google search uh the google alert right um but just just sort of giving you an anecdote about why being able to license something in a way that is really um really clear um and is attached to the metadata of a particular um of a particular you know in this case photograph but you know any kind of image or file um why that's so important and why that actually is so enabling um and the other thing that i think stu said that was really um important here is you know this idea of okay you need to if you're if you're getting an intellectual property light right you know regardless of what you do with it you want to know that you really have the rights you think you have um and this is a problem um in in in many ways because you know one of them is okay well how do i know that the person who minted the nft had the rights that they are allegedly giving to me and were were authorized to give me the like the rights that they are allegedly giving to me right um and and being able to follow that sort of chain of title effectively of the um of the intellectual property as it changes hands and being able to verify like yes this person was the uh creator of the image that was the nft yes they you know used this particular license to give it to um this person on this platform and then that person sold it to this person and being able to see that chain of title is something that's sort of uh you know one of the things that people talk about is so so so cool about you know being able to use blockchains right um and so i i have a lot of hope that we're gonna be able to um figure out technological and legal solutions to make that really clear um but i do think that this is one area this is another reason that it's so important that we have these modular and clear licenses um and we don't have to every time we see a you know chain of title passing hands we don't have to literally go read the terms and conditions of each platform where the where where it uh changed hands to see how those rights changed hands and and frankly we would be lucky if if they're interoperable right um so you know also also a plug for ensuring the interoperability of these standardized licenses so that if you change hands on platform a and then the buyer sells it on platform b that you can you can follow those rights across um platforms um so why this is so important yeah i uh may have been one of those journalists that did such a search uh that resulted in your boyfriend's image being used because i i have saved on my computer different uh creative commons licensed searches on flickr and other sites because i used to use these images all the time um but one thing i wanted to ask so you know we've been talking about how the terms and conditions of the different marketplaces are really important um at the moment do you see that the the platforms are trying to converge on something that's standardized or is it just all over the map like i don't know if you want to talk about what you're seeing on like openc or super rare or any of these platforms but like do you feel they're kind of trying to get things um in a you know bring things to a better place or do you just see that there's not much movement so it's a great question i think it's really important to distinguish between the terms and conditions of the platform and the terms and conditions of the project nft is being sold on the platform so all the platforms have their own terms and conditions but they govern your interaction with that platform so openc has you know the openc terms and conditions but that relates to buying and selling on openc and what happens if there's an issue and you know what you can and can't do um that's separate apart from the terms and conditions that an individual nft project might have um which says for example you can sell commercial merchandise but only up to a hundred thousand dollars how do i even know that you know if i'm buying something on openc in fact in our group we did this uh study where we looked at a variety of different things we've done this deep dive into commercial rights on a lot of different popular nft projects and at least for the ones we looked at not a single one when you go to openc to buy it and it's not the fault of opencv but when you go to openc to buy one never would you know that there's commercial terms attached to that nft again separate from you know the commercial terms you have just dealing with opencs platform yeah i think i think um everything's doing is exactly right i think the platforms um and i think also the projects are doing a really good job of trying to converge on some sort of standard um so you know i mentioned the nft license of dapper labs um you know that's something that's been relatively um i think widespread uh has had relatively widespread adoption um and and so that you know there definitely have and there have been you know i mentioned a couple of others wearable and the nftr licensing agreement and the nft license project so this is definitely something where there are there's a lot of work in this space and a lot of it is really excellent work um and um i will say um you know like there's a little asterisk on that um there's this xkcd and it's like uh there are you know it's like someone who's saying like well there are 14 you know competing standards and we really need to develop one universal standard that covers everything and then it says so there are now 15 competing standards right so you know i think that's like there is definitely this um you know i like it it's it's sort of this funny thing because i'm you know advocating for you know well we need the universal standard um and like i think each of these projects is like yes we are the universal standard right um and you know that problem has been i think solved in the you know by creative commons like in the sort of general um uh copyright arena previously and and really was like it really is like the the one standard for copyright licensing um but i think what we're seeing right now is a bunch of projects a bunch of projects coming together saying well we're gonna be the standard um you know we're gonna we're gonna solve this problem so um i think a lot of great work is happening but i i um i definitely definitely uh continue to advocate for uh use of the already existing standard i.e creative commons yeah but it seems to me that one additional problem is not just what the what the standard is but then making sure that that sooner travels every time there's a resale is that right so like do you what do you think are good technological because i imagine that probably is a technological solution so what do you think could resolve that yeah i don't i don't know um what the best technology solution is i mean there's there's two models that we've seen out there i'm sure there are many more that you know we're just not seeing quite yet um one is um that the nft itself is coded in a way so that it um the smart contract sort of brings in another nft that's the legal contract that the original issuer minted and you can't access the content of the nft you want the digital work of the nft you want without that legal contract nft sort of popping up and you signing it you know with your metamask wallet or whatever and agreeing to it and then you can access the nft so that's you know one let's say flavor solution out there that there's something like that um the other flavor solution is to do something with the metadata and try to standardize that in a way so that every time um the nft appears that metadata comes up you know even it's two lines that says by purchasing this nft you agree to the following terms um you know not ideal in terms of that being binding but you're probably you know within the area of feeling more comfortable that you created a binding agreement but that's another stream to do something with the metadata in a universal standardized fashion and hope that gets widespread pickup all right well so uh as we discussed earlier you collapse will be releasing updated terms and conditions is there anything in particular that you're looking for there and in general like what kind of new developments or um new trends are you going to be watching out for over the next few months or years as this plays out why are you going to go first oh no i'll use two okay um so i think the the most interesting um development again you know in nft time over the last few months has been um you know i think there are projects out there that really feel like i just created something i want everyone to enjoy it use it the community to run with it and i'm just going to go walk away and do something else um but i think you know there are a lot of and we see this you know every day in our practice a lot of really creative people out there doing really interesting creative and innovative things and in some cases you know all of a sudden realizing what they've developed and how valuable that is and i think there's this tension between openness let everyone use it and well i thought the whole part you know part of the world of nfts was empowering the creative community so now i've created this incredible creative work i should be able to benefit from it even though i'm not a household name entertainment company and i don't want to just give it out into the world and let everyone use it i want to monetize that i want to finally be able to benefit from my art the way i've wanted to for many years so i think there's this tension we're gonna see over the next couple years between projects that are torn between a very vocal community saying you should give us the rights to what we purchased and the creators of that work who are well i'll give you some rights but i kind of developed this and built this and i want to see what i can do with it and run with this and monetize it for my own benefit and and i think that's that's coming fast i think that's going to be an interesting issue um to evolve it'll be interesting to see how hugo labs um you know walks that line i think they're in a very good way trying to sort of be in both camps but it's going to take some maneuvering i think to stay down that sort of middle path i would add i think um i think one of the things that is so cool about nfts is that it gives you know artists and creators the ability to monetize their work while also offering the underlying work intellectual property rights you know up to the world in a way that is you know open and allows others to use the work in in their own creative works right um and to use the works in all sorts of ways you know it's not that you have to um you can only monetize your work if you are um you know either selling physical copies of it or or if you are literally like selling the ip rights or licensing the ip writes you can actually creative commons license something in a really open way and then at the same time sell an nft of it and and monetize it um you know as long as those two things are not um uh you know in conflict and and one of the cool things about the fact that selling an nft has actually nothing to do with selling vip to that you know underlying file is that you can you can do both of those things simultaneously you can monetize your work while also um licensing it openly um which is one of the things that i'm so excited about in this space all right well this has been an absolutely fascinating conversation hopefully some of the different nft owners um that maybe had some of those misconceptions that we talked about earlier in the show now have clarity or at least know what questions to ask of the lawyers in their lives um obviously nothing here is legal advice without knowing your personal situation um but this has been so looming thank you both so much where can people learn more about each of you and your work marta why don't you go first um yes um so um uh i you can learn about me i guess on um i i have a twitter i tweet a lot um and um i think one of the things what's the handoff what was that sorry laura what's your handle i'm at marta belcher um on on twitter and uh definitely uh i'm definitely tweeting a lot about this topic um one of the things i didn't mention is that a very large percentage of nfts are stored on ipfs which is one of the technologies that i work on um so thinking a lot about this and uh working on on these issues uh a lot and uh definitely uh excited to be uh be uh here talking to you about it laura and laura thanks also for me for your for your time this is a great conversation thanks marta um yeah i think the scaden website uh where uh we post a lot of things that we've um written in this space that's probably the best way to get information about me and sort of what we're thinking about um in this area and we consider we continue to think about it and write about it as we see uh issues popping up all the time perfect well thank you both so much for coming on unchained thank you thanks so much for having me thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about stewart marta and intellectual property rights of nfts check out the show notes for this episode unchained is produced by me laura shin with help from anthony yoon daniel ness mark murdock shashank and clk transcription thanks for listening
