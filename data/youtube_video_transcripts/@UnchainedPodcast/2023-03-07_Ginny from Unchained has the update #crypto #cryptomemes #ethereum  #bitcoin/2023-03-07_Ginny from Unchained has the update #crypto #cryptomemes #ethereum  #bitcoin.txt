as shares fell at other 10 on Monday it looks like silvergate might be headed towards the Pearly Gates or um the other one this follows a string of drops leaving silvergate's stock price down nearly 94 from this time last year I don't know how much you know about math but 94 is most of the percents so here's what happened on Wednesday they told investors that they needed to delay the filing of their annual report and that's a big deal okay this isn't like when I pay my taxes in October like we're talking about significantly more than 26 dollars we also revealed a one billion dollar loss in Q4 do you know what's cooler than a one billion dollar loss almost anything that's a huge amount of money to lose even worse customers like coinbase Circle and Gemini have cut ties with silvergate you know how bad things have to be when Gemini thinks they can do better don't forget also revealed that they're facing investigations from a number of entities although that's nothing new like if you're a crypto company and you're not currently being investigated by the SEC I have bad news for you you're not trading crypto you're probably trading one coin
