not a dividend It's A Tale of Two fun now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet generally speaking airdrops are kind of pointless anyways um I named trading firms who are very involved I like to eat the ultimate D5 Protocols are the antidote to this problem okay great all right let's go ahead and do this hello everybody Welcome to The Chopping Block every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry Insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day so quick intros first we've got Tom the D5 Maven and master of memes next we've got Robert the crypto connoisseur and Captain compound then we've got to ruin the Giga brain and Grand Puba at Gauntlet and then today we've got a special guest Jake travinsky Juris Prudential Juggernaut at the blockchain association and then you got myself obviously that have made a dragonfly Juris Prudential Juggernaut that's your best one I I really like that I was wondering what I was gonna get and I'm very pleased so thanks for that but let me let me read the description we're early stage investors in crypto but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice legal advice or even life advice please see chopping block to XYZ for more disclosures Jake it has been a pretty awful week and I'm really glad that you are here to talk us through it let's jump into it because I think there's a lot that we're going to be discussing today so let me first start with a broad summary and then we're going to go through these individual cases one at a time to get a better understanding of them so it was yesterday so today we're live streaming this on on Tuesday June June 6th um yesterday the SEC dropped a mammoth lawsuit against binance basically claiming that binance was engaged in a web of deception to evade U.S laws but particularly calling out binance us as well as other stuff that was going on on binance global which we're already aware of from the cfdc lawsuit so that that was yesterday and yesterday it ended up spooking markets and causing a lot of consternation about okay crap this happened to binance what does this mean for the rest of the industry as well as of course coinbase uh well today we just saw the lawsuit drop for coinbase basically mirroring a lot of the claims that were made against binance stating that coinbase running in unregistered exchange clearing agency and broker doing what stuff they're not supposed to be doing uh without appropriate registrations and licenses and then lastly they also stated that I think it's upwards of 12 tokens that they've stated over the last two days are securities among those tokens include Solana cardano near protocol axi Infinity Mana basically at this point almost everything in the top 10 besides Bitcoin ether particular stable coins including uh tether and USC are have not been Naval Securities um and Dogecoin and Litecoin are the only things in the top ten that have not been labeled securities as of the last two days so this is a massive shot across the Bow by the SEC obviously they were telegraphing some of this before but at this point we have the full frontal assault on the crypto industry and just today in a statement on CNBC uh genzer stated that the following sentence we don't need more digital currency we already have digital currency it's called the US dollar it's called the Euro it's called the Yen they're all digital now and then lastly he said cryptos built a field encrypted as a Field built on non-compliance with U.S Securities laws so let's start with the binance case because that's that's where we were yesterday um because it's the meatiest one and it's the one that also is most in Wisconsin claims of fraud so the claim is not just that hey binance is running an unregistered exchange uh it Bynes is doing all sorts of unsavory and illegal things Jake are you able to kind of walk us through what were the most important pieces from this lawsuit that the cftc filed against Finance yesterday yeah happy to do that um I I guess I'll start with my disclaimer which is I'm a lawyer but I'm not your lawyer and nothing I say here is intended as legal advice so if you have any questions about your own your own legal plans definitely go get your own lawyer and don't do or not do anything just because I say so here um I guess let me start with some sort of high level takes on what the SEC did yesterday with finance and then we can get into some of the details if you want from a high level as a matter of law there wasn't a lot that we saw in the complaint yesterday that was a surprise there were a couple things for my I would say a policy perspective and a factual perspective that we learned about how the SEC is approaching crypto and also about what was going on at binance and especially binance us that was a bit new but from a legal perspective we already knew basically everything the SEC said in the complaints yesterday against binance we knew that the SEC thinks that basically every single token in existence other than Bitcoin is a security and they named yet another group of tokens in the complaint that they said are securities we knew that they thought that staking programs right programs that offer some yield to users are securities we saw that in a settlement the SEC standard with Kraken a couple of months ago so we see that again in the binance complaint um we see I think somewhat oddly that the SEC thinks that busd a stablecoin is also a security we found that out when paxos revealed that they had gotten a Wells notice without allegation and yet again we see and is complaint against binance uh that the SEC claims that the USD is indeed a security so we didn't really learn a whole lot new about the sec's theories on the application of the Securities laws to crypto that are relevant for the broader industry I think the two things that we did learn that are quite new are number one the SEC as a matter of policy has decided that they're not playing around anymore right they are not trying to regulate this industry by enforcement which is what they've seemed to be doing for the last I would say four or five years they're trying to ban this industry by enforcement right they are not trying to leave any room for there to be a crypto exchange like binance or like coinbase that can offer services to us persons outside of trading Bitcoin and maybe trading ether although that's sort of up in the air as well so I think that you know the uh the gloves are off so to speak and the SEC has decided that they really are coming after the whole industry a sad situation but I think pretty clear and the statements that chair counselor made on TV that you men mentioned I think you know go to show that exact same thing the second thing that we learned is really very specific to binance and frankly it's reminiscent in some ways of the allegations that we heard against FTX and I'll I'll stop here for a moment just to say these are allegations they are not proven they're just things that the SEC thinks are true that they were willing to write down in a complaint to file in federal courts but always we should presume innocence and binance will certainly show up to have its day in court to contest those allegations but we saw allegations in that complaint of things like binance claiming that there was standards to prevent Market manipulation on binance us that actually did not exist that was the the nature of the fraud claim that was made that they were potentially engaged in watch trading through a related Market making firm that CSU is operating that sort of seems a little bit like Alameda that the alleged distinction between binance.com the international entity and binance us which was supposedly being run totally separately was actually under cz's control much like we heard that um FTX us was potentially being controlled in some way by Sam bankmanfried and also that it's not totally clear where customers assets are which really is I think a pretty significant uh issue so there's sort of a mix of these outlandish legal theories that the SEC has been advancing in the context of Finance with some potentially really serious stuff that I think is is worth exploring further in so it feels to me like um there's a lot of stuff in here that is old news we learned a lot of this from the cftc lawsuit against binance a while back and so the SEC kind of retreading and giving some more evidence and more uh testimony from Individual officers at finance that corroborate some of these things the the big things that were surprising to me so one was the the amount of wash rating on finance us that was surprising to me um binance us was posting like moderately good volumes um but not like you know when you when you go in corn market cap and you see the fake exchanges that you know it's like you know number two exchanges like mexc and it says it does three billion in volume a day you're like that's that's not true like obviously not um binance us was never posting those kinds of volumes I was like okay what if you're going to watch straight like why not watch straight your way to like you know unseat coinbase but I guess they were I don't know they were they were reasonable about it which I guess is good the other thing I mean I I don't think anybody reasonably sized wash trading reason I thought it was very recently sizable [Laughter] I I was um I feel like I was not surprised that cze still you know uh wielded all this control over Finance us I feel like anybody who knows CZ or Highway operates would not have been surprised by that and the fact that you know all these Executives kept leaving yeah I I don't think anybody who really understood what was going on there had had an idea that they were totally separated well speaking of um officers that kept leaving um I think when the CTC complaint came out um they had screenshots or records of like czs or some internal signal chat and you were like how did they get these because assumingly they did not break signal um and then this complaint they say like two former CEOs of one answer that's or bam trading you know or we're cooperating and so so presumably like that was kind of how this whole thing uh came to how a lot of those internal chats uh uh came to the SEC yeah I'd want to see the time stamps because some of that stuff was clearly before they entered the U.S market um because they were talking because this is like the Tai Chi plan which was basically this this was leaked like in 2020 I think uh through CNBC which was binance's plan to basically create binance us as sort of this buffer state to prevent them from a sort of distract and prevent the SEC and other US Agencies from going after binance directly but instead you know using it as a sort of corporate shield from from any kind of U.S enforcement against the the main binance.com obviously once that leaks it looks really bad for you we did solve the mystery of where Catherine Coley disappeared right now where we don't know where to we do know who she was talking to yeah well yes yes well no I think I think she's back so it's like totally it's it's seems like she's definitely glad to hear that well there was a there were all these like theories right on the internet people were just like she disappeared no one no one has seen her in months it's good to know that this strategy of like hiring very respectable and and um government-facing folks who are white and and basically using them as puppets doesn't work like it totally doesn't work in this case I'm sure CZ regrets having put any of these people in charge of binance us because obviously they're they're they're the people who are feeding all this information to uh the SEC and I'm sure they're probably cooperating with the goj as well in whatever investigation they're doing I mean you know a a thing of speculation that I always think about it's like what do you think the interview process was for that job like can you imagine the interviews for dates afterwards gotta have had some very funny questions I can I can imagine I I feel I feel bad for both of them because I can imagine it looked like an amazing job if I could Finance the dominant Exchange in the world is looking to go clean and launch something in the US you know everybody has whatever pet complaint about coinbase and so it's like oh yes this is the I and I can be at the helm of this and we're going to create the most regulated exchange and blah blah blah and I'm sure CZ told them all the right things until it's actually time to show up for work and it's like hey you don't have control over anything you don't have the wallets you don't have any of the software you can't even directly interact with customer accounts like the level of control that binance.com is alleged to have held over binance us operations is just it's crazy like basically they were they had control over almost nothing this is sort of an important point though and not just for Catherine Coley and for Brian Brooks who you know the complaint says band ceoa and Bam CEO B like we don't know who these people are which is always a bit amusing but I think this is an important point that from the outside there is nothing wrong with this type of corporate structure where you say I'm gonna have an offshore Exchange in some jurisdiction which will offer services only to non-us persons income compliance with all the jurisdictions where I offer those services and then I will have a separate us entity that will only serve U.S persons and will only provide the services that are allowed under U.S law there's nothing wrong with that at all and I wouldn't blame anyone for you know sort of looking at that and being enticed by it by that job opportunity the problem is when it's a sham and I think that's sort of how the complaint reads is that this wasn't a legitimate effort to set up a separate compliant U.S exchange it was more focused on just extracting more value from the US markets and you can get away with that for a while but always there are going to be those chats right and that for me as a lawyer is the most shocking part but it sort of never um I never get past how shocking it is to see what people are willing to put down in writing and then that gets into the hands of investigators and it gets into a federal complaint and then we all get to read it while eating popcorn yeah so the key money shot was the there was a there was a line from a former CCO that says uh I think it's something along the lines of bro we're running a effing unlicensed Securities Exchange which is which is which is a very bad word to have entered into the record when you're fighting the SEC from I think the chief compliance officer too yeah yeah quite bad I think the other thing that's that's kind of funny is I have these people not read any books about the financial crisis I feel like the the famous thing is that Jamie Diamond only writes like two word emails or whatever like since since 2008. yeah I mean it does seem like there's not a lot of text of CZ specifically it seems like CZ like a lot of these are Recollections of conversations they had so it does seem like CZ probably does have reasonably good sort of opsec where you know there's there's very little written communication with him it's just you know okay I had a conversation with him and here's what he said um so it's very very my boss vibes from CZ I think he plays the role well a question from our listeners because I was watching the since we're live streaming and we have a chat box uh is uh is Gemini next or is Gemini just too small to fail next um it's yeah look I I'm it's very clear that the SEC is going after the biggest players right basically we have first uh binance the largest Exchange in the world by far and then coinbase the largest public company in crypto and the largest US exchange by far like Jake said they're they're trying to make an example they're trying to make examples in the industry they clearly don't have the resources to go after everybody because it's just such a you know you can see these both of these lawsuits which I which by the way I read in its entirety last night the 130 pages and I read a good chunk of the 70 plus page uh coinbase lawsuit this morning um these are these are large documents with a lot of Investigation behind them um and so the SEC doesn't they can't really go after everybody but they can go after the big guys and say haha look you don't notice if you if you if you keep doing this stuff uh you're next yeah and this is this is I mean I don't know what's gonna happen to gemini or anyone else but this is a pretty typical pattern for enforcement at an agency like this they start with the low-hanging fruit right they start by going after the people who lack resources to defend themselves who have so clearly violated the law that they're gonna score a win and they're gonna get either a judge to write an order or they're going to get a settlement that sets forth the law in a way that is favorable to them then they take that order or that settlement agreement and they work their way up the chain and I think that's exactly what they've done over the last few years with crypto right you can go even all the way back to the ether Delta settlement back in like 2018 where the SEC says Etheridge health is an exchange it's trading tokens that are securities they wouldn't identify at that time which tokens were Securities but then they move forward and they go after more Brokers and more exchanges they went after bixie and then they went after bittrex and now here we are with coinbase and binance the two by far largest exchanges in the world I'm not sure what they get by then allocating more resources to work their way back down the list but I sort of feel like one big thing we have to watch now is where does the SEC allocate resources next these are going to be two very huge cases and they are an agency with limited resources so I think it's a big question you know how much do they have left and who else would they go after next one interesting thing you saw from binance so they merely hit back with a I don't know kind of an empty statement I felt like of just saying ah screw you guys like why are you trying to destroy crypto um and then CZ on Twitter I think has been trying to take a book from Brian Armstrong and just being kind of swinging at the SEC just kind of antagonistic and almost like slightly populist in his response uh where at one point last night he tweeted um uh who protects you more binance of the SEC and just posted a Twitter poll um very uh I don't know I questioned the the the the wisdom of the strategy but I haven't you know obviously I'm not a lawyer Jake what is your take on what what cc is doing and how this is going to play in the scuffle that's to come I confess that I'm not sure what his strategy is I think it could be like you said um trying to take some cues from coinbase I'm not sure it sort of comes across that way I think coinbase deserves an extraordinary amount of credit I think they are in a position and have been for quite a while that is extremely unique it's hard to imagine any other publicly listed American company in such an open and public battle with a regulator that asserts jurisdiction over them and not shying away from that fight right the fact that we knew any of this before the enforcement action was filed is is pretty unique on its own that coinbase you know had been so aggressive in seeking Clarity from the SEC submitting a petition for rulemaking uh being you know very public about the meetings that they had publishing the wells response that they filed right right making that video that that Brian and Paul graywall their clo made which I thought was pretty amazing a 10 minute video I'm sort of throwing the gauntlet down to the SEC we probably knew that this was coming by the time that video came out and I think honestly that is is them writing a brand new playbook for how to handle a situation like this I from what I'm seeing from binance it doesn't really strike me as similar so far so I'm not really sure what the communication strategy is there yeah the reality is that unfortunately binance has very few allies in the US right so binance us as we can see their volumes were inflated because it's frustrating so they never really had the market share that they apparently were advertising that they had and you know beyond that uh it's kind it hasn't been successful in the US obviously the the founder CZ is a Canadian Chinese guy who lives in Abu Dhabi as far as we know and so there's there's I think very little gonna be very little sympathy for a similar type of feeling of like hey you didn't give us the rules you didn't blah blah and and of course relative to coinbase um coinbase did not have any allegations of fraud or you know kind of gross misconduct in the way that we're seeing here for for binance so it's just a different ball game and I don't think the same kind of reaction is going to play the same way certainly not to the American public but uh not in a court of law either so one of the things that is also interesting so yesterday when we saw this uh lawsuit come down um markets just markets just dumped so there was a very very rapid just uh you know instinctive reaction from the market of like oh God it's finally here all these crypto assets are going to be rendered illegal because the SEC is named you know all these things is to be Securities and the biggest Exchange in the world is now Under Fire and maybe this is the beginning of the end um that said the outflows from binance have actually been pretty muted over the last 24 hours I think nanson reported something around the order of a billion and a half that that flew out of binance.com and a smaller number that that uh you know in the hundreds of a few hundred million I think they came out of Finance us which are relatively small fractions of the capital that's in there which I think means right now I don't know how quite how to interpret that but my assumption is that even insofar as genzo is trying to paint this as ah is binance not FTX 2.0 and he's drawing all these insinuations like oh look you know he also has this lack of separation between the market maker and the exchange um you know there's also you know the commingling of assets and there are all these things they're all these things that people are trying to draw this line between FTX and and uh binance I I don't think the market is convinced by it that seems to be what they're telling us and the second thing of course that there's nowhere else to go right so okay yeah binance is guilty of Securities violations and running on Research exchange and blah blah but so is everybody right where else where are you going to go that's not violating Securities laws or is running an unregistered unlicensed exchange whatever so the I don't know what do you guys think about why it is that we're not seeing in Exodus out of binance um compared to what it seems like the SEC wants us to think which is that hey this thing isn't taking time Bob get your money out as fast as you can well not to defend binance as an exchange specifically but you know these are allegations that I think will play out over years this is not I think to the average user and as an existential risk to finance The Exchange whether it's binance us or binance.com International that is a catalyst for removing their assets from the platform FTX was truly an insolvent House of Cards black hole of fraud where all the assets were gone but I don't think anyone suspects and nor has it been alleged that that's the case with binance and so I think to the average user on crypto Twitter or wherever it doesn't have the same sense of urgency so you know it's just another day as usual I mean coinbase came out saying you know for them specifically it's business as usual and I think binance is basically indicated the same it's business as usual and so to a user you know they're not gonna pay as much attention to a court case and what the implications are over the next three years as the exchanges are because to them it doesn't really matter as long as the exchange is still up it's okay and I don't think obviously I've been some um actions where the SEC has tried to get a temporary emergency order against Finance but even that is actually to protect the users and preserve their assets and make sure they're accounted for not to put the exchange into position where the money is mysteriously gone and so I think that's why we haven't seen on Market Exodus from either Exchange that makes sense I also think the person who's taking over for most operational sofa binance Richard Tang is those name he's the former head of the Abu Dhabi equivalent of the SEC and I think like yeah but he he also worked for if I remember correctly he worked for the Abu Dhabi sort of regulator and I I kind of feel like everyone in the Middle East and Asia doesn't really care like that that that's like the tldr is I I don't think there and I think that's a large portion of the customer base I I don't think that's zero and I I think people in South America the Middle East Asia don't really care right they're like fine the US is doing this that like doesn't really affect us yeah I don't know that they don't care but I think they certainly care less than the US does because I think for if you're in latam or I mean I don't look I don't know that much about that so let me just with a broad brush say that in Latin you probably trust binance more than you trust the second largest exchange that that's local um because even insofar as binance doesn't have perfect controls or maybe there's some co-mingling or there's some of this some of that um they trust that binance is a large profitable institution that has a very strong uh track record of not being hacked not defrauding people not you know stealing money not look obviously they do some shady stuff as we're uncovering but on balance the average exchange that's gonna pop up in in you know uh you know Brazil or Argentina or something there's a very good chance that they're likely to just be insolvent within a couple years which is a which is something that I think right now as you said Robert not many people are not really concerned that that's what's going to happen to binance they may be concerned that binance is not following the laws and that they're not properly um securing Assets in a way that's that is befitting of a multi-billion dollar institution um but nobody's worried that binance isn't good for it right nobody's where the buyers doesn't have the money yeah also you're you're you are right I got wrong he he was he was actually the head uh regulatory officer for in Singapore not copy at the main exchanges yeah my point is my point is he he seems to basically I don't know if you've read some of his articles or writing and stuff but I I he seems to be more like very much like Hey we're going to be compliant like saying all in in the other jurisdictions and kind of ignoring the US purposely in like all communication yeah I think the appointing Richard Tang as sort of they they didn't quite say he's the new CEO they sort of said he's sort of being groomed in a very senior position kind of insinuating that he's next in line behind CZ this feels like a way of calming everybody that like hey if CZ gets too hot we've got a plan ready to you know kind of move CZ over and this guy steps in and there's gonna be no disruption to our operations even if you know something God forbid were to happen to CZ so I think the very very good strategy by Finance I think it's probably why markets didn't tank more than they did yesterday was them naming Richard Tang in this article the same day that the lawsuit dropped um I thought that was very true to them well I was going to say the the you know I think it's very easy to say like oh there's you know bad news relating to an exchange crypto must drop you know just to throw a thought experiment out there if there were no exchanges at all right like let's say every exchange disappeared from the face of the Earth what would the value of Bitcoin be you know tomorrow assuming every exchange just cease to operate instantaneously right is it zero no right because it's more than it was the day before because it's scarce and hard to you know the beauty of crypto assets unlike normal assets is there some sort of like Heisenberg Principle like you you can't actually shrink all the exchanges to zero because you can always start a new one right you can't do that with equities because the custodians are restricted but you definitely can with self-custody assets so the idea that you can like shrink it to zero and then also hope the market goes to zero there's like some minimum you can do for both of them and I think that that's kind of like the beauty of crypto is you can't kill it the same way but you can make the price go down by a lot so you can certainly yeah I agree but I don't think it goes I don't think it goes anywhere it definitely doesn't go to zero it definitely doesn't go to zero there's some local Bitcoins guy somewhere who's always going to be trading Bitcoin for for Fiat so that that that's for sure okay let's let's move on from the binance story and I want to I want to talk about coinbase so yesterday the whole world was relaying markets were in the toilet after the finance lawsuit was unveiled and then um basically overnight we got the news that the SEC was unveiling a lawsuit against coinbase roughly the same arguments so unregistered broker-dealer assets or Securities uh staking as a service is unregistered security program blah blah blah and they also insinuated at the margin that maybe there's something also going on with coinbase wallet they weren't they were kind of circumspect about how and why coinbase wallet which is a non-custodial kind of metamask competitor type thing um how and how in in what way that seems to cause any kind of liability on their part and there were also 10 uh states that also uh issued they coordinated for this uh basically mostly on staking and I think that the different states ask for different things one of them I think Alabama was like a show cause order basically saying explain to us why we shouldn't send you a cease and desist and then California I think to send them a cease and desist and said stop offering unregistered Securities in California um so weirdly today so this morning coinbase was down I mean Columbus was down a lot yesterday after um the point of stock was down a lot yesterday after the financing was unveiled they were down again this morning after this SEC lawsuit was unveiled um and the markets were also down and then over the last six hours markets have just been grinding upwards to the point where now Bitcoin is higher than it was before the binance lawsuit dropped so I I am really struggling to understand uh what happened there and why it is suddenly I I want like I I feel like maybe some explanation is that we ripped the Band-Aid off like we sort of knew that this was coming we knew that there was going to be a lawsuit because the wells notice against coinbase and now that we see it it's kind of like oh okay uh this isn't that bad or this is like there's nothing in here that surprised us um yeah okay a bunch of these things were named to Securities with the SEC but genzer's already said that he thinks everything in crypto is a security so we just see you know this is yeah this is consistent with what he's been saying um and I guess everyone noticed that everyone else didn't run away so maybe it's kind of like a Emperor has no clothes thing was worried everyone else would sell and then when no one else sells it was like okay never mind here's my second contrarian take on this and all right go for it the actions are so bold and likely so wrong in some cases and it's gonna be an accelerant and expedite the passage of legislation in the U.S that actually creates the long-term solution and creates rules for the industry right it's such a forcing action that's been taken this week to bring charges against both binance and coinbase that it's more likely we get to the end state of actually having legislative definitions for this stuff um such as like we're seeing with the market structure Bill I'm sure Jake knows way more about this than I do but you know these are the things that are going to actually bring the solution to bear yeah if anything I thought the coinbase one was kind of boring it was a lot of copy paste from binance and Kraken and like other it's like it's like these arguments again you know it just I think that the wall thing was honestly the only interesting part um also I mean the fact that after the Kraken um settlement coinbase came out saying hey here's why our staking is different and then of course they get wrapped up in this as well um I think the other bit that people have been discussing or this sort of question is like well why did the SEC like Columbia's go public um if they thought they were running running an unregistered Securities Exchange uh BD Etc um and you know I think sort of the counter argument is well you know it's all about risk disclosures like any anything can reasonably go public as long as there's appropriate reporting and disclosures but I love these assets that they're they're describing were listed on coinbase at the time it went public so it's not like oh later on they you know circumvented or had some sort of wet Rogue and added these assets that SEC teams Securities that was the case at the time it went public so it does seem little silly in some ways I I totally agree with all of you so I think first of all absolutely yes this will accelerate legislation and we can talk more about about the legislation that's moving through the house right now I think it's really exciting and I do think the SEC has just lost so much credibility through this approach that it's just clear to people that this is not going to work and we don't actually want to ban crypto in the United States right just because chair counselor wants to does not mean that that is the prevailing view of those policy makers and I do think the fact that they've decided to you know like I said before sort of Throw Down The Gauntlet and say we're not trying to regulate this industry we're trying to kill this industry I think that's going to really increase the the impetus for for legislation I also do think that this is a bit of a nothing Burger I totally agree with Tom I read the binance complaint yesterday and I was like hey this is a little bit spicy and then I read coinbase today and I was like okay this is basically just the binance complaint without any of the interesting things it's just a pure regulatory violation and I will tell you in the last maybe six months or so you know I get a lot of questions from people about what's going to happen in crypto policy what's going to happen in regulation what are the scariest things out there and the two things that always come up are the Ripple case right if Ripple loses an xrp is deemed to security is at the end of crypto in the United States and second what's going to happen to coinbase and I think a lot of people really believed there was going to be a day where the SEC was going to show up and say coinbase is illegal now and then coinbase would shut down all of its order books and we would all pack our bags and go back to traffic or something like that and I think people were sort of shocked to see that like this is business as usual until this case gets resolved and this case is not going to get resolved for the next I would say at least two or three years maybe much much longer than that and even if it does get resolved let's say the SEC wins a judgment that says some number of these tokens are securities coinbase the next day can de-list those tokens and continue operating its exchange without having to register so I think it's clear to people that this is not a path where we're going to get clarity I think that's going to happen in Congress and there's going to be a lot more focus on that going forward so some of the claims here um like so it's important they pointed that out that unlike by andaz there was no uh restraining order or injunction against coinbase this is just like a normal lawsuit the the three major violations are running an unlicensed exchange uh not having a broker dealer engaging in broker dealer activities without a broker dealer license and then uh being a clearing agency can you explain what those three things are and how you acquire those things in order to be doing what the SEC says they're doing in a licensed and compliant way yes so okay let's let's think about the traditional Securities markets under the federal Securities laws you know traditional Securities Market you have three different entities that perform three different services in the market you have the exchange The Exchange brings together the buyers and the sellers of the Securities it's the marketplace where the trades happen then you have the broker the broker represents a customer it's the broker's job to take orders from the customer and then bring those orders to The Exchange and then third you have the Clearinghouse the job of the Clearinghouse is basically to execute the trades right to settle the trades often the Clearing House is also the custodian for those assets right so in Securities markets that's the dtcc that the depository trust and Clearing Corporation that basically has custody of every single stock that you can imagine in the world land uniswap is an exchange metamask is a broker and ethereum is the clearing agency So Perfect Analogy that's perfect that's what they do differently go ahead exactly right Perfect Analogy and this is the problem with registering anything in crypto as any of these types of traditional categories of registrants under the SEC it's just not how the technology works so if the SEC shows up and basically says well coinbase is a Securities Exchange it is creating secondary markets for assets that are securities but coinbase has not registered and it is performing the service of all three of these separate entities in one and that is not permissible this is why coinbase and all of the rest of the industry for so long has gone to the SEC to say look you keep saying to us come in and register tell us how we can do that given that there is no Clearinghouse the clear bearing operation is done by the blockchain that's literally what the blockchain is for and we don't have brokers who bring orders to The Exchange customers just have their funds in custody with us and then they are trading on our order books is there some way that we can adjust to the Securities laws to address your very valid regulatory concerns right this is not to say the Securities laws have no place in crypto but is there a way we can address those concerns without just having to become a traditional Securities Exchange and say that tokens just like stocks can only trade in this very highly restricted and frankly pretty uninteresting environment and the sec's answer has basically been no we're not going to help you figure out how to register we just don't like crypto and we're going to file this enforcement action against you that's that's what's happening this week yeah I just actually more had a question about the SEC selection of particular assets at least for Solana and polygon they actually went into some detail as to why right like they had tweets from Solana and from polygon that were like price related and they have like spending certain funds on like things related to exchange listings and stuff like that so they had like a bunch of detail but for some of them they didn't give any and then there were some very large market cap coins that definitely didn't make it on the list whereas some smaller ones did so I'm just kind of curious like what do you think the I I saw all the the speculation that it was literally they just took a screenshot and whichever ones that that's what it looked like they really looked like they went on page one of coin market cap and they were like what can we get our hands on easily that is probably going to be easy to demonstrate that you know they're team tokens and it's good but but they but they spent a lot of time on sawing on polygon like it's very clear that Solana seems to have the highest risk in the sense of like they they spent like four pages on it um it was argument against Solana was not super strong like most of the statements from the team are about technology there were other ones where it's like okay the team is talking about the price and you know with algorand they put the the put the algorithm put on like the 90 cents on for people who did the Ico no no no it was like all this stuff but my point is they they have a lot of that right so I'm just kind of uh yeah yeah so I I'm not I don't know how to interpret that I assume there's selection volume I I think it's a function trading one right like Solana just trades so much that they probably were like look what's what are the assets that do the most volume if we really want to kneecap the industry and say like look you need to de-list stuff they want you de-list almost everything so they're not going to go after some small ball oh you listed this little random you know but like polka dot Avalanche there are a lot of large caps that were not were sort of alighted that are traded on coinbase so I'm like I was just like to me that was sort of like did they have good legal strategy or was this actually Department yeah yeah yeah yeah it was like one of these things where I I can't figure out like why the so yeah Jake do you have any idea of like what the process was I have literally no idea it does not make any sense to me at all I think um I'm going to speculate wildly it could just be um they've had a lot of conversations with a lot of people in Industry maybe there have been investigations these are the people they didn't like and they wanted to send a message to them like I wouldn't put a passing enforcement division to be operating that way I think that the challenge here is that it used to be and it should be that if an enforcement division at a regulatory agency wants to accuse someone of breaking the law they actually accuse that person of breaking the law and bringing action against that person so they can come defend themselves right so like who has the best information and the best understanding of whether Solana could have been you know sold pursuant to an investment contract at some time Solano Labs probably has that but Solano Labs is not a party to the coinbase action and cannot as a matter of law intervene in the case to defend itself and this has sort of been the sec's tactic for a long time so it's regulating by enforcement but by enforcement against parties who don't even have the opportunity to defend themselves I would tell you that I think it's possible that itself is a violation of the administrative procedures act and that's something that we're thinking about at the blockchain association whether there's some way that we can get in and say look this isn't just unfair and unjust it's actually contrary to federal law for the SEC to be acting this way but otherwise I have no idea your guess is as good as mine so actually how does that type of action against the SEC would coinbase be the one making such an accusation or like who who kind of countersues really good question don't want to give you or anyone else legal advice here's the best that I can say sorry yeah I'm not I'm not trying to ask for yeah sorry I give you math advice in exchange yeah that's kind of more curious what the process is if an agency does an action that is viewed as you know not according to law how does that get enforced in some ways yeah so what you need is you need a party that has standing meaning the party has been injured in some way and the injury is traceable to the action by the defendant here at the SEC and then that party has to go to court and then file a claim under some federal law that it says that action that caused them injury has violated and in this case I think it's it's entirely reasonable to think not legal advice that may be one of those uh you know projects that was involved in creating one of those tokens or some other company that maybe sees some harm to their business or to their reputation might be able to go to court and bring that type of action this is actually something that a trade Association is uniquely positioned to do because we the blockchain association have something called associational standing this is now me teaching a law school course which means we can bring lawsuits on behalf of our members without them individually having to be involved so for that reason and for a bunch of others this is this is something that we've been thinking about because our view is we can't just be sitting ducks waiting for chair Gensler to pick his next Target and then hope that it goes okay we need to be offensive and we need to start bringing our own lawsuits on fact patterns we like on issues we like in courts where the law is the way that we believe it is and that that's different in different places in the country so this is something that you should expect to see and hear about more from us as time goes on also as you pointed out they have a finite set of resources so you can go through the denial service attack the fact that your cardano bags went down you might have standing to go and ensue the SEC for making my parents so my parents your parents okay sorry excuse me um okay so so we got we got the coinbase suit uh it seems like markets are shrugging it off one thing that's very interesting to me about all the tokens that they're going after I remember it was um what I think last month that there was the grayscale uh filecoin trust that they wanted to launch and the SEC told them hey no we think Falcon's security and that caused a bunch of folks to start de-listing or stop trading palcoin now basically the industry's on notice that everything is a security and my assumption is going to be that we're just going to see non-compliance at this point is that just like look come on like you I if you name one thing at a time maybe I'm gonna go in there and like give you like okay maybe filed One Security I haven't looked into it you know fine but if you tell me literally everything is a security I'm like look at this point like I don't have a business if you tell me everything is security right I'm not just gonna trade Bitcoin so I it does feel like in a way the the SEC is kind of shooting itself in the foot if they want compliance from the industry because at this point everybody's just going to take the coinbase tag which is okay prove it proven the court of law like I'm not gonna deal with this thing if you tell me everything needs to get delicited and that's like more than half my business is everything besides Bitcoin and ether um so at that point you're giving kind of the economic reality of the industry no choice but to basically Embrace non-compliance because of the the extent to which they're trying to Blacklist everything that people want to trade uh spot on I don't mean to talk so much but um I I think you're totally right about that I think one really interesting and maybe sad part of that story is what happened to Ripple and to xrp right so and say you know think and say whatever you want about xrp but in December 2020 Ripple was targeted with an enforcement action the action said xrp was and still is a security and instantly every single Exchange in the United States delisted xrp right this became very controversial but then and I think the reason they did that right was exactly what you said it was the SEC has spoken they are saying that for us to be in compliance we cannot trade this asset we are going to cooperate and voluntarily comply with that instruction from the SEC even though it would have been better to find out about it you know through some other way than any federal complaint we're gonna we're gonna sort of play along with the SEC that is not how the industry is viewing the SEC today and hasn't been for a really long time I think that started actually with the sec's case against ishan he who was the individual accused of the insider trading at coinbase and in the wahi case the SEC identified nine different tokens that it said were Securities and also said that they were trading on coinbase right essentially accusing coinbase of exactly what they finally put in in their enforcement action today and nobody de-listed those tokens including coinbase I think maybe three of the nine were delisted from coinbase and that was I think the moment that the industry sent the message to the SEC we just don't take you seriously anymore we don't think that we are going to get any credit from voluntarily delisting assets and we understand that really what you want is for us to de-list you know for coinbase they have 240 assets the SEC wants 239 of them everything but Bitcoin delisted and that's just not a way to have a functioning business in the United States so I do think we're in this position right it's not just the SEC saying we want to kill this industry it's also the industry saying look if you're going to treat us that way then we're going to act the same way towards you so one of the things that I thought was interesting I tweeted about this a little bit earlier um was our old friend EOS if you remember EOS um you know crazy Ico I think we talked about it on the show last week uh they ended up getting a loss from the SEC back in 2019 and they settled that lawsuit for I think 25 million dollars ish something in that ballpark um and as a result of that lawsuit block one the issuer of EOS did not register EOS as a security EOS continue to trade and that seemed to be some kind of admission from the SEC that EOS may have been a security when they were doing the Ico like there were some security issuance type properties of the thing but at uh basically at the time that they reached a settlement that was no longer necessary and so the SEC you know did not ask them to to register and basically said great it's a closed it's closed case it seems very strange then that if EOS which is a layer 1 blockchain which does all the you know same bells and whistles you know all the stuff they were describing about why Solana is a you know a joint uh profit-making Enterprise because Solana Burns fees or Solana you know there's a layer one that has this much TPS and blah blah and they talked about the technical properties all those things are obviously also true of EOS um so if EOS is not a security then on what basis are all of these other l1s security Solana Ada near Adam why are all these Securities when when EOS is not that seemed I mean I know that there's no okay what about that guy you know that's not a legal defense I guess or is it that's not a legal defense right you can't just say like well that guy you treated them differently what yeah I I love I love the idea of a court system where you do that though you know where you can enable that on a blockchain sport that's where it be here that's where you can finally point at somebody and say what about that guy and that's a robust legal defense well there is an opportunity to clarify all of this right like you're basically saying hey in EOS the initial sale of the token was an investment contract between the organization selling the tokens and the people buying the tokens from the organization but the tokens then were not Securities right this is obviously a big you know conversation item in Ripple and in other you know circumstances but the potential answer is also sitting in front of us and I don't want to keep on trying to get Jake to drive back to the market structure bill that's proposed but there are solutions that are being discussed to actually answer these exact type of questions and to create Clarity for everybody about how things work how they should operate and what the framework is to regulate them and so you know Jake was there anything in the uh Market structure build that actually would have answered tasieb's exact question so yes let's so let me give you my quick EOS take and then let's talk about the market structure bill I think what's important about about EOS is it was a different SEC that made that decision right that was chair Clayton's SEC and chair Clayton's SEC which we all complained about non-stop back then was basically like crypto not on my watch we're not going to do anything to help this Market but we're also not going to get blamed for doing anything crazy and that's why I think in the in the EO settlement you saw them sort of split the baby right it was like yeah there was a Securities violation here but once the network was fully functional we'll draw a line and we'll say the erc20 token was a security but we're going to let the you know the people who are doing the work on on that blockchain continue doing their work we don't see any of that from chair gamzler's SEC right because his his take is not not on my watch his take is on my watch I will destroy everything in this industry and that's why you see something like honestly if I was file coin I would be most upset about this because they if you remember did a Saft and they did it exactly right right unlike many other projects they did the Saft and then they said we are literally not releasing this token until our work is totally done whereas so many other people did this aft and five minutes later with no functioning Network whatsoever distributed the token and I think you know if your file coin you're you're looking at how everyone else has been treated and then getting filecoin listed in these complaints and you're pretty upset so so that's that's my point there the market structure bill is super important for the following reason it solves all of these problems okay now the the bill is is very early it came out on Friday I still have not had a chance to read through the whole thing it's probably going to take a long time to weave its way through Congress I think it's going to take a long time to get into its final form but the idea is to come up with a registration and compliance regime that actually works for crypto right the one thing that the SEC has refused to do all along so what it does at least in its in its initial form is it creates a framework where you can create a token distribute that token both to you know insiders you could say right to investors and to team members to employees to Founders to Affiliates and people like that have reasonable restrictions on those tokens but also be able to create public markets for secondary trading of those tokens before you have achieved some magical sufficient decentralization tests that none of us even understand after after years of thinking about this and that is the right way for us to solve these problems where again you address these very valid concerns of maybe the creator of this token has privileged access to special information that the purchasers of the token should also have before they decide to make an investment decision right that's a very reasonable purpose of the Securities laws if you're not an anarchist I say that with no judgment but if you're not an anarchist right that's like a pretty reasonable regulatory goal to achieve or for these you know secondary markets right the bill sets forth a registration framework for someone like coinbase that says look we're going to address these very real concerns about Market Integrity we don't want you coinbase operating an Affiliated Market maker where you are watch trading on your exchange and you're not doing any Market surveillance to make sure there's not other types of manipulation happening on the platform that you are you know providing to you as persons but we're going to do that in a context where you actually can register and you don't have to just abandon the benefits of decentralization in the underlying technology that you're building on so I think I think this is the beginning of a probably fairly long process that will ultimately yield something that works for the industry here in the US actually maybe just like a timeline was if you had to speculate on how long the bill would take from now to ever you know passing in some form versus the time the entire court case would take between coinbase and I say you know Tortoise and the hairstyle which one which one is which one makes it to the finish line a great question I'm going to say the market structure Bill maybe I'm just being optimistic but that's my hope I would say the coinbase case takes three years at least in the district court I would hope that by the end of the next Congress we've got Market structure legislation in place I think it's it's a heavy lift right now it's a very serious effort there are two separate committees in the house that are working jointly on this that's very rare and we may be heading toward a markup this summer meaning they're gonna you know make revisions and then vote this thing out of committee and get it to the floor of the house it could pass the floor of the house the challenge in this Congress will be that the house is controlled by Republicans and the Senate is controlled by democrats and it's very hard to get those two Chambers to work together on anything and unfortunately Senate Democrats have a much more skeptical view of crypto in general so if this does get voted out of the house uh but you know predominantly supported by Republicans without a lot of democrat involvement you can imagine it just sort of sitting around in the Senate until the end of this Congress and then we have a presidential election and a whole new Congress and who knows what could happen in 2025 so that's sort of what we're looking at you know fingers crossed that we can get this over the Finish Line This Congress before 2025 but it wouldn't totally shock me if we're still talking about this two or three years from now well Robert you made the point earlier that all the stuff that's going down now of the SEC going after coinbase and going after binance it does Galvanize people about crypto in a way that I think they previously were probably more aloof Jake do you think it's not likely that that's going to change the calculus I mean I think what you described was roughly what I heard about the bill you know last week is that yeah you know it's nice obviously the Crypt industry likes it it's much more amenable than anything else we've had on the floor that's realistic but you know Congress is Congress and like nothing is going to get done uh in anytime soon does it not seem like maybe this changes that I think this changes that and I think I think it changes it on the Democratic side so you know we've been seeing over the course of the last year or so a lot more resistance especially to the SEC and to chair counselor we've seen a bunch of you know Democratic representatives and some Senators coming out to question whether the way that shark anselor is operating is really the right way of Representative Richie Torres is one example he's on the house Financial Services committee he's taking a leading role in pushing this forward he's been you know very I I would say outspoken in challenging you know chair Gensler even though chair Ganser was appointed by a president of his own party and I think that shows that it's not just the industry that's unhappy with the SEC and everyone else loves what they're doing there's a lot of of skepticism about the SEC driving Innovation out of the country especially when you look at Europe and you see Europe moving forward with Comprehensive regulation no American likes to look at Europe and say they're doing this better than us and we're going to lose out to them so I think there are a bunch of reasons why this is going to get very serious very fast I I do hate to appeal to Twitter but one thing that was very clear for anybody who's on Twitter was that no matter what Twitter account you were looking at this was incredibly unpopular by the SEC and almost all of the energy was rallying behind binance yesterday and then coinbase today as feeling that this is just an unjust way to treat a company that everyone recognizes is doing something genuinely new and difficult in an environment that that's hard to know what you're supposed to be doing when there's so little Clarity afforded to companies in the US well it's because it's very clear that they're not trying to bring them within a regulatory perimeter they're trying to murder them outside of the perimeter and you know to anyone you know who's observing this that doesn't seem like the correct approach yeah okay so let's let's zoom out so I think we we've built a pretty good understanding of what the facts are in front of us what happens now to win this new world um the SEC is throwing down the gauntlet binance is unnoticed coinbase is unnoticed obviously binance has this whole process playing out that will happen the chords coinbase is going to take years um what does this change what does this change about how crypto is done in the US does this mean that things are going to go overseas are people still going to be able to found companies here are token Project's still going to launch here what do you guys think happens now first question who is the next on the assassination list you know the meme with the Grim Reaper going to each door like who is the third door and I think I kind of don't think there would be a 30 door I feel like they're gonna there's the third door is uniswap then then you know the answer to your questions that is that's that's my thoughts one thing that they have not gone after yet if the third door is someone like that then like that's your answer that would surprise me they are going after defy they're just not doing it in enforcement they're doing it in rule making which is a whole other conversation but they basically have this proposal that's pending they issued it last I want to say last February they just reopened it maybe two months ago that expands the definition of an exchange under the federal Securities laws to capture like basically everything under the sun and that would certainly capture defy and I feel like that's how the SEC is trying to go after defy I honestly I don't think that there's a third coming from the SEC if there's anything else I would say it's the third case against binance and we didn't talk about this too much but you know the cftc started this there was a lot of content in the cftc complaint against binance about terrorist financing and sanctions violations that stuff doesn't just disappear because we stopped talking about it for a few weeks and I think you know the SEC complaints may just be leading to something more serious and maybe criminal so I don't know anything that you guys don't know I'm totally speculating here but I think if we're going to have another big news day where we talk about a federal court filing that would be sort of what I'm looking for the joy of this podcast is it's all about speculating in sometimes 100 we are we are the The Spectator podcast in the spirit of not giving legal advisors we also don't do all this podcast if you were talking to an entrepreneur who's starting at the foot of the mountain today and thinking about what they want to do what would you tell them about what they can and can't do in America in America I would tell them that I need an engagement letter that uh you know has my my fee schedule set forth um no look I think what I would say in general is you have to understand that if you're going to do business in this industry in the US you are putting yourself in a position where odds are you know that The Regulators do not agree with you and you have to have the stomach for that right there's nothing wrong with that um there's nothing wrong with saying you have a better view of the law than a particular unelected bureaucrat who happens to be in leadership at an agency today but you do have to have sort of the guts to do that and you also like any you know startup founder um who sort of you know is willing to chew glass and run through a thousand people telling them that what they think is never going to work and that they're crazy you sort of have to do that but you have to do it from a legal and Regulatory perspective you just have to be extra careful because you have to take these things extremely seriously and you have to find extremely good lawyers who can help you understand where can you in good faith run your business in the U.S and where do you have a good faith disputes with Regulators where you believe strongly that if you end up in court you are going to win and then you have to you know feel confident in those decisions if you don't have sort of the guts to do that then I think being in crypto in the US is going to be pretty hard because you're going to hear from a lot of people you're going to read Matt Levine every once in a while who's going to say that everything in crypto is Securities fraud and you've just got to be sort of you know ready to go through that that said I would tell people again not giving advice but I do not think that you want to just flee the United States because currently the policy picture is a bit challenging I think if you want to launch a successful product or service in 2023 you want access to the US markets and you are more likely to get that in a more meaningful way if you stay here and you again position yourself as a good actor doing this in good faith in compliance with federal and state law to the extent that you can be and trust that you will be able to work it out rather than just trying to run you know an offshore operation Instead at least that's that's what I tell people but that's what coinbase was right like coinbase from the perspective of an outsider is doing everything in as much good faith as possible they were building in this industry you know for administrations ago you know where all of this was nascent and you know it's evolved into this system we have today starting from almost nothing and they consistently you know tried to operate with the best of intentions towards their users towards you know government towards you know the system as a whole and unfortunately they're on the losing end of you know of regulators saying that their business can't exist anymore if you know the court brought aside with them and that's you know a good actor being targeted you know binance for what it's worth I don't think is as good of an actor you know we go back to who'd you listed Ripple you know coinbase listed Ripple I don't think binance did right I think Ripple still trades on finance right coinbase has always tried to you know play by the rules as they understood them they've always asked for clarification on the rules and you know being the good and honest actor in this case I don't think has worked for them with all that being said Robert I mean coinbase is still worth 12 billion dollars so it's not um it's not as though coinbase has flushed out the toilet as a result of this I mean they're down maybe 15 their stock price since the stuff dropped in the SEC um but it's not actually it's kind of traded in the same range roughly that it's traded over the last six months so I don't think that this is a death smell for coinbase although it's possible that you know if if this case works out against coinbase in in the worst uh way that this could be the beginning of the end frequent is but it's very clear as as we were listening to earlier right now the market is not really giving credit to the SEC that they're going to Prevail on the what ostensibly what they're what they want which is for coinbase to shrivel up and die and go away or only be a Bitcoin brokerage basically it seems like the the the vision that they have for coinbase it doesn't seem the market believes that because if it did this thing would not be worth 12 billion dollars today I I hear that and it's still an incredibly valuable and Incredibly important company and I think that's why you know they are going to be a catalyst for you know all of American legislative and Regulatory policy to figure this out because you know they're the biggest Exchange in America with the best of intentions and they've essentially been put into the position of being the one at bat and I I you know I think it's going to be good for everybody long term but we'll say yeah actually are there any other examples of say like in maybe a different regulatory portion of the law where like the regulator tried to kill an industry leader who followed rules and like the industry moved offshore completely because like I could imagine like there must have must be some sort of historical text market and um I feel like a bunch of financial markets have moved offshore I mean the euro dollar market is kind of the same story uh but your dollar kind of came back because the Futures are all traded here so your dollar is funny it started outside and the US was like we're not gonna let these [ __ ] Europeans like own this thing so we're bringing it back no no I mean there's there's literally a quote uh from uh cftc commissioner about this a long time ago but the uh I guess my point is more just like there there's like that's like sort of a weirder case I'm just more curious if there's like some commodity that's ever been like the US was like we don't want like you know like Shale gas you could have imagined that it could have gone the way out of like hey it gets kicked out but I'm sure there must be something and I'd love to find an example and just like compare the historical [Music] if you know of a good example of something that was pushed out of the US because of Regulation um we're running up on time so Jake I just want to end with one more question one of the things that I think a lot of people are banking on is that um so right now as you mentioned there's basically two years left in this Administration um very likely there's going to be an election we don't know right now it's a toss-up roughly 50 50 if it's going to be Democrat Republican there there's there's been a lot of discussion about chair gensler's term I don't totally understand how completely works because Commissioners my understanding is that commissioners of six-year terms at the SEC um genzler sure Gensler has said that uh or it's been leaked I don't know exactly that he wants to to go for treasury uh Secretary of Treasury as opposed to uh chair of the SEC um how does it work does he continue at the SEC even if there's a new Administration does he roll out does he become a commissioner instead of the chairman how does how does it work in in a new presidency so you're right that there's a I actually I think it's a five-year term but then they can extend it after the five years up to maybe another 12 or 18 months so I think yeah the maximum is something like six or six and a half years um he took his position in 2021 I think that means technically he could be with us past 2026. that said often when there is a presidential transition even if President Biden is re-elected there's always a transition before the you know the next term begins where the cabinet positions and then also usually leadership of the agencies gets Revisited and there's one Theory which is like you said chair Gensler has been doing this because he wants to be treasury secretary I don't know he's ever said that but that's certainly um you know the the view of basically everybody in DC is that that's really what he's looking for and that he's not going to get that from President Biden which might mean that in the transition he decides I've made my Mark I don't really want to stick around to lose all these cases that I brought I already got on squat box uh when I filed the complaint which was really what I wanted and I'm gonna go do something else until you know the next president shows up who you know might want to appoint me to the to the position that I really want so I would think that maybe in 2025 chair Gensler moves out and we get somebody new whether that's someone better who knows we all said that anyone other than Cher Clayton would be such an improvement and here we are what would we you know what would we give to to get back um Jay Clayton as chair of the SEC so I'm hard to count on us just sort of surviving and outliving chair Gensler but I mean eventually his his reign of terror will be over and we'll have somebody else in leadership there okay and that was not exactly the most reassuring yeah a relatively small consolation but whatever I'll take anything I can get right now all right I gotta find me some sugar-free Red Bull um because I know it's gonna get me through yeah we'll we'll see we'll see if we can get that sponsorship lined up uh but for now I think we have to sign off thanks everybody and uh we'll be back next week thanks for everything thanks everyone throughout this journey thanks thank you [Music]
