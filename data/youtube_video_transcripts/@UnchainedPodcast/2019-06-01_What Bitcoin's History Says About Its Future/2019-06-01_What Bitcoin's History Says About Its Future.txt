author of the book digital gold Bitcoin and the inside story of the misfits and millionaires trying to reinvent money welcome it Daniel thank you for having me so let's start with this week's news the suspension of this segment 2x hard fork which for listeners you don't know about that that was the topic of the last podcast which you can check out sinneth annual what's your take on what happened and why I said what 2x was called off hmm my take on what happened and why it was called off boy that's I guess what it's been sort of three years in the making I can just hear whatever glib comments I make here setting off the the Twitter mobs I I will say this is this is going on a tangent but it is amazing how merely talking about the fork and what the outcome is no matter what words you use you are you know immediately offending probably both sides use almost always at least one side so you know and in sort of interpreting hit I have to say I've become very sensitive to that as I'm sure you have but you know I think I think at the end of the day you know I think both of us probably wrote about the fact that this was about really two different visions for what Bitcoin was it you know in the end it was not just a technical dispute now I think the the question sort of moving forward is you know the the small blockers the folks who won this said that they this is going to be something like a digital gold that we're gonna build other layers on top of and I think the real question is going to be can they build those things on top of Bitcoin faster than other coins you know start getting adopted for you know these payment channels and and things like that so I think that's going to be really interesting to see moving forward because you know at this point some of these things are sort of technically built but you know it's not clear that they're going to work so I think it's a real sort of moment of uncertainty for a Bitcoin which you've seen in you know the price over since the fork you know sort of seesaw it up and down yeah and I'm totally with you on the political stuff it is so scary to write about this just because it's scary it's not the word but you know it's so sensitive you just know anything you say somebody's gonna tuck it and it is used you're right it is usually both sides which is kind of interesting that they both just read into whatever sentence or word choice our own projections and yeah and I think that that ultimately that is very destructive probably for this whole project not not like like there should be an open debate and you know everybody should be able to state their opinion but kind of the degree of viciousness in this community is something that really didn't exist three years ago and you know I hear a lot of developers who say like they were you know just turned off from the whole project you know working for either side really because it's just so nasty and personal and you know that there are other sort of communities other virtual currency communities that are just sort of more friendly places to be right do you have any theory about why it's changed so much in the last three years um I think that for the first six years bitcoins existence and we can sort of talk about this with with this in the history of it these this project had a leader so for the first two years it had a leader Satoshi Nakamoto who kind of generally had the final worked on things obviously you know open-source software you know everybody was running around the world but you know at the end of the day if nothing else he was the only person that commits access to you know the github repo and you know he then handed that over to Gavin Andresen who you know frequently referred to himself as a sort of benevolent dictator and you know he was somebody who could make a decision and just sort of cut things off and just stop the arguing at a certain point and since Gavin left there has not been a leader and that comes with certain advantages but I think it also comes with certain disadvantages and you've seen that and I think you know even sort of comparing it to aetherium I think is really interesting because the theorem obviously has a leader and a lot of people criticize the theorem for that but you know here's somebody who can sort of set the tone and you know at some point soar to step in and give an answer and obviously a lot of people don't like that about aetherium but you see how that plays out in the project in the community that forms around it right and I think the other thing that a theorem has going for it is that the people that disagree already split off and they have their own little project out with their own classics so I think that also helps although not we have the same a Bitcoin - yeah no it it does help I mean I think I think the other thing that happened and this is true of and Vitalik and sort of totally putting aside you know their technical chops or their vision for the project whatever it is they were interested in like goodwill they were interested in sort of goodwill prevailing and so you know if that meant certain compromises at certain point or sort of stepping back at certain points or or on the other hand sort of putting your foot down at certain points and saying like that's not like that's not an appropriate way to treat a person you know I'm in a community they wanted that and I think you know part of what you see in the Bitcoin community today is that there's a real viciousness on both sides and there isn't somebody sort of stepping in and saying you know you on my side like that's not how we want to treat people like this is a community we need to treat each other with respect and I think that's been true to a certain degree on both sides and and when you look when I've sort of looked more deeply metallic and and look back at Gavin going back he he didn't want a fight he and he was okay if you insulted him you know he always said you know I'm the I'm the sort of useful idiot in the project I mean he was kind of self self-deprecating in that way and I think Bitcoin sort of as a community could could use a bit more of that if it wants to be a welcoming place now all that being said you know I think to a certain degree you know to the degree that people want this to be a revolutionary project that isn't compromising you know maybe this is maybe this is the right way to go maybe it isn't a project that should compromise you know and that's that's I guess to some degree what this whole thing has been about you know in addition to what is the Bitcoin project going to look like is it going to be more focused on payments it's gonna be more focused on store value I think a big part of this was just like how do you compromise and you know I think to a certain degree sort of Bitcoin you know the the Bitcoin not Bitcoin cash has said at this point like we're not this isn't a community that compromises we can move forward and we can make changes and we can but it feels like that was sort of one of the markers that was laid down and that maybe that's what this project sort of wants to be you know that's what the followers sort of people who are buying at people are investing in it but I think that's sort of very much in the water right now as a subject of debate well something that was so interesting to me which you may not remember but when I was rereading the book by the way listeners I barely slept because I was trying to finish the book which I did do and I had read it before back in 2015 but I just wanted a refresher and by the way I need to recommend the book it is so good if you were into this stuff you definitely should read it is I think I'm the only really isn't the only narrative book on Bitcoin I think it is right I think that more recently Brian yee-haa has come out with one that is a is a sort of told as a story which is how I approached it I did not want to write a book that explains how Bitcoin works or why it will or won't be important I just wanted to sort of explain how it happened and who the people are and that's kind of been my my goal is not to come to any conclusions about what it is or isn't but just look at the people who are doing it and why they're doing it and how they're doing it and how it works and how it doesn't work and did you read brains foot because I I haven't yet I have not yet okay oh so they're okay it's not the only narrative book but it is the first narrative book and it was a really good one so I really do recommend it um but one thing I couldn't help but notice when I was reading it was that the vast majority of the main characters in your book ended up being too xers Gavin Erik Voorhees marcher fear Bobby Lee when Seska soros and then a bunch of the minor characters as well like Jeff Garza my turn very silver christeson Bryan Armstrong Fred or Simmons and if you don't know all these people um I am NOT going to run through all the lists of the CEO Nate or CEO the names of the companies that they're seeing us though or developers for by anyway I did know there were just a few one Xers who were charlie leave a crater like coin nick szabo a well-known cryptographer who sometimes thought of as Satoshi and then Charlie Shrem like switched from being it to X or 1x er Sony beneath theories about why that is or do you think it's just a random coincidence or it's a it's an interesting point I and I hadn't thought of that before I certainly had noticed that a lot of people who were really sort of passionate about Bitcoin on an ideological basis you know in you know libertarians who came to this because they wanted to evade government you know oversight you know government censorship you know you might think that they would end up on the small block size of of this argument you know that that the small block size is frequently kind of I think associated more with like purity ideological purity when it comes to these the ideas and values behind Bitcoin but you know they ended up on that too exciting I think you know to a certain degree when you look back at the history I mean I know there's so much you know quoting Satoshi to support this side or that side but you know I just I went back was was reading the white paper this week and I and you you you you notice when you read the white paper I mean first thing it talks about is cash right the first thing it talks about is electronic cash being able to do transactions outside government oversight so that was there very firmly and I think probably a lot of the early folks that I was writing about I think that's kind of what drew them in it was the fun of this thing that you could send around and you know I think there's no question that it's become harder to just simply send bitcoins around it's become more expensive they you know transactions get delayed now it could be that those problems could be worked through you know the Lightning Network could happen and this all gets that that this is no longer a problem right now there is not a solution so right now if you want to do the things that you know just sort of send money around you know Roger ver was famous for you know just anybody set up a wallet I'm gonna send you three dollars look how look how amazing this is you can't really do that anymore you know it cost five dollars to send somebody three dollars and I think that probably the kind of ideas about what bitcoin could be you know and what it is are evolving I think may be a part of that is early on it seemed like it could be everything it seemed like it could be everything to everybody it could be digital gold and it could be PayPal and I thought that I think that people really thought I could be both and I think is becoming clear over time that it can't really be everything and and I think there are a lot of really smart technical people who say it can't really be a payment system so so it's not worth trying to be that you know yes it could be a payment system if things are layered on top of that but in itself the Bitcoin network you know would have to scale so much you know it would have to you know orders of magnitude in order to handle payments in order to be able to compete with PayPal and Visa so you know you just look at on a practical basis it's not it's not worth trying to do that if such it's sort of an impossible goal but you know on the other hand when you look at sort of what was described initially there were a lot there was a lot more I mean I'd be interesting to do a kind of word bubble from Satoshi's early writings to see how often he talked about payments and cash versus commodity I mean he talked about both and again I think early on there was an idea that it could be both but I I do think that you know the first words of the abstract and the first words of the white paper and the first words of the first pitches he made were about cash and I think that you know going back the the the precedence for this or hash cash and digit cash and it was about digital cash it was about private anonymous digital cash you know looking back at the history of this whole project going back to the 90s and and so it's it's not entirely surprising that people would still have that in their head as the thing that they want this to be and I think what's interesting now is you you have this argument that maybe it's actually not fine that maybe what was there but it may not actually be that good for that and maybe you know we need to sort of acknowledge that reality yeah actually now that I think about it this was in your book a little bit where you describe the very very beginnings of it like the first year or two where he had written about digital cache and so forth and then somebody that got involved was it Martin Mull me it didn't re mommy yeah the finished kid yeah wasn't he the one that was all like injecting kind of a libertarian aspect or it was someone very early and I remember that Satoshi was a little bit like like there was some point when they're making the website or there was some aspect like that and then the person made it all about like this is about you know of leaving government simple and citrus was like whoa whoa whoa let's walk the language back there was some incident yeah I mean Marty mommy be interesting to check in with him actually see where he came down he's still he still gets involved he's not quite as visible but you know I think the thing that is amazing to me about Marty and I always talk about this with my book is you know he is really kind of he kept Bitcoin alive for about a year it was like it was gaining so little traction and he was so committed this kid Marty mom he started you know three or four months into the project to emailed Satoshi and said I love this you know can I help you build the website he was sort of doing all the dirty work for Satoshi and he would check in with Satoshi and say are you still doing this what's going on they're having many transactions in a while and I just love the fact that this guy who nobody has you know really heard of really sort of kept it going you kept faith when when even Satoshi it seemed like had lost faith but but Marty you know part of the reason he was so drawn to this was he was very ideologically driven he was probably one of you know six libertarians in Finland and his first descriptions of it were about sort of avoiding the government and and Satoshi you know and a lot of those early communication was much more cautious you know let's let's see how this works let's see how this evolved you know a lot of times you'd say I don't think we're ready for that yeah you know we're not we're not there yet and you know he he had that mentality of somebody of a service builder rather than you know a dreamer who just wanted to sort of throw it all up and say this is a revolution and you know we're gonna win the other thing I want to ask about link because I you know I just love that you do have this context of kind of the big picture from Bitcoin in its early days to know how would you place this segment to 2x chapter in the larger history of Bitcoin well I think one interesting thing I've been thinking about recently is that I think at a lot of points in bitcoins development so there's always been this tension between the kind of purists and then the new business interests coming in and kind of wanting you know to be more practical and realistic and that that has been this that has been this tug tug of war from you know this first year for the set you know I would say the first year or two that it didn't exist because there were like 20 people doing it but you know as soon as it started to have value you had this tug of war between like the new people who wanted to make it useful and the old people who were like no we have to you know keep keep the spirit of this thing alive and I think at a lot of previous points the new corporate folks who wanted to be more practical one and and I think one of the most fascinating things about this segue to Xing is that the the practical business interest did not win right so that as its scaled to its largest size ever the kind of grassroots idealism I think won out over that you know kind of like we need to be practical and and and expand this thing and so that's kind of a reversal and it's interesting too you know at the point where it's grown the most and and you know probably the most people are owning it having contact with it it's sort of its I know I wouldn't say gone back to its roots because I think both sides in this debate could you know legitimately argue that they're going back to the roots but the kind of people who aren't as interested in the business of it you know the the purists the the programmers have have won and so now that we do see all this pressure of new money coming in but yet at the same time on chain there's kind of like this limit that transactions might bump up against weird what do you think is gonna happen I mean mm yes yes certainly my guess is as good as yours and probably as good as any of the listeners I mean you know it's this is another one of these moments where you realize like Bitcoin is an experiment and we don't know how it's gonna turn out and I know that people on both sides are very certain of how it's gonna turn out they know exactly how it's gonna turn out but you know I think one thing we like to Bitcoin is that you just don't know how it's gonna turn out like how important was you know bitpay has it has all these companies that are using it to pay bills they're they're bitpay is helping pay salaries in foreign countries they've been using Bitcoin you know talking with them they've been pretty clear we are now going to look somewhere else like we have to look somewhere else they are already looking somewhere else they're already experimenting with other Park chains so if they stopped using Bitcoin does it matter if black market sites start you know shifting entirely to Manero or Zee cash does that matter how much did those transactions matter to this whole ecosystem and I I don't think we know I do think that again it's going to be a bit of a race to see if these second layer solutions if they can get you know the Lightning Network can that get going get working so that people can easily send Bitcoin around on the Lightning Network before people turn to etherium or Bitcoin cash or you know any number of other coins for these sorts of payment use cases which is is definitely something that a lot of businesses have been built on so I think that that's that's the the open question at this point and you know there's certainly an argument to be made that there's a real business use case for like the digital gold vision that this becomes the settlement layer that's that's like a reasonable argument but we don't know so work and you know again it's like this this idea that bitcoin is an experiment and that's I mean ultimately that's what keeps me coming back what makes this so fun to cover what makes it worth putting up with you know the the patrolling is that like you just don't know where this is is going to end up and I mean I you know I just think back to one of the pieces that got me more hate mail than anything else was my piece about Mike Hearn quitting Bitcoin I remember sort of a lot of the criticism when I first wrote that piece was you know he doesn't represent anybody he's gonna you know this is nothing this is gonna you know and that was like the beginning of three years of you know literally Civil War and you know I'm not saying Mike home was right but but that you know that thing that seemed really small at the time oh you know that's the we're gonna figure this out that he that his views on this don't matter like whether you think he was wrong or right the fact that he had strong opinions of it I think ended up mattering right I mean that those views were reflected by others and you know he did have a point that others ended up making not not about like the the price of Bitcoin you know he people love pointing out that he sold his bitcoins back then and missed out on all of this price appreciation but you know the concern that he expressed then was something that certainly ultimately resonated with a lot of other people who are trying to use this thing yeah well so I agree with you about it like I just can't stay away from this story because to me it's like the most exciting thing a night I have been interviewed Barry Silbert this week just for a really quick little story but um I think I asked him like how he felt about it and I said well I care because I'm disappointed because I don't get to write about like if an adoption can you imagine like that would have been the most amazing thing ever I was just like so excited for that like just from the spectator person right yeah to sort of see how the game theory of it worked out right but going back to because you you talk about you know covering this how did you even learn about Bitcoin in the first place and come to write the book I mean my first story was about Bitcoin for the New York Times was about the Winklevoss twins and the fact that they had amassed this sort of stock pile of bitcoins and at that point they had not been out with their interest in Bitcoin and they sort of came to us and I was just covering financial markets and we didn't have anybody writing about Bitcoin I think everybody had sort of thought it was gonna go away it was a joke and I wrote that story and then I just became the person who knew about this as it continued to go on and it probably took me a year before I didn't think it was gonna disappear and you know it was about the point where I thought okay you know what there's enough here that something of this is going to survive or do something interesting that I decided to write the book and actually a lot of it was not I mean some of it was that the kind of ideas behind the project but a lot of it was like after a year I just met enough people who had kind of given their lives over to this that I realized like this is a story of our time that needs to be told you know regardless of where this whole thing ends up like just the degree to which this has caused people to leave their old lives behind and sell everything they own and you know that whole idea just like what what is it about this I wanted to understand and you know that was I think when I decided I wanted to write a book about it okay so we're gonna talk about who Satoshi Nakamoto might be initial coin offerings Jamie Dimon and more but first I'd like to take a quick break to tell you about our fabulous sponsor on-ramp if you're starting up a new project or need some design or branding help on an existing one on ramp as he covered on ramp is a full-service

they've helped passionate entrepreneurs achieve their dreams go to think on-ramp comm thanks on-ramp ripping a supporter of this podcast and all of our listeners and speaking with Nathaniel popper tech report of the New York Times and the author of digital goals so let's talk about regulators how would you characterize the way US regulators have approached Bitcoin over time I think that probably the biggest surprise to me is the degree to which American regulators have been willing to leave it alone you know and let this go I mean there are so many ways in which the regulators could have decided to step in you know have the authority to step in you know if nothing else just to shut off banking relationships for for Bitcoin companies and you know they have done that to a degree I mean they they have warned banks about not working with companies particularly you know companies you know not working with established companies so that's that certainly happened but they've let a lot of this go and sort of very consciously let a lot of this go and that might be more sort of expected in the Trump era but you know the fact that even in the Obama era where there was more an interest in regulation there was there was a willingness to kind of let this develop was really you know fascinating I do think you know there are a lot of signals that even in the Trump air with what's happening with icos there's an awareness that oh wait we we need to do something here you know this there are a lot of people who are gonna lose a lot of money here and you know people are gonna look back and ask why we didn't do anything and so I think you're seeing a lot of signals from the SEC that they are looking at this hard so you basically think that now we're starting to see a change because more people are getting hurt and is getting more popular is that right well I think in the ico realm because prices have only been going up people haven't gotten hurt yeah you know for the most part but I think there's a clear awareness that a lot of people are going to get hurt a lot of these projects are going to go to zero and so I think you know those are where this particularly at the SEC that yeah like we need a we need to do something I mean we haven't really seen them act yeah I mean you know they basically just issued warning so far but you know it takes it takes a while to build cases and I would not be surprised at all if in the next few months you know we see some big cases against big names particularly the ICO space I also wanted to talk about China's early role in Bitcoin because that was kind of a big theme in your book obviously you know they played a major role in the beginning but now there's some miss down on Bitcoin exchanges and initial coin offerings so how would you kind of characterize its history in Bitcoin and we're in the role of might play going forward yeah I mean I think look until 2013 China essentially played no role and then sort of overnight in 2013 which is when this really kind of burst in the public consciousness a lot of that was because of this Chinese interest in it and what that Chinese interest did to the price of Bitcoin so you know it led to that first spike up to $1,200 in late 2013 you know so much of that was these these Chinese exchanges and and that price spike is what got attention you know and what what got everybody looking at this thing and trying to understand it you know you hear so many people in Silicon Valley who say it was 2013 when I first really started looking at this and trying to understand it and you know people sort of poopoo the price spikes and and also you know are unhappy that bitcoins associated with all the the Silk Road stuff and the drug stuff but it's all of that that got people interested in this and made people want to look at it and so I think you know and then from 2013 till really this year China was essentially the sort of dominant country in Bitcoin you know most of the trading and most of the mining I mean not the developers but trading and mining and now what we've seen this year I guess is sort of trading has largely gone away you know because of this crackdown and now mining is still there but it's gonna be I think the open question is whether the end of the exchanges is gonna mean that those miners can't really get rid of their you know offload their bitcoins in order to pay their bills and if if they can't do that can they keep those facilities open there does this start to migrate elsewhere but certainly like this year the fact that you could sort of stamp out trading in China and everything could kind of go on sort of largely unhindered I mean I guess maybe I just mean that the price could keep going up does suggest the way in which this has there are a lot of different places that are now involved in this you know Japan and Korea have become so enormous in this as well as the United States and so you know it's you know being a truly international project it's not I don't think it's a currency but it's it's an international project and that's pretty amazing to see that you know it could survive that so easily yeah and one other thing that was so interesting to me was here we are in 2017 Japan has made Bitcoin an official currency its licensed 11 Bitcoin exchanges but in your book and I don't know if you remember this um when Roger Maris first moved there he found that people were very wary of big yeah yeah and they said why do you think that was their initial reaction and money it's like completely gone the other way well for fear of being a sort of national reductionist I'm gonna tell you what Japanese people have told me with that important caveat I I think that what Japanese people told me is that and I and I saw this when I spent time there you know it Japan's a very like tech fork country but it is still very much a country where where you follow the leader you don't try to charge ahead and sort of break you know it's not a revolutionary country in that way you still call the leader and so you know Bitcoin was this like radical new thing that that the government you know had nothing to do with and I think you know that scared people away in Japan for many years and what you essentially got this year was the government gave it a kosher sign you know gave it its its imprimatur and said okay bitcoins okay and it was right after that happened that it took off there and so you know this is another one of these sort of funny ironies in bitcoins history where you know this currency that was supposed to be about evading the government gained its support gained distraction because of the government you know because of government support for it that's what that's that's why it's taken off in Japan you know I think it's something I heard from a number of Japanese exchanges this isn't my interpretation of it and so you know the degree to which governments still sort of have not control over it but sort of determine its its fate is fascinating to see and the other thing about watcher fear is reading your book again I realize that Roger played a much bigger role in bitcoins early history than I kind of like think about today or or really remember and so how would you characterize the role that he played overall in Bitcoin and then I also wondered you know here he is now evangelizing Bitcoin cash and he's also in Japan where obviously there's this big crypto mania I don't know if you have any thoughts on what what he might do or where them I go I know I don't I don't have a great read on Roger today I like spent a lot of time with him in the writing of this book but I have not stayed up with him well enough to have a sense of sort of the specifics of what he's doing and sort of where he's pushing well you know on his roll I think like you know I say this all the time about these projects about Bitcoin about aetherium you know their social movements that need marketing and they're about getting new people to be interested and new people have to be convinced and Roger you know probably convinced more individual people to get into this project than almost anybody or at least he tried to you know he's kind of like the Mormon proselytizer of the Bitcoin world like he just went out and knocked on every door he could and every conversation he got in every taxi he got and he would you know talk this project up and you know as we've seen with icos marketing is everything it doesn't matter what the substance if you have good marketing and roger was a very good marketer for for Bitcoin and you know I think now he's probably going to be a very good marketer for Bitcoin cash but the other thing that I had very early on was that he had money to throw into this market and you know he he in 2011 to the 12 when he got into this I mean just him buying alone could push the price up five dollars you know is very illiquid back then it's still very illiquid now you know you hear this from the big traders in the space that this is why banks won't get into it fine there's you know on a good day there's two billion dollars trading you know that's nothing compared to like significant you know securities and the in you know the United States currencies you know the amount of their trade is trillions of dollars a day and it's very it is still very maybe not very easy but it is still quite easy for somebody to move the price of certainly a Bitcoin cash and and probably a Bitcoin so I think you know there's a degree of that going online now that we're probably not aware of but you know somebody like Roger who has a lot of money you know if you pull five million dollars out of Bitcoin in an hour the price is gonna drop if you do it even if you don't want the prices drop it will drop if you want the prices drop then you can really make it drop yeah well what's interesting is I don't know if you saw but this morning so it was near as we're recording this on Friday before the Friday before this episode comes out um but when I woke up they coin cash was at like eight eight hundred dollars and then right before recording this thing so it was at nine sixty three and then obviously in Bitcoin itself is lower than seven thousand and earlier this week it was up at like seven eight hundred so I don't know do you have any sense of what is going on or why that might be no I mean I think one thing I learned in writing about the book when you actually sort of dig into why the price increased at one time or another you frequently get a different answer than sort of the obvious answer like you know in 2013 everybody thought the price was going to because the Cyprus banks were you know putting a hold on people's bank accounts and that did happen at the same time that the price went up but when I went back and sort of looked at like who was buying you know when seska's arias who's a main character in my book that was right after he'd come from a couple of conferences where he'd convinced like billionaires that this was worth doing so there were a bunch of billionaires trying to buy millions of dollars that month and you can you could literally see when the price jumped and you know maybe Cyprus gave them a bit more confidence or interest in it but it wasn't Cyprus it was these people who were buying bitcoins and right now you know it's people buying bitcoin cash I think you know you can give the kind of outsider explanation which is you know again there are gonna be businesses that want to do payments you know bitpay has already said they're gonna be looking for other blockchains to do payments on you know makes sense that bitcoin cash would be one of those and so they wouldn't want to hold as many bitcoins so you know that's like a reasonable answer but I think you know maybe if either of us dug moat enough we would find out that there were specific people who were buying and selling now that were probably moving things yeah maybe Rutter himself since obviously I'm sure he's upset no okay so let's also talk about who's Satoshi Nakamoto is do you have any theories about this did you have you looked into it by the way I mean I I haven't looked into it so you know when I my book came out I wrote a story and it's sort of you know including material on the book about the person who I take to be the best bet which is Nick Szabo and I I think I'm still in a position where I think he's probably the best bet I mean I I'm not saying he is Satoshi but of the people that we know I think it's probably not Craig right you know that seemed to be pretty clear unless Craig Wright was trying to purposely do a bad job of proving his case in order to throw people off the trail it's not Craig right and I think that theory it doesn't make sense because then why do all the you know the press thing like with the wired and what was the other publication cheeky or whatever like why do that big press thing and then like not follow through it you know I yeah I think probably he's just not Satoshi maybe he kind of was in touch with people at that point or some of the people I think like there's a pretty good chance that it was a couple of people working together although you know when I really think you know I just like read every everything he wrote every message every email and you know something about that still makes me think it was a person because it was just a consistent voice and it was a consistent voice of somebody who kind of had ups and downs emotionally maybe there's just one person who is doing the emails and somebody who was doing the codeine but it just felt like somebody who you know occasionally heard of the projects and got busy and and and so something it may still you know thinks from the evidence that I looked at that it's probable it was a person but I think it's also very plausible that it could have been a group I mean again I I think the sort of case I put down for why Nick's I was a good candidate still hold I mean he's he said many times he's not and and and I think part of the reason I wrote that story about Nick was because even if he isn't Satoshi understanding him and his background is really helpful for understanding where this project came from because a lot of the ideas sort of filtered through him and a couple of other people and so you know even if you don't think he's Satoshi understanding where he comes from and how he thinks about this is really helpful and understanding the origins of Bitcoin okay well I was hoping you were gonna like reveal it all on my pockets but I guess that's not gonna happen um so you wrote this great article on how shady someone I SEOs can be describe what you uncovered in that story and what you think that means that we're all for crypto going forward so my my story was about Sentra and you you wrote a story about Lydian coin I think you know both of them were kind of stories about the fact that you know these projects were run by people who if anybody had done even a basic background check they would have realized these things and that's where you are with icos at this point that's that's it's worth being aware that there is nobody doing basic background checks on this I mean you still you're starting to have a few sites but you know I'm struck by the fact that you know there are all these ICO research firms that seem to be making a lot of money and yet they have not turned up any of these scams they haven't turned up I mean they seem to be there to write positive stories about icos and I think that right now there are a lot of probably a lot more negative stories that could or should be written because you know this is a universe in which there is really nobody checking and like the crowdsourcing of this just doesn't seem to be cutting it because you know in the case of Sentra I mean there were so many red flags and they raised thirty five million dollars and you know just how does how does that how does happen and you know I think it happens because you know this at this point it's all about marketing and there isn't that kind of layer of people who are sort of looking into these projects and I you know that may be starting to evolve but that's that's saying you know you you have to sort of contend with when you talk about icos and you know how they can change the world yeah I I had Smith in crowd on podcast and they were saying like they don't want to give us no but approval to anything and stuff like that and and I sort of I mean I get that too because even at Forbes me just we discuss doing certain different things around tokens and I was just like listen don't do anything where were you know putting our improvements or on any of these but who's gonna say was oh yeah and I think like for us like you and I are our role is he's been more important than before um so one other thing that was funny to me about your book or I don't know funny is the word but um would've kind of like the hottest and most secretive companies you describe in your book is 21 which of the time was doing mining and hardware and chips and stuff and recently now it's changes thing to earn it's basically doing like paint paying people in cryptocurrency for doing tasks um what do you think that this I was even aware of that latest iteration of their business I knew the intermediate one where you know they you'd pay somebody to send an email to them but I didn't I mean Aaron calm you know balaji who founded this whole thing is like a creature of Silicon Valley and these are like classic Silicon Valley pivots where you know one thing doesn't work you you try another thing and you know it's it's it's telling how hard it is to build a real business on this I mean you know today you know there really are not very many businesses you know ongoing businesses that do that that you know found a business model doing anything other than buying and selling bitcoins yeah well coin basis on me clean coin based on zoppo I think there are two other right chain there there they make their money buying and telling Bay and even circle it no one knows but you know they're a big market maker and that's how they make less their money ya know buying and sign bitcoins is a good business I think that's one of the things that I have been particularly fascinated with recently you know as everybody talks about you know it's going to change this industry in that industry it's worth sort of dwelling on the fact or contemplate the fact that at least as far as I can think of there is no no business that uses the blockchain other than to buy and sell like that makes money that pays salaries other than buying some Bitcoin now the bit pay may be an exception they process Bitcoin transactions for people I'm sure there are some other you know three-person companies that that that do it maybe you know they're certainly consulting firms that make a lot of money but I'm always out there asking as a journalist show me a company that is doing something on the blockchain or on Bitcoin or on aetherium where they make money it's an actual business they're not just testing something an actual business doing anything other than buying some Bitcoin now I'm not it may happen like but at this point it's it's worth kind of memory it's like it's all theorizing still it's all just like hypotheses about what can happen I mean do you can you think of any III often challenge people I I'm not saying I've no no every company but so the only one that came to mind was me the theme but I don't remember I don't even remember if he told me what their revenues are or if they're cashflow positive or anything and they don't use the Bitcoin watching exclusively but basically they do b2b payments okay only between you know the US and Canada or even within the US or whatever but they do a variety of things they yeah use I think multiple blockchains and sometimes even we use their own ledger like if if two of the customers aren't both on beam but right but yeah I think it's a small yeah there probably are some payments where there's probably some remittance companies that may be doing it I mean I'm always interested to hear like how much cheaper are you like when you include all transactions how much cheaper are you then using transfer it's for that corridor or I had never fully been able to to sort of get a read into that and be convinced that that's a that that is a real business that I mean it may be some at some point but I mean I think about this more in relation to icos which is that all these I SEOs are saying you know these tokens are gonna work in this way and do this and have these incentives and create this sort of economy and I think that's really where you say like the only economy that's been proven to work so far is the Bitcoin economy but you know like the incentives there are doing something real they support this currency but we don't know if this whole sort of system of incentives and this method of organizing can support anything else what do you think of the theory well I think it's the same I mean it's the same thing it's working to support a currency and people are building on top of it so you can build things on top of it but none of the things that have been built on top of it are sort of functioning businesses at this point as far as I know again I may not know every you know there's you know things like augur their prediction markets that are sort of in testing but I don't really maybe they're working but are they better than the alternative are they making money I mean that's that's that's really like the test for me is are you running a business that makes money on this other than buying and selling bitcoins and facilitating payments is maybe like there's some layer doing that the theorem is like working in the same way that I think bitcoin is working you know the incentives are working to encourage miners to participate and secure the network that seems to work but can any other system of incentives work it could be I think at this point and but and again I'm I'm interested in hearing like I I get emails every day and these are the questions I ask to people can anything else work maybe I think we have no idea at this point I think that's sort of again where this whole thing is an experiment and we don't know where it's going to end up and like you know theoretically you can explain your economic system and how it's going to work but you know one of the things from bitcoins story is that oftentimes it plays out very differently than you then even the creator's expect oh yeah definitely I only say that this is I feel like I have a front-row seat to the most suspenseful movie ever right oh yeah so one other thing that when asked him it was I knew too sauce on your butt that in 2014 Jamie Dimon was basically singing a lot of the same things he's been saying about the coin recently like that Bitcoin will never amount to anything real that and basically the government won't allow something like this but why do you think he hasn't really changed his views I mean I think he's kind of like he's a pretty old-fashioned guy I think you know there's a tendency to read like kind of ulterior motives into people you know like he's scared that this is going to threaten JP Morgan I definitely don't think he's scared that it's going to threaten JP Morgan I think he probably legitimately thinks it's stupid and and I don't mean legitimately like he's writing and thinking that I think that's just what he thinks and I mean I know I used to cover JP Morgan I used to cover him as a banking it's just a guy who speaks his mind he's also a guy who doesn't always you know dig into things so deeply you know he's not some intellectual who's trying to understand things he kind of looks at the basics and and draws his conclusions and I think you know he just made that conclusion and he's kind of sticking to it and it you know I think the interesting thing there is just that he has let his bank be one of the leaders in working with blockchain you know aside from Bitcoin sort of you know they've created this quorum sort of instance of aetherium which is you know not not the open source theory I'm not not the open blockchain all that but you know quorum is like a real thing that a lot of people are using and you know he has some real sort of they're leading the way on that and so it's it's just I think that iron is is interesting but I think it's also there are a lot of people Jamie if if this is Jamie diamonds position there are a lot of people who think like you know I'm not gonna touch a public blockchain but private blockchains could be very interesting like he's me wouldn't be the only place and right now that's kind of their position as a Bank private blockchains can be very interesting but you know public watchings no thank you yeah they just want to sub watchings to make their world more efficient but I think in me well I personally think and those will be much less quote unquote interesting yes back-end like SAS enterprise software is not interesting and for for a year there it seemed like covering this was going to involve covering enterprise software and it was got very scary and thankfully the interesting stuff came back the radicals and the revolutionaries and the people who want to change the world and you know that that's what makes this project interesting yeah ok so just one last question is there anything I didn't ask you about that you want to mention there's anything top of mine in the crypto space boy so much but I none of it's none of its immediately coming to me I mean this is just you know one of these things that I this is not the only thing I cover you know I'm responsible for covering sort of the the future of money and the intersections of finance and Technology more broadly but it's very hard to stay away from this this is sort of it's so much more interesting and so much else of what's going on in Silicon Valley these days and so it's just you know always kind of dominating my thinking but I think you're doing a good job of sort of following the evolution of this and all the unexpected places it goes Thanks that means a lot coming from you thank you well this has been a great discussion so how can people get in touch with you well my twitter handled nathaniel popper I have my email address and you know DM me there it's probably the easiest way but I try to be pretty easy to reach okay well thanks so much for coming on the show thank you for having me thanks to everyone for joining today's episode on the history of Bitcoin and
