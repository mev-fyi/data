[Music] thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap the infrastructure bill will most likely become law on monday on november 5th the united states house of representatives passed the infrastructure investment and jobs act which contains two provisions that could heavily affect cryptocurrency tax reporting so-called crypto brokers must report customer gains via a 1099 and any transactions over ten thousand dollars to the internal revenue service to many in the crypto community including advocacy groups such as coin center and the blockchain association the bill defines a broker too broadly and could potentially impose reporting requirements on entities such as crypto miners and wallet developers for whom it will be impossible to comply in addition to the broad definition of broker the bill includes an amendment to tax code 6050i which would require entities to report personal data on trading partners like social security numbers for digital asset transactions over ten thousand dollars coin center described the requirements of the bill as unworkable and possibly unconstitutional even more striking not reporting such an event would now be deemed a criminal felony according to abe sutherland in his appearance on unchained in october jake travinsky the newly hired executive vice president and head of policy at the blockchain association explained that getting the language changed is most likely a lost cause in the short term importantly nothing will happen right away he said the crypto provisions don't go into effect until 2024 we can try to get them repealed or amended before then he also noted the 2022 midterm elections could reshape congress's attitude toward crypto however if nothing can be done to amend the legislation by 2024 a redefinition could fall to the treasury department it's up to the treasury department to decide who is subject to the provisions said ivory johnson founder of delancey wealth management to nbcnbc similar to the broker definition the treasury department will have to provide guidance twitter embraces web3 via dedicated crypto team twitter announced a new business unit dedicated solely to

regulatory scrutiny from the united kingdom japan germany the united states and other jurisdictions q3 was tough for crypto communities especially coinbase third quarter earnings reports have slowly begun filtering out and the numbers for crypto companies have not been pretty coinbase for example saw a decline in monthly transacting users by 16 trading volume by 29 and net revenue by 39 between q2 of 2021 and q3 in response to the earnings report coinbase or coin shares fell roughly 10 on tuesday afternoon and after hours trading as of press time coin is down 4.1 on the week other

u.s securities and exchange commission or sec stopped a wyoming-based decentralized autonomous organization or dao from registering two tokens as securities the dao named the american crypto fed dow llc was legally recognized in wyoming as a limited liability company or llc back in july following wyoming's decision to allow such an action the sec alleges that the dao filed a materially deficient and misleading registration form known as a form 10 that failed to contain certain required information about the dow's business or tokens the sec alleges that the tokens ducot and lock are equity securities rather than utility tokens as the dow attempted to describe them according to gabriel shapiro general counsel at delphi digital it appears american crypto fed dao llc was a sham to be clear i don't fault the sec for this he said it clearly was a troll but does show that the come in and register not so easy of a thing he added this is getting farcical we need a better way ens rose 100
