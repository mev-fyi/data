Michael sondenschein CEO of great skill welcome Michael hey great to be here thanks for having me the grayscale Bitcoin trust or gbtc is currently trading at a 42 discount to the net asset value or nav because the two percent fees on the trust are tied to the Neff people invested in the trust are effectively paying almost a four percent fee per year compared to the price of the underlying and on top of that investors cannot redeem their shares for Bitcoin and also would probably struggle to share their shares to somebody else willing to pay those fees do you think that's an appropriate fee for investors to pay when they don't have the option to leave the product well so a couple things to clarify there Laura so one the total annual management fee for any and all gbtc shareholders is two percent right and when somebody invests in the product it's not as though they put a dollar in and 98 Cents Only goes into you know giving them exposure to bitcoin it's instead similar to other investment products that the underlying Bitcoin per share ratio over the course of a year will decline by two percent and the fee on the product today I think is certainly borne by you know just a lot of costs that go into running a product in the crypto space it's not analogous today to the kind of economies of scale that you'll see for Equity products or fixed income products and we've said publicly and I'll say to you again um we are committed to lowering the fee on gbtc when it converts to an ETF but certainly in the meantime all the fees that are being generated on gbtc that is all the the capital that we as an organization are putting into our lawsuit against the SEC bringing the best legal Minds possible to the case and really just continuing to advocate for for our investors so we feel very strongly about the case the full resources of the firmware behind it and again yeah we'll we'll lower fees in an ETF State yeah so let's actually now just play out some of the scenarios around the lawsuit you know for listeners well catch them to see grayscale is suing the SEC over its denial of Grace kills Bitcoin ETF application oral arguments will be heard March 7th which is coming up pretty soon if it fails you've said that you would appeal you know at this point you were saying that under the ETF that's when you would consider lowering the fees there's another scenario where you would appeal but if the appeal also is not you know is not successful then are there any other conditions under which you would reduce the fees sure so let me just lay this out just to set the record straight and who better to do it with than you contrary to what folks may think we didn't somewhere along this journey in the last nine years decide that an ETF was the ultimate goal for gbtc right an ETF format was what we always conceived of and that's always what we intended to do even before we launched the product back in 2013. so we have been on a journey for the last nine years not only growing this product and bringing Bitcoin accessibility to investors in a regulated and accessible you know accessible way but we've always been in pursuit of an ETF so when we think about the journey that we've been on yes it was very unfortunate and very disappointing that the SEC um denied our application to convert gbtc to an ETF in June of 2022. investors have been patient we think investors deserve this and it really is a signal that in the near term investors have really seen that their regulator is you know pretty much shutting the door on the opportunity to take the world's largest Bitcoin fund and bring it closer into the regulatory perimeter so it left us no option other than to initiate a lawsuit right we have a fiduciary obligation to our shareholders this is what they want and and this is what they deserve so we had to proceed that way the case is moving swiftly so again we've filed the case in June of 2022 it's now late January 2023 oral arguments as you said coming up in a couple of weeks and we do expect a decision on the case by this fall the fall of 2023. if we lose the case although we're confident that we have really Common Sense straightforward arguments we've definitely seen overwhelming support for the strength of our arguments that the SEC is looking at Bitcoin Futures ETFs in Bitcoin spot ETFs in a very disparate way in an arbitrary kind of capricious manner we would seek to appeal the case a couple of weeks ago as well in the spirit of transparency we did really want to communicate to investors that if ultimately we exhaust all of our judicial options and again that would really not only be you know continuing to fight the SEC in in a Judicial setting but it would also mean that the SEC was you know continuing to deny investors the additional protections of an ETF and we were done with all options we would then consider putting you know a tender offer right a tender offer would be a material deviation from the long-term path that this product has been on and of course the details of a tender offer would need to be worked out with the SEC receive shareholder approval SEC approval but that would be an outcome that would really again be more indicative of regulatory postures than it would be grayscale's intentions or what investors ultimately want which we know is an ETF and can you walk us through what that tender offer would look like it's really tough to say because a tender offer is really rooted in the idea of the details of which being completely fair and Equitable for all shareholders and so when you have a product like Bitcoin or in this case gbtc where the value of the asset moves around every single day you know a more bespoke tender offer would need to be worked out with the SEC to get comfortable that the tender offer was being administered in a fair and Equitable manner so as we mentioned at the beginning of the show a number of investors are underwater on their gbtc investment and also paying you know what to them feels like high fees and I'm sure you're aware that some segment of them are calling for grayscale to seek what's called regulation M relief from the SEC that would allow investors to redeem the shares for the underlying asset which is in this case Bitcoin why has grayscale not filed for the regime relief you know I I get you know your timelines uh that you talked about for the um lawsuit and stuff but are you essentially saying to these investors that they need to hang on for the resolution to that because that obviously is that's a long that's that's a long wait uh for some of these people that for instance have this money in their retirement accounts and are you know not really able to enjoy the fruits of their labor so Laura it's another great question and let's let's take this opportunity to clear up some confusion about this regulation m is something that is really tied to ETFs what regulation M offers is a product relief from regulation M to simultaneously create and redeem shares and so reg m is an exemption or an exemption from Regan is something that's granted to all ETF applicants and so in ETF as we all know is a financial instrument that you know is holding some other asset or giving exposure to some other asset and because the ETF will move around you know throughout any trading day it's important that the ETF is able to be kept in line with the value of what it owns based on creations and redemptions and an exemption from reggae so those folks that are calling for reg M being something that's obtainable in a vacuum that's simply just not a possibility and so when we think about the conversion to an ETF when we think about the application that was denied by the SEC when we think about now the lawsuit grayscale has filed challenging that decision the core heart of what that lawsuit is is not just an ETF but obviously comes with reg M relief as well so the investors that want to see that regular relief they're the ones that you know are certainly can be frustrated with the discount we as a team are frustrated with it too we want to see reg M relief we want to see the conversion to an ETF and that really is the core part of the case and really what we're advocating for hedge fund fur tree is suing grayscale to obtain more details around the trust and it looks like they're doing so in the hopes of getting grayscale to resume Redemption and also cut fees are you going to grant their requests for information and do you feel that shareholders are entitled to that yeah you know it's funny to see that so many investors are are taking an interest in grayscale in grayscale's operations we continue to feel that you know the ETF is going to be the best long-term solution for any and all shareholders again IT addresses any concerns over fees being too high because we've committed to lowering them in an ETF State and we're also confident in the strength of you know of our lawsuit um against the SEC and so I think given the the kind of recent mistrust we've seen in and around in the crypto space there has certainly been you know a small vocal minority of folks that are further frustrated um and we share in that frustration Laura we really do in a moment we're going to talk about some of the questionable incidents that have happened around gbtc but first a quick word for the sponsors who make

description back to my conversation with Michael last Friday bankruptcy documents showed that Gemini liquidated 31 million shares of gbtc that had been pledged to it by Genesis and they liquidated all of that in a single transaction in November because gbtc is a restricted security an issuer of the these kinds of restricted Securities cannot sell more than one percent of the shares per quarter and this was actually a sale of five percent of all the shares did grayscale know that this liquidation was going to happen so as the case is with any investment manager or with any investment product out there we're not necessarily going to be party to every transaction that takes place so the result of what you're seeing and when you saw it in the market is the same time our team saw it so the transaction that you're referencing I think was something that was floated through the documentation that Genesis Capital put out as a part of their bankruptcy proceedings that kind of detailed the transaction between Genesis and Gemini we were not party to the transaction itself and we're not aware of the transaction itself that it had so if the transaction took place as documented then would you agree that the amount sold was five times the allowed limit so I am not a rule 144 expert so it'd be tough for me to comment on it I would you know certainly direct you to to the folks at Genesis or Gemini to really think through the transaction although I'm sure both of those parties were very thoughtful about the transaction given the relationship that they so another big gbtc trade that's been talked about quite a bit this past year was for instance sort of this levered long trade using gptc uh made famous perhaps my three arrows Capital can you talk about how you think that trade worked sure so I think certainly earlier in gbt's life cycle we've seen the product trade at both premiums and discounts to its net asset value and so there was certainly a period of time where gbtc was in fact trading at a premium to its net asset value and so investors who were subscribing to the private placement when they were locked up you know cause of the private placement shares anywhere from either 12 months or eventually six months once gbtc became an SEC reporting company they had to certainly take the risk on over that 12 or six month period not knowing where they'd be able to monetize their gbtc shares out in the public market and so for some investors who waited out that 12 or 6 month period they may have reached a time when their shares became freely tradable and gbtc was trading at a premium to its nav or a premium to where the spot bitcoin price was and thus were able to actually monetize their investment at a value you that would have earned them a higher you know return than have they just gone long Bitcoin itself and so that is you know certainly something that some investors were able to profit from and do you think that they were also buying shares of gbtc pledging that as collateral with Genesis to obtain more Bitcoin which they were then using to create more gbtc shares yeah so certain investors were able to obtain loans um to be able to trade in gbtc or to you know create shares of gbtc the collateral Arrangements I think with each of those investors would have been different in something that Genesis would have been the party that was extending credit to the investor not something that was born by grayscale and so for the structure of gbtc investors are not allowed to transfer shares until after six months and those shares also cannot be uncumbered for that period was Genesis allowing 3ac to use these so-called unseasoned shares shares you know that are less than six months old to borrow Bitcoin yeah so I think that there's some minutia um to get into there into the legal dots that surround gbtc and the unencumbrance has to do with the underlying Bitcoin that you know stays within our products itself and so the Bitcoin that underpins gbtc the ethereum that underpins ethi those coins are unencumbered they're owned by the shareholders themselves they're not loaned out um there's no liens or pledges Etc against them but there is certainly the opportunity for shares to be pledged in certain Financial arrangements so long as those are disclosed and signed off oh oh and that wouldn't violate that that restriction against them being encumbered so long as the pledges are properly like disclosed and documented okay Genesis had long been gbtc's authorized participant and what that means is That's The Entity that has the ability to create and redeem shares in the trust in October grayscale changed the authorized participant to grayscale and obviously the timing on that you know October is the month before things went uh you know quite far south in the crypto Community why did grayscale make that change at that time so it was actually a change that I believe we set in motion about a year or a year and a half prior to that October d as we have been continuing to grow as an organization some of the functions that we've been working to build out are for instance our own broker dealer and our own registered investment advisor and so in 22 we obtained both grayscale Securities our broker dealer and grayscale advisors our Ria and so it was quite a bit further along than uh that October time frame that this was already on a path to having operational Independence and actually taking over the role as authorized participant here at grayscale security so this was something that was planned for and just happened to be a switch over in and around that October 2022 timeline I'm sure you're very well aware the crypto Community has a lot of questions about the relationships between grayscale Genesis and dcg can you explain sort of what the information is that grayscale for instance has about Genesis you know do you know who the shareholders are do you know when transfers occur how is information shared how are decisions made just to outline all of that yeah so I think from an outside perspective it's sometimes a little hard for folks to wrap their head around but dcg digital currency group is a conglomerate and there's tons of conglomerates out there and whether it's you know Berkshire Hathaway is a conglomerate that owns netjets and Geico and other businesses or lvmh as a conglomerate and owns tons of companies underneath it that are operating subsidiary is I think the dcg scenario is really analogous to those where grayscale is a standalone entity that has you know Common ownership Under the dcg Umbrella the same is true of Genesis the same is true of you know coindesk or trade block or you know Foundry and so grayscale is a standalone entity separate and distinct from these other businesses I have my own management teams surrounding me we have our own budgets our own governance our own policies our own procedures as I shared our own broker dealer our own Ria and so we're not privy to you or party to um what's transpiring in any of the other entities despite the fact that they are owned wholly by digital currency and can you also just in that I mean maybe you sort of answered it but I think people are also very curious to know how involved Barry is very Silber the head of dcg how involved he is in the decision making and strategy of grayscale so I think given that a lot of what has happened at grayscale was Barry's idea to start you know Barry was the one who was early enough into Bitcoin to say I think we should start an investment vehicle to make it easier for people to access Bitcoin as early as 2013 when folks quite frankly Laura thought he was crazy you know I think you know strategically and and directionally uh Barry has said grayscale out on a path but then he you know brought someone like myself in and I brought a you know leadership team in around me as well to really execute on that early Vision that Barry had and so he is not involved in day-to-day decisions he's not involved in you know changes to policies and procedures um you know Barry's Focus has primarily been on investing at the dcg level whether that's in protocols and I think dcg now is invested in over 200 companies um in over 40 countries around the world so a lot of his Focus there is on keeping track of what's transpiring in the broad you know crypto asset class on a global level and not you know being bogged down in the decisions that my leadership team and I are making day to day here Grace the trust documents were also restated to remove shareholder rights specifically the right for shareholders to replace the sponsor as long as there was a 75 threshold of shareholders in favor of that why was that move made and can you talk a little bit about the process for changing the trust documents yeah so there have been uh several amendments to the trust agreement over the life of gbtc and in other grayscale products which is something that's not unique to our product family you see changes occur all the time in investment products and to be clear when changes do come about to the extent that they are the least bid or possibly adverse to shareholders they are ratified by a majority of shareholders so these are not decisions that grayscale is making in a silo um so it's really important to know that you know that exact you know distinction so any of the changes that have been you know put forth out to shareholder others have in fact given them you know the statutory opportunity to weigh in on any of those changes and ultimately weigh in on them over time and do you publish the results of those shareholder votes you know that's a really good question I think the last time the trust agreement was updated may have been as recent as 2016 or 2017 when perhaps there were some changes associated with you know converting gbtc to an ETF but I'm not sure of the exact date or the last time the trust agreement was updated so you know as we alluded to at the beginning of this there are a number of investors in gbtc who are you know they're hurting at this moment and I wondered if you felt that there was anything that grayscale or dcg could have done differently to engender more trust um if there's anything over the last few years that you know you feel um could have you know been improved upon I gotta say Laura I think that we have amassed an unbelievable investor base we have now a million or more than a million investor accounts in the us alone that own gbtc all 50 states are represented small holders large holders institutional holders gbtc is inside of ETFs inside of mutual funds and so I'm really proud of the team that I built the work that we've done and I feel that shareholders do in fact trust that we operate as an organization that has you know really thought about not only its construction but its operation we were born in the U.S we made use of existing U.S rules and regulations we've continued to push the limits on Fair and full disclosure for investors we voluntarily went to the SEC and became the first SEC reporting company we work to develop definitions risk factors policies all of which has only resulted in greater shareholder protection and you know I think you'd be hard-pressed to find another asset manager that is you know so bold as to actually file a lawsuit against the regulator that oversees every aspect of their business and that's a decision that you know both as a CEO and we as a team we didn't take that decision lightly but we knew it was the right thing to do for our shareholders and so we have been on a journey on this path towards ETF and we continue to again feel really strong about our arguments and really continuing to advocate for shareholders yeah and I should add that just before recording um Andrew Parrish who has very active Twitter feed where he talks a lot about what's going on at uh grayscale at dcg in Genesis he tweeted that uh you know somebody took a a look at the legal arguments and felt that they were very strong to the point where they thought maybe they could even go to the Supreme Court and um you know for more information on that I either did an interview with Matt Hogan or I at least wrote an article in which I quoted him I will put whatever whatever piece of content that was in the show notes so people can find out those arguments but Michael it has been such a pleasure having you on Unchained thanks for coming on the show thanks for having me Laura always good to chat don't forget next up is the Weekly News recap stick around for this week in crypto after this short break thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap blockfi has a 1.2 billion dollar exposure to FTX and Alameda bankrupt

may be under collateralized given the decline in the price of Bitcoin mining equipment the entity's bidding for the debts will likely be debt collection businesses buying for cents on the dollar U.S

also been long known as Bitcoin Jesus the lender claims Veer failed to settle crypto options transactions before the expiry date this is not the first lawsuit against Veer as coinflex a crypto

obligated to do so Celsius plans to issue a token to repay creditors bankrupt crypto lender Celsius is planning to pay back creditors by issuing a new token according to a recent report from Bloomberg the attorney for Celsius Ross M questenia informed a bankruptcy court that the new token would be part of a payout plan from a reorganized company that is properly licensed however this plan needs to be approved by a creditor committee before it can move forward according to coindesk the proposed token is called asset share token AST creditors who are owed an amount of crypto above a certain threshold would receive AST which they can either retain for potential dividends or sell in the marketplace the platform's remaining customers would be given a one-time distribution of liquid crypto assets the lawyers for excelsius the lawyers for Celsius also stressed that despite the recent ruling that Assets in Celsius earn program are the property of the exchange's estate and not of customers burned customers would be treated like everyone else in the eventual recovery of assets Additionally the mining division of Celsius plans to temporarily house 20 000 rigs that it is currently retrieving from core scientific which could put the troubled firm founded by Alex machinski in a better position binance makes a mistake in its accounting Finance the world's largest crypto exchange acknowledged that it made a mistake in storing token reserves and customer funds in the same wallet as per a Bloomberg report the reserves for nearly half of the 94 tokens issued by binance known as B tokens were stored in a single wallet called binance 8. according to the exchange's website this wallet contains more assets in reserve than our required as collateral for the issued B tokens indicating that it also contains user assets binance issues its own version of eth usdc and usdt to be used on the BNB chain which are supposed to be backed by one-to-one reserves of the currencies they are based on however mixing of B token collateral with customer assets is against finance's own guidelines earlier this week binance also announced that its Swift banking partner Signature Bank will no longer support transactions under 100 000 in value this change comes into effect on February 1st and will not affect credit and debit card purchases of cryptocurrencies or payments to and from third-party exchanges Signature Bank is imposing this new transaction threshold to reduce its exposure to the digital asset Market meanwhile Finance is on the hunt for a new Swift partner to help facilitate its US dollar transactions Shanghai upgrade is closer ethereum core developers announced the successful deployment of a shadow Fork which supports stake to eat withdrawals as a test for the Network's upcoming Shanghai upgrade the shadow Fork went live on Monday and developers plan to test the upgrade's resilience by deploying evil nodes on both the execution layer and consensus layer the final version of the Shanghai upgrade is set to go live on the ethereum main net in March it will also allow validators to withdraw the 26 billion dollars worth of ether that sits in the deposit contract Additionally the team met liquid staking derivatives protocol Lido proposed a plan to support staked ether withdrawals after the Shanghai upgrade is activated the process will be asynchronous and will have two modes a turbo mode to unstake requests quickly and a bunker mode as an emergency plan which will be activated under Mass slashing conditions moreover decentralized autonomous organization index Co-op launched a new structured product that will give investors exposure to the eth liquid sticking derivatives Market Wormhole hacker levers up on staked ether as Shanghai comes closer the crypto Community is getting excited about the potential for steak to eat withdrawals however it seems that the hackers are also interested in this new development blockchain security firm sertic reported that the wallet address associated with the Wormhole hack which occurred in February 2022 moved 155 million dollars of ethereum this week the funds were moved to the open ocean to centralized exchange and then converted into Lido finances staked ether and also wrapped steak to eat the hacker then used the steath as collateral to borrow stable coins and repeat the process this is the largest movement of these stolen funds in recent months speaking of exploits the FBI announced that the Lazarus group a cybercrime organization sponsored by the North Korean government is responsible for the theft of 100 million dollars in crypto from Harmony's Horizon bridge in June last year the Lazarus group has a history of orchestrating cyber attacks and is considered one of the most dangerous organizations in the world time for fun bits Eric Wall immortalizes his enemies have you ever heard of the saying keep your friends close but your enemies closer well one crypto Enthusiast has been taking that phrase to a whole new level Eric Wall one of the best writers and analysts in the industry is not only keeping his adversaries close but is also etching their faces onto tungsten cubes that's right Eric is building a collection of Cubes made of the extremely dense tungsten metal each engraved with the face of a defeated crypto enemy but why tungsten you may ask well it's said it'd be virtually indestructible and extremely resistant to scratches kind of like Eric's arguments as for why he's doing this who knows maybe it's just his way of saying don't mess with me or perhaps it's simply a reminder of his past victories thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about Michael grayskill and gbtc check out the show notes for this episode if you like
