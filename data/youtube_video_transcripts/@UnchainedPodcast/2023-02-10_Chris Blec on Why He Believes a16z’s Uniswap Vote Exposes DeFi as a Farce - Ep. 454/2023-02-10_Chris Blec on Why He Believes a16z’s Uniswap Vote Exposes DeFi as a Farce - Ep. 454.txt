[Music] foreign welcome to Unchained your no hype resource for all things crypto I'm your host Laura Shin author of The cryptopians I started covering crypto seven years ago and as the senior editor of Forbes was the first Dimitri media reporter to cover cryptocurrency full-time this is the February 10th 2023 episode of Unchained with the crypto.com app you can buy earn and spend crypto in one place download and get 25 with the code Laura Link in the description [Music] today's guest is Chris black defy researcher and analyst and founder of the Black report welcome Chris hey Laura thanks for having me on this week a16c cryptos participation in a uniswap vote caused quite a bit of uproar in the community The Proposal on was whether or not to deploy uniswap V3 on the BNB chain and in an initial temperature check vote before the formal proposal more than 60 percent of the community wanted to deploy using the Wormhole Bridge rather than using layer 0 which is an a16c portfolio company however at that time a16z was actually not able to participate in that temperature vote check and then so when the formal vote started and this was again was just on whether or not to deploy on BNB and kind of tucked in there would be that they would also deploy using Wormhole at that time a16z crypto used 15 million of its uni tokens to swing the vote in a different direction um the Voting is still occurring so the period's not over and at this moment actually it looks like they're definitely going to lose but talk a little bit about you know what your perspective was as you were watching this play out we've seen large token holders like a16z in the past come in and basically use their might in order to change outcomes that look like they're favored by the community and what we saw here in this case was a16z coming in laying down 15 million uni token in a direction that was opposite to basically all of the votes up until that point almost so it did appear on that day that they were trying to swing the vote in their favor since then we've seen things shift quite a bit and more and more votes have come in on the side opposite of a16z including votes from their very own delegates which is very very interesting and now it's tilted to scales in a way that is opposite to what a16 Z wanted and they admitted right up front uh in some Forum posts that they wanted this outcome because they wanted it to favor a company layer 0 that's part of their Investment Portfolio which made it very interesting uh you know incentive situation for them and their uni tokens so as you mentioned a16c has quite a large number of tokens it has at least 55 million uni the 15 million that it voted with and then the 40 million that it delegated out to other groups many of them educational blockchain groups such as ones affiliated with different universities how do you think Dows should deal with these kinds of entities that have large numbers of tokens like that how should they deal with them I mean it's it's kind of by Design right the way that it's this whole thing works the it's one token one vote and these large entities like his a16z have that many tokens because they purchased them from the Dow or the company that was starting this thing up or whatever it might be so I don't think it's a situation where the system is broken per se because it's working as it was intended the problem comes when they pitch these things as decentralized and as people-powered but then these entities come along and they just throw their tokens in when they feel like things aren't going their way which is something that a16z does have a history of doing in dowels like this so so so do you feel that there's anything faulty with Dow design or do you think that that's a good system one token one vote and there's whales in the system yeah my personal opinion is it's a horrible system if you're trying to create a decentralized autonomous organization which is what a dow is supposed to be right so if you have a situation like we've seen before with uni uh with maker Dao with a bunch of other Dows out there where these small token holders operate and they they do the work and they vote on things uh and they're able to do what they want to do until something that they want to do goes against the interests of one of those large whale organizations or whatever it might be then that whale organization comes in and just votes on those certain proposals that do go against their financial interests that is a problem right because you you are creating this illusion that it is decentralized and that it is people powered when in reality it's always being watched by the actual owner in this case a16z and wait I'm sorry the actual owner you mean just of those tokens or what owner of what that's a great question you know and that's something that I've been trying to answer myself a16z has a pretty considerable percentage of the voting power both between what they they operate with in their own wallet and what they've delegated out to other entities universities Etc like what you said plus who knows we have no way of knowing how many other uni tokens they might have okay there's no way to know for sure exactly what that total is beyond just what they say now how is that different from looking at a private company that might have four six ten percent of the voting shares in that company you would call them still one of the owners of that company um it's a lot different from me if I have 10 uni versus this entity over here that has 50 million you know so at some point we need to start to see the parallels that are happening between a traditional company and uh what's supposed to be a Dao you know when in reality it's really being Opera in this case the whole debate is happening between a16z and jump because of their competing interest in these two Bridge organizations and everybody else just has little you know little bits of of input here and there what's making this really interesting though like I said is that delegates of a16z are voting against them so it's going to be interesting to see how a16z reacts to that down the road because why would they keep these delegates if they're not supporting their interests yeah and just to clarify for listeners so jump capital is the major investor in Wormhole and a16c is a major investor in layer zero and Wormhole after it was hacked was basically kept alive with an effusion of 300 million dollars from jump so obviously they have a strong vested interest there you know you talked about how it is that a16c is actually delegated out the majority of their tokens and some of those different educational groups like The Michigan oh sorry I don't remember their official name but you know something like the Michigan blockchain Club the University of Michigan you know there were others different with different universities they did not vote in line with a16c they voted against as you pointed out and so doesn't that kind of undercut your argument that a16z is sort of like controlling all of their tokens and doesn't it sort of um you know align with that idea that even though they are the owners that they're delegating in order to Foster decentralization uh it doesn't undercut it because a16z chose their delegates right and they chose delegates for very specific reasons because they lended legitimacy because they thought they would think in a certain way because they thought they would vote in a certain way that would ultimately help a16z and the biggest mistake that I think people make when when talking about this issue is is assuming that a16z or any Venture Capital firm has any reason at all to be philanthropic they're not here to um to to be charitable they're not here to give you and I more rights in the world or to help us in any real way they're here to make money that's what Venture Capital firms do right when they're choosing their delegates they're choosing their delegates because they think those delegates are going to help them make more money so the real question to me now is to when they you know they they can't force their hand right the deli they're not forcing the delegates to do anything but they chose them and they can get rid of them and they can get new ones too or they can choose not to if they think that's going to look bad and that's going to cost the money whatever's going to make them more money is what they're going to do so it's up to us because there's no regulation in this space because there's nobody else doing the work it's up to us to look at it and interpret what's going on so that we can manage these things better in the future and we can tell people when it's decentralized and when it's not clearly this situation is not decentralized though So when you say that it remains to be seen how a16c will react to the fact that the entities that it delegated its votes to voted against them what do you mean by that I mean that a16z is a for-profit corporation they're not a they're not doing this for philanthropic reasons they are operating in a way that's going to ultimately make them money whether it's through their tokens through their investments in other companies you know and it's pretty clear that a16z hey they're smart they're Savvy they want to put together a defy ecosystem I like to call it a cartel but you know an ecosystem of companies that work together and create this like little bubble of their Investments their different companies and the beautiful thing about D5 is it's interconnected and everybody can can benefit each other in their portfolio uh so um when their delegates start standing in the way of that then you have to start to wonder what's the benefit of keeping those delegates you know is the best so either they're going to end up keeping them and say this is this is proof to the world that we're not trying to be tyrannical and and to um dictate what goes on here or they're gonna get rid of them and they're going to get other delegates that are going to vote more in line with the way that they want to invest and the way they want to make money with their business so that's the part that is going to be interesting to watch you know I happen to think they're probably going to just keep these guys on and say Hey look it's decentralized because our delegates are voting against us you know and but again it's not because they really care about decentralizations because they care about looking decentralized hmm all right and just to bring in one of the voices so blockchain at Michigan is the group that I was thinking of they were one of the delegates of the a16c uni tokens and they tweeted we voted incongruently with a16c because we believe that Wormhole is an adequate messaging solution for cross-chain governance a16c is an investor in layer zero they have an interest in seeing layer 0 succeed we don't although we like Larry's layer zero our priority is what's best for uniswa protocol so in a moment where we're going to talk a little bit more about the role that VCS should play in a decentralized world but first a quick

with the code Laura Link in the description back to my conversation with Chris so you hinted at this a little bit in some of your answers but do you feel that these that VCS don't really have a place at all in a technology that's meant to Foster decentralization or what role do you see them playing personally I come from the point of view of of somebody who entered the space because of Bitcoin because of the promise of decentralization of self-sovereign money of trustlessness venture capital firms don't and they can't share those same interests because those interests are not necessarily profitable they're not billion dollar company unicorn startup ideas right you can't build a unicorn company and have it be completely trustless because then you have no real solid way to make money and to to change your product with the times and keep up with things so I don't think that VC Investments uh when it comes to blockchain Tech are compatible with a lot of the principles that bitcoiners in general come into the space for so with that being said they could be doing a lot better they could be doing a lot better to actually prove that they're interested in decentralization like they say but you know we've seen and and we're seeing right now this play out this vote that's going on is not necessarily about what's best for decentralization or what's best for trustlessness or anything like that this is turning into what's best for each parties investing strategy what's best for their portfolio for their for their bottom line and that's not really why I entered the space at all yeah you tweeted the part that many are missing is that Behemoth VCS like a16c are using the free market excuse to foster a regulatory environment that will ultimately stifle competition and make it impossible for Indie devs to operate and defy legally what did you mean by that what I mean is that big money in the space whether it's a16z or other big investing firms have an interest in fostering a regulatory environment and working with Regulators to develop a regulatory environment that favors their business they're not interested in running pirate operations that go against the grain or go against the law or anger the government they're not going to become giant billion billion billion dollar companies that way the way that they become huge is by working with The Regulators working with the government in order to put together laws regulations whatever they might be that benefit them over the next 5 10 20 years and that's happening right now and ironically a year or two ago a16z actually used their tokens to vote into existence an organization called the defy education fund um which if anybody wants to look back can see a16z made that happen they use their tokens to make this thing happen and what it is it turned out it it was like a 30 or 40 million dollar fund intended specifically to to Lobby to work with regulators and educate educate them about the way that regulations should come into existence but because of the way it's funded and incentivized it's not about creating regulations that are privacy friendly that are Liberty friendly it's about creating regulations that are going to ultimately allow a16z's portfolio to grow and to become huge companies become huge successes and those two things are not compatible so that's what I'm talking about when I say they're trying to Foster something that almost goes against a lot of the language they're using to describe these organizations you tweeted I've been asking a16c to engage in a public dialogue with me about defy governance for over two years so if you had that opportunity what questions would you like to ask them I'd like to know uh how uh well first of all I'd like to know how they choose and uh and why they choose delegates the way that they do they've done some blogging about that they talked about that somewhat but the bottom line is like I said before they're coming at it from the point of view of they're trying to be these Goodwill ambassadors and you know we're being so generous and doing these delegations but let's get down the brass tacks you want to make money you're choosing delegates that you think are ultimately going to help you make money why are you making these choices the way that you're making them so that that's one thing for sure um and then beyond that it's really about how can we consider these things to be decentralized when it really comes down to just a handful of giant organizations like yourself you know maybe there's there's four or five organizations that can swing any vote with a lot of these Dows you know and I know and that that the long-term thing is for them to to unload the tokens and to dump them on people who um might come in later you know but I mean for now to call these things decentralized autonomous organizations it's like a slap in the face to everything that Bitcoin in the first place built you know and to continue to use that term is just crazy easy to me so do you feel that there's any optimal way that you would like to see defy governance operate or are you saying that you feel that D5 protocols in general can never be truly decentralized or in general what do you think this says about defy not just VC participation in defy I think there's a lot of experiments that have yet to actually be tried as far as using tokens to vote you know and and really the most popular method still is one token one vote and what we've seen over and over is that doesn't work for decentralization that method with the the money the amount of money that's involved with it is absolutely going to end up being captured by Regulators or governments down the road just because it's clear you have these parties that have five ten percent of the voting power they're saying this thing's decentralized but they can sway things in so many different ways that's that's not working you know it's not working for decentralization now I think you know there's other things going on out there other Dows that are trying different things quadratic voting or time lock voting and stuff like that but that stuff is less profitable for a venture capitalist you know so they still favor the one token one vote and they're going to push that as far as they can go so my objective right now is just to make people aware of what's going on because a lot of people just can't wrap their heads around how this thing how this stuff is working you know and um the almost false type false like advertising that's happening from a lot of the VCS in the space isn't helping you know so it's really up to us to explain to people here's why it's not as decentralized as you think and here's where it's going to lead it's going to lead to regulation it's going to lead to less privacy for you it's going to lead to governments having a huge say over how these things work in the future and that's almost certainly what allow of these VCS want they want that type of Regulation because that's going to be the path to big money for them okay yeah I mean I guess you've alluded to that earlier I I did want to ask you though directly so you wrote again in a tweet all Dows using unadulterated one token one vote governance mechanisms will inevitably be captured by governments slash Regulators how do you see that happening like what do you mean exactly when you say that I mean that there are there's a lot of money right now going into lobbying and trying to push regulations into existence big institutional money won't come in to defy until there is clear regulation until we know exactly what's legal and what's not and those regulations ultimately are going to control what's legal what's possible with a dow with a dow that is selling tokens and is is is operated through these type of voting tokens so at a certain point we're going to have on the books very clear rules about how this is going to work and they're rules that are going to favor big you know whales that are actually out there you know greasing palms and making sure that things happen the way they want them to but those same rules are going to apply to new Dows they're going to apply to small Dows they're going to apply to Indie developers that are thinking of new projects that they want a lot punch it's going to be up to them to make sure they're not breaking these new laws and that's part of the reason that the existing organizations want to have a say in how these laws look because they want to make it harder to lose their competitive Advantage you know and this is not just this isn't unique to blockchain this is every industry we've seen it over and over for decades the first movers want to come in they want to take advantage of their relationship with Regulators teach The Regulators about how it should be and then all of a sudden you've got these laws and we've seen it from you know what we're seeing now to the internet to telephone to radio go back 100 years this is always the way it's been and so anybody new that wants to enter the space needs to hire lawyers have tons of software tons of you know stuff to navigate the bureaucracy it's going to make it harder for new people to come into the space all right Chris well thank you so much for sharing your insights my pleasure Laura don't forget next up is the Weekly News recap stick around for this week in crypto after this short break thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap in SEC settlement Kraken agrees to shut down its crypto staking surfaces on

hilarious story why don't you listen to it from Unchained social media manager Jenny Hogan so the FBI has seized a board ape which now that it's mired in government bureaucracy is an extremely bored ape went to a recent report the FBI sees the ape a doodle nft about 87 eth and a 40 000 watch all for an Infamous cryptoscamer named Horror by far the most shocking part of this story is that when the government sees the assets the East was worth about a hundred and sixteen thousand dollars and today it's worth about a hundred and forty four thousand dollars this is a twist for the ages of course the FBI themselves did not actually find horror doing things achieving goals helping people that's not really like what the government's all about independent blockchain investor Zach xbt to the rescue we don't know the real identity of Zac xbt it is not as his name suggests want to be Elon musk's children but get this horror was discovered because of a forty thousand dollar watch that he bragged about on social media doesn't he have anything normal to post about like an avocado all of which is to say if you're going to steal a ton of crypto have the decency to use your iPhone to keep
