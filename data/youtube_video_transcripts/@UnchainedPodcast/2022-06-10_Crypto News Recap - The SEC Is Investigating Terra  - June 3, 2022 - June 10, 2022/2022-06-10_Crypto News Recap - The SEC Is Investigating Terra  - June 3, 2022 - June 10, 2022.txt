[Music] thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap tara must face subpoenas and investigations from sec and korean authorities bloomberg reported thursday that the sec is investigating the marketing claims behind tara usd aka ust the now defunct algorithmic stablecoin that collapsed last month according to bloomberg sources the sec will be attempting to determine whether ust marketing violated several federal u.s investor protection laws terraform labs said it was unaware of sec action related to ust marketing and the sec has declined to comment also this week court documents published by the u.s second circuit on june 8 made clear that terraform labs and its co-founder jo kwon will be required to comply with sec subpoenas related to the ongoing investigation of tara's mirror protocol kwon had initially been served with a subpoena in this investigation upon his arrival at masari's main net conference in new york in september 2021 where he was a speaker at the time terraform labs argued that the sec lacked jurisdiction over the entity due to terraform's lack of sufficient contacts with the u.s it also argued that the sec violated its own rules of practice when it served the subpoena by handing a copy to quan in person despite tara's lawyering the court ruled that the sec was in line with its own roles and did have jurisdiction in the case because terraform labs had u.s employees and had previously stated that 15 percent of its users resided in the country investigations are also ongoing in korea according to the financial times the seoul metropolitan police agency said it was looking into allegations that employees of terraform labs embezzled an undisclosed amount of the organization's bitcoin holdings those holdings had allegedly been loaned to market makers to help buttress the ust peg last month but there has been no independent verification that the funds were used according to their stated purpose roxton merges successfully wednesday morning ethereum's robsten testnet the largest of its three test nets completed the protocol's first successful public merge of an active test network ethereum's other two test nets gourley and sepolia are expected to merge as well in the coming months in the proposed merge of the ethereum main net to be enacted q3 or q4 of 2022 the existing economic activity on the proof of work chain will be merged into the proof of stake chain currently being run on the bacon chain with a set of independent validators each staking 32 eth while robsten's successful dress rehearsal bodes well for the technical aspects of the merge concerns are building about the centralization of staking both in terms of software clients running the network as well as staking as a service providers for example the prison client holds a two-thirds market share in the validator set for ethereum's beacon chain which is worrying because if prism had a bug it could cause a consensus failure on the network additionally staking services contribute to this centralization more than a third of all validators are controlled by staking services of which lido is far and away a leader and a significant portion of the rest are operated by centralized exchanges op tokens stolen on back of winter mute mix-up 20 million of the new op tokens from optimism were stolen due to a mistake made by optimism's market-making partner wintermute optimism provided the tokens to wintermute in the form of a loan unfortunately for wintermute the address they had supplied and confirmed to the optimism team was an ethereum wallet that did not have proper support for layer 2 chains an adversarial actor took possession of the 20 million op tokens that had been sent to the defunct address optimism and wintermute both published statements on the matter winter mute has taken full responsibility for the attack and promised to buy tokens on the open market to counteract any sales by the attacker and to make the protocol whole winter mute also promised to pursue legal recourse against the attacker provided the tokens are not returned within the next week if they are returned a gig is in the offing wintermute described the adversary's actions as rather impressive and offered an opportunity for consulting work kane work founder and ceo of optimism-based derivatives liquidity protocol synthetics wrote in a tweet thread wednesday seeing the funds in your address is not sufficient as a test the correct way to test a transaction is to ensure you can move the received tokens but like zero percent of people do this my conclusion after years of watching this stuff happen is that it's not possible to avoid every mistake but communicating them transparently and quickly is the optimal approach finance faces increased scrutiny a number of developments this week increased scrutiny and finance by regulators and law enforcement in the united states bloomberg broke a story about an sec investigation into the initial coin offering or ico of bnb a token with a nearly 50 billion market cap the bnb ico occurred in 2017 100 million tokens were sold to the public for 15 million dollars the firm has recently backed away from its initial promise to use 20 percent of the exchange's profits to buy back the token each quarter chiang fang zhao founder and ceo of binance claimed in a 2020 blog post that the decision was a result of legal advice so as not to classify bnb as a security according to bloomberg also this week reuters released an investigative report on how finance became a hub for hackers fraudsters and drug dealers to the tune of 2.35 billion dollars the report caused a stir in the community finance responded in a blog post by publishing a portion of its email correspondence with reuters in related news binance received regulatory permission for the opening of regional european headquarters in paris this week after 18 months of work with french regulators the exchange has agreed to invest 100 million dollars in france to advance crypto technology and donate 2 million for the restoration of a room in the chateau versailles crypto adoption highlights first paypal finally

and absconded with keys controlling approximately 32 nfts including one bayc nft according to crypto security research firm peckshield the attack was first publicized by twitter user nft herder yooka did not confirm the hack until 11 hours after the initial tweet from nft herder this was the second time in less than 10 months that eucalapse has been compromised on april 26th 2022 eucalypts has closed a 2.6 million loss in a phishing attack related to an intruder accessing its instagram account when bayc founder gordon goner responded to the incident he blamed discord saying discord isn't working for web3 communities we need a better platform that puts security first however stephen fink of nounsdale tweeted that it's user's faults for clicking on phishing links you didn't lose your nft because you used discord you lost your nft because you signed a malicious transaction with your key yooka labs recently raised 450 million dollars in venture funding in a seed round entailing a monster valuation osmosis bug in a temporary lapse in judgment the osmosis dex was compromised on thursday after a bug was found that allowed users to increase their position sizes without adding capital through the deposit and withdrawal of funds an official post from the osmosis team stated liquidity pools were not completely drained devs are fixing the bug scoping the size of losses likely in the range of roughly five million dollars and working on recovery on-chain activity and validators were paused upon discovery of the vulnerability but not before five million dollars was lost one culprit was the fire stake validation poll which reported that it had taken two million dollars from the protocol during a temporary lapse of good judgment representatives from the poll said we were thinking about our family's future and not the future of our community osmosis remains non-functional as at the time of this recording time for fun vids neil stephenson inventor of the term metaverse
