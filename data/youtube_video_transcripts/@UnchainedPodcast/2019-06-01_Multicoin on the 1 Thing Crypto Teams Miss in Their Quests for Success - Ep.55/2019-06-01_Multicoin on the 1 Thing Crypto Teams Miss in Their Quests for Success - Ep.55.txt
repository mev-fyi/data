guests are kyle samani and Tushar jain co-founders and managing partners of multi coin capital welcome Kyle into char hey thanks for having us Laura really excited to be on the podcast a big family tell me both how you got your start in crypto Kyle let's start with you sure so my first company about five years ago the company's building software for Google glass for use by surgeons that was going quite well until Google pulled the rug on Google glass at which point I had a big problem on my hands ultimately I ended up pivoting the company and the company was ultimately sold and I found myself unemployed in January of 2016 I spent about two months playing video games and then in March of 2016 I discovered this thing called ethereal and I thought if areum was the last thing I've ever seen I was drawn to it in particular for two reasons one was I felt the pain of platform risk after having on glass and experiencing the pain of Google pulling the rug out from under me the idea of having a platform you know where no one could do that again to me was particularly compelling and the second thing that drew me to it was the finance opportunities at some point in 2016 I realized that every financial institution on the planet in a giant smart contract and when I realized that I talked to myself oh man this technology is going to be really important I'll let - sure I can tell he said yeah I discovered crypto for the first time back in 2013 actually I had also started a company around the same time that Kyle had is a healthcare IT unrelated to crypto but I heard about this thing called Bitcoin and I did a lot of research and bought a couple literally - wish I had bought more I think we all do but I bought a couple of tuition make sure I had some skin in the game and wanting to understand how it all worked and after doing a good amount of research I realized the only app that you really needed Bitcoin for in 2013 was Silk Road and I didn't really need Silk Road so I didn't go much deeper at that time I thought it was a really interesting idea but I didn't see the broader vision until Kyle actually shared the etherium white paper with me and told me about what if you're in could enable that Bitcoin could not and in the meantime I had been working on building this marketplace network type business in healthcare IT and I really saw the potential for these cryptographically bound networks to replace a lot of these traditional network businesses and that's what got me extremely excited because I saw that crypto was a new way fundamentally of organizing human economic activity and we hadn't had a new fundamental organization mechanism since the advent of the publicly traded corporation back in the late 1400s early 1500s interesting yeah I love these stories and you guys know each other from and you or something right yeah that's correct so to start I met at NYU and I think our first semester of college maybe our second but pretty early passes 2018 timeframe we became pretty close in our first two years of college and we've been best friends for eight or nine years now one thing I love about your story and Kyle too is that you're the classic example that Chris Dixon of andreessen horowitz likes to talk about where he describes how he's seen a lot of entrepreneurs who build on these closed wall Gardens like Facebook and Google and then they get burned when those platforms end up shutting down services or pivoting their strategies and then those developers get cut off and I know he's actually an individual investor in your fund along with Marc Andreessen David sacks and he says that he sees a lot of those same developers now building on block chains where they can be compensated directly from the protocol where the data is open so I'm curious why did you guys decide to go the route of a crypto hedge fund rather than building a project in the space you know after I left where she was March was January of 2016 and I was unemployed and I like spent a lot of kind of time doing soul-searching over 2016 I was illegally unemployed for about 18 months during that time I was slowly discovering crypto and you know I kind of done one rodeo as an entrepreneur and I spent a lot of time thinking like what I want to do with myself they're fundamentally two kind of white-collar jobs they're operators and they're allocators and I thought to myself at the time that I wanted to be an alligator if I could spend all day just reading writing and thinking I would and you know and this time I was unemployed I have literally nothing to do no responsibilities I like found myself are at spend days I just spend lost in a book lost things or some on the internet thinking about stuff writing about stuff and like that when I cut as then I found crypto and it just sucked me into that particular vortex and I felt like that was my calling was to do allocation rather than operating so that's really like why I want to be in the fun side of things what you described is not that different from journalism so if this doesn't work out you can also join this field I'm sorry you're like hmm cost-benefit analysis no but anyway it's something I'm also curious about is you know at this point in time obviously it's quite unclear how any of these crypto assets will gain mass adoption and you guys have so many great blog posts where you kind of theorize how this might happen but why don't you just describe for me right now how you're thinking about what these paths to wider adoption could be and then how you factor those thoughts into your investment choices I think something that is critically undervalued in the crypto space right now is distribution and I don't mean distribution amongst people who are already in crypto I mean distribution to the blue ocean of people who have not yet actually interacted with any cryptocurrency user protocols and the reason for that is fundamentally because everything is open source and these two are intricately related because what that means is that there is no IP there is no protected technology whatsoever and it means that the investments that another team makes into advancing their technology can be borrowed by your team and whoever gets the most Network effects for some of these protocols that do have strong Network effects will end up actually dominating from the economic perspective so the focus on go-to-market I think is actually the best signal for a team that understands the competitive dynamics of the crypto ecosystem and understands what it takes to actually win in this open source world well that's interesting because it's sort of like saying oh maybe easy cash is sort of specialized around privacy but since aetherium is adopting zk snarks and they're more focused on well no actually yeah so how do you sorry I don't know how I'm going to finish this thought because so like I guess so what you're saying is maybe in that example Z cash is like focused on the technology but cerium is more maybe not like only focusing on the technology but they're sort of like more broad in that they're adopting a whole bunch of use cases and so that is more likely to gain wider adoption let me give you I I agree with the Zika example and I'll get to that but let me give you an easier one so an easier one is as I'm sure a lot of your listeners are aware there are a lot of computing stable coin projects out there right now there's you know things like base coin you have things like maker you have things like saga and there's a bunch of lower profile ones that are still either in stealth or just haven't made a lot of noise yet and staple coins is something that we're really interested in as a firm multi coin capital is interested in stable coins however when we talk to these entrepreneurs who are launching stable coin networks while we do care about the stability mechanism we that's not where we're focusing because we understand that the dominant stable coin if stable coins do end up being an important part of the ecosystem the dominant stable coin will adopt the best stability mechanics from every other stable coin experiment that has been run so what we really focus on when looking at single coin projects is what is the go-to-market strategy how will you get consumer adoption and how easily can you adopt the best mechanics from everyone else who's experimenting in this space this is the beauty of open source right is that everyone is always developing I'm the latest and greatest so if you can if you can kind of abstract away from that and realize that distribution is what is going to decide which stable coin wins then it makes sense for the team to focus on that and so what do you think are the best distribution strategies we had this year 2017 where everyone was like the initial coin offering is the way to bootstrap your network and it's way to get the early adopters incentivized to kind of proselytize the network to other people and yet I don't really know how well that's working out so I'm kind of curious what what do you think are the best ways to to get broad distribution yes I mean varies vary widely depending on the kind of application you're building so right like let's take funfairs example so the funfair team you know Jen's and David are those guys I mean they have they're hiring a sales force well they've already hired a sales force and they are calling up casinos and other you know casino operators and basically pitching them on the value of the platform and they have to go through like the standard enterprise sales process not only that that kind of general go to market it's not applicable for all cryptocurrencies obviously if you're in foundation doesn't need to do something like that but there's a lot of interesting products like funfair where you need to build a run and enterprise sales organization and there's a you know enterprise sales largely a science although I detect background like Iran failed or get Christine like I have some sense for how like to run an enterprise sales org and like that's 90 % 10% art there's a process to do this and it just requires extreme discipline and hiring people who like know how to do that and I find the crypto there's just way too many and tech tech people and I'm nearly enough go to market people if you're gonna build a developer tool for developers to build on like you should go hire the best developer relations people out of Twilio and out of MailChimp and you know those kinds of places and SendGrid and those kind of right and like I just don't see that kind of strong focus that I would like to see what I think about you know how do you get this thing from a 5,000 to 10,000 users to 10 million users right like they need to be thinking about a 100x growth and like how do you get there this is so interesting because essentially what you're arguing is that the tech matters less in the beginning because ultimately at the start what matters is just getting people to use whatever you're offering and then because these are all open source as you go on and get wider adoption then you can just add in the technology that actually makes your your product better is that a good summary it is and really it comes from our approach as fund managers is to identify asymmetry that's right we need to see where the risk and return is asymmetric and this is actually an example of an asymmetric strategy for competing in this market is well we have something that's fundamentally different which is that all the technology is open-source so what does that change about how we compete in this market and a lot of teams are going about competition in the same way do they have in traditional tech companies but we think that that's fundamentally wrong or it's not the right strategy it's not the dominant strategy from a game theory perspective and at the end of the day show me the incentives and I'll show you the outcome so I think that's a quote from from someone when I asked you earlier how you're factoring this into your investment choices essentially you're maybe then looking for teams who have more of that business savvy I mean it sounds really like the founding team needs to have a stronger market but like they need to have at least some plan thoughts thought about it seriously and then most importantly be willing to hire people who have done it elegant arena relevant companies there's a lot of great technology teams in crypto that have raised tens even hundreds of millions of dollars and like they're hiring their friend who like is a like makes marketing brochures and they're like oh look we're doing marketing now and I'm like no that's not what world-class marketing looks like go hire a true VP of Marketing who's done three series a stage startups in a relevant field or relevant fields the person's gonna be expensive and like hire them and bring them on board and then that person is gonna need to build a team I'm like just the level of caliber of like discipline and focus on systematically thinking about like how do I get my next not just 10,000 users been like seven base your school how do I get it next million users the next five million users and like that doesn't happen by accident that doesn't happened with haphazard like buildings from brochures and like Handa hendrikpasmans and community events there needs to be a real systematic thorough process to build scalable growth yeah just to add on to that there's this idea in this space have build it and they will come and it makes sense when you consider the makeup of a lot of the teams is very engineering heavy and there's this precedent where Bitcoin was built and people came if the area was built and people came there wasn't a real marketing push by some organization that help make those things happen but that is not how it's going to play out for almost anyone else in the space they need to actually go to market they can't expect the market to come to them okay yeah just because now it's much more competitive obviously than it was um what else is part of your process for determining whether or not a token merits inclusion in your portfolio there's a few questions that we like to ask ourselves as a part of our process the first is how is this project uniquely enabled by blockchain blockchain technology has three fundamental strengths and that's going to be the censorship resistant nature the permissionless nature and then the crustless nature of blockchains if you don't need to use one of those three attributes then you're better off using a centralized database a blockchain is extremely inefficient compared to a regular database if you don't need one of those three features so that's the first question that we asked and 99% of things that were pitched actually end up failing at that level then the next question that we ask that we find is also extremely valuable is can we fork this token out of the protocol and by that what I mean is is the token actually necessary for the functioning of this protocol and if it's not necessary for the functioning of the protocol and there are a lot but these types of tokens right now it may have some value in the short term for speculative purposes but the reality is that someone will go in and fork out your token take your open-source product let's say you know it's it provides some service distributive compute for example and built for counter token and I'll say instead of paying with your specific proprietary payment token we will take all of your open source ecology and just allow people to pay with the for allow people people to pay with a stable coin or pay with Bitcoin or whatever other asset and they have an incentive to do so because they can find ways to profit from that by either shorting the token or having some other interesting profit motives so we really see that as being an inevitable transition because if you think about it no one will ever fork a proprietary payment token into a service that already works without them I'd turn to Hammond token it's like entropy it only goes in one direction okay and one other thing I was wondering about is since your investment is more liquid than it would be if you were a traditional venture fund how much commitment and help are you giving to the protocols you invest in like are you committing to any sort of lockup for yourselves or do you just sell the tokens the second they go on the public market or some portion of them and how much do you plan to help these teams if your investment is intended more for the short term yes so we sounds kind of intuitive but we can do kind of both at the same time so there are a lot of teams right now our portfolio has I think five or six assets in it in the liquid portion of a portfolio or in liquid investment I think we have seven or eight more that are illiquid right now but we only have five that are liquid there's far more than five credible teams that have a liquid token that does something that could be valuable or interesting in the future the fact that we don't own it right now can be a reflection of many things it can be your flexion of our market cycle which is very obviously the case gonna be reflection of lack of short-term catalysts it can also be reflection of there are so many other better short-term catalyst for other assets so right like the fact that we don't own a token at the current moment does not necessarily reflect our opinion that we don't think the token will accrue value in the long run it is there's all these other variables that could be prioritized over that fact one of those are major sources of alpha we deliver to our investors we believe is being plugged into the ecosystem and having a level of depth of knowledge and understanding that you can't get from just being a surface level player we make it part of the reason we write so much room publish so much research is that how teams understand the kinds of things we're thinking about and ultimately helping them think through those types of decisions we help that seems very actively with connections in the space with recruiting kind of with everything we really can and we're happy to do that even if we're not necessarily invest at the current moment because we may want to be invested in the future and like we want to make sure that we have those users the depth of knowledge around to make sure we're doing that not everything has to be how did I make money off of this in the next 24 hours like there's real fundamental long-term value creation here and that just takes time so you don't commit to any sort of lock-up it sounds like actually I want to address that specific question we do not go invest in an illiquid stage and then sell immediately afterwards we do have internal policies against that we're not you know going in buying in a discount and selling at the ico that that's not who we are that's not who we're ever going to be for these investments that we're making we do have a commitment to helping the team especially the early-stage investments that we make however if we do purchase a token on the public liquid markets then we are not subject to a lock-up I see but then at that point are you talking with the team I mean it sounds like just because you're invested like maybe you would want to help them or is it just more like a short-term play where you're gonna buy at that time on the public markets because you think it is smart at that moment but then you know maybe later you might exit without even talking with them or how much do you treat it more like venture investing I guess is what I'm wondering I mean we we like we will help the teams even if we don't know in the tokens and like we do this all the time with lots of the high profile projects around the space help them with reviewing materials communications strategy economics wherever we can be helpful we really strive to be that that's how to earn brand that's how we learn those kinds of things just because we don't own a token at the current moment doesn't mean we don't support the project it just means that there are other priorities in our current portfolio or it couldn't mean we're in a bear market which actually turns out we're in a bear market right now so the fact that we don't need a token does not indicate we don't believe in a project it just indicates we're in a bear market right and so it sounds it's a kind of oxymoron but we can both support a project you go out of our way with our time and energy to do so and not own any of the token and those two things can coexist yeah well I wanted to ask you about the downturn how have you guys been weathering it I wrote this article last summer about all the new crypto hedge funds popping up and the beginning of it was like there are sophisticated and unsophisticated people getting into this face and then and then the intro ends with I guess we'll see which how many of them survive a downturn and as we have seen in the news some of them are already closing up shop so how have you guys been what's your strategy been during this time we have done quite well through the downturn we can't talk about numbers publicly because of SEC restrictions on that kind of a thing but as a hedge fund we do have the ability to short various assets and we have made use of that ability over the past few months oh that's interesting but is that with projects that you support no those are more general data shorts so we're not going out and shorting projects that we do support especially not only from a just support reason but also from a logistical reason where it is well we do have the ability to go and short some things we cannot go in short everything you have to actually secure a borrow in order to execute a short securing a borrow against a less liquid token it's difficult typically once you leave the top five it becomes extremely expensive or I'm just difficult to do and how much do you have in assets under management now 15 change so I'm curious how do you deploy a meaningful amount in small early-stage projects especially because I mean maybe you guys see a lot more a lot more interesting projects than I do that are interests that are in early-stage but sometimes I just look at all these pitches and I'm like no no no so I'm curious how how are you meaningfully to deploying 50 million dollars in this market right now yeah so there's two pieces the liquid portion and a liquid portion our liquid portion our portfolio is about 90 percent of our total assets so if you say 50 million that means 45 million is liquid and no more than 5 million or so will be a liquid so when we think about the real estate projects our typical check size is between 250 K and a million for these kinds of early stage deals that reflects the fact that we've got about 5 million dollars to play with right now in the early stage market opportunity deploying 5 million dollars into you know multiple deals is pretty straightforward in the even in the early stage of the pre I Seattle stuff so for the remaining 45 that's liquid and there's only 45 across the whole range of liquid assets it's a pretty straightforward and ever you can deploy four to five million dollars in 24 to 48 hours it doesn't take very long to the play that much capital in an intelligent way without too much slippage and how do you measure success are you benchmarking against Bitcoin or ether or the US dollar the phone is denominated in u.s. dollars so our goal is to deliver investors returns denominated in u.s. dollars and internally we do look at things like Bitcoin like either like the whole 10 index in order to have internal benchmarks who are your investors and have they changed over time in any fashion like are you detecting any trends and who was interested in investing in crypto last summer as opposed to now the market so I mean we got started our moods were investors were eating angel investors to invest in technology companies and then a lot of like the early crypto whales that was our proprietary capital base to get started over the last few months we've started to get a lot more inbound interest from venture capital funds from general partners who run hedge funds like traditional public long/short equity hedge funds so lots of those guys are our investors with us now guys and gals and we're now in starting to see a lot more interest from family offices and from endowments and foundations that pool is the most progressive 1% of those pools is looking now actively some of them have already deployed a lot of are saying okay crypto is real we need to figure out our strategy that process of figuring out the strategy for a lot of these organizations will take three to six months so a lot of them are figuring out now some of them are starting to deploy and so the capital base of our fund is changing and that's a reflection of the capital base of the market as a whole changing green we're gonna discuss the

big competition is taking shape between smart contract platforms such as if the area meows definitely chases Cardno and others how do you think this race will be decided and do you think there's room for just one or multiple so the smart contract platform space is the area that I find most interesting in all of crypto that's where I spend most of my intellectual energy and time so if you think about these smart contract platforms like there's features like privacy sir example like ZK snarks or like that this protocol is even like those are fundamental copyable features between these systems but there are some systems like some decisions that you make in this design any systems that like you can't have it both ways so they're just fundamental compromises and trade-offs we've identified somewhere between 10 variables kind of on this spectrum of like just fundamental design decisions where there's trade-offs in these principles so these were things like latency things like throughput things like degrees of privacy things like governance in tightly coupled versus loosely loosely governance expressivity of programmability formal verification ability some of those those kind of key variables when we look at smart contract platforms we basically ask ourselves like each of these teams has a hypothesis given this n dimensional trait set of trade-offs given this n dimensional trade-off space each of these teams is putting forward a hypothesis of why they think the set of trade-offs they're making is going to accrue some local maximum of value we believe there will be look there will be multiple local maximum of value some of those local Maxima will be larger than others right now basically kind of sort of only one local maxima has really been explored in the meaningful way and that's the local Maxima that both Bitcoin and etherium occupy the hyper focused on decentralization decentralization decentralization of block production specifically at the expense of scalability and there are other teams who have fundamentally different views every layer around flexibility and scalability and security and all kinds of other things and these things are all exploring these other variables we're super excited about kind of seeing they're just that everyone's the only game in town right now and we're super excited to see other people come to market with a fundamentally different world view we expect there will be multiple winners interesting and just so I understand how you're defining local maxima that's like an area of priority specifically referring to capturing value right so you're getting this n-dimensional trade-off space call it there's maybe ten variables how you count and these variables are like there's pushes and pulls between them different kinds of ways depending on the different types of technologies used and depending on just your political or ideological beliefs about how these systems should be designed and what what they should prioritize so given that right you've got all these variables there's not a great way to visualize this in three-dimensional space so I call it M dimensional space but like given how you prioritize those different variables we believe that like at certain sets of trade-offs between those variables there will be some local accrual of value just if they have a value let me give you some examples that might make this a bit easier to to wrap your mind around I think this is an extremely powerful framework that can help people really evaluate various more contract platforms as well as other projects in the space and this kind of links back to what we talked about earlier which is that open source changes everything about how competition works in crypto and going back to that idea of open source means that your features don't matter you have no IP any features that you come up with will be copied by your competitors so a really easy example of that is the etherium had come up with this idea for the Imperium main service the etherium named service is kind of like the DNS or domain name service where you don't type IP addresses to go to a website you type in a human readable name well if they're a name service was intended to provide that same feature where instead of sending funds to a specific the theorem address you would send it to a human readable version and this is a really interesting feature but gos also has that same feature and other competing platforms like Definity or Tasos either have that feature will adopt that feature that's not going to differentiate your platform what will differentiate your platform are things that fundamentally cannot be easily changed so while etherium is prioritizing decentralization of block production over scalability the OS is actually prioritizing scalability over decentralization of law production and along just this one variable or this one range from completely centralized and extremely scalable to completely decentralized it and very difficult to scale what Kyle is saying in terms of local Maxima is we can see along if we just simplify to this one dimension that there will be value that's accruing on the totally decentralized end and that's the Bitcoin or the Monaro end or the if your iam end where you really need censorship resistance as a core feature and then there is also going to be value accruing at other points along this spectrum and then using a OS as an example a OSS idea is that it's decentralized enough its platform grade since you're persistent not sovereign grid censorship resistant and since it's decentralized enough it means that it's somewhere in the middle on this dimension that I'm talking about and so it could capture value there too and now if we expand that model out to not just be one dimension n dimensional space like I was mentioning then you can see there will be different places in that n dimensional space that actually end up capturing value and I think comparing the theorem to EOS is an easier way to kind of internalize that idea and just so I'm clear I don't know as much about AOS but as far as I understand there is only something like twenty-one blog producers that's correct yes that's correct I just like in this moment in time when crypto is so small I could see how that might have an appeal but I do think at a certain point if crypto gets big enough it could actually pose a threat to nation-states and so maybe in that environment that kind of blockchain might not have as much appeal so what do you think of that yeah that's completely fair and actually that is that is the goal of diversifying your investments across these different possible value accrual local Maxima in this n-dimensional trade-off space is well some things are going to need to be fully decentralized and if that's actually what ends up capturing most of the value we as fund managers need to look at the world probabilistically and so we assign some probability to that happening or that's that person of the world existing in the future or there's a version of the world where you know actually we care less about sovereign resistance and we care more about platform grade censorship resistance we're having a neutral back-end that a bunch of decentralized applications can build on is valuable and especially for certain use cases like tokenized securities you do not mean censorship resistant tokenize securities because at the end of the day securities are dependent on the legal system in the jurisdiction in which they were issued they're worthless otherwise so having censorship resistant tokenize securities is kind of an oxymoron you don't need it right so there are other places like other functions that something like an Els can serve that Bitcoin cerium is it like the decentralisation of material it's not necessary and are there particular areas within those local Maxima that you think will generate more value than others yes I mean like the only thing we can say with I think a high degree of confidence based on empirical data is that maximising there will be a local maximum value if the if you tried just decentralize that block production and the basic idea is running like no matter what happened to governments can stop it and like there's they can't inflate in your play with the money supply they can sense of transactions those kinds of things so there's a real value at optimizing at that extreme and Bitcoin etherium tend to do that it seems very obvious to me that as a result of that like what they these guys they're leaving a lot of other opportunities open for innovation the OS is the easy example here to use there are a lot of applications that just need a shared open neutral database that is designed to comply with all laws and all drill jurisdictions to that end you just say that the US has a constitution that Constitution is set and voted on by the block producers the block creatures are voted in by by people who own the tokens by so it's gonna face the representative democracy and every single transaction to be valid in the ELN system you have to take a hash of the Constitution and submit that hash or the Constitution with your transaction otherwise will not be valid until my point in all this Assange is like us is trying to actually be compliant and supportive of laws around the world and there's a tremendous number of applications then that's what they need if you're running an advertising exchange like on blockchain like this is perfect for you I mean look at what Facebook is doing with the GDR right now right like these these people are complying with laws and they're the purpose of them is not to say hey screw the government we're gonna do whatever we want but to actually be able to comply with laws and deliver a real-world applications to real people doesn't do that another very obvious example is gaming so we soap into dozens of teams building building games in the space and all a lot of the teams at first explored a cerium as the backend for their games and they all came to the conclusion that the theorem is not workable because they're just stupid issues you know guys to build games are used to building systems that process thousands of transactions per second and so all the game people especially cuz they're not that early people have a economics or monetary policy they like they look at a theorem they like this is a child's toy you know they want they want real systems that they can build real-world applications on and so a lot of teams building games for example right now are gravitating towards yes so our point is is like we we're using a theory videos not to say there's only two options it's just that's probably the most stark yeah clear visible line between these systems if you look at Kadena right Kadena is one of the cool things in the Kadena is that the smart contracts are intended to human readable so you can have non-technical business users read of smart contracts maybe it turns out there's a massive sector of global commerce where people want to be able to read contract before signing them and committing to them programmatically cryptographically right if you think there's some probability to that future vision of the world plays out then the Kadena becomes very interesting and maybe that's just playing on a totally different spectrum totally every kind of set of trade-offs in the design face of these systems so we're not at this point it's very premature to like say with any degree of confidence where all those local maximo will accrue it's very obvious that there's a local maxima maximal decentralization it's very obvious there's a local Maxima at platform grade platform grade centers of resistance versus sovereign grade censorship resistance there will be lots of other local maxima and we are exploring those every day and to be really clear to the listeners here the idea behind this is to give everyone a framework that they can use to evaluate these layer 1 protocols we're not recommending any of these investments and we do you know update our views pretty frequently as we get new information so I want to make sure that that listeners know that we're not saying that EOS is better than aetherium that's not how I want that to be interpreted they are choosing different trade-offs admit that they will address different markets but the important thing here is really the framework of how to think about competition between these layer levels I think something that's interesting to me is that I almost want to say that this is a little bit contradictory of where we started the conversation where you were talking about how the network effect is really going to decide things and that the bigger networks always adopt the better technologies later on after they get all the users and then at this point in the conversation it feels like you're saying that there's gonna be a whole bunch of different chains all with different users who want the chains for different things are these actually opposing or do they coexist somehow let me reconcile those for you that's that's a really good point and the way that those two views actually coexist is that we're talking about different things and those two views when we're talking about it's all about go to market and everyone will copy everyone else's technology they were really talking about features we're talking about specific user experience elements or just other types of features that are valuable but when we're talking about different chains offering different solutions we're talking about trade-offs so no matter what BOS develops and how much of it you theory eMpAtHy's it's extremely extremely unlikely that etherium will ever copy the delegated proof of stake consensus mechanism of POS that's just not gonna happen to them it's too centralized it's kind of like you know the light side the force in the dark side of the force when you talk to people at the etherion foundation so you're not gonna see a system like a theory I'm going use the different trade-offs that a competing system like Definity or z/os or Tasos has chosen but you will see the copying of features and when you look at the a player build of you know one layer above this level one platform layer that's where that feature copying becomes even more cutthroat and you'll you'll see that same differentiation by choice of trade-offs even at that a player so this helps us this understanding of both of these points of view of you know how does open-source change investing really helps us understand which attributes of a project are actually truly differentiated or will cause it to be differentiated from its competitors and which won't and then that's really informative in our investing decisions something else that's interesting to me about this conversation is that I think this is the first time where I haven't heard Kyle be completely all-in bullish on aetherium because I had actually previously written this question noting that Kyle had said that all the developers have left Bitcoin for a theater well I don't mean this in the literal sense that the Bitcoin developers have left for aetherium but just he was talking about developers generally saying that many of them have left pick point for etherium but I will actually wanted to ask him about this because so Kyle I just was curious about this contention and I looked at the github repositories for Bitcoin in etherium and in the last 30 days Bitcoin has had quite a bit more activity actually than etherium for instance it has had 66 active polar quests as opposed to 16 active pull requests on ethereum and then there are 48 active issues on Bitcoin as opposed to 18 active issues on etherium so why do you keep saying that all these developers have left the coin for aetherium sorry so when I tell burrs have left pick one for aetherium what I'm referring to is not core level protocol developers my I think I think it is correct this correct statement that more developers are currently actively developing the Quinn protocol than the etherium protocol that needs to be caveated by saying that there are multiple ethereum implementations there's really only one two quite application so when you say you're looking at a theory i'm your i'm assuming you're looking at Geth which is the version of a theremin and go but there are multiple other versions and a lot of those developers are working on only one version so I would caveat that one note but when I say the developers have left Bitcoin for aetherium what I really mean of the people building on top of the clinton etherium and it is there's a difference of probably two orders of magnitude and perhaps even three orders of magnitude difference between the number of people building things on top of etherium versus the number of people building things on top of Bitcoin and how are you judging that how are you figuring that out I mean I don't have a perfect precise measurement I can look at I can just tell you like based on collectively all of the like various data points I see so this would be obviously pictures that come in to us through our websites this would be going to meetups this would be just looking at like listening to the communities on Reddit on Twitter across all these places collectively I mean Bitcoin today is basically there's a couple of core level innovations going on like lightening is being developed like they're working on some novel like signal you know source signatures and a couple other signature aggregation things but like like there's just not that much changing in Bitcoin and then you look at a cerium the number and pace of things changing both at the protocol layer and on top of the protocol it's just massive difference I knew you're gonna love the Lightning Network on Bitcoin why so the Lightning is like it resent Eliza's Bitcoin so if you look at the diagrams today of Lightning Network look at the network topology of like who has open channels with other people it looks like a hub-and-spoke model today and this is that like basically you know alpha scale or maybe David's killer usage there's basically no viable game plan to get lightning that could be a decentralized network in a meaningful way or assuming a distributed and we're gonna move away it's gonna be the southern smoke model and so if you as a user are connected to a single hub and that hub is your single point of access to connect commerce other people like the whole point of these systems is to not be decentralized and then I have a single party who can censor your transactions and I just like fundamentally like lightning violates that core principle in a way that I think doesn't is in a long-term corrosive to the vision for Bitcoin I think if you want to solve scalability you know I'm not saying all there two solutions are bad I'm saying giving up on layer one scalability for layer two scalability I find that to be like the ultimate capitulation of not being willing this of not willing to innovate and try to solve hard computer science problems at layer one and one other thing I wanted to ask you about your views on Bitcoin is that I know you think that Bitcoin has largely failed because of debacles in its governance but at the same time you also have tweeted that faux on governance is a poor use of resources so why if you think that governance problems can cause a network to fail why do you think it's not that important to focus on it yes I think these should be taken a view of different points in time for the different levels of maturity of the projects referring to in the case of Bitcoin my belief of the failure of the big ones governance is that the team might be that Bitcoin is failing is a view of they basically evolve or die and Bitcoin basically refuses to evolve there's plenty of people who will say that's false and look at all this innovation yada yada yada I'm not saying they're not doing anything I'm just saying if you look at the level of technical ambition of Bitcoin versus basically any other serious layer one protocol there it's not really in the same ballpark other teams are trying to solve fundamentals computer science problems like the slaughtering the scalability trilemma its kind of the very obvious example here but there are many others Bitcoin is literally giving up on that and just said no we're just gonna do layer two and centralize everything on these hubs for like your network and I just think I think that's the ultimate wrong view the governed the implicit governance of Bitcoin is such that the Bitcoin core development team in practice controls the roadmap of the system and it took even the miners after fighting for two years to finally develop a way to fork off and go to Bitcoin cash my view of governance thinking is a Bitcoin is that you just have this like people say it's decentralized and I mean you could argue my mining centralization or not there's a separate question but there's no question that you know the Bitcoin core Development Group which is a very small number of people I think it's four or five people who control the actually merging commits in the github like those people could hold a Bitcoin and I believe their views on how to build like the future of money I believe are fundamentally incorrect and that's why I believe the coin is scaling because it just bigger doesn't make sense to me that the future is digital gold and that's digital cash that can be used for all kinds of other things and - sure I know that you somewhat disagree with Kyle's views here what are your views on Bitcoin Bitcoin is a interesting discussion point within the firm and actually this is one of the things that we pride ourselves as a firm on it was being able to productive disagreements and discussions ear and nose I find lightning Network to be far more compelling than Pyle does for a couple reasons one is I do see that there is real value to complete decentralization and the ability to run a full node for anyone who wants to I don't know that this is definitely the right answer so I can't say with complete conviction that yes you know one megabyte blocks for ever but I do think that if we can solve scalability with a second layer solution then we have solved the scalability trilemma between layer 1 and layer 2 where you do have decentralized block much and you do have a secure network and you do have scalability so it's going to be interesting to see how the lighting networks evolution actually plays out there are some really difficult technical challenges with getting a global scale lighting network implementation some of which are just not solved yet such as how do you route money through the system but there is a real chance that this is a plausible solution and as fund managers their job is to look at the world probabilistic way right there's there's a real probability that lightning works in the way that's been advertised yeah and one other thing is that Bitcoin has that first mover advantage and the brand name recognition which goes back to kind of that earlier thesis point that you guys were - and we're talking about with you know looking for a coin that has distribution and network effects but I actually don't want to belabor this because I want to move on and ask you something else - char you tweeted that public pre-product icos posed too much regulatory put posed too much risk from a regulatory perspective but at the same time you also mentioned earlier that you have illiquid tokens so how are you managing regulatory risk right now we are really cognizant of the regulatory risk for us investing in product investments we are investing in those as you know incredible investor effectively and with all of the proper exemptions filed with the SEC so we we do not want to invest in anything that we think has a real chance of being an unregistered securities offering being combined is one of our core values we talked about stable coins in the beginning of this conversation and talked about how they can fill perhaps a need right now in the space which has to do with the volatility of pricing and I know a lot of people think that that maybe has been part of the reason that crypto hasn't got an adoption is because the prices don't remain stable so people don't want to spend an asset that could go up but at the same time I once was talking with Kyle and this was after the news about base coin one of the stable coins came out and it's actually I mean there's different ways to structure stable coin for listeners who didn't listen to the episode with maker Dow and and Philip Rosedale of who did second life but is now doing a project called high fidelity we talked about the different challenges in keeping a stable coin stable in the different ways that some of these projects are going about it and base coin is doing it in a way where they're not actually backing up their coin with collateral but I wasn't sure Kyle if you're bearish stance had to do with just that way of setting up a stable coin or if you think all stable coins are are not necessary and and will go up in flames my sense is that on a long enough time scale there probably won't be a decentralized open and stable coin at least not one that's that's an algorithm Central Bank I think that's some confidence in that but but again like low overall conviction we today an Ulta we don't have any stable coin investments we have evaluated lots of them and evaluate them despite the fact that I think in the long run that they probably won't work at least not ones in the shares model of the world and that's kind of base coined is the quintessential example that doesn't mean we don't want to invest in them a to learn B because we can generate financial return before that time scale and so I we're super interested in the space I think it's one of the most compelling opportunities in crypto and it's ok to invent some things that you think have long term like challenges but like as long as you're cognizant of those challenges and then price the risk accordingly then that's totally fine last question for you guys I know you have written a ton and your Twitter feeds and blog posts are seriously just like candy for anybody who's gone down the crypto rabbit hole there they're awesome I highly recommend that readers check them out but I just wanted to ask you before we go what for each of you what is your most controversial position in the crypto space I mean bitcoin is failing ok - sorry what about you let's see I would say I am amongst at least within multi coin I am the least bullish unstable coins I do not think that stable coins are going to work I don't think they're necessary as a large scale a project and the reason is I think that we will see central banks issue fiat on the blockchain and that's going to eat the market for stable coins from the bottom up it's an it's an inferior product from a lot of economic perspectives where it is still you know just to be up currency but it'll also be you from the top down as the various assets like Bitcoin or either become much larger and therefore become less volatile so I see stable coins as being eaten from the bottom up and from the top down I don't know if that's that controversial in the broader crypto world but it's definitely a controversial position with them yeah we'll see I asked rune Christensen of maker Dow about this and he was like because I I said oh ii thought a central bank issues a currency on the blockchain then aren't you out of business and he was like no no no because this is decentralized and not centralized so we'll see something that centralized like so if you pay your same coin to the US dollar then you don't have your own monetary policy you were just using the Federal Reserve's monetary policy but I don't I don't think you're like yeah I don't think they're fixed on that forever he was saying it could they could change it to I forget it's CPI is something like it's basically positive about Couture goods yeah you have yes they are well once again that's still centralized is where what defines the CPI is the federal government the United States federal government defined CPI and what defines the SDR is it's a combination of currencies like the US dollar the pound the URL etc so it's you're still coming back to that centralization and if you try and peg it directly to a basket of goods without using the CPI now you're now you're subject to the Oracle problem of how do you determine the price of goods and they differ between different countries and you're trying to solve this global problem and there's just a no credible solution presented yet yeah yeah I I agree I mean there's there's a lot of questions there but I do I frankly find all this table coin projects super interesting if only because yes there's so many ways you could imagine that they would fail well it's been so great having you both on the show where can people learn more about multi coin so yeah you guys should definitely follow us on Twitter as Laura mentioned we share our very colorful opinions rather frequently I'm on Twitter at Kyle somani Kyo Lee si ma
