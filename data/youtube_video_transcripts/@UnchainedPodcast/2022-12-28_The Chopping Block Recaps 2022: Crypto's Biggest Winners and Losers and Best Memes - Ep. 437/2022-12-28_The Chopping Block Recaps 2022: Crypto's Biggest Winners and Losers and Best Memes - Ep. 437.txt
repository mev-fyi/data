not a dividend It's A Tale of Two fun now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet generally speaking airdrops are kind of pointless anyways um my name's trading firms who are very involved I like to have the ultimate D5 Protocols are the antidote to this problem all right hello everybody Welcome to The Chopping Block every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry insiders perspective on the crypto topics of the day so quick intros first we've got Tom the D5 Maven and master of memes next up Robert crypto connoisseur and captain of compound then you've got to ruin the Giga brain and Grand Puba at Gauntlet and lastly you've got myself Embassy the head height man a dragonfly all four of us are early stage investors in crypto but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice legal advice or even life advice so it has been an absolutely insane and harrowing year uh so much stuff has happened this year it's one of those um I think it was it wasn't it Stalin who said There are weeks when nothing happens and or Not Sorry years where nothing happens and then weeks where decades happened or something like that this feels like a year where centuries happened can ask me one question do we start with the good news first or the bad news first in like you know if I in your storytelling Style I think it's hard to begin with bad news because the year started pretty good right like I mean Bitcoin was at 50 something K when the year started and like things were feeling like I remember so I listened back to our uh end of year the first ever episode of The Chopping Block actually was uh December like 20th something last year so it was basically the same time of year last year and we were looking forward on the year and reflecting on what went well what went poorly and we were also optimistic it was like really crazy how even the things that were negative last year in retrospect were so small and minuscule compared to the horrible things that have befallen people in this industry in 2022. so what we're going to do is we're going to go through actually in the same order that we went through the winners and losers the biggest winners and losers in all the different categories for last year so this is a sneak preview the categories are going to be biggest winner Biggest Loser best mechanism biggest surprise best meme and then we're gonna make predictions for 2023. so that's the game plan we're going to start with biggest winner okay so just as a reminder last year what we said in 2021 the biggest winners were altel ones coinbase from its IPO Solana openc Lido and Dogecoin okay that's what we said with the biggest winners of 2021 2022 biggest winners I know it's hard to find anybody who won this year uh but Robert why don't you start who is your 2022 biggest winner for this year so the biggest winner of 2022 are I don't know if you've seen this meme on Twitter stable coin Bulls the people that were Naval coined matching who were posting memes of like ripped blue usdc balls and anyone who basically was following a market neutral stable coins esque strategy so there were some corners of the industry where people all year were maxing out their stables and just chasing yield wherever they could find it now some of these people chasing the old got felled by C5 landmines by you know defy hacks by whatever but for the most part the stable coin bowls were one of the rare pockets of winners this year it's funny I've got one guy who replies a bunch to my tweets who is constantly writing threads about let me explain to you how this thing is actually going to change the world here's a thread and he wrote one about usdc and I was like what is going on uh but that guy that guy printed this year that guy did amazing this year compared to the rest of us yeah the people who were chasing you know half a percent a month yields you know did fantastic this year there was a UST bull so maybe not you may want to do you may want to you may want to like put a boundary around the all the different bull meme accounts even even UST balls did great this year I mean you know sorry not UST sorry I thought you said USD there was a UST bowl that that of course you know yeah that was one of the many stable coin landmines that did exist but also tether didn't blow up this year even though there's a couple moments where it traded off you know two and a half percent um you know in general the stable coin bowls you know were in my definition the winners totally agree I mean also I think just from an issuance and transaction volume perspective you're hitting new all-time highs and stable coins so not only did they do well from a portfolio perspective but like from a usage and metrics perspective stable coins are kind of killing it right now bullish bullish on stable coins nice okay uh tarun what is your biggest winner for 2022 you know I'm not trying to to butter up our host too much but I actually think Laura Shin had an amazing 2022. she had an amazing book that came out she had a bunch of amazing Scoops with both all of the villains as well as with Martin shkreli last week she I think she had like probably the best year in crypto journalism of everyone like the mainstream media completely blew it like Forbes looked stupid because all they were doing was like constantly lapping up at SPF every week yeah you know like they did all those crazy articles that like people cite all the VC funds we know how well their media strategy went so like I gotta say Laura Shin's kind of like last journalist standing like really like killing it this year so I'm gonna give her my my and again I'm not trying to this is not like me sucking up to the teacher you know being like Oh like I actually think she had an amazing year I I think you're absolutely right about that however I just want I should add you know being that we are on the show we also had a pretty amazing year in lockstep with Laura right like we had almost every crypto villain on the show except for three hours three hours was the only crypto villain we didn't have on the show who has wanted to be on the show that's true uh and we I think we've we've had a pretty good track record of calling stuff I think FTX we messed up FTX we did not call out pretty much at all until after FDX blew up but almost everything else I think we were fairly prescient before things ended up exploding so I think um overall we end up looking okay I think Laura definitely looks better than we did but I thought I think chopping blog was a pretty good year for us I mean I mean Laura had an unreal year like journalism wise like I think like she might this might be like the bumper year well I'll I'll add on and say also citizen journalism on crypto Twitter this year had a real breakout performance I mean this is one of the years where in general crypto Twitter was scooping a lot of major stories later were covered by media organizations you know ranging all the way from like you know Kobe you know finding the insider trading at coinbase to people you know revealing some of the weaknesses at Celsius you know people doing research on FTX as it was collapsing you know there was you know Zach xbt you know breaking all of these different you know scams and run polls like this was a year of Citizen journalism on crypto Twitter and in addition to Laura being great in addition to us being decent crypto Twitter did an awesome job this year and a runner-up to block explorers like so many of the big stories this year were told through block explorers and I think a lot of people a lot of journalists especially got acquainted with block explorers for the first time this year all right Tom you're up next biggest winner you know I was still feeling pretty good about my last pick because Lido and they still seem to be crushing it but in the interest of doing something new I'm gonna go with D5 I think you know this is the story that we kind of keep telling time and time again which is yes you know a lot of these C5 ponzi's have blown up but D5 is still doing well um you know other than the you know hack here and there sort of the core defy Primitives are still solvent users still have money they're still functioning they're still issuing loans a lot of them are making a lot of money and so I think you know this has been sort of a crucible for the industry overall but I think also a great narrative enhancer for why D5 is important and also obviously a great it feels like sort of the Redemption Arc from March 2020 of a lot of these things flowing up or incurring losses or realizing they need to be fixed this was sort of the flip side of that of them sort of coming home and uh showing that these things are very resilient and they they work as intended um and they're they're necessary now um you can't just rely on the trust of you know any single centralized actor with D5 the proof is on chain yeah it's such a good point I think you said on a previous show that D5 really went through a hero's journey I think it's a perfect metaphor for kind of the the experience of D5 from 2020 when covet started to I guess 2022 when covet ended in some places that D5 really showed its medal given a challenge of similar proportion to what happened in March 2020 but with a totally different kind of hardened skill set and and maturity than what we saw the last time we saw a crisis for D5 one actual question is if there's really a hero's journey who's gonna make the movie um I don't know there's gonna be for sure an FTX movie but I don't know if that's going to cover T5 Robert who would you want to pay you play you in the uh D5 movie yeah who's gonna play Robert that's a great question Zach Galifianakis well I would love for Zach to be fine well the thing about another but here's the thing about Defy is that if D5 succeeds there can't be a movie about it because there are no characters yeah that's true but I I do kind of feel like there's still a story like even if the characters made the characters are more transient like they like have some important when they go away a narrative film without characters so it's kind of you know like it's like you know koyana scotsy or something yeah and so uh you need some uh anans need some voice actors you know it can just be like someone voicing djen Spartan and uh yeah that's that's sort of the movie I guess it has to be an anime right is that is that what you're sort of now I would tell I would 100 watch a defy enemy that sounds amazing sounds amazing all right so my 2022 biggest winner of the year is the evm so the evm has absolutely crushed its primary competitor last year was basically a combination of there's a lot of virtual machine as well as uh wasm there were a bunch of wasn't based chains that were really trying to make a run at evm and this idea was coming around that maybe the evm which is the ethereum sort of operating system so to speak wasn't going to win or was going to be displaced in the near future it's become increasingly clear that that is not going to happen now with the downfall Solana nine of the top 10 chains by tvl are all evm based the evm has just become completely and utterly dominant in everything smart contract based and it's very hard to see that turning around at this point I think one of the clear winners in a year with not a lot of wins has been the evm it's a great pick fair enough all right so okay I guess actually one addendum maybe to that is um you know I think one interesting thing to watch is is sort of like whether the ZK evm kind of version of the world will will be the next iteration or whether it will be other virtual machines that host a ZK evm and like right now we're starting to see like what's the future of the evm and I think that's like something to look forward to in 2023 because it's like very it's not clear at all what the the final state is for like the next what's the thing Pokemon do Evolution yeah there we go that's your basis for evolution is Pokemon yeah okay sorry sorry what's that thing that animals do yeah that's good um yeah no you're absolutely 100 um what I want to I want to clarify actually in saying that I think the vvm is not dominant does not mean that the evm is done or that we've reached the end of the line and this is you know the the the Charizard of virtual machines as you will uh in fact it's it's a sign that there's much more work to do because clearly the evm is not going to get us to the promised land right the evm is still super janky it's basically unchanged from when it was originally developed we are like in the you know the the action script stage of JavaScript development there's so much more that's going to be done I think to one improved DVM but then second you know other virtual machines I think will still take a run of evm and try to improve it at the margin uh or build upon it and kind of innovate upon the foundation of the evm but change things underneath it but I think evm is probably going to be now the just the lingua Franca right The Core Concepts behind the evm are probably going to be enshrined and how blockchains work do you remember how uh like in the 2000s early 2010s there was like a new JavaScript framework every year that became like the like hot thing for a year and then it would disappear and do you feel like that's going to happen here because like I I'm I guess you could argue like the hard hat Foundry kind of transition yeah looks a little bit like that yeah yeah I feel like the the dev fueling and framework you know in Vogue within crypto turns over over time but like the consistent bit is the evm which is also you know true for JavaScript yeah it'd be cool to see just like a diagram of like the comparison like the timelines of these two types of things because like I feel I feel like there is like a lot of parallels totally totally okay so biggest winner it's kind of a feel-good section I think it's going to be the Biggest Loser section is probably going to be quite a bit meteor this year because it was a year of a lot of losses let's say uh should we do two per person because I feel like there's we might we might need a there's a lot of space if if you wanna two you can do two I'm gonna do one okay we'll let people do what they feel in terms of losers so just just to recap what did we say as biggest losers last year we said the grayscale gbtc trade which oh boy did we have no idea what was coming on that Bitcoin as one of the biggest losers hen which was an early tazos nft Marketplace and then EOS those are what we said was the biggest losers last year in retrospect very naive to say that there's any of those that really lost compared to what was coming for them but okay Biggest Loser hey gbtc gbtc gets some credit come on that one was a good that was that was a good prediction even if that's the wrong restaurant I'm saying there's much more pain coming there was so much more pain coming than what we imagined at that time yeah I'll take credit for naming gbtc last year it was also one of the big losers this year but you know that we'll see what happens next year maybe it'll be the big winner next year as it gets Unwound so what's your what's your pick for this year Robert well I'm Gonna State the absolutely most obvious Award winner for the Biggest Loser this year and this might be a slightly controversial take but I believe that this year the Biggest Loser was the reputation of the industry from the perspective of Outsiders so starting off with the implosion of Tara and UST which was one of the fastest growing algorithmic stable coins and alternative L1 blockchains of all time which did about you know directly 60 billion dollars worth of damage and indirectly a couple hundred billion dollars worth of damage to the rest of the industry following up with the collapse of every single C5 lender some for you know innocuous reasons some for terrible blunder some for deliberate fraud you know the collapse of every single C5 lender culminating in the collapse of FTX externally the most respected exchanges of all time um with one of you know with a Founder that was widely you know revered outside of our industry you know for better for worse all of these things in my opinion have done you know a tremendous amount of damage to the reputation of the industry and collectively you know share the award for our industry's loss of you know respect this year yeah that's a it's a very sobering answer I think you're very right it's something that I think all of us have experienced just in retrospect thinking to like what it felt like December last year when all of my friends thought the coolest thing in the world was to be a crypto PC and now it's like the cringiest thing in the world to be a crypto VC anecdotally I have heard from a lot of my friends that they're um if they're single that their dating prospects massively changed between this year and last year just because crypto has lost so much face culturally compared to what it felt like in 2021 like I I hate to say it but all four of us are unfortunately For Better or Worse tarred and feathered with being closer to Ian Belina than we are to you know sanctity this is true this is true all right well tarun what do you say Biggest Loser of 2022 in a competitive field my my two I kind of have two that I'm tied for on the tech side because I'm gonna try to maybe more focus on like technology side and I I'm reticent to call out both of these because I actually think they do have vibrant communities and they clearly made a mark one obviously is the Solana ecosystem I just think like the sheer number of blows that they've taken is unreal and if they survive this is like a e 88 event like like if solanus ecosystem survives like I think they just are a cockroach after this but if they die that like this is a insane amount of death blows to get at once let's start with the beginning of the year Wormhole hack mainly affects a lot and needed sort of a a centralized gatekeeper to step in uh with the capital buffer right like it wasn't able to like kind of reconcile a telephone so and then you know I think a lot of the interesting things there's a lot of ties between the salon ecosystem and to some extent the lunar ecosystem partially because bridging was actually easy between them and you know that started really like the spiral of like people just starting to remove money then there are a bunch of hacks partially because a lot of the D5 protocols in Solana were just never open source that were not audited and and like I think in like the Gaga days of 2021 no one really cared but obviously this year I think people started to pay more attention and then of course you know you have the mango hack good FTX the thing that's interesting is the people who are still around in salonland do seem to have the mentality that I feel like East people had so I'm hoping that they can get a little bit of a reprieve just because you know there's a lot of really smart hard-working people in that ecosystem uh who are not like just like DJ and nft whatever Traders they actually are like trying to build new technology and that has a particular philosophical vision of what it should look like and there's pros and cons to it yeah I mean also I I forgot to mention the biggest one in my mind to some extent was the loss of serum because a lot of their defy ecos was built around serum as sort of like the main liquidity Center the thing that's really interesting is that so actually one of the predictions you made last year was that there was going to be a massive hack within the saloon of ax ecosystem which you had like many times over you were definitely right about that but a lot of us thought last year you could were called out the closed Source nature of Solana it wasn't really because of hacks that Solana ended up bleeding out its defy actually that was happening much more aggressively on BSC which has actually been more resilient than Solana on the D5 side it seems like Solana defy really was a death by a Thousand Cuts because of liveness is that just the blockchain kept going down this year especially for the first half of the year due to all these like crazy nft kind of uh thundering herds but also the hacks even the bridge hacks caused liveness losses right like but but the bridge Act was made whole right so like people actually didn't lose money on the hacks in Solana they lost a lot of money on BSE Allah a lot of the defy users have lost money so in Solon for instance one of the craziest things that you would see right after the Wormhole hack because at that time Wormhole had synthetic assets so like you lock up Ethan eath and you get this like IOU like West like thing on Solana and the peg that thing depeged significantly and so people were using as collateral they Marked One to One on Solana as it goes equal to neets but it actually was redeeming for much less and like the the D5 users actually took some huge losses in the hacks that are different than just like people crossing like lenders on the Solana side who lent usdc Solana took huge losses so my point is like there's all this stuff that it is definitely Death By A Thousand Cuts but there's a lot of stuff that went wrong and I think part of it is like all the things that grew last year needed to give this like kind of pump effect to each other constantly and so like when that all explodes even if you actually are like the one who who has a lot of things like that didn't intrinsically blow up you're being constantly in the shrapnel is going to just like really really hurt you from from many different versions of the world so I but like I said I I you know I even though in my mind they are the certainly The Biggest Loser on the technology side said I think a lot of other things that were sort of weird were like I think the Solana phone was kind of like a crazy thing that's like a an idea that people you know makes a lot of sense because like actually it's like really hard to get phone manufacturers to like build trusted enclaves for certain types of keys and stuff like that right but like it feels like they did a bunch of stuff prematurely that like now doesn't look that great in hindsight so I I put them I and the other thing I tie with them is probably the nft ecosystem I just think like I it's like there's just so much that went wrong there I feel like this year and I don't know where to start with that [Laughter] um I uh Robert quit nfts Robert quit nfts this year that's true that's true that's true I quit nfts this year yeah I mean if you look at nft Daily monthly actives and you look at nft mints actually those numbers look pretty healthy so I think it's not it's a mixed story I was gonna say nfts are surprisingly resilient I think they're like kind of isolated they're in their own little world for the most part and so yeah from like a user numbers and activity perspective entities actually look great um obviously the price is in volume so maybe not connect up with with 121 but um independent of that yeah I think nft holders are poorer but there's still a lot of them and they're still pretty active and they're still pretty animated about what they're doing um but I think the Envy of normies of the nft world that has gone away anyway that's done uh oh actually another loser I'll add the word Normie I think I think I think I think I don't think it had a good year is it time to retire the word we'll bring it back in the next bull market I think for now we'll we'll put it in the pantry we'll pull it out when we need it do you guys agree it kind of it like started the year as this like I'm better than you like whatever like [ __ ] like Dubai Miami crypto person like shtick and like by the end of the year it's like wow don't you wish you were a normie yeah exactly because I felt that feeling quite a few times all right Tom what is Your Biggest Loser for 2022 you know again I'm still feeling pretty good about my 2021 uh pick of Bitcoin where this year we saw real inflation we saw a worse macro picture and Bitcoin you know just kind of traded like every other growth asset and so the inflation resistance narrative is kind of dead um and then you know in comparison obviously each had it had a great year uh with you know issuance going negative for a brief period merge completing successfully but again in the interest of of picking something new I had ponzis as a category overall and I think what we saw this year yes there were many different and it collapses but they all can add a similar shape to them which were kind of byproducts of like a zero interest rate environment very Pro reflexivity very Pro leverage and sort of you know when that momentum started to stall out they all sort of fell and that could be a Luna that could be an axi that could be a literal you know three arrows or FTX or whatever it is but it feels like all the big losers this year have that in common where uh you know when the gas starts to run out and the momentum starts to die these things get hit the hardest so um I think it's good probably that these are no longer with us but overall that's kind of how I see um you know a lot of the big failure stories of 2022. this is actually exactly one of the things that I picked I called it tokenomics which I like I think this is a terrible year for tokenomics anything that you wrote a medium post about last year explaining the tokenomics every single one of them got absolutely destroyed this year so whether it's Luna whether it's axi whether it's you know ve tokens whether it's like all this D5 2.0 crazy recursive nonsense almost everything that had anything interesting about his tokenomics just got absolutely exploded so I think the the just even the term tokenomics I I think might have to go in the pantry alongside normi because it just it is not aged well as a term it's a little cringy it's a little cringy now yeah so actually I I um when when I talked to entrepreneurs or Founders about tokenomics at this point I tell them like don't even think about talking about like just don't say the word tokenomics is a distraction from just building a good product that people want to use and if you do that then maybe you have a chance of building something valuable but tokenomics won't get you there like there's at this point we basically don't have examples of when tokenomics actually created great products tokenomics are a zero interest rate phenomena well I I would actually equate tokenomics to financial engineering right so absent Financial engineering you know companies on Wall Street have to be successful otherwise they go bankrupt and that's the end of the story right there's also examples you know look at the 1980s using debt right look at you know the 1990s using new Equity structures right there's examples of financial engineering complementing strong underlying businesses to be you know one and a half X successful or 2x successful but there has to be an underlying you know value and success driver there otherwise you know whether you call it Financial engineering or tokenomics that's not gonna you know change the core it's just going to put you know lipstick on a dead pig right like I do think there is a world you know maybe in the future where there's lots of successful crypto networks crypto protocols crypto things that augment they're incredibly sound core with you know Innovative token design right and I think that's an enhancer when done correctly but I think there has to be like a really strong Foundation it's a good point I think arguably the only real protocol with good tokenomics at this point is ethereum itself almost everything else that you would admire for its token uh like it's tokenomics just has been an absolute dog and usually it's some kind of card before the horse thing where the tokenomics is the interesting part and the product kind of sucks now we it's very clear that's a huge anti-pattern um but very attractive in a zero interest rate environment the way I like to describe it is if you took steroids and you didn't work out you're not getting jacked that's that's how I described that is a perfect there's a perfect encapsulation so I had I had a double a double a double feature so my other big loser for the year last year I said the biggest winner was Kyle samani and this year he's also the Biggest Loser So Cal samani is the managing partner at multi-coin Capital which is a big Solana and FTX Affiliated investment firm they made huge bets on Solana which did extremely extraordinarily well last year one of the best performing funds in Venture history this year gave a ton of it back uh rode Solana down we have you know public statements that they've made or not public statements let's just say leaked uh statements to their own investors they lost 10 percent of their net assets on FTX in addition to owning ftt having invested into FTX equity and owning Solana as well as a bunch of Investments on top of Solana almost all of which have gotten really destroyed this year so I feel for the guy I like Kyle we've had one the show uh a great dude but he has just gotten absolutely hammered this year and I feel for him um I'd say alongside Kyle I'd say growth investors you don't include hashed uh they've hash definitely got hit but they were working on a much smaller base than what I think multi like multi-coin was really just they were just you know champions of the universe at the end of last year they they could do no wrong and um I think now this year they've just taken a beating that uh on a different scale than hash hashes you know they weren't that high up when I think they got really hit by Tara and everything that happened in that ecosystem I mean it was still like three billion dollars lost right something like that like three years like they have like a Luna yeah it was like gigantic right right I mean multi-coin had a big so it's a lot of position too uh plus FTX equity salon's not zero true true true true the FTX Equity is zero Solana not zero yeah they they lost a lot as well it might be close tie it might be close the other the other separately I'd say also growth investors as a category when it comes to investors growth investors just got absolutely shafted this year I don't think there's any investors any growth stage investors in crypto who have made money now I'm pretty sure every single one is down very significantly and of course half of them put money into FDX so it's been a bad year for growth the best thing about last year that I remember that I was very confused about was when people who were growth investors were like oh I you know what I'm gonna do I'm start gonna start doing early stage early stage Investments like trait by basically investing in whatever FTX invested and I was like wait wait I thought you're supposed to be a growth stage investor why are you like copy trading seed stage investments from one of your growth stage Investments That was like that was one of the crazy things of like December 2021 that like you know I don't think we're gonna see her for a while there's also the opposite seed stage investors investing in late rounds and growth very true and that was equally disastrous so you know it goes both ways yeah the lesson overall is like stay in your lane stick to what you're good at otherwise you're gonna get hurt and uh in a bull market everything gets rewarded right it's like you're you're riding on a slip and slide and everyone's gonna make it to the water in a bear Market you are like driving into oncoming traffic and you'd better be you better know exactly where you're going and time all your turns because otherwise you are just going to get wrecked and that that seems to be the story of investing this year we've got some biggest losers let's move on to best mechanism okay this is this ultimately is a podcast about crypto and and crypto mechanisms last year what we said was that the best mechanisms were univ3 convex Finance plus curve the whole you know symbiotic ecosystem there om and ESD which is empty set dollar those were our picks for best mechanism last year let's see what our updates are to the specs mechanisms Robert what do you got best mechanism well I'm gonna simultaneously Award Best mechanism and worst mechanism to the same recipient because this is a a slightly abstract one I'm going to award Mev on the ethereum blockchain both best mechanism and worst mechanism so I think this year more than anything was a year of extreme normalization of Mev of embedding it directly into the block manufacturing process with Mev boost you know the extreme success of flashbots and you know there's certainly a few other block Builders but Mev I think this year uh reached its inflection point and I don't think this is necessarily a good thing but I think from the perspective of what mechanism has been wildly successful has seen significant growth and almost a unilateral adoption well met I think you know as a mechanism has won this year now I don't think this is a good thing you know I think in some ways you know it you know runs completely counter to the interests of you know the users of the blockchain ethereum and I think it's you know a little bit ironic and perverse to see you know Mev essentially you know officially condoned so to speak because I don't think it runs along the long-term interest of the users of the blockchain but it's definitely the most interesting and successful mechanism in future years we might say it was the least successful mechanism or that cannibalized user base or had these negative externalities or whatever but for the time being this year Mev yeah that is a very good point I think since the merge there's been so much more conversation about Mev outside of people who are sort of defy insiders and kind of understand the machinations of how MV auctions and flashbots and all this stuff really works now it's impossible to not be aware of the politics of Mev that I think is new it was in Elizabeth Warren's proposed bill you know like any Mev got a mention in there about like malicious activity that needs to be stopped like pretty directly um so fascinating I didn't I didn't I didn't know that that's crazy okay so Mev uh tarun what is your vote best mechanism 2022 so last year my mechanism uh I I'll I want to defend it a little bit because it actually did survive which is the OWN bomb uh because zero like Luna and most of the reason was the bonds actually locked people up for a long time and yeah you they had the steady exit out of the main token instead of this like rush to the exit Behavior now the Ponzi staking coin [ __ ] that I'm not I'm not gonna try to defend that but the own Bond I think is actually a very is like I think that will be over time like bond-like mechanisms will somehow make it to defy I you know there have been many attempts some of them gave up some didn't whatever but like during this is a weird Hill to die on but okay do I ever die on very normal Hills I'm not sure that is true that is true you would only die on an extremely weird Hill that is very true yeah yeah so are you doubling down this is your best mechanism no no no okay I I so I think there's this year has been actually a year where it reminds me of 2018 where people went from you know like 2017 like high you know like all these crazy ideas like X on blockchain or why is a new blockchain to like oh like let's like invest in hard technology like starkware got founded then and stuff like that um so I actually think the interesting thing is that there's a lot of new mechanisms that have not been tested that have come out theoretically this year that I think will be successful in next years and those are the ones I'd probably highlight of like things like eigenlayer which you know like you know whether it's implemented by eigen layer whether it's from someone else the idea of restaking your locked assets to offer other services as a validator is going to be kind of a really big thing especially in a world where there's a lot more ZK proof generation uh and I just think like this was a good year for like theoretical mechanism design and less on they apply like the stuff in practice like yeah like kind of like Robert said like nav is like kind of the only thing that got better better in some efficiency sense [Music] that maybe because theoretical designs are not Mark to Market whereas everything else is so it looks good when there's no price on it I think it's actually like in a bull market people do the like hey let me copy pasta like take something existing tweak it a little bit make put that out right and when things crash people like okay I need to take a like much larger bet and I feel like that those are the mechanisms that I think were good this year I think all the ones implemented were people just trying to like re-re relive last year's hurray but with high interest rates I I generally agree with you but I don't think that we actually entered that phase this year until relatively recently I think most of this year although prices were crying post Luna like the moment Luna happened and like it was quite fast where like yeah like all of a sudden all of a sudden all the investors I knew who last year oh this is another big loser in my mind the phrase web three but like all the investors who are touting dog [ __ ] nft stuff which you know listeners of this show have have literally said the same thing to me about like they can't believe all these funds invest in this stuff the idea that like they all flipped the moment Luna happened to try and be like oh we're gonna do her attack again no more like random wallets or like some nft like hype thing and it was like such a fast flip from the investment side that it like also Drew all these kind of like new mechanisms and so I like the Luna thing was clearly like either LPS of all these funds got angry at them or the funds were like oh [ __ ] we can't like invest in dog [ __ ] nfts anymore I don't know what it was there's just like huge transition like like June July of this year you just saw like the investment landscape changed like dramatically that that's totally true that's totally true but I do feel like after FTX like after Luna things felt like okay we're not in a bull market anymore right like things are we've been kind of chastened by the realities of hey bad things can happen in crypto but I think it's really after three arrows collapsed and then after FTX that it really felt like we were in a bear Market I think like three arrows was the feeling that okay not just did bad things happen we're in a bear market now and like we kind of deserve it things aren't going to go back up anymore and then like the party's over right after three years felt like the party was over uh whereas more like Luna felt like somebody knocked over a vase and it was a very expensive vase and it's a big deal and like we're kind of in trouble but like the music's still playing right after three hours the music stopped after FTX it's like oh like one part of the house exploded like the things are very very bad and that the feeling I do actually think that what you're describing to ruin this feeling that when entrepreneurs come into space it demands much more seriousness of them I think that really started after FTX and I think now when I talk to entrepreneurs there is just no sense that anything cutesy is going to work in crypto anymore that I I feel like there was a big tonal shift in the way that entrepreneurs view starting a startup in crypto yeah I mean I don't see any more puff posts and I see all these funds hiring cryptographers instead of like celebrities so like you can there's like such a gigantic change I mean there's one fund I'm talking about in particular which is pretty obvious who that is for the for that like you know they like literally flip from like celebrity endorsement like people to like oh we're hiring a ton of cryptographers like you know that literally started in June it was it was like such a like the the three arrows Luna thing was a complete shift to to the way people's behavior Behavior was and I think that's one of the reasons I'm very negative on nfts for quite a while because I don't think any of these like larger players are going to come back for a while okay Tom what do you got for best mechanism of 2022 this one's maybe a little esoteric but uh I went with liquidity mining on blur blur for those that don't know is the nft aggregator it's a nft aggregator and there's sort of been this this thing where basically last year openc really blew up and everyone saw how much money they were making and now there have been they basically have this Target on their back and there have been a lot of competitors that have come out trying to take down openc um like a looks rare or an x2y2 and they always you know launched openc but with a token and the idea was well we can use the token to and summarize people to use our platform and then maybe we can use that to overtake openc and they were always so terribly designed there are always some like permutation of trade mining which we know has all these issues and that's why you see these stories coming out about nft wash trading and you see these tokens kind of getting farm and dumb it's like it's like so obvious I feel like if you're in the space that like these you know types of token incentives don't work um if you're interested incentivizing people to wash trade blur was really like one of the first that came out well hey I had a you know great product um B it was an aggregator on day one so even you know the day one experience without needing supplemental liquidity is going to be superior just to showing up to some random exchange but three they actually incentivize people to place bids near the floor and as you get compensated more the closer your bid is to the floor um and so it creates this sort of uh incentive to provide liquidity which is like what every nft exchange or every exchange period sort of lives and dies on and so that's why you've seen I think them be so successful not just on on a volume perspective but more importantly from a user perspective from a definitely liquidity perspective they I think had a very clear line on site on how to take on the Giant in the room which is openc um and so far it seems to be paying off pretty well so that's my number one uh mechanism I think for for 2022 is a blur going after uh this big prize yeah great pack has been really impressive to see the growth of blur just in the last couple months even at a time when nft volumes are in the toilet and it doesn't seem like there's a lot of it's very difficult for sharks to grow in an environment where things are trending downward but blur is one of those really rare exceptions that has managed to be one of the breakout growth stories at a time when not much is growing I mean it seems like the year of the aggregator in general right like nft volume and aggregator seems to like basically killed the main exchanges the main exchanges have to either build or buy their own yeah it's wild to me how many people I've spoken with who are starting or pivoting to an NFC aggregator I think it's it's kind of those memetic things where it's people see something working and then they all try to you know copy paste it even if it doesn't really make sense for them or they don't have any unique Insight so also cool to see blur kind of poke through the aggregator space with um you know fresh product but when I got my pick for best mechanism of 2022 was tornado cash so tornado cash has had obviously a rocky year uh it was sanctioned by ofak uh earlier in the summer it ended up they ended up uh basically I mean one one of the founders and developers of train of cash Alexis is still being held uh in detention in Amsterdam without charges being brought against him uh just for the act of writing code however the whole idea of tornado cash was that it was a permissionless decentralized way to achieve privacy on chain and guess what it still works people are still using tornado cash we talk a lot in crypto about the idea that your protocol should work without human intervention well guess what the only protocol or one of the few protocols that I know of that actually answers to that name because it was forced to is tornado cash you can still use tornado cash you still don't need anyone's permission you don't need any human beings to help you um it's all permissionless code on the blockchain and it just works and if anything it's a testament to the power of what they built and now again not not to endorse it or to say that good actors or Bad actors use trainer cash obviously many Bad actors do and you should not use it because it's you know if you're subject to U.S sanctions you should not use render cash but to me I think best mechanism of the year is tornado cash it's it's a privacy protocol that works without any human intervention and it's proven it multiple times over yeah that's a great pick there's a uh Twitter account that tweets out the tornado cash volume uh every day and you know occasionally show up in my feed I'm always surprised it's always like a few hundredk you know kind of low Mills and it's like yeah it's still going people are still using it um you know even without uh yeah even with the main site being down and everything that's happened to the dads and everything so yeah I think uh my my personal measurement of like whether the net direction that the IQ of Bitcoin Maxis is tending in is like their tornado cash posts because like they'll all be like oh it represents like ethereum censorship and whatever and they're like wait a minute but you still see transactions going through like oh like it's not censorship resistant like this is the most resistant thing in ethereum what are you talking about like everyone that's tried to throw the book at it and still running totally totally on top of uh all the Amity boost trailers that are trying to censor it and yet you can still get it between no cash transaction bind within like you know a few minutes so yeah there's a lot of like mac Bitcoin Maxi cope because I feel like they like like tornado cash philosophically and they're like oh we like uh ethereum censoring ethereum sucks because like it's not working and there's a lot of like very complicated Rube Goldberg logic machines kind of on that don't make any sense all right guys let's move on to biggest surprise so biggest surprise again a year full of many surprises so it's gonna be it's going to be a tough choice but here's what we said for 2021 2021 we said the biggest surprise was one the rise of nfts uh and you know concurrently the the flipping of board Apache Club over uh crypto punks uh we also said uh Luna the the success of the Luna burn as one of the biggest surprises uh and the last one was the rise of a one bip pools on uniswap V3 those were our picks for the biggest surprises of 2021. 2022 Robert what do you got biggest surprise well I'll preface by saying that Tom sort of scooped me a little bit earlier in this show but I'm awarding the biggest surprise to one inflation exceeding the expectations of the market in general leading to higher interest rates than the market expected both in the U.S and globally but three and this is really the root of the surprise the assets like Bitcoin that had been you know discussed for years as inflation Hedges seeing their first really inflationary environment not rising to the occasion so this was a surprise to me because you know the narrative that had been built up for the last decade plus was that you know oh wait for inflation that's when you're really going to see Bitcoin shine that's really when you're going to see you know non-correlated assets across the board you know shine relative to traditional asset classes and you know I'm sorry to keep on being a bearish drum here but you know Bitcoin in particular as well as pretty much every asset class did not benefit from inflation and this was you know a direct counter argument to one of the loudest narratives of the past few years it's hard to see what other narratives get you know used for assets like Bitcoin in the absence of you know it's an inflation Hedge now this has been in a lot of ways disproven but the big surprise to me was inflation how fast it grew how fast it exceeded anyone or the Market's expectations and the performance of asset classes that we've been waiting really 12 years to see how they would perform in the face of it seeing them perform for the first time yeah I mean this has been a as a professional investor I'm always thinking to myself what are my LPS paying me to do and one of the things that I've always believed is that look I'm we're not macro investors rlps don't think we're macro investors they don't think that we're qualified to be able to opine on the direction that macro is going but this is the one year when no matter what asset class you're investing in you are a macro investor because the high order bit for everything this year has been macro and so it's been really challenging but also an incredible education just to see how many people have been able to get the same things wrong and how much it ended up massively impacting what your performance was how you did as an investor no matter what you were trading no matter what you were investing into just by being able to get some very basic big questions right for sure tarun what do you got biggest surprise of 2022. it's actually quite hard because there's like way too many options okay just pick one my main surprise my number one surprise is that that Arbor charm really like stole defy away from every other L2 this year like if you just look at like the net volume and you buy on Arbitron it's like clearly trouncing everyone like like polygon obviously has tons of activity but it's actually way more than if he said now like the D5 side is shrinking quite a bit uh optimism is sort of like in this weird like they have like weird the mining Grant rewards things that like don't seem it's like kind of not pushing the needle but but GMX and a couple other places on Arboretum seem to just like have I I it's not that I guess I'm surprised that there is a dominant L2 d5ys as much as I'm just surprised that like arbitrum has done it with like no incentives what do you attribute them to so I think it does have some of the most reliable L2 infrastructure uh in terms of you know like stuff that makes it easy to develop on it's like for instance like Bedrock the new optimism um upgrade is gonna is actually going to move towards something that optimism that arbitrum did which made it very easy to predict how like when your transaction is executed within a block whether you measure things in Block time or real time and like there's some like very tiny nuances there but one kind of easy thing that happened was the way optimism counted blocks messed up certain yield farming programs because some of them use time stamps incorrectly and basically like the farming rewards ran out early and so there's a there's a lot of like very interesting like nuanced stuff like that they use like the internal blocks within optimism rather than using like the blocks on ethereum what was the difference it was sort of that but there's also this notion of like how how they're producing like are they produce blocks like drawn from like this like poisson distribution of fixed time or are they actually like a much wider distribution and like that change that actually changed some of the like uh the ways people have oh because they were using blocks to approximate time yes exactly exactly I see I see I see okay yeah yeah okay I mean this is all the stuff like itself people didn't know this would stuff would happen but I think arbitrarm actually tried to be very consistent with ethereum and I think a lot of the other l2s were much more loose and and and it actually I think it's like one of the interesting things is that like farming contracts worked better on Arbor Drive like for a while and like now everyone realizes that and they're gonna upgrade and change stuff but they're developer friendliness in certain ways seem to to win people over and I think for polygon I think the difference is like polygons just been focused on nfts like they've been killing it right they like basically have like taken all the Solana's nft stuff like in the last you know six months they've like slowly eaten everything so I think it's just interesting though that Arbitron became the D5 place right like I I don't know if I could have predicted that at all the beginning of the year it would I would have just like rolled a three-sided Dice and said like it's arbitrary optimism or polygon well one of the things you see anecdotally or hear anecdotally from users right now is that there's a lot of users on arbitrum because within the community there's still a lot of expectation that arbitrum is going to release a token and it's going to be retroactive towards its users whether or not that's you know reality or hope or rumor you know I think a lot of the activity is you know preemptively designed to Target that a lot of the other l2s at this point you know all have tokens arbitrum is sort of the last man standing of a blockchain that doesn't and so it's possible that a lot of the usage there is just really designed to try to capture a token if and when it doesn't yeah I wanted to say that this proves my tokenomics point but it kind of doesn't because of retroactive airdrops retroactive airdrops are this kind of like reverse causation that kind of Muddy the Waters of like what's actually happening there part of it is certainly that like yes arbitrum is not you know pumping out liquidity rewards because it's just they built a good mouse trap and people like the mouse trap but part of it is like yeah to Robert to your point once they actually do have a token and whatever airdrop they will do is done then you can say cool here's like real actual completely organic usage and unfortunately we no longer can do clean a b tests because of retroactive airdrops I I agree but I also think it's interesting that like polygon completely won the nft war and and Arboretum there was a time where arbitrary was actually the highest L2 nft volume probably like at the beginning of this year and it completely lost that right it even lost like the Reddit thing started there but then moved to polygon do you remember like it was actually a Nova chain yeah so my point is it is interesting that the users have segmented and some of it actually does seem to be like ux and quality like obviously none of it like clearly a lot of it's economic incentives described but it does seem like they they found certain things that to developers and users people like I suspect that a lot of it for polygon too is that actually for onboarding new users the ux of a new L1 is actually a lot simpler than the ux of an L2 right and L2 implies that okay it's ether but it's not ether on ethereum if you have ether on ethereum you're in the wrong place you've got to like Point your lasers at the right thing you know manage your rpcl and stuff whereas for for Matic it's just like if you have ether you're in the wrong place ether is the wrong thing to buy you don't need either you need Matic go on your exchange buy Matic that's the thing you want you know so it's I I just I assume I mean not only one they have the network effect of just having a ton of users already compared to what arbitrum has in terms of you know just monthly or daily actives but also just like ux wise if you read it and you are going to have hundreds of thousands of people touching this blockchain if you lose 10 of them because they don't understand what a layer 2 is because oh it's on ethereum the arbitrum is on ethereum so therefore okay I've moved my money onto ethereum if even 10 of people make that mistake or five percent of people then it's just not worth it because the underlying the underlying chain doesn't really matter to you that much so much is Just hey I need an open C and I need you know a chain that can be super low fees so anyway this is a theory I don't know if this is true but that's my assumption yeah I I it's still I I still would say if I look back at January I wouldn't have necessarily predicted that they would be the default chain right now okay Tom what do you have biggest surprise 2022 yeah maybe a bit broad but uh I have usage durability there's you know sort of this phrase that you know the map is not out the territory and I think in crypto it's like the price is not the product and I think you know in my mind a lot of kind of defy you know obviously exists in part two offer Leverage um and so naturally it's sort of gotten hit in terms of overall your TDL or or usage by sort of this this wind down these this different macro Market but I think if you sort of peek under the hood a lot of parts of crypto actually look pretty fantastic from a usage perspective um like we were talking about nft emits earlier nft mints are still at 50 of all-time highs um user numbers are still at 50 of all-time highs even D5 um yeah you know in in some dexes maybe you know volume is down but user numbers are actually looking pretty darn good and I think that's true in these you know different areas of our performance like the Reddit nft um example uh you know four million people minted their Reddit Avatar or uh with Tyler Hobbs gender art artist his qql minted out like you know 17 million dollars like that was like two months ago which was supposed to be sort of you know the middle of this nft winter and so there are all these different areas where if you sort of look under the hood there's actually like pretty interesting activity going on people are still really excited it and you know the numbers don't really lie but you kind of have to go go find those so I think in my mind 200 000 eight pictures was maybe partially a macro byproduct but there are still a lot of people out there who are excited about these things and so um I think in defy in nfts in other areas of crypto there's still a lot of usage even despite the price drawdowns I'm pretty sure the line the prices the product was coined by Kyle samani last year so yeah I think it is I think it is fitting that that this is the this is the year of the dissolution of that of that Meme so yeah well well called out so my biggest surprise and by the way I just want to point out for the audience you can tell we're all being cute and we're all dancing around like the actual biggest surprises but whatever I'll continue in the theme of being cute well because we already said them we kind of already said that we already said that because like the biggest losers yeah exactly okay so I just I just want to say that in case we don't actually say it so if in my case the biggest surprise I'd say was the death of all the lenders so it doesn't surprise me that lenders died right like okay of course if prices go down some people are leveraged some people made bad loans they died it turns out every [ __ ] lender in the industry died every single one of them we basically had a great financial crisis level Extinction event for every single lender that was surprising to me basically nobody has made money in lending since Inception which is really just mind-boggling to me you would think that in a cycle there would be some people who sort of you know went sort of went too far toward the tide and ended up getting carried away when the tide increased but the people who are closer to shore would be okay and like there'd be some people were like oh I had better risk management I did this I did that and that's why you know I didn't do what those crazy people did doesn't matter what you did every almost everybody died from this generation of lenders and I would not even if you told me that prices in crypto would have drawn down you know 50 plus in a single year I would assume that well you know block five is going to be screwed but like other people will be fine uh but turns out no every single lender died and so anybody who's building a thesis last year about well I'm going to underwrite this lender because they're better than the other yeah okay block five is crazy Celsius is crazy but these guys are gonna be fine nope the entire category all got destroyed this year I do remember talking to some people who were investing in Block five like last few rounds and I had just been like oh like what's your thesis like why do you think they're gonna be really great people always said the same thing for all of these Mega lender rounds like Celsius block fi like not Amber the the person Amber used Babel like stuff like that I I I just like people would always basically say the following they yeah they have these like really great borrowers who are market makers like everyone says the same thing about all the lenders so like maybe this is just like the cycle of life it seems so it seems so and until I mean there's a lot of lessons about like why did why fundamentally or what could you have arrived at to know that the entire category was just not underwritable and I think a large part of it comes from the fact that so lending on the whole made a lot of money last year right so you know people made um in aggregate you know in the billions last year obviously it was a crazy year for crypto leverage period And so a lot of that was just ended up getting recycled as crypto leverage but the the difference between lending so there are some you know very successful Landing companies in you know web 2 traditional startups but most of them have some kind of innovation and The Innovation might be you know something like you know a point of sale integration like by not pay later it might be you know some clever underwriting or being able to like you know model out exactly what your repayment schedule is going to be or something like that nobody in crypto had all of these people had bad 2020 they all did but they didn't die right they didn't die they didn't die it was that was a lot of just repricing due to rates right so like the the attractiveness of uh these lending uh you know basically being able to get high risk debt just on the whole got destroyed because of rates going up right so like that's ultimately what a lot of these lenders were really doing was packaging up high-risk borrowers but they didn't die everyone in crypto died and I think part of the reason why that is is that ultimately the lenders in crypto were competing on taking risk because there was no way to compete on technology nobody had any better technology there was no actual Innovation normally when VCS back a a sector they do so because the person who has the better you know structural advantage is going to win the person who has better technology who has better vertical integration who has better execution whatever they're the person who's going to win and venture capital is in the business of finding that one person giving them lots lots of money and achieving the outside success but if there's no Vector for uh competition besides risk besides just taking more risk then basically every single person that is Venture backable takes a bunch of risks and as soon as the tide increases they all drown together and that's basically what happened and so I think that for me that's a big lesson about just what it looks like to find a category even if it's making money that actually has a the the properties of venture the properties of venture should be that as a company gets bigger it becomes more robust not less robust and that's that seems to be what happened to the lenders that as lenders try to get bigger they became less and less robust in in traditional uh Finance like you know lending is not a venture type business it's something that you know like obviously lending is a big business it's massive but it's not the kind of thing that you know small players grow overnight through some kind of magic growth hack or structural advantage and then end up becoming these big incumbents it's the opposite it's a very slow moving industry with very entrenched players um and so that well I I I would one thing I would dispute about that characterization is that a lot of like Edge lending that requires like either novel underwriting standards or like packaging up loans in some weird way like buy now pay later a good example or like pipe all these like invoice factoring type of things like they were ventricle because they had some sort of like there's this outsized premium that like that market is going to grow like and like if the current users are just small right but I think that that also points to real Innovation right it's like understanding there's a class of users that nobody else understands how to underwrite and they have some technological way to underwrite them in real time or at a much faster sales cycle than anybody else can right that's both buy now pay later and in spite in spite of certain VCS asking me to stop pulling VCS down on this show I uh wait who asked you to stop we'll say that I'm not telling you but I I I got it you have to call them out what are you talking about I I'm not calling them out I'm just gonna let them hear that I said that so they know I think I think the problem is VCS just took the model of like the pipes of the world like oh let's translate it to this like Edge asset that we don't understand but people are securitizing in some way and oh like it seems to be growing like like I I can kind of see like the growth investor story for this because they're just like what's the spreadsheet of the numbers and it's not really about the technology like that is sort of the difference between like late stage growth investors and Seed investors right like if you're investing in growth stuff you're not actually underwriting the technology anymore at something you may you might be if it's like SpaceX but like most fintech stuff it's not right like and so I think like the the there's a sense in which I'm calling it not Venture investable is not totally true but it is true that the growth investors maybe were not so sophisticated and you know I'm not [ __ ] called Venture investors dumb so I'm just gonna say that I'll leave it at that I think one of the things that makes it interesting from a venture perspective is that at a hypothetical level lending is a business that could require a lot of capital for something that is mostly just software and a little bit of people and I think you know Venture investors get excited about businesses that could require five billion dollars just because you know that's something you can deploy assets and capital into at scale unlike most other businesses in our space um or you know in finance in general like it's one of these things that could soak up just huge amounts of capital given the right conditions and you know it gets better as it gets bigger because you know when it's small it's like oh why would we bet on this like you know what's the ads this making any sense as it gets bigger I I think people's eyes widen when they see how much Capital it could you know ask to soak up and that's what makes it interesting a business perspective in a way that you know we're building this protocol or we're building a new blockchain like it's very different I think that was true in a bull market when there was tons and tons of money and that money was trying to find a home right so I think it was very true last year this year I think many fewer people are thinking of businesses in that context and I think this is exactly where it in the counter analogy of course is that you know block fight a huge employee base all these lenders had tons and tons of bodies right whereas you know Robert to your point about compound compound Ave they don't need employees they just kind of run they're super Capital light that is actually traditionally what VCS like VCS like the idea that with a small amount of principal investment you can build something really big that's the advantage of software businesses is that they don't scale through people they scale through software so and D5 is the apotheosis of that and so I think the the regular lenders we're seeing were not yes I will take this opportunity yes I will take this opportunity to say that D5 is better than the old way of doing business with tons of people and spreadsheets and like making up decisions on the Fly and choosing who to lend to based on how much they bro out with you or tweet good tweets you know Defy is vastly superior to all of these businesses that have failed in almost every way there's a reason why defy has performed exceptionally this year in terms of the resilience and the smoothness of their operating versus these C5 and the fact that D5 does not trust your self-certified balance sheet it checks like you got to put the collateral in the [ __ ] contract and so that uh yes it's very hard to scam a smart contract it's very easy to scam a human at A lender speaking of that I'm ready for our last category because this ties into my best meme okay let's move on to best meme so just as a reminder so last year what we we chose the best memes of 2021 where the term web3 dog coins Grimes tweeting what was it what was the actual tweet it doesn't exist anymore oh oh okay you're right and then uh last was spf's shoes when he went to Congress those are what we chose as the best memes of last year um like I forgot about that he's gonna be wearing very different shoes this year I saw a pretty uh well I saw a pretty morbid tweet recently where it's him walking around without laces um because obviously when you go to jail they take your shoelaces from you and so it's a you know this the shoelace meme but in a very different light all right that got heavy uh Robert you want to go first that's meme of 2022 I'm gonna go literal and I'm not gonna go with like a big metaphorical meme concept I'm gonna describe the best one jpeg meme that I saw all year in its Simplicity and wonderfulness if everyone's familiar with the low wit mid-wit High wit you know IQ Bell chart meme um historically this is used to indicate that the low IQ and the high IQ generally agree on something it's the midwits that disagree and they're wrong and they're silly but the meme that I saw this year was the low widths saying it was you know I got wrecked on Terra you know the mid-width for saying I got wrecked on Celsius and the high wit you know saying I got wrecked on FTX and you know I thought it like perfectly encapsulated this year and that you know there wasn't an outlier it wasn't like the midwits or wrong and the low IQ and the high IQ like are both completely correct in their own opposite ways this year everybody was in alignment and it was just the flavor of What attracted them uh Like Moths To The Flame to their demise so for the low low IQ it was generally Tara you know for the midwits it was generally C5 lenders and for the high IQ it's you know it was like market makers and Traders and people who had assets still on FTX when it you know went under so that was my best meme this year that I saw you know I tried to like it and retweet it and stuff but it wasn't a concept just a literal jpeg I love that bear markets are the most democratic because everybody gets shafted but in a different way in a way suited to your social status you will find a way to destroy you one way or another no matter who you are all right tarun you're you're up you were uh you were giving us a a little bit of a teaser about your the meme what is your best meme for 2022 proof of Reserve uh which is you know it's it's kind of been a very stupid meme where like every exchange is like pushing themselves on the foot to be worse at getting audits that claim they have enough assets to withdraw post FTX mainly because you can't see liabilities and you can't see the chains of liabilities and when you're talking about defect contracts where you can see the entire liability chain or or hopefully the future where it's like you can't see the liabilities but I can give you 60 proof that like all the liabilities are correct while still giving some some privacy to to the user it is just like so Superior in this case that it's actually like reading some of these audits is like painful it's like oh yes we attest that like these wallets are a finance like signed to sign sent us to sign signature from these things but actually we can't tell you anything about them outside of exactly and not just binance but I'm not just thinking of the kraken's audit was dog [ __ ] like bit mixes with dog [ __ ] all of these things are like okay they're fine but like is there really a dog it doesn't doesn't crack okay hold on I think there's like such a massive Chasm between what binance did and what Kraken is doing but even these Merkel personal preserves things are not very good when it's like an exchange that's actually quite complex of like what if liabilities are maybe the cash flows shown in those come from outstanding Learners sure sure but doesn't Kraken also have like an audited statement saying that like these are our liabilities the oh I if I remember correctly the only exchange a big four other I could be wrong about this maybe Kraken has this now but like last time I looked was it was coinbase like they're the only one who's convinced like I can believe that I can't believe that I don't know if it was a big four auditor that was what I heard did we go I'm all speaking with hearsay I I'm not an authority on this no I think I think bit Max and maxing have been trying to do this like Hey we're gonna do Miracle professors whatever but that doesn't Detroit these entities could have like you know 500 sub entities like they all do in reality like like FTX where it's like oh like this thing is minus 50 billion dollars cost 50.01 billion dollars and like you don't you know you don't see the minus you only see the plus and you're like oh okay great it's working so like I I I I just like I just think like we you know I I I'm happy people are doing it I think it's a dumb meme personally I think you should have the liabilities represented and understood in the way that I does and it's just cleaner right like you can believe the audit I agree with tarun because I think this meme is counterproductive in that if people get complacent and say oh my God we solved it we're just gonna use these exchanges that do you know the proof of reserves in this way and then later they get scammed even more like it's going to be problematic and I just think it like it creates an extra layer of complacency as the reaction to FTX even though it's probably not the objectively correct way of going about it you know the low width and the mid-wit are gonna get confused and convinced by these that's a concern but like you can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good right like this is way better than what we had before which was absolutely nothing and if you cannot generate even a like slightly convincing proof of reserves that is a very good signal to no matter what wit you are that hey something is probably wrong at this exchange right like what we want to avoid is another FTX FTX could not have even done anything remotely like a proof of reserves now can can an insolve an exchange fake approval reserves yes as the same way that an insolvent company can also fake an audit right as as we learned some of the great financial frauds of the past the point is to make this stuff harder not to make it impossible it'd be great to make it impossible but we don't have a tool that does that quadriga I just looked this up quadriga had an audit before like by a reputable Canadian firm before before uh they went under so well but that's not proof of reserves right but the I mean their author claim to have done it because it was like for doing a listing on the Canadian soccer exchange so I these things are like kind of like everyone wants like the like the like feel good thing it's like yeah yeah but that's my point it's like look it's not perfect nobody's claiming that proof of reserves is perfect but it's clearly better than not having anything otherwise like what's the alternative I agree I'm just saying it's a meme that came out of this FTX fear that I I think will probably be netf like just don't I just don't see it being a positive meme in the long run all right this is nothing against any exchange owners you kind of have a you're in a rock and hard place it's kind of like heart you're either showing everyone like everything you of all your entities on right and it's like it's not it's not I don't envy their job doing this I'm just pointing out that like it's just it's a very big meme right now right like everyone is like constantly talking about it yeah even the SEC is unhappy about it so they they are uh cool all right Tom what do you have for best meme of 2022. mine is also not a literal JPEG but I have I'm a ladies the ladies went through a rise and a fall and a rise again and I feel like they have this sort of you know anti-cyclical nature to sort of the ethos of what they represent and I think in my mind they've also kind of branched outside of crypto which is actually like the thing that has taken them into best meme status for me where you see people in like the effective accelerationist movement and like other random AGI people are super into milady's and so in my mind like it's again when I started talking about the price is not the product this is sort of in that bucket of like yeah the price is not done super well you know yeah it's it's not a big I think religious have done well actually this year as a I guess relative it's not you know a big mainstream you know nft like crypto punks or whatever but it's in in the sense of cultivating an online community and sort of having a different tact to what the rest of crypto is doing I uh I give them the ladies my best I've heard that one of the commonalities among a lot of my ladies holders that there's a very high density of convicts among people who hold my ladies have you observed this to be true we've been to jail or prison I've never one of the first things skreli did when I got out was I don't think it's just funny I don't think it's just friendly apparently there there are others this is like a thing I don't know this is hearsay okay Malay if any chopping bug listener who is a Milady holder who who disagrees with Steve needs to go like tweet at him right wow right when you're listening yeah his team just called me to be clear I said a higher than normal density that could still be a very low number I don't know there's ten thousand of them right so you know it I don't know good good choice Tom so myself for best meme I guess I took this fairly literally I thought Gabriel Haynes was probably the best meme of 2022. I will never forget that iconic video of him like walking around in the like in front of a country road with a shirt off and a machete basically the day after FTX was collapsing he was like the one thing that I could show my wife that like look I can't explain to you what's really going on but you should watch this guy this guy will explain it better than I can I think just having a little bit of insanity amplification at a time of just like otherworldly Insanity really helped me yeah he's a vibe cool all right but honestly the entertainment you need in the dark definitely definitely he's doing God's work okay so predictions for 2023 so we made a number of predictions last year there was a little bit too much detail from all of us for me to for me to aggregate them uh but let's just really quickly aggregate up what are our predictions for next year it's been a rough year hopefully there's some you know some some light to look forward to in 2023. Robert what do you got predictions for next year so my prediction for next year is that developer activity sort of re-centers around ethereum in the last couple years we've seen extreme fragmentation of developer activity spreading out to a lot of competing l1s and l2s to your earlier point about the evm you know having its moment you know the evm was a format and it actually made it really easy for alternative l1s using the evm to capture applications and developers and I think 2023 is you know the real start of the reversal of that I think you know you're not going to see people trying to launch another evm clone I think you know as you know the price of either is low and gas costs are low I think like a lot of activity is going to return to core L1 ethereum I think you know we're going to see it be more of a you know composable ecosystem for applications again um one of the trends from the last you know year or two has been there hasn't been a lot of composability between applications because everyone's just building their own application in a silo and they didn't really care what else was being built in their ecosystem because they could just jump to an all that one you know and just like start from scratch but I think I think 2023 is going to be a year where we start to see a network effect grow for developers and people start to re-embrace the composability of a lot of development activity being in one place um so that's my prediction I can be completely wrong but I think it's a year of complexibility okay so the inverse of the reversal of the fragmentation we've seen this year uh Troon what's your prediction for 2023. I predict we will get our first maybe consumers the wrong word but average user ZK application I'm not sure if it will be like some you know big D5 thing or whether it be nfts I I'm not willing to make that bet but if you just look at the number of people who are downloading starring and forking circom which is one of the main uh ZK tool chains for building provers and building circuits admittedly it's extremely primitive it's like you know a bug I ran into which someone else told me about so I was trying to reproduce it is is like you know you can do a for Loop to 99 elements but you can't to 100. like there's just like tons of weird stupid limitations that like have to do with like how wait it's base 10. that's not that it has to do with like the circuit side like they only use a certain amount of memory that stores the circuit and this that amount of memory happens to be 100 Gates so it's some random it's it's annoying not worth discussing I kind of think like people are experimenting with writing ZK circuits in a way that does feel a lot like smart contracts whether it's in starkware and it's Cairo and it's like you know going that direction whether it's people writing custom circuits for doing things like bridging or whether it's sort of people building games uh that take advantage of the ZK elements I I think like we're gonna finally find one application this year it's not going to be what we expect it's going to be a little bit like unislop where it like looks totally different or dumb or something like it's gonna have some affectation to it that's going to make you think like who cares like why is and like does dydx count are you talking about like just an application built in a way that's provable an application that takes advantage of the verifiability and like incremental verifiability of the computation and like actually uses the person right like Dark Forest is an example of something that actually uses a ZK proof as part of its yeah okay okay yes yes not not just like taking advantage of pure scalability yeah okay yeah my guess would be that's probably either bridging or identity um is is going to be the use case yeah for sure I I that that's what gives me a cop-out answer because I know the bridge stuff is is like quite far but but I do think there will be one that like you will be able to use the meta mask kind of easily relatively easily like it'll be as easy as you can now too hopefully well the number one this year was also my pick earlier which is tornado which uh I don't know that it says easy but it's certainly you know it's it's it's usable you could use it's yeah like there's dot guides for how to use it it's not just like hey read my code and figure how to use it which is like 90 of DK's 200 100 all right Tom what do you have uh your prediction for 2023 yeah I'll try to keep it somewhat short I think in terms of the the industry my one big prediction is we will start to see the first company's fold and shut down there's this concept in Venture Capital the J curve basically you you know invest in a bunch of make a bunch of Investments the companies are going to fail fail before the companies are going to succeed and so you sort of see returns you know drop from those failed companies in the short term and then dealing in the long term you see those a successful company sort of uh you know lift your returns and yeah we've seen a lot of companies blow up um as we've been discussing this entire podcast but we haven't seen many companies shut down because they can't secure additional funding they can't make enough money they don't have product Market fit and so I think in my mind that sort of truly signals the bottom when we start to see people wind down simply because they haven't found pmf or they aren't generic enough Revenue so I think we will see that in 2023 I think in terms of like memes and trends that we'll probably see I think rwa is going to become a big thing again like people looking for productive assets there's new site rwa.xyz makers leaning really hard into rwa I think we'll see a real world assets become a big thing within D5 account abstraction also see people seem really hyped about now I think because of eip4337 um basically allowing people to bundle different transactions or sort of arbitrarily sign and create transactions as opposed to just relying on an eoa this is something I've personally been excited about for a very long time like since back when I was at zero X so excited to see if this actually hits mainstream next year and then ZK evm it feels like it's kind of been you know bubbling the past few months and I think it's kind of finally sort of spill over next year independent of that means something on mainnet and live that people are using but it feels like that's sort of where the Forefront of of excitement in cryptos is happening yeah I think I think we're going to see more excitement congeal around zkvms I don't know that they're going to be really that production ready next year I think they'll be things that you can actually play around with and deploy things on but I think there there's still a lot of rough edges to the kvms I think for all of them that um I don't know that I don't know that it's it's going to be time for ZK VMS to overtake up Mr rollups in 2023 but I agree with you I think the story and the star is going to rise um so it'll be more and more excitement around it I suspect so my predictions for 2023 I had two first is the rise of Roll-Ups I think both ZK and optimistic of course we have the the big ethereum up code repricing that's going to take place next year that's going to massively lower the cost for uh posting roll up data on chain that is going to make Roll-Ups now suddenly competitive with alt l1s in terms of pricing and that's going to be a huge huge shift now all of a sudden the the ux difference and the and the just you know the the cost difference between l2s and a polygon or a Solana or whatever will shrink not you know collapse but it will shrink significantly to the point where you know if it's a fraction of ascent we're us one cent you don't care you know it's not we're not using order books we're not doing anything that's super high through but for most people and so for any normal use case one cent is basically the same as a fraction of ascent so I think that is going to be a big Catalyst for Roll-Ups this year as well as just the development of zkvms and then my second prediction for 2023 is that as a direct result of FTX we are going to see The Exchange stack get disaggregated meaning that we're going to see finally the the breakdown of this idea that you have these verticalized exchanges that do everything they do you know the trade execution they run the order book they do the clearing they do The Brokerage and they're the custodian these things are going to get separated out not all of them but some of these functions are going to get separated out into separate players and fairly soon I would guess by the end of next year you're going to see more and more especially professional Traders but even just like you know kind of prosumers being able to say Okay I want my custody here and then I'm going to use exchange for the coinbase I mean it's coinbase for exchange and I'm going to do my lending and borrowing through this other person that is going to become more and more common in crypto and we're going to move toward more of like a Trad fire like structure that makes things like FTX basically impossible because the same party that runs the exchange doesn't actually have access to the funds so my guess is that's going to be one of the biggest immediate consequences from ftx's downfall looking forward to your future and on account called NPC bull I do think the NPCs are going to be beneficiaries of it unfortunately we didn't invest in DNA the the game well maybe fortunately given that everything's down but we didn't invest into any of the NPC platforms but uh I am I do think there are going to be big beneficiaries of this yeah it seems like that yeah if it seems like it if your prediction comes yeah well if if my prediction goes through cool well guys um it's been a absolutely insane year it's always a pleasure this is by the way this is the one year anniversary also of The Chopping Block so just just as is a quick refresher for those of you who weren't there at the time before we started the chopping block we actually started this as a dragonfly robot Ventures happy hour that we would do on Twitter spaces like every Friday or something like that and it was just like a casual thing where we were chatting we were like huh this is really fun we got like a good vibe we we have interesting takes that nobody else seems to really propound in public so we should like do this as a regular thing we got to know Laura we built a relationship and we decided to start trying this out as a regular show and it's been absolutely amazing to just get all the feedback this year from everybody who watches the show like it's it's it's crazy for me like I go to a conference and I think so you know we people respond to us and I get emails and stuff like that but it's especially true when I go to conferences the number of people who listen to this show and get value out of it especially in a year with so many crazy things happening that nobody else understands how to explain it was not not an Insider it's just been absolutely an incredible experience to do the show with you guys plus one this has been a lot of fun over the last year so if you have things you'd like us to talk about or do or change or whatever your feedback is also welcome and encouraged my big goal for the chopping block for 2023 is to get to roon um and second goes again the shop on time uh hopefully hopefully I can clean the seed to your requests uh I I just want to say really a lot of thanks to all of the listeners especially those of you who've like reached out and like talked to me about stuff um you know I think the our listener base is extremely Broad and and that's thanks to Laura she's like obviously built up just like amazing listener base like that includes everyone from like people in normal Finance LPS funds like technology people who are not in crypto who are just like okay this is the one thing I listen to every week to like see if crypto's still alive or dead and like it's it's it's been awesome kind of learning who's listening to this and then but but y'all are interested and then yeah as Robert says like feedback on anything would be awesome yeah so one uh change that we're going to be doing going forward into the new year is we are going to start um doing fewer live streams and trying to do more podcasts so uh in general we've seen that you guys really love the show there's a lot of uptake of the podcast much more so than the live stream and just because all of us are kind of traveling around all the time in different parts of the world it's a lot easier to do these shows if we don't have to commit to doing live streams we may still do live streams from time to time but we're not going to have every single show be live streamed as we did in 2021 so that'll make it easier for us to do the show with a tighter Cadence and make it more consistent and also allow us to get the editing down so just prepare for that in 2023 you're going to be hearing more of us but it's not going to be uh live stream quite as often as it was last year we we hope you all have happy holidays and uh we hope that 2023 ends up being a gentler Year to your portfolios than 2022 was um and I guess that's it from us happy holidays everybody have a good New Year Happy New Year [Music]
