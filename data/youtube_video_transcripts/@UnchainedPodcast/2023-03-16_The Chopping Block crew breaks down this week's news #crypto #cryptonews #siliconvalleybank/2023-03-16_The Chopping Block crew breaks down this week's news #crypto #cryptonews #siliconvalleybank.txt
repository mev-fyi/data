the three banks closest to crypto are no longer in existence and no other Banks regardless of the health of their balance sheet or systems have gone under and I think the root cause of all these Banks going under was they all bought bonds at the wrong time you know all of them really had Mark to Market losses which they didn't have to account for and I think most likely every single bank is in one way or another in the same position where interest rates were low they loaded up the assets either balance sheet with long bonds and they they did them and took a horrible loss it's just that these crypto banks are the ones that were forced to account for um those assets through the withdrawal possibility most other banks are probably equally as insolvent or suffering from negative equity they're just not forced to account for it and
