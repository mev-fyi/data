[Music] thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap in hearing senators go tough on stable coins this week senators took both stable coins and defy to task during a banking committee meeting senator and committee chair sherrod brown started the hearing with prepared remarks saying cryptocurrencies advocates argue that crypto assets are superior to real dollars because they are decentralized and transparent but stable coins are neither he added stable coins make it easier than ever to risk real dollars on cryptocurrencies that are at best volatile and at worst outright fraudulent senator elizabeth warren also chimed in expounding upon the dangers of stable coins and defy saying staple coins pose risks to consumers and to our economy they're propping up some of the shadiest parts of the crypto world defy where consumers are least protected from getting scammed she went on to say defy is where the regulation is effectively absent and no surprise it's where the scammers and the cheats and the swindlers mix among part-time investors and first-time crypto traders not every voice in the room was so negative senator pat toomey took the site of defy citing cross-border payments programmability and efficiency as different ways that stablecoins improve upon fiat money tumi also emphasized that regulations should not stifle innovation and called for regulators to have the humility to recognize that many of our views about how financial services are delivered and how investments work are quickly becoming outdated tuesday's senate hearing comes

president's working group released a report on stablecoins which advised regulators to restrict stablecoin issuers to insured banks bitcoin jumps as fed accelerates its stipulus taper on wednesday the

ave v3 release restricted by a business license this vote is essentially a signal on whether or not the ave community wants to protect its intellectual property from unauthorized use or simply allow anyone to use the code in any way they prefer explained the proposal that was passed by a slim majority of 55 a business license restricting the use of code in defy was first introduced by uniswap which most likely instituted such a practice due to being forked and vampire attacked by sushi swap during 2020's d5 summer the proposed of a v3 business license would be similar to uniswaps in that it would restrict the usage of code for an initial amount of time which would most likely be one year during that time ave governance would keep the rights to authorize code forks for projects and teams who have a track record of collaborating with ave in the past the proposal didn't pass with overwhelming support 44 percent of ave's community voted for v3 to be released under an mit license

across the aisle to push for changes to infrastructure bill this week u.s treasury secretary janet yellen received a letter from six senators asking her to clarify how the treasury department will interpret the broker definition for crypto tax reporting in the recently passed infrastructure investment and jobs act in the letter senators rob portman mark warner mike crappo kirsten cinema pat toomey and cynthia lummus noted that the vague definition of broker could pose significant issues for crypto actors and asked yellen and the treasury department to honor the intent of the bill which they felt was cemented during a conversation between senators portman and warner on the floor of the senate earlier this year at that time they specified the term would only cover brokers who enabled the transfer of digital assets while entities ancillary to the process would not be considered brokers the senators urged the department of treasury to provide information or informal guidance within
