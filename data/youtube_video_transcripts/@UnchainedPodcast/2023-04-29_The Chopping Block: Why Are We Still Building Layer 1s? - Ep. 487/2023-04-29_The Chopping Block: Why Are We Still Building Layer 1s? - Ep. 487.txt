not a dividend It's A Tale of Two fun now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet generally speaking airdrops are kind of pointless anyways um my name's trading firms who are very involved I like to have the ultimate D5 Protocols are the antidote to this problem hello everybody Welcome to The Chopping Block every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry insiders perspective on the crypto topics of the day so uh first up we'll do some intros first we've got Tom the D5 Maven and master of memes next we've got tarun Giga brain and grad Puba at Gauntlet and today we've got a special guest Avery who is the Chief Architect of Aptos and then finally Bill myself I'm a sieve the head hype mad at dragonfly so we are early stage investors in crypto but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is an investment advice legal advice or even life advice please see chopperblock.xyz for more disclosures so this is the first time that we are doing the chopping block with a live audience here in consensus in Austin how are you guys finding consensus Austin I will say uh the weather here has been significantly better than at East Denver um what are you guys Impressions so far from Austin I forgot that there are so many layer ones in the world you know like I feel like I live in each land and like I just like don't I'm like whoa holy where'd all these other ones come from like some that I I just like didn't realize still had huge communities are you are you are you firing a shot at our guest here today no no no no I'm talking about like I'm talking about like cardano and Tron and stuff like I just like had not realized there were so many you know like it's like a part of the world that's like excised from my brain I had like a cardano lobotomy or something yeah there's something around like inverse correlation with like sponsorship size for like a bear market like if you look at like the like the top sponsors it's like yeah it's literally like Tron Adera someone else it's like what like yeah you did actually in the last show uh there was some offhand comment you made about cardano that I believe set the cardano Army on you tarun do you want to describe you know like From The Trenches what was it like going through that experience as a cardano veteran I gotta say the cardano Army is quite mid compared to the link Army the link Army I'm afraid of angering cardano army whatever like they they're kind of weak weak sauce nowadays wow okay that's uh that's bold so I'm I'm waiting I'm waiting to see what the reply to that is because now now all right now you can get one oh they they love you they love you I've noticed they're big fans um Avery tell us about the the Aptos Army by the way it's pronounced Aptos but I really want to say Aptos why don't you just pronounce it the way that everyone wants to pronounce it it's a good question um the way we came with the name Aptos not Aptos is because the way the technology was built was in the Bay Area back at meta Facebook days and we wanted to definitely pay homage to the fact that um you know that's where that's where a lot of the people came from and that's where a lot of work came from the other reason of course is because Aptos is a great you know town about an hour south of the Bay Area uh it's wonderful for beach beach town as well as surfing and other fun things and it actually is is from an indigenous word which kind of refers to the people and we thought that that was the best way to think about who we're building for and why we're doing what we're doing there's something around uh layer ones and California beaches yeah yeah I was about to say like Solana is a beach right in fact so-called there's a lot of names derived from California towns in in this community for sure yeah I'm just waiting for the baker's Beach little one to come along um interesting okay so so app to us it's got a hard to pronounce name uh well not hard to pronounce but you know unintuitively to pronounce um but uh you say you're inspired by the people of Aptos the town but I assume that's not where your users are we've heard that a lot of your users are in Korea and that's where Aptos is getting a lot of traction talk to us about like what's going on in Korea right now because there's a lot of talk about U.S regulation a lot of talk about Hong Kong but we don't talk about on the show very often about Korea of course it's a big market for crypto talk to us about that yeah I think you know one thing we talked about offstage a little bit was you know Korea's been a market that's been very excited about this technology space they're said about you know things like Luna about um Clayton blockchain as well and I think from those early days people have been you know building and building in many different projects and especially gaming has been one of those areas that's picked up a lot of steam in South Korea um where we've partnered with a bunch of different Korean companies including you know npixel which is a triple a gaming studio to build on top of Aptos but many others that have not been announced yet we had our hackathon recently um earlier this year uh where I think more than 450 developers came through and built some incredible projects uh and so what we've seen you know from that experience is this that the the area is just one of the few places where there's kind of first willed Builders with top rate developers uh that are that are moving the industry forward whereas you know places like the US are actually not going as quickly um and that's really exciting to us nice so one of the things that um Aptos is known for is it's a it's a story about building a more performant blockchain and we've heard that story before um obviously Solana in the last cycle was the predominant purveyor of the story is that we're building a new blockchain from the ground up totally different stack totally different architecture and we're going to make it really fast and really perform it um so tell us how you guys by the way by the way I should I should copy out I forgot to mention this that dragonfly is an investor into Aptos um how do you guys think about performance in a world that's full of layer ones talking about how performant they are that's a great question I think this debate is something we really want to talk more about I mean when people talk about transactions per second let's start off with what the transaction is the way we Define trash transaction is we talk about user transactions not system transactions to start with that system transactions like you know we we for instance in our Network we also have a transaction that goes off periodically so that we can update the clock that's not something that we count as a user transaction like that's not something that users are interacting with also some you know transactions can be composed of one or more operations of some you know very small transactions might do be very fast and very large transactions or be very slow so it's not a really good way to think about like you know how much transactions can this system do versus that system do especially when you take into account a lot of these nuances um so our our plan is to really put out you know transparency in the market how do we create a definition which is again for our point of view a user signed a set of actions that occur in the network and then thinking about where databases have been in the past where TPC has done a phenomenal job in terms of understanding different kinds of use cases and access patterns specific to workloads that are common to Industry and then evaluating these in a reproducible environments uh that are going to be used to kind of compare what's what's appropriate for your workloads and for your application specifically so basically if I can summarize uh benchmarking and crypto kind of sucks like there basically is no real benchmarking it's like let's ask the audience I mean like do you guys feel like there's a great way out there to tell how blockchains are compared to each other no I mean the the status quo today is that a blockchain will basically say I built a new Fast thing and then they will put out their own stats that says I have 200 000 transactions per second and Solana only does 20 transactions per second under my blah blah blah and they generally don't publish code they don't publish like how they do this they don't run the they don't run any benchmarks repeatedly which is what real benchmarking companies do um why do you think why do you guys think that we don't have like a benchmarking company or any benchmarking infrastructure in crypto yet I I think like theoretically it's actually impossible in the sense that like if I'm say a virtual machine that is something where I execute fully functionally there's a single transaction corresponds to a long execution Trace versus say something where it's procedural where like I actually have you I have child transactions that are generated and so it gotta gets the same input the input output mapping is the same but one of them you know creates a bunch of extra transactions like I've written and that trade-off uh will kind of inevitably always exist um for instance in gpus Nvidia and AMD would always like make kind of weird benchmarks to compare their throughput they would never just be like we do this many flops on blast which is like the basic linear algebra system like the the main sort of library for testing this type of stuff they would instead say something like oh well our our warp uh bandwidth is really good or are we read particular parts of ram really fast and I think there's actually this and ability and something technically complex that you have like this good heart's law type of thing where people start inventing metrics that optimize because their thing is optimized for it and so then you just you you kind of can't it's purposefully like adversarial in that sense that's why you need independent benchmarking right like if you if you have the benchmarks invented by the company that's offering the product they're going to find some obscure tiny little things who is going to do that I that's the question I'm asking maybe I don't know we're gonna do it so well but you're not independent yeah I think what we can do is at least start to put out what repeatable benchmarks look like what workloads look like and we can get input from the community and get other l1s and other application designers to to give us feedback like so we might be curious to know like what how fast do you mentioned nfts if these nfts are certain types of complexity or how fast can I you know transfer uh you know value from One customer to another uh and how a bunch of parallelism can get out of that and extract from it so even if the environments are very different and you can still evaluate on a per workload basis you know what is your your throughput of that workload and it may not be defined in transactions per second maybe it's in operations per second whatever but those kind of apples apples application benchmarks are something that we really feel passionate about yeah I mean one thing I would add though is that all of these different blockchains have different memory models so like for instance uniswap works great on global State access virtual machines like you uh but it's very hard in kind of software transactional memory things like move or like it has a huge you know huge worst case behavior and so you some have to make sure that your benchmarking workloads under worst case behavior is average case behaviors and stuff in the middle and that whole Suite is where I think people's marketing comes in it's like some people have really high deviation between the worst case benchmarks and average case benchmarks and they basically report the better of the two of them and it's just like I I'm not I'm not so sure you can get around this type of stuff so so transparently I think that's where like TPC has done a pretty decent job right like they've actually come with a series of different benchmarks or use cases and then if there are certain benchmarks people perform well on or poorly on you can evaluate that for yourself and I think that would that'd be wonderful if you had that kind of transparency in this industry I tend to agree with that I think look if somebody does heavy lifting of making it easy for an unaffiliate organization to step in and say aha okay here is a good framework around independent benchmarking let's go in and do it and then like once and for all kill the concept of layer ones like each inventing their own way of saying I'm the fastest because here's this super contorted reason why my blockchain can do more XYZ to be fair though like I said in the history of computing and Hardware we it's always that XKCD comic of the meme of like there are 15 standards I'm gonna make one standard that unifies them all tomorrow they're now 16 standards I mean clearly they're writing their zero standards so I think I think I don't think there's one I don't think there's zero I think there's like a hundred like every single person like that he was not Computing right like people don't actually like care about flops anymore they care about like you know workbench uh scoring and like you know workloads that are actually represented people were using those for but but for custom Hardware people don't do that right for GPS gpus in particular look more like blockchains in terms of the the way people Benchmark them and it's like they've had this kind of like weird game where it's like you invent you you really do have this good hearts a lot of problem where like everyone just makes up a benchmark that's easy to optimize for them yeah but like when someone's reviewing a GPU like it depends on the use case obviously maybe for you know something like group generation or whatever it's a different story or or machine learning but like you're using for gaming and Graphics like it gets reported so one of the interesting caveats of this is that in sort of right around the time that people started realizing that oh you could do fixed Precision deep learning so you can use like normal graphics cards and not get a ton of Errors uh you know AMD was actually winning on all the like gaming benchmarks all the like how you know video rendering benchmarks but they completely miss the fact that for some other applications like Cuda and then sort of like the structure of the Nvidia chip was just like orders of magnitude better and like that's why AMD sort of lost the race in a lot of ways but they were like optimizing on the wrong Benchmark for 10 years and then Nvidia just like kicked them in the face well it's very possible that we see that in blockchains that like the blockchain is best at uniswap which is you know sort of layer one or gen 1 blockchains is like okay a lot of D5 a lot of these kinds of use cases maybe in the Next Generation it's gaming or it's some other thing that has totally different access patterns and and will have a different Benchmark that replicates that so so there's like a full Suite there's a full Suite hey that's a great word a full Suite okay so movie worth Maps let's talk about your um your little brother sweet so um Aptos and sweet you guys have had some drama over the years uh I know that you guys are you guys are not the best of friends like siblings you know that I feel like that's very normal sibling rivalry um so sui has been under Fire siblings step step siblings you know we definitely talk quite a bit they love each other they love each other deep down um so sweet uh they've been under fired lately because they are not doing an airdrop and that has caught they're doing like some weird sale thing or I don't know what exactly they're doing um they're doing like some uh some ieo type thing so that's what I the best my knowledge I think yeah okay whatever we like pseudo white list that's like the weird part it's like not anyone can enter the purchase okay so that's where I'm confused that's where I got controlled okay let's talk about that because obviously none of us on stage seem to know but the the interesting thing is that we decided not to do an airdrop and this is kind of unique now this is kind like I feel like the story is actually not people are mad like whatever people are always mad but the interesting thing is that sweet decided not to do an airdrop and the current meta is that when you launch a level one you always do an airdrop to the people who are playing around on your test net or the people who are validating earlier the people who are accomplishing certain tasks uh so what do you guys think about this move from sui of first of all why do you think they didn't do an airdrop um and second like what do you think it means about the way that we're going to think about airdrops for our little little ones in the future arbitrum's airdrop seems like it could have been a liability in the sense of like the PO all the drama we talked about a couple weeks ago I feel like that could scare people I could see that so what does it have to do with an airdrop that's just like token distribution if you do it through an IO it's the same thing but the problem it might have to do some weird orchestration where the foundation gets paid somehow and you also do the airdrop and the ordering in which you do those they're sort of like but if you sell it to retail on a foundation extractable value and like unfortunately that has to exist somewhere in the middle right and and that in of itself probably causes infinite legal problems well also I mean if you do it through an ieo right you can always see how people who might you know might be you know U.S residents and so you can sort of create some some liability buffer that way which is I think kind of the intent but anything about like what is the purpose of doing an airdrop right one is like maybe create some marketing and you know create some Goodwill for the for the brand and then two is like you know distribute the token more broadly versus like just having it with the team or the foundation or early investors um I don't know how like effective they are like doing either of those things um and I think what we're seeing is just okay it's like this it's this arms race right where people expect an airdrop and the team has to go do civil you know uh pruning to make sure that that's not good and then people develop more sophisticated ways to do like simple attacks and then so it's like what are we really doing here is this actually effective at sort of the either either of the goals and so um I don't know and maybe this will be sort of in the same way you know doing airdrops or doing liquidity man it became the meta maybe this will be a new meta it'll be a new way to sort of do you know distribution going forward but it's clearly true that this is probably a reaction to the regulatory situation in the US yeah recently uh the SEC he filed a lawsuit against bittrex I think it was where they said they claimed that algorand was a security and um I I don't know that Alberta did an airdrop but I'm sure that they're somehow drawing the line of like oh their ones are now more exposed than we thought they were and so let's like be super careful about having any us people own this thing by doing an IO and not doing an airdrop um I assume that's where it's coming from because nobody likes getting trashed on Twitter especially like the day that you're about to go to you know uh go to mainnet Avery any take on the drama at your siblings I'll just say that uh you know we we I think when when Aptos launch the foundation wanted to do an air job to really you know I agree their trade-offs here in terms of doing civil defense and things like that but rewarding a lot of the community members who took the time to really help understand what aptus was build build projects uh help to run lots of nodes I think I think more than like 15 000 nodes around Aptos making it one of the largest networks even before launched um and and just just show that sign of appreciation station in Goodwill for some retroactively of course okay so not going to say anything negative this way this is your chance everybody's ready for you to say something I think one thing comment on is that you know when you talk about algrand specifically there I think one thing's called out in that particular document was the fact they did in Ico um and as one of the factors that led to that decision and so generally I think that's a that's a risk yeah the only thing I want to say is all of the Gensler algorand 2018 video memes from the last two weeks were pretty hilarious the ones of him like praising algorand for not being security yeah the moment that Gensler was pretty hilarious it's gone on the offensive and all of Twitter has basically trudged up everything he has ever said in a lecture and is trying to use it against him to be honest there's not that much there's not that much stuff that's not bad he's like avarand is very innovative you know whatever that doesn't mean it's not a security and then uh there was something that Brian Armstrong posted where genzer said 70 of everything in crypto is a commodity not a security and Brian Armstrong's like what WTF like what is this oh my God like he's these uh uh equivocating in reality I I I read that actually if you if you read the context he's talking about by market cap because Bitcoin and ether 70 of the market so actually he didn't really say what but I know I thought he was saying so anyway um people are people are mad at Gensler um what's interesting about the bittrex case where they where they named algorand as a layer one is that basically you know if you look at the record of what the SEC has gone after in terms of enforcement actions you know they the in terms of Big L ones they've gone after EOS they've gone after telegram uh and then you know they haven't actually gone after algorand but they they named eo's telegram Rebel uh basically being like the big old ones that they've gone after and then most everything else they go after is like some random weird D5 money market thing or some like basically borderline scam uh most of the stuff that they end up being enforcement actions to which seems to imply at least if you look at the pattern of behavior l1s that are run by like reputable people seem to be mostly left alone right he has not gone after the algorithms the solanas the polka dots the you know blah blah blah it's like the kind of shady ones that are not going to play well in court I think that's like mostly the action the the strategy that he's taken so naming algorand as a security seems like very out of character I think it would surprise a lot of people not because alvarand doesn't share a lot of features with other things that he's named as Securities because they did do an Ico and obviously you know there's a team and blah blah blah but it is surprising that something that's like a turing Award winner MIT Professor it's like not what the SEC goes after did you guys have any thoughts on that or Avery what was your guys reflection seeing them after Alvarez I think we were just very again pleased that we decided to do an airdrop in no icos I think that was a big important part for us when we thought about the way we distribute tokens to the community I mean actually those are dead at this point anyway so I I don't think that was a real decision I I mean argue like again soaking sales of any science is something that's risky uh oh I see I see that's something we did not do so even like a like a coinless type sale you guys would would okay that makes sense um cool okay let's switch gears a little bit um so one of the interesting pieces of news this week was a hack which is you know every week there's obviously some hack that goes on but the interesting thing about this hack so there's a there's a protocol called Merlin decks and it was half for two million dollars it was some kind of rug pull apparently people are now speculating it's a rug bull which happens you know there's always rug pulls but people started blaming surtic so surtic is this uh auditor auditing firm they are kind of the criticism against certic they're they're a very big auditing firm they're criticized as being kind of a like a sweatshop for Audits and that they like just spit out lots and lots of audits uh very very there's like they're very cheap and they do tons of them and and there's a there are a couple websites that have rankings of hacks by auditor and they are number one by an order of magnitude are they adjusting for total number of audits though that's the that's the question no this is just like tvl okay yeah yeah so so I mean certainly also they do a lot more audits so you have to adjust for that but anyway so surdic uh people also you know Merlin uh I think their audit was completed the day before the rug Bowl happened and so people were like oh my God certeg how could you sign off on this audit which is a very interesting thing to to to to point the finger at right because nobody was like Merlin there how dare you steal our money it was certain how dare you certify that this guy's Pastor audit um and so because it was it was a Red Bull so like it was some admin key that just like pulled up yeah I think there was the egregiousness of the fly it like had like at at time of deployment it already had like infinite approval for the asset set on some like random eoa so it was like like anybody reading this could easily see that was gonna be a rug pull it's like did they did they just rubber stamp it or like it was in some esoteric bug maybe they're using gpt4 to do something um interesting okay well so what happened was that people got really mad at cerdic and then certain very out of character for some have ever seen this surdic announced that they were going to pull together a Compensation Plan to to uh basically pay everybody back who lost money in this two million dollar hack so to be clear audits don't cost two million dollars I'll just cost a lot less especially from Zurich they cost a lot less than two million dollars so this is a crazy precedent for an auditing firm to offer to pay people back who use a protocol what do you guys think about this I mean we do that so yeah yeah but will we cover we cut like you know if there is but that's an explicit thing right that's not the case with an audit a lot of doesn't give you yeah sure yeah but I'm pointing out that there are people who do actually yes so if you agree to do that then you should definitely pay it out he's certain never agreed to do anything they're just responding to people getting mad well to be fair this is like the 50th hack from them in the year like I at some point the the pr damage does does force you into being an insurer this is also in the realm of like being feasible to repay right it's like two million dollars it's not 25. think of it as the cost of PR for them yeah stores that breakage you know baked in and this is this is breakage for an auditor basically I think it's fantastic I mean as someone who deals with auditing firms and it also helps to find help helps pair auditing firms with our ecosystem project specifically it is amazing if they could guarantee any kind of payback for for damages done and it gives them a lot of Summer security because I'm is really how do you get applications from ideation into production as fast as possible and Autos are such a big part of that um that would just I think increase confidence enough to go after one two three four Auditors just to get that confidence in there I mean I so I understand like it's a nice to have right like if your auditor is actually also secretly ensuring your protocol that's obviously awesome but the reality is that if that becomes so first of all now we everything we know about crypto tells us that once it happens once the next time everyone is going to be yelling at them to do it again right the next time this link is hacked by certain they'll be like you paid out this one why not that one now I'm gonna sue you because blah blah blah whatever um and so you have this basically this like a bundling now that um it's going to be expected that if the hack is small that the auditor auditing firm is going to pop so this is not yeah this is not actually the first time this has happened so there was this cylinder Euler hack I forget the name of this auditing firm but it's like it's a protocol where people stake uh in order to perform the audit do what I'm talking about uh anyway they're the ones who audited the Euler hack code and then basically they paid out partially um and they're actually I think fully drained right now the amount that they put up for insurance but they but this is your personal insurance yeah yeah there's explicitly insurance but my point I think it's very different I think it's very different because look if you're if you're charging for insurance then your insurance premiums are going to change right yeah like because now let's say look we had a payout turns out again sometimes we have to pay this so the insurance premiums go up and they compensate for that if now when you get an audit they're also basically underwriting the cost of insurance that means the price of audits goes up because now I have to look at the risk of like not only okay I give you this audit and then you go and like do stuff with it and fix your damn code it's also like well I'm taking on the risk of giving you this audit that your community will get mad at me and demand that I pay you back for a hack um it just like breaks a lot of stuff like audits are already really expensive right bundling the stuff I mean I don't know Avery um when you guys pay for audits right just because I think a lot of people in in the audience don't really understand they know that audits are important how much do audits actually cost I mean they can cost any anywhere between you know depends on the collects of the code I mean the way Auditors typically charge is you know they have a certain you know man hours or people hours they put into the project and then they're going to say like how much code I'm reviewing um you know what am I looking for specifically so it really depends on the scope of your project I mean if you've got a simple 20 line project probably almost nothing if you've got you know tens of thousands of lines of code and it's very complex it could be hundreds of thousands of dollars easily or more than that and give this ranges for like what you guys have paid and what you've seen for like companies in the app testings uh definitely out of our you know respect to our Auditors we will keep those confidential but like I said anywhere between you know five to a hundred thousand dollars could be very common for audit yeah I mean I think um is Sherlock the one you're thinking of yeah sure a lot that's it I think there's room for like in better incentive compatibility right like Auditors are basically one of the few professions or or goods or services but there's basically no warranty right like if you hire a plumber and your pipes break the next day they'll come back and fix it or there's an implicit warranty or an explicit warranty there's nothing like that for Auditors but also you know um for them it could be an interesting new Revenue stream if you're basically reselling somebody else's insurance and you're sort of offloading the reinsurer that seems very attractive but you're right that they should be like warehousing that risk to themselves that's just like uh way too dangerous yeah also like that also means that if somebody's underwriting a protocol like let's say let's say you pay me 30 000 for this audit but it's okay fine you pay me 30 000 I do thirty thousand dollars worth of work um I now also have to know how big is your protocol gonna be because if you're like a dinky little thing that's never going to be a problem where I could fit then like okay sure I'm fine underwriting that but if you're gonna get like 100 million dollars on tvl like I can't pay that back yeah so one one thing I have seen in industry is that um what otters might do and without again under contract is that the the pay for the bug Bounty that you know could have been associated with that particular uh bug that was found that seems way more reasonable to me yeah right because that's like again proportional to the fee that you're paying them as well exactly so I I think like if look if if there's like actually a warranty such that if my if my um uh my audit doesn't catch something egregious then I'll give you the money back that you paid me for the audit but like two million dollars for like a 20 000 audit obviously like I mean again this is an extraordinary circumstance I don't know any of the details but if this becomes a norm it is going to make auditing insanely expensive but it also belies the fact that like what what are audits really in crypto they're kind of overloaded right we think of audits as like okay well an audit is a way to check whether you have like fundamental errors in your code but it's also a like you know sort of s p or like Moody's like stamp of this is a triple a contract and you can trust this contract it's like investment grade contract right and we kind of rely on Auditors to do both we sort of don't acknowledge openly that that's what audits are for but that is really what they're for like when people say like oh it's an audited contract they generally don't even read the audit they just say oh it's audited by trail of bits right like great nobody opens up the audit actually reads through it there's like oh trailer bits like signed off on anything some people I read the audience okay all right I'm saying the vast majority of users don't read the audience right that all they do is they take that single bit I think I think after um the last year I I definitely think people have started reading a lot more audits like professional people who are like you trading used to not read audits like professional trading firms in 2021 you load only and after a lot of them got rug pulled they have started deciding to bother reading things or asking you know people who are paying attention I agree with that although I think a lot of that is a function of velocity rather than them learning it's just there's less there's less stuff to do these days so you have more time to read the audit um maybe okay well all right um let's move on to uh our favorite topic which is regulation so uh you all know us as your favorite regulatory show uh so there was a lawsuit that was filed from coinbase against the SEC so if you guys remember how The Saga started uh the SEC issued coinbase of Wells notice basically saying that hey you're doing some illegal stuff I'm not gonna tell you exactly what but we think you're in violation of Securities laws um coinbase has very vigorously in the press and to the public argue that the SEC is being unfair they're not giving them clear guidance and they intend to fight to the to the deaf um so then coinbase has sued now the SEC preemptively uh to basically enjoin the SEC to affirmatively make a rule which the SEC has never made rules like they basically against argued repeatedly that we don't need any rules we already have all the rules we need the laws already cover crypto um he has basically said like look uh you guys need to um essentially make a rule about crypto or decline to make a rule explicitly uh and either way from what I've read not being a lawyer and not knowing what the hell I'm talking about um they've basically the the strategy is that they're going to compel the SEC to say no because obviously the SC is not going to make a rule on crypto they already said they don't want to they're gonna they're gonna probably the SEC to say no and then when the SEC says no they're going to use that in court say look the SEC is not making rules they're being jerks uh and hopefully they'll play well in front of a judge so I don't know if that is correct but that is what I read somebody else speculated who knows more about legal than I do um what do you guys think about the Tesla right now between coinbase and the SEC elections coming up right so I think there's gonna be a half I think it's just gonna get dragged out like until like right after the election so you're saying that it's it's politically unpopular for them to fight this fight in public right now yeah it's sort of it seems like that that's just my you know not being in DC okay what do you speculate the election is going to do to all the actions that are against crypto well I I think the thing is like a lot of people are banking on the anti-crypto movement in their campaigns right like between Elizabeth Warren and and others there are other others I thought it was really just Elizabeth Warren I mean I feel like there's a she she has convinced people to nod politely when she talks about it right which before they're like you know we don't care right so that that that's a a step up I guess but but I guess my point is more like I feel like gendler's either going to try to like shove as many homework assignments under the teacher's door right before the election or basically try to like lay low until after depending on the outcome so if I I don't know which strategy you take the Super aggressive like just keep pummeling as many of these actions as possible um and then be like look I have such a good track record Congress give me 2.5 billion or whatever he requested and uh keep going or whether it's like do enough a high profile things but then you know like wait till the election and if if there's more support post selection because right now it feels like it's like 50 50 on crypto stuff as we saw in the the hearing of him uh then kind of like pull out the Bazooka if the electric goes right but it does seem like crypto I don't know that like going anti-crypto is a great election strategy so I agree with you on that front is that the reality is people who don't like crypto like people who lost money in the last cycle especially they already sold all their crypto they don't own crypto anymore so like a year from now they're not really going to care that much about crypto they care about inflation they care about you know crime or whatever immigration like these are the Hot Topic things that are going to be Mainline issues in the election um if you're talking about crypto the only people who care about crypto are people who own it and people own it they want you to leave it alone so I think like if you're if you're appealing in a general election you know Independence like you know what 10 15 of Independence on crypto and so you're mostly going to want to like not mess with crypto because you're just going to lose people and nobody's gonna vote for you because you're answering crypto it's just it's just such a low you know valence issues for most people I think on the flip side like um uh you know you know coinbase now is more they have and and they came out with this like nft support crypto thing this week they've really been trying to whip up like a Grassroots movement around getting people to support crypto and I think trying to sort of copy like the Uber Airbnb Playbook from like the early 2010s which was extremely actually effective in terms of like um uh convincing local regulators and the markets that they operated in you know big get Uber drivers Uber users to uh apply political pressure we haven't really seen that be effective in crypto right like despite the fact that arguably the user base is much much larger than either those apps like there isn't really a Grassroots Pro you know very loud Pro crypto movement and I don't really know why that is I mean they're they're trying but it doesn't really seem like they're getting uh a very effective these are people who are the biggest crypto users or people who are perpetually on the internet I don't think they're exactly like the graph Roots I'm gonna go like rally at like my local yeah how many people who own crypto and bought in last year have made a phone call that's a good point maybe a telegram call or something like that it's a bad thing like that's what I think I think that the generational Gap piece is actually quite important in assessing do you remember when uh what was it was like nopa and sopa like the um the laws about like uh they were gonna basically gonna cause a lot more internet censorship and there was this big coordinated blackout by all the internet companies like Google and Reddit and all this stuff and they like blacked out the home page um I was gonna say like they should just like turn off all the blockchains one day as like a protest move sorry sorry CEO of ethereum can you turn off the blockchain thing just ask metallic find Satoshi you know like we can I mean Aptos we can turn off right like so yeah so on as well as well sorry I'm talking um but yeah I do agree with you that like it's as much as it's good to see coinbase trying to take this Grassroots approach and get people energized by hey let's protect crypto let's fight for this um it is hard because crypto like they are also like very individualistic selfies I think the thing that will work the most is is a obviously inflation but then B um the end of the petrodollar hegemony like it really does feel like I think Chinese Yuan transfers recently were like higher than USD transfers for like a week which was like crazy you could shine for Chinese trades yeah yeah but not it includes domestic it include included exports would because like for instance like France is paying in Yuan for natural gas now they're not paying in dollars anymore uh Brazil the same thing so like this there's kind of this interesting thing going on also where the petrodollar hegemony does seem to be its weakest Point ever like everyone in the Middle East doesn't seem to give a  about the dollar anymore and I I kind of think the anti-crypto equals anti-dollar movement is the one that will actually win through the next election you heard it here first a little like 200 IQ I don't know if that's gonna I don't know that's gonna quite penetrate the mainstream um but I like where I like where your mind's at that's interesting I think you know we're we're definitely excited for more clarity that's something we've you know I think the whole industry is looking for we I've talked really recently joined the blockchain association uh then so we're we're actually hoping that the Luke offers and Clarity will help us to I can build things the way that you know regulars want to see them being built I've heard of so um looking forward into this this next year obviously it's been um you guys for for Aptos you guys have come into mainnet you're seeing the light of day you get to be a grown-up L1 now with everyone yelling at you and being mad all the time um what what uh what what are you looking forward to over the next year whether within the Aptos world or just like more broadly within crypto for Raptors I think well I I would say these are more broadly crypto themes which is I think we're all waiting to see like how we leverage like what three and crypto to be the best utility for customers and we haven't seen those mainstream applications yet hidden to market right when you ask people like what are you excited about crypto it's like oh I liquid stake and I go to open C that's that's great I mean those are all wonderful things but they're they're they're not like you know the way that internet applications have taken off uh with Netflix and Amazon and with Google and all those fun things that are out there and so you know we need a way to demonstrate that utility at scale and so solving those problems of user experience um system infrastructure and then working together and partnering and maybe even building some of those applications that actually can reach scale uh kind of from our experience but building a meta I think is something that's really Paramount not just for us but really for all the industry going forward actually speaking about it we were talking about this while we were outside um so I was just on the panel talking about AI like the intersection of AI and crypto and um I know meta actually has been in the been in the news recently for like their metaverse stuff plus their AI stuff like get behind in a couple ways um but what do you guys think about so we had a show recently with Ilya from near talking about the intersection crypto and AI I came out of that conversation feeling quite skeptical that there are that many interesting applications in the short term when I say applications I mean like investable crypto slash AI networks or tokens or whatever um but you guys disagree with me give me your bull case give me the bull case for the intersection of Krypton AI why there's going to be a ton of interesting stuff that happens there oh yeah I think you know at first when I looked at you know I think people have been talking about crypto AI for a long time by the way it's not something new I think back then I did believe a lot of it was more hype than the real but more recently I think you know with with the rise of large language models and other things there are many things are possible so first of all building smart contracts I would just talked about auditing for example that'd be a big process of getting from ideation into production the way that something like chat gbt can help you to guide you like hey chachibi can you write me a simple contract for doing like a simple swap or Escrow Service those kind of things will help onboard tons of new developers through a space when we have tens of thousands of developers in web3 there are millions of developers who work across all like software software Stacks around the world and so I think those kind of tools are going to be amazing in terms of helping to onboard users even start to do things like again like with move you have this kind of cool thing around a move prover and formal verification help me write the the formal verification specs to ensure that you know resources are conserved even if these operations are held like those kind of complicated operations that now improve our audibility of our code uh and actually run every single time I I try to launch a new feature on the blockchain is going to help us to move faster in this space and so those are kind of a couple of examples where Ai and like large language models can help us to develop more quickly and actually assist in smart contracts platforms and help educate users how to build in this space more effectively and then you know I have one more time I know we're running out of time so I'll just kind of jump in real quickly the other thing is blockchain has ability to kind of um do some kind of decentralized learning which is really interesting so federally learning for example where you kind of maintain privacy of user data being able to share that data in a way that can be accessible for um for for machine learning and for large-scale training uh can be done using the blockchain and I think that's another interesting you know area that that we're particularly excited about you know given our background and kind of my background just to be clear I've worked in data infrastructure for a long time worked on things like you know Hadoop mapreduce I've distributed scheduling uh all those fun things and so I see that kind of interesting being very interesting in terms of you know to to process data at a very very large scale in a way that kind of rewards uh the creators of that content as well um I guess I have two main uh things yeah certainly I think the decentralized training aspect you know every cycle of crypto has had someone say that so 2015 was like Golem 2018 it was like dfinity all the L ones right now kind of sort of saying that but there are actually some quite interesting improvements in decentralized training that aren't just strictly uh you know hey whatever you post some State proof that like I I did a single operation correct correctly there's actually sort of like some mechanisms people have made for fraud proofs where I can be running a GPU training part of a model you can be running a GPU training part of a model and the the person who's requesting it can send us particular tests of whether hey are you just giving me random numbers are you actually like running the algorithm putting the data in and those fraud proofs are actually super super useful because there's actually been a ton of uh fraud in terms of like training stuff where people just give you random numbers back instead of actually you know running stuff on your data so there's that part is is actually gotten way better and that's all because of ZK people that's not because of the current consensus stuff the other side of the ZK coin is uh is algorithmic provenance so how do you know that something came from an algorithm or a human or an algorithm that has access to particular data and so the slideshows I guess I've written some blog posts about this this week so it's quite it's like on my mind but there's a there's a natural question of like can you generate a form of proof where a a language model can prove to you that it was trained on a particular data set like oh this language model was trained on the corpora of coin death consensus transcripts and this other language model is just the default gpt4 can can can they interact with each other to generate a proof to you that one knows that it was trained on this other particular type of data and then generate something that looks like a ckp that's posted publicly so the idea of having algorithmic provenance I think is actually one of the most important things that people are really realizing is important because everyone here has read something where like oh well yeah that's definitely from chatging PT but you've also probably read things where like that sounds like it's almost human and being able to actually have a distinct line for that that's verifiable is going to be very important the next five years so to be clear I I don't disagree with any of your points but nothing that you said there like what you basically described is advancements in cryptography that have been um subsidized by a lot of stuff happening in blockchains are going to have broader use cases especially with the intersectional machine learning totally agreed um I don't know that in principle any of that requires you to post that on the blockchain so the provenance piece I think does need to be posted so publicly being able to verify that a particular model gives a particular output and that it was made by a model not a human or it's made by a particular registry uh is actually going to be quite important because especially as you talk about things where people have fine-tuned data sets for you know my custom model does X better than yours being able to prove that you own that is is going to be very important because that's the IP of the future right the IP is that that's fair that's fair that's exactly that's the argument of knowledge okay there's a fair argument that is a fair argument um okay we're running up on time so unfortunately we have to wrap sorry for my rant no no that was a great it was a great rant that's a natural way to end to talk like this thank you all for listening see you all next time [Music]
