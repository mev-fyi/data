the way that the lindy effect works in my opinion is kind of logarithmic so the fact that the merge was successful for one second is already a huge breakthrough the fact that it was successful one minute is a huge breakthrough ten minutes a whole day a whole week a whole month or whole year and i think if it can survive the next few days the next few weeks next few months this is a high high high confidence that you know this is this is reliable i must also highlight that the proof of stake chain has been running for a very long period of time it's been running for you know over a year and a half now it's the most secure blockchain in the world now it has 20 billion dollars of economic security and also unlike proof of work chains it has the ability to recover from 51 attacks thanks to slashing the ability to identify and remove attackers if and when there is an attack yeah and just to draw that out it's because in contrast in a proof-of-work system they would still have their equipment so you know it's kind of like harder to keep them off the network is that the implication there that's correct when you are under attack and proof of work you cannot distinguish the good guys from the bad guys all the hash rate is fungible and so you can't just you know target you know the the the data centers of an attacker and kind of remotely burn them down but this is effectively what we're able to do with proof of stake because every unit of stick is identified and can be removed from the system either automatically for example in the context of two inconsistent finalized points there's an automatic process whereby anyone who voted on both sides of of these finalized chains will get automatically slashed and there's also a process if required called social slashing whereby as a community we kind of observed for example that there's been censorship on the chain and we can react with a soft fork or a hard fork that removes the attacker from the chain if you enjoyed this clip watch the full episode available now on unchained
