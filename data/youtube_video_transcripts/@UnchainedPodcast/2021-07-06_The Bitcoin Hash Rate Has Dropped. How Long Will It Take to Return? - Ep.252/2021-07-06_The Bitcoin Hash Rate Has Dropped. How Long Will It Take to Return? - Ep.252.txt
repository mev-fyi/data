vice president of business development at foundry welcome kevin thanks for having me on laura before we get into all the bitcoin mining news and there is a lot of it why don't we just start with your background because you have you're kind of like a crypto og tell us how you got into bitcoin sure thing uh so like many others i heard about bitcoin quite early back in college in 2011 and i actually wrote it off it's oh it's magic internet money nothing just goes to a thousand it's not really backed by anything and i kind of disregarded it for several years but then it came back to me when i um was quite bored of my corporate finance job at ford and i was actually through some of my video gaming friends on world of warcraft uh they introduced me to bitcoin money and that particular friend uh introduced me to it he was childhood friends with roger veer and when he told me that he was building a mining operation out in california and he was looking for someone that had a background in finance could speak chinese to work with manufacturers and a passion for technology i was sold right away so i packed my bags and fled to california to kind of pursue this crazy bitcoin money i love that story and um you tell us where you worked there because i think that you worked at some companies that were associated with roger vere oh absolutely uh so prior uh to me joining roger bitcoin.com i uh i was working on several different large-scale projects in north america so i spoke about there was this project on california well very quickly we learned in late 2014 how difficult it is to operate and maintain a mining facility in very hot climates like california we also needed cheaper electricity and more scale so eventually we found the business up in montana and that became known as project spokane which eventually got acquired by a group called hyperblock uh in 2016 that was what we claimed was one of the largest facilities if not the largest in north america at the time eventually i did join roger over at bitcoin.com i helped him with his bitcoin money operations and bringing business to bitcoin.com's mining pool eventually i did find my way back into the us i worked on a project called british generation which was a very large-scale natural gas power plant and first fully compliant uh behind the meter mining operation for bitcoin out of the power plant i guess that caught the attention of those at dcg and uh i joined mike barry here at uh foundry digital all right yeah and we'll dive a little bit more into some of the details there later on so tell us what does foundry do and what do you do there sure uh so i'm the vice president of business operations or business development here at foundry um foundry is a decentralized infrastructure play for digital currency group um what that means is we provide services in the infrastructure layer for both proof of work and proof of stake but my guess is for today we're going to focus on the bitcoin mining site all right so why did dcg decide to start foundry because they had been industry players for quite a while before doing so yeah that's a great question prior to me joining dcg i was at greenwich we were looking to raise capital and partner up with many of the uh known staples um within the crypto community and investors and there was this uh saying that was being passed around where a lot of the more institutional investors they were saying friends don't let friends mine and clearly there there was something that was missing there and what it all came down to was we realized there was uh the bitcoin money in space needed cleaning up uh for lack of a better term it really wasn't quite a show especially for westerners trying to break into the market certainly lacks a lot of transparency it's very opaque uh lead times for deliveries can be very long it's a very risky and capital intensive endeavor and most people have typically shied away from it and dcg our mission is to build a better financial system for the future and part of that is bringing an institutional adopters right and to get that institutional adoption you got to make industry more mature bring more transparency and credibility so we realized that we have an ability and an opportunity to leverage our balance sheet our capital and our reputation to break into a mining ecosystem and really clean up the ecosystem for other investors to kind of follow the path that we're leading a clear example would be um uh let's say with both our subsidiaries sister companies at grayscale and genesis they're dealing with a lot of flow and a lot of coins that they're custom or that are from customers are looking to generate yield returns on the crypto that we're managing for them well when you're dealing with billions of dollars in digital assets it's very difficult to trust let's say two college students in a dorm room for their staking service uh and we realized that as a space needs to be more mature and institutionalized we should first be able to serve our own sister companies and portfolio companies if we could provide an institutional product internally then we can offer it to others and the same is true with mining i mentioned before that there's all these risks with not only procuring the miners but also building your facility knowing to invest in what uh what collocation and sites to work with and we wanted to bring our credibility experience to the table and just to kind of draw out the issues there it's that when you talk about the delay and um you know purchasing minors it could be that you calculate what your cost would be and um figure out whether or not you could be profitable based on the price at any given time and the difficulty your electricity costs but as time goes by those factors start to change a little bit and then that could affect whether or not you could have a profitable operation by the time the miners arrive is that kind of what some of the issues are there yeah absolutely so i think one of the most critical things that a lot of investors and uh market participants miss when they enter into the mining space is timing right i have to actually be quite counter-cyclical uh where usually if you're buying and purchasing miners or building your sites when the economics are very profitable usually it's too frothy and by the time you actually get your operations online units are delivered they're very long lead times right we're talking six to nine months if not a year so by the time you actually get your equipment and everything powered on the economics are no longer there because the rest of the competition has either cut up or the markets have themselves corrected all right yeah so now that we understand a little bit what the mindset is of a mine operator let's now talk about the news coming out of china regarding mining um obviously there's been this ban that's been in the news um why don't you tell us what happened uh so this may be quite long tangent but i think there's a lot of things to cover right the way i look at um how china is cracking down on mining and crypto regulations in general it's not focused only on mining ccp and china as a country the main focus is social stability and maintaining their authority and their status quo by making sure everything is under control and that is oftentimes challenged when crypto is in everyone's faces everyone's fervent investor right and it's on top of everyone's mind and i literally recall that in the middle of i believe it was may my friends texted me from china they were like hey grayscale dcg and barry they're on cctv too right uh so when you have a state brand news channel that's broadcasting on cryptocurrencies and they spent a whole 30 minute segment covering doggy coins and the crazy returns you can get on those coins um you know that okay the chinese governments have to respond in some way with their own news channels and broadcasting people so a lot of this is focused around financial risk and control right and this has been ongoing and it's been a pattern of cyclical for some time now we saw the same thing in 2017 uh when there was the ico boom and bitcoin was pushing 20 000. almost immediately after the state ran cctv news channels were covering all these crazy returns from ico investments a few weeks later the chinese government came and cracked down on the exchanges at the time so many of the staple changes like holby finance okay they moved overseas and this time around it's very very similar the one thing that i think is different is we also have the focus in the spotlight on the 100th year anniversary of the ccp uh that was just yesterday right so i think they want to demonstrate even more control over what's going on in space and the one thing that's different than three years ago was there's a lot more of an effort on the environmental impact of bitcoin mining and the esg efforts from the central party so bitcoin mining was more in the crosshairs this time around and it did crack down right everyone's talked about the same uh narrative that oh china's band mining china kills uh going again this and that but this time around they actually did enforce and crack down quite hard different provinces and we can go through the whole timeline and the cascade of the events if you like yeah why don't we do that and also when you do that if you could just explain a little bit what the relationship is between um power plants in china and miners because from what i understand this 100 year anniversary really did affect even how the power plants themselves you know how willing they were to um enforce these crackdowns so let's go into the timeline yeah absolutely so we won't go all the way back to 2017. we'll just start with this year right um so i think the first major news that hit time around was march 1st so march 1st interim mongolia announced that they were cracking down on bitcoin mining uh they had listed um several large facilities that they were going to inspect and further offer more stringent regulation for operating their bitcoin money farms what ended up happening by the end of the month was that further strength and regulation turned into oh we're going to suspend mining activities in our mongolia so at the time most people were suspecting oh this is more of environmentally driven type effort from the central government because their mongolia is largely uh backed by coal fire plants that supply the bitcoin miners and uh before i talk about some of the other events that happen i think it's also important to illustrate that in china it usually is an annual migration of miners so during what we call wet season anywhere from mid june to late june when there's a lot of rain oftentimes miners will send their equipment and their asic servers down to sichuan where there's an abundance of hydropower and then by the time november rolls around they'll return their miners to the northern regions or the coal-fired regions like xinjiang or inner mongolia and in this case the miners are starting off in their position in inter mongolia waiting to be sent to sichuan so a lot of that got accelerated and even then during this period of march and april uh most people were they were still uh not fully confident the chinese government would actually come in step in and actually shut down some of these operations so there were those that actually stayed behind what ended up happening is by the end of april operation at this day behind they were all shut down they were sealed to police tape and the transformers and a lot of substations they had padlocks on them so my operations did cease for good at the end of april at least this time around um one of the largest gpu money farms that i'm friends with over in their mongolia they had all their equipment stuck and they couldn't even access them because they went with the bet that maybe the chinese government isn't actually gonna regulate this or crack down so hard unfortunately um they were they're quite serious this time around when you say that that you know their um equipment was padlocked and everything why wouldn't they be allowed to ship it out where they want like as long as they're just not in inner mongolia yes i think one thing i may have glossed over was um the tone of the crackdowns and the regulations from the beginning of march towards the end of march changed drastically so initially in march they were like we're going to take a look at this and offer guidelines for how to maintain bitcoin mining uh and be compliant but towards the end of the month the tone had changed too okay we want to cease all bitcoin body activities um so they've given the deadline for that by the end of april but they first they want everything out and that's why the people that decide to stay behind and kind of go with the gamble or risk that maybe they aren't going to actually inspect the crap down that hard they were kind of hot with their pants down there oh wow is that mining equipment going to be destroyed or confiscated or something or so there's a lot of uh there's a lot of conspiracy theorists this or that the state's gonna confiscate this all and the chinese government is gonna shadow mine and do this with that but no it's it's all so they're actually some videos that have been circulated on the internet or some pictures over the years but they actually do confiscate it to their uh police departments and depots and it's all just sitting there collecting dust oh boy oh yeah so that's the longest yeah quite a lot okay all right so keep going with the timeline all right so um what also happened during the middle of april was bitcoin also pushed all-time highs right so not only the bitcoin price push all-time highs in the mid 60s uh 60 000 or so so did uh bitcoin money hashtag oh bitcoin money hash rate it was averaging around 170 x cashes maybe even 180s hashes time period so the the inner mongolia crackdown hadn't really affected the global mining network too much the people that did move out which was the majority of miners up there they were able to find other open capacity available in china or abroad um and then things started shifting and changing come may 13th and may 15th towards the middle of may when i mentioned before the story of the cctv2 uh broadcast um that was when bitcoin had really in his crypto in general uh had really hit mainstream news and it was all over the state broadcast media this and that and then almost immediately afterwards this was i believe may 21st or so the state council of the people's republic china they made an announcement that they want to crack down hard on trading and mining but this was only just a couple sentences so there wasn't focus only on mining but they wanted to crack down all crypto uh cryptocurrency activity and they did say we want to regulate trading and mining during that time bitcoin price had also been correcting it already fallen from 64 000 down to the low 40s or so and the hash rate had had also been dropping and it re-corrected down to 150 x caches uh and around that time this is kind of where it's started the sharp decline of hash rate as we enter the month of june so june 2nd at the very start of june 2nd a lot of the miners already started sending their miners over to sichuan so i talked about how miners will relocate their miners take advantage of lower rates uh and abundance of electrical capacity that stranded at the hydro dams in sichuan so a lot of the mine equipment had was actually migrating from northern china and other coal-fired areas to sichuan and a lot of the power plants and miners um they're worried that oh if china during the may 21st announcement if they're going to be taking a harder stance on bitcoin mining and trading how are they going to regulate us here in sichuan right so they proactively set up a council in a meeting to discuss how to do fully compliant mining uh within sichuan they want to weigh the pros and cons of should they permit money at a provincial level what came out of that was okay we're continuing mining and we're going to see what's going to happen at the state level that was a ghost signal for a lot of miners to kind of send their equipment to sichuan if they hadn't already then on june 9th uh we also had announcements come from xinjiang and tinghai uh that they were also going to be suspending money activities so forced the hand of all the other miners that hadn't moved to sichuan so essentially at this point most miners were moving their equipment to sichuan china in hopes that the hydro power would be sustained uh and will be allowed for uh bitcoin mining uh and then the big bombshell came on june 18th and this is when sichuan made the announcement that they were going to suspend all bitcoin money activities they initially called out 26 of the largest power plants in the mining facilities everyone else they essentially shuddered and they were like well if these were the same plants that participated in the june 2nd meeting they proactively set the guidelines for how they were going to be compliant and the regulations that were set forth in front of them and they were told to shut off many of the other even smaller medium-sized binds they decide to shut off their operations as well so this is the point where we saw uh global hash rate starts filing downwards and we take ourselves to essentially present day roughly the end of june the last province which is yunnan also followed suit with banning any remain money activities which essentially took off 90 of the hash rate capacity uh that was being mined in and china we can see that global hash right now from an all-time high of 170 180 x cash averages back in april may those have now plummeted down to 90 extra hashes or so wow that's incredible and um so at this moment it just feels like we're in this transition period and we haven't really seen a ton of the miners come online yet in other places but as far as you know at this moment where are miners looking or what are the factors that they're considering as they decide where to set up shop yeah that's a great question i think that's the question on everyone's mind right and the tough answer is that um there really isn't that much space to plug in this much capacity into right uh when essentially it's overnight right over the course of one or two months you had over 50 of the entire network go offline you have to be able to build that capacity so quickly uh we talked about before that oftentimes projects take six to nine months that's after you got the green light in approval to begin construction in some of the western more established countries right so the quickest turnaround time uh for money operations to be built up and the countries and jurisdictions most similar to china people that benefit the most was central asia so the most popular country for a lot of these chinese miners to migrate to was kazakhstan no different than everyone else kazakhstan they can only support so much capacity as well much of the network has actually remained dormant and offline since these crackdowns and we're seeing that with this large difficulty drop the largest ever that's going to take place very end of uh today friday uh july 2nd yeah and so when you say that um you know there there isn't this amount of capacity elsewhere when you say it's just because they tend to look for excess capacity is that why it's not just excess capacity it's open capacity right so a little bit of background and the mining infrastructure needs to first be built before miners can be plugged in you have to step down a tremendous amount of electricity usually at the substation level so you have high voltage electricity then you have stepping down to medium voltage and that medium voltage then needs to be brought down to low voltage and you have all these different layers of electrical equipment permitting and uh sourcing of equipment uh infrastructure that takes a very long time very interesting kind of dynamic that's being played uh it's playing out in front of us is there's major uh bottlenecks supply crunches on not just the bitcoin mining uh equipment ecosystem but all over the world electrical transformers are at a premium and there there's a massive shortage here too overall materials have spiked in price so for all those reddit traders everyone else they know exactly what we're talking about uh copper prices have shot through the roof lumber et cetera right so a lot of these materials that go into electrical infrastructure or into the building of these facilities those are shot up not only in cost but in lead time and all of that is because of the pandemic pandemic oh it's yeah quite the quite the storm one other thing that i saw that you tweeted which was really interesting to me was you said a lot of the mining equipment is not up to code for western countries so what do you mean by that right uh so we also talked about um so you have all this equipment that's being shut off in china that's infrastructure actually let me take a step back uh one of the ways we can tell that the chinese government's much more serious about this crackdown suspension of mining is that many of the power plants that were fully compliant and got the green light to go proceed with mining from the provincial governments they're now being told to not only uproot and take out their bitcoin miners they're being told to uproot and take out what's wrong all their electrical infrastructure they've been solved so all these things that uh has taken months to source being able to they need to remove it from the premises and what i meant by some of this equipment won't translate so well into the west is one of the advantages that china and the kazakhstan the world has had over the u.s has been that they don't have a stringent electoral code we do over in western countries in europe you have ce certified type electrical equipment and in the west you have ul listed equipment that you have to run that's a fancy way of saying you got to build your electrical equipment with your code and regulations and with better more stable materials so the aluminum that's being used in chinese transformers that's often required to be copper over here in the north america that equipment won't be allowed to be turned on here in the states so you have all this equipment that now is no longer able to be translated and used again in the west but they sometimes can be sent to countries in central asia where it's much more similar to china okay yeah and one other factor uh for those who are looking to relocate in the us are the u.s china tariffs also a part of this calculation yeah absolutely so that that tariff is still there guys so for those are looking to purchase used miners oftentimes does it make sense to send them directly or don't run them in the us there are like proactive stances that the manufacturers have taken right so we're right now we're obviously focusing on the dormant miners that were taken offline in china but the manufacturers have done a great job of also spinning up assembly and manufacturing sources in malaysia and thailand and other parts of the world so most of the us mining participants they are actually purchasing directly from the manufacturers from these overseas manufacturing sites where the tariff doesn't apply to them but most of these use binders um they still have a tariff because they're mining in china and they're produced in shenzhen right so that's another reason why a lot of these miners are going to the central asia groups and even canada so the tariffs are only applied to the us and china so canadians have benefited a lot from this as well as other non-american countries so what's your take on what this ban means for bitcoin and and and just to make clear so i mean it sounds like you're saying you think this will be permanent or do chinese miners think at all that maybe like you know in a year or two they can kind of turn the lights on again or yeah um that's a good question it's also another questions on everyone's mind and there are those in china that think that um there's this theory that maybe it's only so stringent and so severe of a crackdown because it's centered around the ccp's 100 year anniversary um but large part of this actually plays back into what i mentioned before which is how prevalent and how much of a splash is bitcoin and crypto at large making in the uh in the social circles right bitcoin is pushing all-time highs again towards it this year i'm quite certain that money will still be suspended right the last thing they want to do is to show weakness or show that oh we actually don't have much authority in that we spend the money once it's coming back again right if we look back at say 2017 exchanges ultimately found a way back into china they re-registered overseas and they still targeted the same retail investors that were in china uh mining um may be similarities in that if bitcoin were to correct or we're into another into another fair market or um price action right where there's less volatility and less news and media then perhaps chinese government overlook it for them it's all about um i think it's about the perception to show that they're they're kind of in the driver's seat they have a good handle of things in limiting financial controls yeah one other factor i wonder is as they get rolling with their digital yuan dcp if that will kind of um push them to enforce the crackdown more as time goes on because they'll kind of want the population there to interact or to transact with that system so there's definitely that's a very popular narrative and i think um there's correlation but i don't think there's too much causation there and ultimately uh it's the same thing with the environmental stance right um so the bitcoin mining council they released some data that shows that bitcoin's actually largely renewable and um feinstein over at blockcat he's tweeting some awesome data statistics where bitcoin money uses just a drop in the bucket of the total power that's out there so um when people talk about the environmental impact of decoy mining or they talk about uh how it can challenge a digital yuan it's it's very very very small percentages and numbers statistically against what they're competing against so once again i think it's more of the perception and the narrative around how much they're actually controlling actually contributing against the the networks all right so um i think maybe the last thing i want to ask is just what would you say is going to be the overall significance of this ban and the migration for bitcoin yeah um so overall significance is you're going to see much more decentralization across the entire network which is great for the security and the longevity of bitcoin right it's very much um it's very unfortunate for a lot of our colleagues and friends for some people say brethren and comrades right over in china and they are they are very close friends and colleagues right uh and it sucks that they had such a shark stance and they had to remove a lot of their uh operations they've been going up over the years but uh the rest of the world stands to benefit right the more decentralized and the more distributed the bitcoin mining network becomes the more secure it is and i think what this will actually help accelerate is development of new technologies to support the mining activities in previously uh prioritizing regions right so if you look at mayan distribution maps you'll see that much of the southern hemisphere doesn't have money activities right and that's largely because uh even though they have cheap electricity or access to cheap renewable power typically much hotter climates right they're closer to the equator or they're more human right so uh when there was capacity available in china and there's abundant capacity in north america people started prioritizing expansions there but now that these regions now have excess capacity you touched on el salvador earlier these places stand to gain a lot right it's technologies that will be developed to support those regions typically bitcoin buyers are cooled with uh uh with open air solutions but now we may look at more developments and may be accelerated when it comes to immersion right so that's submerging your miner into fluids into cooling your miners and we can see much more of that coming out in countries like el salvador south america in australia southeast asia maybe even parts of africa right i'm hoping to see that much more mine spreads out to these regions because they do have dormant capacity and cheap um electrical rates that are very conducive to bitcoin all right i'm going to have to ask you more about that but one last thing i wanted to say about this significance for bitcoin and how you said the hash rate would become more decentralized i remember back in 2015 when i wrote one of my first really big articles on bitcoin that i said one of the risks was that since more than half the hash rate was in china that if the chinese government ever decided they just were going to take over all the miners then that would be a way for the chinese government to kind of like 51 attack the network and so now that the hash rate in china has fallen below 50 percent um i think that's uh the first time since i've started reporting on this space that i can say okay well now that's not a risk absolutely so it's another stress test that proves just how resilient bitcoin is right um yes i mean some of the block times were maybe a little bit longer during this difficulty period but here in the next other eight hours or so uh at the end of this friday when difficulty readjusts times will resume much closer back to 10-minute averages and the network prevails and continues uh soldiering on so i think that's it just further uh emphasizes um how awesome of a technology bitcoin mining is or bitcoin yeah i agree all right so in a moment we're going to talk more about what the drop in this hash rate means but first a quick word from the

conversation with kevin zhang so as we've been discussing in the show the bitcoin hashrate is going to see what is likely to be its biggest drop ever today is that right it's going to be definitely the biggest drop ever all right so um so we kind of you know talked about how the network is resilient but uh still what does this mean for the network and for all the various uh actors and you know industry players on the network i've tweeted out some threads about this and i've shared some of my thoughts already but now that we're getting even closer to the difficulty adjustment here in eight hours or so um economics are pretty much locked in right um there's only so many more blocks are going to be solved and we can already forecast uh knock on wood unless bitcoin moves them very much in one direction we can kind of forecast what it's going to look like so we're looking at anywhere from a 27 to 28 difficulty drop which will be the largest ever but that being said it's well within the limits so the way the bitcoin difficulty adjustment algorithm works it can grow or decrease by a factor of four so it can grow significantly more or drop up to 75 percent this is actually well within its normal bounds and well within the network's algorithm but what we're going to see is from the market participants so from users they're going to be excited because block times will return back to a much more of a norm around a 10 minute average by uh difficulty dropping so much the block times then they go higher right we're looking at 13 14-minute blocks um it slows down the network somewhat the fees go up but the network still worked right but people prefer more uh normal block time so this week but the people that stand to benefit the most are those that have miners plugged in right so when the difficulty is going to drop 28 that's effectively a 38 increase in revenue there's a lot less competition uh and especially if you're a very competitive operator with lower costs you're going to see even a bigger impact on your bottom line so for miners that do have capacity and do have their equipment already plugged in or bring more miners online they stay they stand the game the most uh so much so that the profitability of a minor let's uh i was tweeting this out earlier and i actually just updated the numbers before a call minor during uh the middle of april when price was around 60 000 or so pushing all-time highs and back when difficulty and hash rate were also at all time highs uh the s19 uh hundred terahash miner was was yielding and producing about 35 to 36 dollars a day right once this difficulty adjustment takes place that same miner uh we'll be making roughly 33 a day so it's a very very small drop in revenue and the bitcoin price has almost been cut in half since then and it's largely because the difficulty and the hash rate's dropped with it so once again miners that have equipment plugged in they stand the game the most and it's a very good time to be a buyer yeah and all of this is happening at the same time that we've been seeing bitcoin gain much more uh mainstream adoption which has also meant that a lot more mainstream concerns have been coming to bitcoin and probably top of mind there would be the environmental concerns and just wanted to ask you you know in general like at this moment in time especially now um where you know we're seeing hash rate move out of china and a lot of people tend to think and i you know i don't know how true this is that uh a lot of the dirtier energy um is the bitcoin that's mined in china um do you have a sense of whether or not bitcoin is becoming greener uh at this moment like what do you think are the prospects that it will become greener yeah so um i have a couple thoughts there uh before i dive into that answer i'll just kind of give some context on foundry one other reason why we entered into this space right uh part of green or institutional adoption obviously it's cleaning up the ecosystem making it more credible and transparent but another is kind of combating these narratives there's two big narratives that we've been combating um since we were found the first was bitcoin is centralized it's controlled by china but we just discussed how that's kind of solving itself in front of our eyes so it won't go too much there we can also cover um how we've been comparing the narrative that bitcoin's destroying our planet or going to the oceans and as a bitcoin miner and as having uh access to many different uh sets of data and many operations that we work closely with the facts are actually on the bitcoin monitor side bitcoin is largely renewable or it's taking advantage of stranded energy that otherwise be wasted right i also talked earlier before that uh darren feinstein at blockcat he issued awesome report statistics that's a drop in the bucket compared to the total um energy usage that's out there and especially that's being wasted um but the other thing i want to leave listeners with is that like my colleague our ceo the office says that bitcoin has a ruthless drive towards cost efficiency and some of the most cost efficient sources of power are from renewable sources right so bitcoin will naturally become quote-unquote uh in that the power consumption that it uses will be largely from renewables as we um trend towards those technologies uh one of the things i think is often forgotten is that we can't just flip the switch off overnight and switch from home quote dirty energy into these renewable sources overnight and bitcoin money serves as this incredible opportunity has to be the battery for a lot of these unstable grids uh one of the large uh negatives in the drawbacks for using renewable power is that it's not sustainable uh or it's not very sustained uh it's very intermittent and having an energy consumer that can stabilize and turn off or turn on and flip the switch is a very powerful synergy synergistic tool to keep to empower those technologies and bitcoin mining is just that yeah what you're referencing there i think um is the idea that was uh posed in this white paper put up by square in arkhanvest um can you outline a little bit how that could work about how bitcoin mining could be a complement to renewable energy production and how much are we seeing that you know actually take place now or or or you know whether or not um there's any critical mass of objects like that in the works sure so um i can't speak about specific projects i'm also not an expert on electrical side but a very high level i talked about how a lot of these renewable energies whether it's solar or wind sometimes uh these are not very stable sources of power because um oftentimes there's not someone that's going to be out there taking that power on so often times there's a ramp up time uh there's a need to store the electricity and the batteries that are required uh to build out the capex of these deployments it can be very cost prohibitive but if you deploy bitcoin miners and you have another revenue source that can readily use the power and also give it back when it's longer than needed or when the with the grid and the energy markets spike and peak bitcoin miners are the perfect solution answer to that they can flip on and off like a switch being europeans it's very it's very uh front of mind for us or top of mind for us because of what happened this week where we got those alerts on our phones to conserve electricity this and that like people oftentimes take for granted that power doesn't just come out of thin air right it has to be generated and it has to be sustained over time so i think bitcoin miners are absolutely the solution to that problem uh well just for people who don't know um it was like an amber alert on on my phone suddenly it just started screeching that you know i had to turn off as much energy as like energy usage as i could and being a good citizen i did that um but i was like oh oh wow okay um anyway one other thing i wanted to ask about was earlier you you mentioned something um that i i'm not super familiar with which is underwater mining or i don't remember what phrase you use to describe it's called immersion cooling okay yeah so how does that work several types of emergent cooling technologies so one of the uh biggest challenges of running a bitcoin money operation or running even a single bitcoin miner is dissipating the heat so the latest generation bitcoin miner uses about three and a half uh kilowatts uh so you can imagine three and a half kilowatts being three microwaves condensed into a shoebox that never turn off that constantly run so imagine the heat that's dissipating and on the amount of power it's not consuming right so the most cost efficient way and the prevailing strategy for cooling those miners has been installing very high frequency fans to move the airflow right remove the airflow and dissipate the heat we talked about earlier before that now that there's a supply crunch and bottlenecks capacity in those air open-air cooled areas and there is available uh capacity electricity in the southern heather hemisphere closer to the equator it's hotter and it's more humid air cooling no longer work so we can look at immersion technologies immersion technology is actually submerging your miner into dielectric fluids i love those two different types what's called a single phase coolant and there's also two phase coolant a single phase coolant means that they're moving the fluids that you're submerging your miner into and the chips and the hatchboards into and it moves the fluids and it cools the fluids in the heat exchanger and it uh recirculates it once they're moving air removing these fluids that dissipate and grab the heat off of the boards and chips uh the other methodology is two-phase two-phase uh sounds a lot fancier it's a lot cooler but it's also much more uh expensive uh it's actually taking the the state that the fluids are in and change it into gas to cool the fluid before it recirculates it into the miter so these technologies they haven't been as prevalent or as proven at a large scale because they have largely not been prioritized but as we see these other regions and the need for decentralization pop back up right in these technologies we'll see a lot more a lot more interest and a lot more growth okay you know i had miami mayor francis suarez on the show and he didn't seem aware that that you know the temperature in a certain location would affect whether or not you would want to mine there but if i ever have him on the show again i'll mention this to him and say well if you want to bring mining to miami then i think this is the way um well so speaking of mining in north america there's been a lot of talk in recent years about more mining moving to this continent and i don't you know i don't really know but is that just kind of like patriotic americans and canadians wanting to see more mining here or are there tangible benefits to having more mining in north america absolutely i think there certainly are a lot more uh benefits right first of all it is is very much real and the data stands behind it and it's that much more multiplied now that china has shut off a lot of their operations right china has been anywhere from 50 to 70 of the global mining network uh for the past few years and when you lose 90 of that capacity in the last few months the other percentages and the other distribution network across the network grows uh so right now we're looking at anywhere from 25 to 30 of the entire network being in north america that's both the us and canada right before about the differences between china and the us as far as from the building side um when they can source cheaper uh electrical equipment and they can build on shorter time frames because it's not as stringent from the permanent regulatory side but the one advantage that u.s has is the capital markets and we've seen that play out in the last half year or so right when bitcoin won its run some of the biggest winners in the space has been the publicly listed companies so the capital markets is the one big advantage that can really accelerate the growth and the amount of capital you have at your disposal no large-scale mining operations and many of those have already come online and continue to grow expand where it gets really ironic and interesting is we talked about obviously oh china uh they're so it's so centralized there they made 51 impact the network the government takes over this or that well we're actually gonna be trending to the point where the us or north america may be too much of uh the global hashtag but where i have confidence that uh that that scenario will play out is obviously the us and the western large part is a lot more democratic the government's not going to step in it just kind of sees all your equipment but ultimately it's uh a lot of the regulations that come at the federal level is very mixed and it's not consistent across the states so what you see a lot more regulations on the local jurisdictions at the state level right where it's very different from china where essentially the state or the their national or state or federal level right um whatever they say goes right so even though certain provinces wanted to keep mining like the unions or sichuans that held off the logger they were ultimately uh their hands were forced and they had to shut off money even though they were previously compliant in the u.s it's a lot more up to the local jurisdictions um you have some states that are a lot more friendlier to minors like the kentuckys the texas's the georgias of the world um or of the us and then you have other states that have issued moratoriums or actively trying to stop bitcoin mining right you have uh moratoriums in chilean county over in washington plattsburgh new york and we saw that the recent bill proposed up in the state of new york that was clearly targeting specific bitcoin buyers so unwanted way of saying um certainly hash rate is growing in the us almost too fast and it's great to see a company that is based here but we'd also like to see growth not only in the u.s north america but all over the world one thing that i found interesting was your previous firm greenridge used a behind the meter system um can you explain what that is and why it is that that was beneficial for your company yeah so behind the meter is a fancy way of saying like you generate your own power right uh it's power that you're not pulling from the grid and ultimately what that means is you're going to be extremely cost efficient so long term i think more and more of the bitcoin miners that are in the internet ecosystem are these um large energy companies and power generation assets right uh bridge prior to instituting bitcoin mining a struggling peaking plan right it was on the verge of shutting down and a lot of jobs and taxes would have been lost but because they implemented bitcoin money grid previously was not giving them a sustainable enough business model to be a peaker plan right so we talked about how city new york or new york city struggled with electrical stability and everyone takes for granted that the power just isn't readily available but it's not like these beaker plants need to be incentivized uh to stay there to provide stability to the grid right and um the market economics as they were weren't conducive to that so bitcoin mining allowed greenwich to run base loaded and they can ramp on much quicker uh they have uh the power plant constantly running supervised stability to the grid anyways i kind of went on a tangent there but um behind the meter once again is gener you're using the own power that you're generating right and you're no longer paying a lot of the same transmission distribution costs that your competitors are and that's why i think over time as there's more clarity and as there's more data that affects just how uh environmentally friendly uh and quote will green bitcoin actually is more of these players are gonna enter into the ecosystem and the people that move first they're gonna have an advantage because they're gonna have the know-how the capital built out and once again we talked about timing right they're gonna be first movers and grenades is certainly one of them and um we've mentioned this a few times but haven't really discussed it in depth so as we know in el salvador they're looking into volcano mining is that going to be a real thing what do you think is the plausibility of that if it's not a real thing we're going to make it a real thing right um jokes aside um geothermal technology for bitcoin money has been happening for a long time right iceland has been fighting off of cocoa volcano power for quite some time now um so i think the uh the challenges that they face is obviously going to be once again how do you mine in a hotter and a more humid climate but the technologies are there right immersion is not like uh it's not some new foreign technology that hasn't uh been used before it just hasn't been built largely at scale at cheap enough costs but now that we're seeing a lot of buyers being displaced the economic incentive is there to solve that equation uh there is going to be new um hurdles of bionics with likes how do you source and get miners over from china to south america what is the regulatory framework going to look like right is it going to always be this stable that's one of the risks you look at evaluate when you enter into new jurisdiction and region can they bridge the cultural language barriers for minors coming out of china right i think these are all problems that will get solved right the president uh is obviously very bitcoin friendly is uh is pushing it very hard and we love seeing that a lot a lot of it is one of those things where only time will tell right one thing to be all uh have massive buying in crypto in bitcoin when bitcoins pushing all-time highs and it's in a bulk market but is your operation or are you be as interested uh when the market's in a very down cycle right which is when you actually should be building investing more capital so time will tell so amidst all of these changes there's also been this new bitcoin mining council tell us what you think the significance that we'll have for the industry yes i talked earlier about the importance of using real data in facts to combat these narratives that are hurting uh the reputation of bitcoin right and the big one they're combating is a lot of the concerns about climate and esg's right uh so yeah i think we yesterday uh this is thursday thursday night uh they had a meeting where they issued uh and they released data and reports that show that bitcoin once again is over i think it's 53 uh carbon or emissions uh so once again the data is on our side right so it's important it's awesome to see that these buyers have banded together right uh to collect data and hard facts to kind of combat these narratives and i think more time as bitcoin gets more credibility maturity and largely on the back of these miners being more transparent disclosing more data so another thing that people have talked about for a while is the financialization of bitcoin mining what does that mean exactly and what new developments are you seeing on that front yeah that's a great topic um so this has been been a tricky puzzle that a lot of people been trying to solve for some time right financialization of bitcoin products is another way of saying how do we make sure that miners can actually hedge their profitability right um right now let's take granite as an example or any other data center that's out there it's very easy to actually hedge your energy costs or your input costs on the electrical side either you're locking in your energy rates along with ppas or you're purchasing your energy source um hedged out for a long period of time so you can lock in your input costs but your output costs are where you're exposed right where your output variables are where your exposed point money we talked about all this entire call there's many variables going to right it's not just bitcoin price it's also what's the difficulty in the network hash rate where's that at so oftentimes people say well why don't you just lock in a bitcoin price well a bitcoin could be more expensive or less expensive to purchase based off of what the network and the hash rate is doing like just uh tonight we're going to see that it's going to be 38 home quote cheaper to mine a bitcoin when a difficulty readjusts difficulties dropping 28 but your revenue goes up 38 right um so being able to find a product in a market for these miners is very very powerful the tricky side of it uh and why it hasn't been proven at scale is that who are the buyers right even though there's obviously a demand from the sellers the bitcoin miners it largely hasn't been a business case or use case for the buyers of these products and once again i think it all circles back into the credibility and maturity of bitcoin right obviously if if markets were efficient there would be buyers here because miners are able to produce bitcoin at such a steep discount uh so how can we actually close this loop and actually make an efficient market where people are there's interest in buying these products so that's kind of one thing that a lot of different people have been trying to solve over the years uh some of it has been in hash rate contracts this and that but often times the buyer gets burned either they're buying it at two steep prices or they're demanding very very large discounts so one thing that we're keeping a very close eye on uh is the financialization of hashrate products all right and so why don't we wrap with um kind of what your predictions are for what will happen to bitcoin mining by the end of the year what will what will it look like in the second half of 2021 man put me on the spot uh so i think i was a little overly eager and already shared several predictions right so i think immersion technology will be more prevalent i think we'll see more projects announced where there will be immersion deployments at scale i also think that hash rate will struggle to get back to its all-time highs earlier this year largely because there's such long lead times for miners to come back online especially when it comes to building new capacity and new infrastructure uh so i think we're gonna not see those all-time highs on the difficulty in the hatchery side i also see that over time uh i'm not sure if it's by the end of this year or not uh you'll see more countries embracing bitcoin mining and more jurisdictions openly welcoming bitcoin wires because as there's more data there's more facts being shared and there's more transparency from groups like archer the founder the mining council and other market participants um business case is going to be undeniable for bitcoin all right and what about the future for foundry oh future for founders so um that's a great question uh we're so busy working every day hard to think about the future um so uh here we offer several different services on the mining side right we we've been a very large financier mining equipment uh i talked before how one of our mandates is breaking up the narrative that china or bitcoin is very centralized right and in doing so we actually financed over 50 of all the latest generation equipment that came into america back in 2020 so a large majority of the s19s and 1030s were financed by foundry we also have deployed our body equipment and made different sites all across north america and we're branching out to other parts of the world to help them get the speed and leverage our expertise and that's also through our advisory business right so we also offer advisory for minors that are new to the space public trade companies large firms that know that there are financial incentives here but they don't have expertise and experience to execute as well as helping chinese miners move out of china because they're not displaced right where can they actually plug into miners what operators and builders are actually credible for them to work with and lock in the contracts even before the sites are built and uh lastly certainly not needs at least is our modding pool right uh part of the decentralization effort that we've been uh very very large proponents of has been our mining pool right mining pool is called foundry usa pool to really emphasize even at its namesake that we are a us-based uh fully compliant mining pool right uh we're leveraging once again our balance sheet and capital uh when times were tough that's when we started building because we knew no one else had the capabilities of doing so so having alternatives outside china been ready beforehand and in place uh was one of the smartest moves we could have made it would continue to do so to help decentralize the network great and where can people learn more about you and foundry yes you can visit our website at foundrydigital.com uh you also check me out on twitter uh i guess i'm a little bit more active than i used to be i had a lot of peer pressure from some of my close friends and colleagues in the space so you can find me at cynocrypto on twitter perfect right well thank you so much for coming on unchained awesome thanks for having me laura thanks so much
