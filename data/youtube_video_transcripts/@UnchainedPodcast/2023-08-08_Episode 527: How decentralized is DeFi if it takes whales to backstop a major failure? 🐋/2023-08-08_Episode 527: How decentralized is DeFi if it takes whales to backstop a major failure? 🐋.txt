obviously there's people that say well this proves like you're saying this proves that defy doesn't work or this proves that there's just a bunch of stuff that has to happen behind the scenes for it to work and first of all uh I think that if the lending systems other than fraxland for example Incorporated more things like fraxland's Innovations like time dependent interest rates and and actually were more autonomous this whole thing would overall just kind of fix itself right it would oscillate to to the right kind of uh market system and a lot of it was just because for example MIM has fixed rate interest rates they have to just actually go in and change interest rates Ave has to vote on them per recommendations of like their I think it's gauntlets uh safety of reports and and these kinds of things
