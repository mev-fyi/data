exchange value in a digitally connected world discover how people are reimagining the world around you on tezos today's guest is house representative tom emmer welcome representative emmer thanks for having me laura you've been quite active in creating crypto legislation how did you get into crypto and blockchain technology well when i first got into congress i'm sure your uh your readers and anybody watching this podcast is going to know just by looking at me that i'm uh you know much younger and into all these new technologies but that's not accurate i i came into congress in that generation that didn't grow up with computers and that generation that didn't have email uh a generation that seems like many lives ago in this country and it's interesting i i had a uh a great young man working for me who's uh into this uh industry and the whole idea of cryptocurrencies uh and landon gave me a book when i first got to congress called the age of cryptocurrency and laura what he learned is when you give me something i read it i read this book i gave it back to lana and i said this thing's amazing and i asked him are you satoshi right he denied that he was satoshi or maybe he said he couldn't admit or deny i can't remember but uh i he told me sadly then that because i looked at this this is the future and the future has arrived i you know government is uh only uh gonna hurt itself if people like me don't get up to speed with what's happening in the financial technology space with cryptocurrencies with blockchain uh uh etc and by the way when i first got involved in this my peers seemed to think blockchain and cryptocurrency were one of the same thing that's how far behind we were right i but that book actually started me down this road and thinking about the fact that uh within the next five years within the next 10 years within the next 20 years what a great space where we can have peer-to-peer transactions that are verifiable in real time right and i i i am safe and secure uh and we don't have to have a middle man uh negotiating these things and then i realized the possibilities for blockchain technology go well beyond how cryptocurrency might utilize it uh and it's just opened up a whole new world for me in terms of how we've got to get a government into a place where it allows for this innovation it allows for this development as opposed to impedes it or instruction yeah i mean i find it amazing that that was your entry point because you have been so active and we're gonna get into this on the show people will realize like you really have um yeah just put forth all different kinds of bills and you have all different kinds of thoughts on many different aspects of crypto the one that prompted me to reach out to you is something that i was fascinated by when uh we saw these corporations recently buying bitcoin and putting it on their balance sheets you recently wrote a letter to the financial accounting standards board or fasb advocating that it established what you called appropriate accounting standards for companies holding digital assets what is the issue that you're trying to solve there and how do you think they should resolve it well the issue is there the financial accounting standard board known in the alphabet soup of washington dc simply as fasb uh fazbe has not issued any definitive guidance on how you should be uh accounting for uh digital assets uh and crypto currencies and that to me is a problem uh you know many uh people or entities on their balance sheet will list uh holdings as intangibles and that just isn't acceptable it impacts the balance sheet because ultimately they have to almost uh under value uh the asset that they have that they're trying to account for uh and in some cases even though this isn't a problem i would say as much as the government needs to get on the ball i if you're under valuing assets then maybe the tax liability is different as well so i think it's a very important what it's very important that fasb actually clarify how we should be accounting for digital assets on the balance sheet so that not only does this trend continue but once you do that you're going to properly value companies you're going to be able to uh frankly encourage more people more entities to get involved in space oh this thank you so much for that answer because it resolves something that i have been wondering um and i did ask michael saylor but he didn't get into the details i did ask if there was any situation in which the fact that uh bitcoin does as you put it have to be undervalued um when they do the accounting if that ever can benefit the company but it sounds like what you're saying from a tax perspective it could um but i guess that's to the government's disadvantage can i just can i just add to that yes it can uh undervalue and at least in the present time perhaps it gives them a tax benefit but the risk is is great in my mind and you've seen some of the other legislation that we've been pushing for or instant safe harbor uh legislation from my uh the irs this would be an example of what happens laura if down the road suddenly there's a clarification and now you have a major tax exposure that you didn't know existed because you didn't get the guidance in the first place so while it might be a benefit today it could actually be a detriment in the future and i think they really need to clean this up from an accounting perspective so that people that are engaged in this uh this area in this industry don't get surprised later yeah and so all this is happening at the same time that michael sue the acting controller of the currency suggested creating an interagency sprint team to look at crypto what is your uh thought about that idea i actually i'm my let's say i am uh encouraged by the fact that he is talking in that in that manner i think uh our last administration you know we've got some great champions uh uh mr giancarlo uh hester pierce uh brian brooks was a uh was a great uh ad for the last administration but there was a lot of uh friction is the word i'd use but it's it's more like tension within the uh the last administration about which way to move and how to move in terms of the bureaucracy the executive branch working with uh uh cryptocurrencies in particular uh in digital assets i it's the the nice thing about uh mr sue's uh testimony because i had a chance to ask him some questions uh last week is that it gives me encouragement that they're looking towards advancing this but now we have to have this across all uh of these different regulators right they all have to have an understanding what they're dealing with what their jurisdiction is because they should be a value add they should not be a wet blanket on this innovation and so let's now talk about some of the other particular bills that you have introduced there was a piece of legislation you introduced or reintroduced to protect protect taxpayers from penalties on some gains or losses they might experience from forked assets so what problem are you trying to solve there and what is how does the bill propose to do that well there's a there's a great example if you look i i think it was uh dogecoin was bought from lucky coin and lucky coin was forged from litecoin the the problem here is that if you or i hold let's say we held litecoin right and the asset forked so now you have litecoin but you also have some lucky coin i as as i understand it you may not even know you have some lucky coin unless you're looking at your wallet every single minute to see what what's changed but guess what you might be taxed on this uh this lucky coin that you didn't ask for and you may not even know you have why because uh well once the assets split now perhaps uh the government's gonna tell you that because you hold both you will tax on both and that this is kind of like an appreciation of the asset that you originally had of litecoin i i don't think that's right in this case uh if laura holds both litecoin and she uh suddenly has a fork uh asset where now she's got lucky coin you weren't asking for that that's not an event that you uh caused to happen that happened to you and i i just don't think it should be another taxable event all right so in a moment we're going to discuss some of the other bills that you have introduced around crypto but first a quick word from the sponsors to make this show possible tazos lets you easily exchange smart money throughout our digital world a self-upgradable blockchain

of 2021. this could have a direct impact on the crypto industry can you tell us a little bit about this bill what it proposes and what problems it could solve yeah so it's very simple it goes back to uh our previous discussion uh with mr sue and his talking about a uh this sprint uh concept i this is a bill as you note that passed out of the house last month and it would require the securities and exchange commission and the cftc to establish a digital asset working group to ensure collaboration between regulators and the private sector that would foster innovation so it kind of goes back to what we had touched down a little bit before the break before your commercial break which was these regulators they should be a value add to the industry to those that are innovating to those that are creating not an a a challenge or a detriment or an obstruction now the problem that we've had is we've got all these different regulators and i think this should go beyond the sec and the cftc i think it should involve for instance the fdic i think it should involve uh all of these different uh potential regulators that touch uh on to currencies uh because what happens is they don't know their jurisdiction or quite frankly you you've got a situation right now where we do not have a clear definition for what constitutes a currency what is a commodity what is a security uh and even though my uh in my past life i practice law i just don't think the idea should be to have the holley test as a full employment opportunity for lawyers out there where we're pouring all kinds of money into lawyers to try and figure out with this test what you fall into let's face it in the beginning uh an investment or an opportunity might actually look like it might start out looking like a security but at some point it's going to turn into a commodity or an asset that is different from a security i we need to start to have these uh these working groups come up with a new framework that is more clear that's flexible that allows for this uh new world that we live in where we not only can have this uh have an appropriate amount of regulation supervision light touch is what we always talk about because we don't need government smothering these opportunities by the way i want to make it clear i don't think government ever will smother these opportunities the problem we have in this country is that we don't do this if we don't do it right and we don't get it done soon all these innovators will go somewhere else they will find a different place to create this next great generation of opportunity and i think it should happen right here in the united states so again this bill that was passed would create this working group with the sec and the cftc i think we should broaden it and i think we should get to a place where government establishes a policy congress establishes a policy that starts to put some guard rails on there so you and all of your listeners uh and the people that watch your podcast can literally say okay here are the rules of the road this is how i get my project started and i'm not going to get surprised later by having five regulators uh crawling up my backside and suddenly have the irs telling me that oh by the way you should have been taxed like this i think those are the biggest challenges right now that we need to address as congress so something interesting that you said there was that sometimes tokens might initially be issued as securities but later turn into commodities but actually also you did introduce a bipartisan bill last fall the securities clarity act and in that um it advocates that digital tokens be clarified as commodities and not securities and it even in the um i think it was the press release or something it even made the assertion that digital tokens issued and securities offerings quote are in fact and all and always were commodities can you tell us a little bit more what you meant by that well i will i'll tell you first the i love this uh securities clarity act because it's a technology neutral bill that clarifies that an investment contract asset like a digital token that you just referenced is a separate and distinct it is separate and distinct from a securities offering that it might have been part of i an investment contract asset is any asset sold as the object of the investment contract there just is an unreasonable level of uncertainty with the way federal securities laws are applied to these transactions when we talk about the sale of blockchain based tokens uh in the lack of clarity is frankly hurting american innovation from my perspective i the idea is that token developers need a clear framework for determining if their asset is a security or not and it goes back to what we were just talking about right so who's going to regulate you what uh regulations do you need to be cognizant of and follow this bill would provide that clarity by amending the securities law to make it clear that a digital token is separate and distinct from any securities offering it might have been part of which has huge ramifications when it comes to someone who's working uh developing projects with these tokens so i uh again i it's if there's too much overlap laura and let's face it the securities laws from the 1930s never contemplated digital assets like we're dealing with today and as a uh as a lawyer i'm just not a big fan of the howie test i understand our courts are trying to make it work but you're taking a test that was created for a completely different type of investment vehicle with uh with a different language and you're trying to superimpose that onto this 21st century uh world that we're now in i think it makes more sense that we start to clarify because you're going to have these hybrids and it's all about control and expectation right if i if i control it if i expect a profit off of it there's so many different things that we need to look at and if we don't provide clarity uh in congress if we don't start to do that i i'm gonna tell you uh it's already started to happen i talked to someone yesterday who is well known in this this area who started a i think it's a a 1.4 billion dollar uh project that is based in the british virgin islands because they just couldn't get the answers that they needed here in the in this country we can't afford to have that happen we've got to have those projects those great opportunities happen right here in the united states you're also interested in defy and you said in an interview with the block last fall that at that time it was too early to talk about policy for defy but at the moment it looks like the fat f may soon be issuing guidance that would classify many d5 protocol developers and other d5 builders as vasps or virtual asset service providers which would subject them to all different kinds of regulation what do you think of that and how do you think defy should be regulated at this point well as you and your listeners probably can gather from my earlier comments i you're not going to be surprised to know that i do not like what that is proposing or what they're doing i think it's uh i think it's the wrong approach i the proposed rule from my perspective is an attempt to challenge d5 uh because defy happens peer-to-peer it's not clear who uh the money transmitter is and uh quite frankly if i just boil this all down into a statement i'm very concerned this is our government's uh need because the government needs to see everything the government needs to be part of everything this is a an attempt the fat of which i believe the comment period for the industry ends later next month uh towards the end of june uh so if anybody out there uh wants to make comments on this i encourage them to do that you've got a little time left i mean this is truly i believe governments uh intent on identifying people in this environment and then tracking what they're doing i this is uh i i think it's the wrong it's the wrong move laura and we're going to keep pushing against it by by the way laura by the way we we already have a bill we already have a bill by the way that pushes against it the blockchain regulatory certainty act and i probably should have mentioned i mean that that act affirms that blockchain developers and service providers that never uh custody consumer funds don't have to register as money transmitters uh in 50 different states so i think by the way we should also i i've got a bill that says that uh when you don't custody funds at all uh we need to have a federal rule that uh it'll help the industry dramatically if they don't have to try and get licensed as a money transmitter in all these different jurisdictions so anyway i really appreciate your interest in this and love talking to you about it yeah well it's just out of curiosity out of all the different bills that you've introduced which one do you think is furthest along or has the greatest chance of being adopted well listen the uh the safe harbor for forked assets the securities clarity act these all of these as far as the people that have leaned in and anybody wants to know the the members of congress who are truly interested in this area take a look at our blockchain caucus uh you've got republicans and democrats alike who are learning more and more every day about what we need to do obviously our office has been heavily involved in this since i got to congress but the problem we're having right now on the house side is that the the leadership of the financial services committee quite frankly is way too suspicious of cryptocurrency and has not done the uh the due diligence to understand what a great opportunity this is to give people access to banking services to financial services that they've never had access to before to streamline the process so so people again the unbanked can actually be banked i mean this has the potential of creating opportunity for all different americans that the haves and the have-nots to be able to participate in our financial system like they've never participated before and again unfortunately when you ask me how far along these are i we've got a lot of support within the committee but i'm afraid that the leadership of the committee is just not prepared as it exists right now to move these innovations forward at the congressional level but we're going to keep pushing uh uh ms waters uh brad sherman some of these other uh deniers i'll call them uh we're gonna keep pushing them to explain this these uh cryptocurrencies and the technology that we're talking about actually empowers your constituents and gives them opportunities that they haven't had in the past and i think once that gets through we'll even bring these naysayers you know the the suspicious ones over the cynical ones but certainly i would say by next congress you're going to see this stuff start to move i think the financial uh technology task force will become an actual subcommittee in the 118th congress and all the work was done in the 115th 116th and now 117th this education is picked up uh even faster so i i wouldn't get your hopes up too much about any of these becoming law in the next six months but there's a chance that something could happen before the end of this congress and i'm very confident that when we get to the next congress so probably about 17 months from now you're going to start to see some of these bills move and become law because again i think the common interest between uh if bridges political uh the political divide is we want the innovation and the innovators here in this country creating opportunities not only for themselves but for uh americans and others around the world it needs it needs to happen here where it started great well thank you so much for coming on the show it's been really enlightening talking with you and i hope to have you back on again in the future i'll look forward to it i'll look forward to meeting in person don't forget next up is the weekly news recap stick around for this week in crypto after this short break did you know nearly 338
