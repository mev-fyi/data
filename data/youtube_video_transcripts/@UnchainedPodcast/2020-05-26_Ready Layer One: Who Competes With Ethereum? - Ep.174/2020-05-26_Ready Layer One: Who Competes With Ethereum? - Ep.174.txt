Paula suka of near protocol Zac Iranian of cosmos Robert hopper Meir of poccadot and Arthur Brightman of Tasos we discuss how these layer 1 chains plan to take on aetherium not just with features but in terms of attracting developers and users plus we get into a big discussion over whether or not Bitcoin and aetherium are direct competitors it was a lively fun discussion and I definitely notice

dot-com app today [Music] welcome everyone to our panel where we've got a number of founders of layer one protocols which I believe a year ago maybe we were calling them aetherium killers but anyway why don't we just each have have each of you just go around and say what it is that you're working on and where you're sheltering in place from hi I'm ducky sheltering in place in Palo Alto working on cosmos I'm just working on watching IBC right now hi my name is Rob I worked on polka dot which is a heterogeneous charting platform I am hunkering down in the DMV in the DC area hey everyone Amelia co-founder at near working on pretty much we just release main net and like stage one and then kind of gray to decentralize it over this months and beyond actually in Shanghai in China hi my name is Arthur Brightman I'm a co-founder of today those chains meet my for a bit over almost almost two years now and I'm sheltering in place in Singapore great well thank you all for joining so I actually wanted then all of us to also just give everybody kind of an overview of what did it like why we you know brought you all together so why don't you each now just say what it is that your protocol does and kind of we're in the stage of delft development you're at cool so cosmos cosmos is a software stack for building your own blockchain and so the cosmos hub and a number of other block chains like the finance Dex chain iris net cava tera all been live on the software stack for about a year but sort of the two pieces of this sort of item sort of vision of cosmos one piece was this idea of you know build your own blockchain you know anyway everyone can have their own sort of customized community driven layer one and then this second piece was interoperating those blockchains so in the year since we launched since a bunch of these networks started to launch we've been working on this interoperability framework called IBC and right now we're in the midst of game of zones which is the sort of incentivized test net sort of inspired by game of stakes which was sort of the original incentivized test mat that were sort of putting IBC through its paces expecting to launch IBC on the Cosmo sub later at the Sun robbery yeah so i-i've you that there's there's a design space of blockchain scalability so what polka dot does is it it occupies a space a point in this design space that's in between something like homogeneous charting where you have a bunch of different shards that all execute the same kind of smart contracts and things and in between something like cosmos where you have a bunch of different block chains that I'll talk to each other each of this block chains has to be fully sovereign so there are trade-offs to both sides of that design space so we try to occupy a middle ground where those shards are heterogeneous we have a bunch of different shards we split up the work between a bunch of different block chains the draw security from the same source but those block chains are specialized to specific tasks they don't have to bring their own balances they don't have to bring their own validator sets things like that so as any engineer knows the closer you can specialize to a specific task the better your solution is going to be more general solutions or less efficient so that's our notion of Perak chain so we also embody this notion of build your own block chain bring your own block chain we built a a toolkit called substrate which is for building your own block chains writing the what we call the runtime the logic of your block chain and web assembly in rust code and everything else is sort of taken care of we eat our own dog food in the sense that we've written polka-dot using substrate as well so we've launched the Kusama network which is it's essentially polka dot but it isn't polka dot so it's a incentivized real value bearing now work for sort of putting through our our theses through through the through the hoops and we're working on deploying the initial implementations of pair of chains over the next few months Illya I know you also have some news yeah so as Rob mentioned there's kind of a a spectrum so we're on the other side of spectrum from cosmos where we see the world as kind of developers might want specialized solutions but in very rare cases and instead they kind of want speed and ability to go to market if they actually business building a business faster hence like we actually we think of near as developer platform really targeting kind of people building applications and not needing to think how infrastructure granese works right kind of same motors that like kW has been able to build a huge business around at the same time like to actually be able to serve those developers you do need a scalable platform you do need to solve a lot of current technical challenges so that's what kind of infrastructures that we were building this new protocol is is a Charlotte protocol it transmitted assembly it kind of provides all those tooling around it and yet like yesterday as we mentioned and so when his opening talks we just kind of opened up our main net it is a proof of authority right now but the goal like the point is that it allows people to start building applications and actually getting initial users and then throughout like May and June we're going to be decentralizing bringing more validators on board and over time kind of releasing it to the community all right there I think if you think of C's networks on platforms earliest technology you're you're missing the the forest for the trees what these things are primarily is they are communities they are the closest thing to them our policies they are essentially political organization and a backbone of that usually use a blockchain it's a good way to do it it's just one way and well we're trying to do is to those is ensures that this you know you can you can preserve that community you can preserve that network while being somewhat agnostic to the technology and the way you can do that is by having technology which can evolve so if you're looking purely yes you know obviously software and development are very important you cannot go anywhere if you don't have engineering if you don't have good software but I would say that it's you know it's not the end it's not the end goal these things are not operating systems they are fundamentally political entities and web potatoes does it's essentially trying to really tackle on that ID directly by introducing means of control by by the community of the platform and how it evolves and so Taylor's has been you know it's been in the testing it for many years now it was in a in a minute for almost two years and it's already been she was three she protocol upgrades there are there proposals for a force one coming and so you can't define it as a piece of technology itself because the technology can change and so you know anything we can discuss in terms of like charting in terms of like into probability all of these fundamentally these are technologies but they're not they're not communities and I think that's a focus specifically those yeah well let's talk a little bit more about that because um you know I kind of made that joke at the beginning about the etherium killers which is sort of like this just catch-all phrase that was used for a lot of protocols that are sort of working in the same area that all of you are but I'm sure you know even just like listening to each of you describe what you're working on obviously there's a lot more nuance and yet at the same time we are in this reality we're kind of like the most used blockchain in this space is aetherium so it was curious to know how you differentiate yourself from aetherium you know what problems you believe still need to be solved in the space and what you guys are working on and anybody can start we I I know we've been going in this little clock white circle but it can go in any direction I'm happy to start you know it was a what I think I was reading about near which they said was was completely on point and I don't know how how relevant it is today but it was a statement saying like look we've been working on sharding and like having this like super high scalability and then we realize hey is there's no point in building like it's like building this giant building in a desert you know and so I would say by and large you know it might seem if you're like really looking very closely at this is like oh you know everyone's using ethereum but I would say no one born is using a theory I'm like okay like you have supplications most of them are going to be around around lending and and there's not you know and and so you might be tempted to think like oh well you know this thing have not been adopted but I take the view and it's not a very it's a views very popular in the Bitcoin circle but I think that if you if you if you have too much of a platform and technology mindset you might miss that but I think the views that merely merely holding the token is using it if you're thinking in terms of censorship resistance resistance store of values which are problem tell you what what these things are and you you can try to think of the miscast as much as you want this is not the reality that we are today not in not in not in theory of not in Bitcoin on any network yeah I think like one thing I would do when I mentioned like I don't think etherium is even close to like most used blockchain and like I would want to have some data but I think it goes get and then a bunch of other protocols that kind of like  like use get used by you know millions of developers so get is actually using it maintains a data structure which is pretty much blockchain it has like caching go ahead yeah so and and so in in general like and then if we go cryptocurrencies right we have Bitcoin in in the smart cart like in this space where you guys are playing that's what I meant like obviously Bitcoin is yeah but anyway so keep going well I think I think it's important to remember how far we are from like to use stuff that that's I think like like I think electric actually has a very good report which like is actually tracked down also like developers buildings of space and it's like like laughable numbers right it's like 10,000 actual active developers in NZ like whole like smart contract space right I just wanted to say I did an interview with Maria who wrote that report from electric capital so but anyway keep going yeah I'm just saying like like 10,000 developers was like you know first few weeks of Google releasing the framework right that that's kind of the that's kind of the difference of magnitudes so I think definitely understanding how can we bring more developers and and like people and and actually users because definitely agrees that like if we have developed like two developers to come here we need people to use the stuff right they need to have value I need to see value why is it really isn't this so alia can I just ask you a little bit more about your approach was nearer because so obviously you announce your new funding yesterday congratulations oh and that's the news I was referring to it was 21 million and you also launched your proof of its already main net and you know just I think you would agree with me like proof of Authority seems really appropriate for enterprise blockchain where you know kind of the validators are known there's a very limited number of them and so I just wondered like is this your way of kind of targeting a different audience from the audience that like a more public walking like aetherium is targeting no I mean the plan is to like start onboarding more and more validators pretty much like within two months so we have we actually have 40 or validators running right now on one of our test nets across the world which you know actually is more decentralized to some other public plug chains right now but yeah so the idea of as POA is really just give the developers a platform to start deploying while we're still testing everything and kind of in a way pipeline like still validating that you know decentralisation everything works like the networking issues all things and exactly can tell how really hard this problem sar and how long it takes to like debug all this at the same time already start providing a platform for developers to actually build applications and like we have few developers kind of who already have an application and actually serving users right now from test net and we really wanted to give them platforms that actually like will maintain state going forward all right well so to continue what I was asking about before just about you know whether or not you guys are thinking about how you're thinking about aetherium kind of as you're you know working on your protocols and figuring out which audiences you're targeting or which problems you want to solve or things like that and I guess like in a way Robert and lucky you guys you're really working in a slightly different way where you're just trying to kind of bring a bunch of different types of you know whether it's different block chains or I guess for Robert with with shards like you know how are you thinking about what you're doing knowing that like etherium at the moment at least in this particular space is leading well as the as the others have said like they're they're leaving a developer community which is small relative to the amount of momentum that we want the space to gather in the future and III would like to clarify that the concept of heterogeneous charting is very very fundamentally different from homogeneous charting because you're bringing in a capability of optimization and specialization that you cannot have with homogeneous charting but I mean without a representative of aetherium here I don't feel too comfortable speaking a lot about aetherium so like maybe I'll speak a little bit more generally like how we look at a developer ecosystem and developer growth I mean this is one of the reasons that we've historically and we continue to lead the charge into technologies such as Russ like bringing rust into the blockchain space and bringing webassembly into the blockchain space that these especially with webassembly when you have the ability for developers to target webassembly you're talking about a system of technologies where we don't have to read invent the wheel and you've got the strength of the millions strong developer community huge open-source bodies behind it all the browser vendors behind it for things like form of verification good developer tools and for people to write blockchain software in languages that they're familiar with and I think this is key right that you don't have to learn an entirely new language and rather you can maintain your comfort when moving into a new blockchain space as a software developer who hasn't previously been exposed to those things so I guess the way I mostly think about the blockchain space and what we're trying to do with cosmos is I guess the question so where a theorem has been successful is it has been an incredibly successful sandbox for building sort of early financial primitives and onboarding assets and you know indeed and having some sort of baseline of economic activity on those assets the question is really is these right sort of the theory of maximal strategy is is the way I think about it is is it's a point of view that's basically like well we can take these successful experiments organically grow this ecosystem sort of glue on scalability solutions as as they're needed and essentially sort of organically evolve into a sort of global sort of a global financial sort of ecosystem I guess the the cosmos point of view is is that we're sort of missing some primitives there and the primitive that we're missing is basically this you know sovereign interoperability primitive and sort of not having that primitive means that like you can that these sort of nascent experiments will never be able to grow into sort of large scale platforms and you know we've had some early signs that there's like general enthusiasm for this you know there isn't we don't really sell the cosmos platform really that hard but we've seen sort of a number of other entities sort of either adopt the platform wholesale or basically adopt the philosophy and concepts of this of the platform in in what they've built and that sort of seems like the the indication that we're sort of moving in the right direction by introducing this new primitive end of the blockchain space which is to a certain extent a very that that that's sort of like our governing philosophy I recognise as you guys have all been saying it's super early and the number of developers that are working in the blockchain spaces is still very small globally and yet at the same time you know I think we could say about aetherium that at least they do have sort of a network effect and some of you did allude to this you know right now obviously defy on etherium I would say you know has a certain network effect at the moment there's about 400 million dollars worth of eath locked in defy on etherium so just like in terms of attracting developers you know if if this theory that has been talked about for quite a while in the blockchain space is true that you know cryptocurrencies and blocky networks really are about building network effects then how do you plan to attract developers to your ecosystems there's actually an interesting point that like public blog chains in comparison to something like Libra is actually allowed to link to other blog chains right and that's what as I keep working with ABC but there's like various ways to connect which means network effects actually like and bringing people into psycho system kind of benefits everyone obviously would like it we need tooling and we need like kind of better connectivity and that's for example we working on a bridge which is somewhat similar design to IBC that links to helium and like allows you to build applications that just use kind of existing liquidity existing LEGO pieces from a stadium on other platforms and I know like polka dot is doing the same so in general I think like there is a network effects and there's people who are kind of professionally like building solidity contracts now and are excited about the space but I don't think like at this point there is like we see that this idiom way of like specifically building on this on this specific technology right is is winning and I gave as R Seck here it's more about like like there's a community of people who are building this financial primitives and excited about the new way of building kind of FinTech companies and they will be looking for kind of what is the best pieces of technology they can pull together to build a better experience for users right and I mean even so what happened on like March 12th right the kind of spike in gas prices by can usage pretty much rendered a lot of applications unusable or like the sounds of developers end up paying huge amounts and fees right because the theorem just couldn't like scale to this kind of very extreme capacity issue so like there's definitely need for kind of different solutions and and I think like even this existing cohort of people who are here will be like extending and I think like jaws apart is to just bring more people who are excited about syntax and see that kind of this approaches and those technologies actually will allow them to get faster to the market and Arthur actually does that apply to you that you can kind of interoperate with aetherium in some ways to take advantage of the developer activity they have their I I see how it applies to some of the other blockchain so and I wasn't sure about ASOS I mean you know this doesn't have any way of what it is so it's easier active to developers or it's not and the only means that I have to I have ever said you were to make those attractive to people is going on podcast and explaining why it's a great box chain so you know that's pretty much what I can do for it but I just think is very attractive I think the the the spirits and the idea of it is as you can have a chain which is in some sense autonomous it has internally mechanisms that can make its current over and over and over and the idea of knowing that you can bid on a platform and know that it's going to keep current it's not just going to be displaced by something else which is going to be faster or more scalable it's always always the idea of having the means technologically speaking to always be at the forefront or closer to forefront is I think pretty compelling but in general I think that you know if you want developers a bit thing is to have good deal of tools that's that's what you know I'm top of a good platform you want to have easy-to-use could developer tools and that's that's that's probably thing but I would say also you know if if you're not you know if you're not an incumbent and much of the ER which was a network effect of a theorem I don't think it comes from the fact that they have existing it's not so much that there's like what is built I think it mostly comes from the fact that they're an incumbent and you know we're in a space where which is mostly winner-take-all and so in comments have a huge advantage so bitcoin is a huge advantage of aetherium because they are direct competitors and in serum has a huge advantage over the other platform just because it was there earlier and it's been there for longer and it does nothing it has nothing to do with I think the network effect evaporates and if built it's more of a mind share type of network effects that idea I'm referring to and I think the way that you can the way that you can deal with that is by being very focused and by having a really good understanding of what it is that your technology do what it is that you're building and that that makes you at least you avoid a lot of dead ends if you understand pre-start you know if you really understand your product and I think very few people in this space understand what it is that they're what is it you're building like they know how to build it she's the one person with your building yeah I mean I think I'm just translating that as yours you know it's sort of saying that basically everybody should have a vision and and you know kind of keep that in mind while they're building but I was curious to know like you know with Tasos what are people voting on you know I kind of took a look and it looks like it's all stuff kind of really focused on the protocol and you know it doesn't seem like there's anything controversial happening but I didn't know like aside from that like what else are people doing with with Tasos so there was actually some Z controversial in in a balloon upgrade and even in essence there were some discussions over say yeah I really upgrade so that I think that's that's fairly important and you also have to say that because there is you know because there is mechanism it's you know you don't have you should think of the voting mechanism on a chain now that the decision procedure but as a ratification procedure in some sense you have some you have some governance that essentially happens of chain but then you present it and you ratify and basic you know and basically I think it avoids a lot of the a lot of the scenario which you might have as wise where people might push for you know controversial IDs to up so hard Forks because they know that they're not gonna get to votes and so you don't necessarily observe it but I think it has an effect an important effect on now yeah on the network you know I think they're using it as cryptocurrency and fundamentally I think if you're building a platform and you're not singing and you think you're building a better forum for application and if you're not building a cryptocurrency I think you know understanding what you're building if you're not if you don't sing that a CRM is Derek a competitor of Bitcoin I say I think you don't understand this area if you don't think it's already saying things that's they are all little all direct competitors and the fact that you can build application is great if you can have applications you know because cryptocurrencies are know they're good for a few things they're interesting is they store you know is the Cossacks come and try you know and take everyone's money and change anyone from remove shells then you can keep your cryptocurrency and that's and that's great that's you skip number one excuse ever to you want to make a lot of cruise water payment between machines all over the internet it's completely infeasible to use one of the

competitors because I don't see it that way at all well what I think a lot about is so what we have platform technologies and each of us have like different platform technologies but it is somewhat like the search for comparative advantage for a token is also is also sort of somewhat like it's like a it's like a different like technology like social and technological progression to the like platform evolution like they're coupled because the the token exists within the platform technology but you have the search for comparative advantage and comparative advantage is not zero-sum but like there is a relatively narrow space in which to search for that comparative advantage right now and that that does sort of render all of our tokens that like into in something of a like a competitive space well it's it's competitive but it's not zero-sum at least at the moment because there's a lot of room for growth so like I think that's a very important distinction to make is that like what one protocol gains is not necessarily the loss of another protocol I mean once you've saturated the market yes I think that this would be the case but at this point we're looking for differentiators that will just expose us to broader and broader markets and bring more people into the space I think good framework is that take like tokens and and especially like more into your policy is in some way a central bank of this like country of you know people and users and developers and everyone who's using this system right and like in some way obviously you know every country wants to take over the world but at the same time you know we are like we actually have countries coexisting to some extent and and and and the central banks have a very different properties around like what is their economics is based on right like you know if you look at sounds like Russia for example a lot of its economy is based on oil versus you know I'm not gonna talk about us but like in general right the way the economics of this general banks operates can be very different and while like at the same time it is money and you know it is like it is what people use for like day-to-day operations so I think like it's important to remember that like yes in in like underlying way kind of when I agree with Rob and you like saturate the market it will become like somewhat more of a competition but at the same time like the economics can't be based on very different kind of components and and like utilities that it provides I do want to mention though that like on the governance side just to put one thought I actually don't believe there's a context there will be contentious hard Forks in proof of stake systems at all because in proof of stake like improve of work the decision of you know switching to a new protocol is like on miners but everybody else needs to accept it right like everybody else needs to also change the binary like because miners can you know shift and keep and like start mining different chain but if I'm running my node I can start mining the old chain right so there can be like natural Forks and like mining power improve steak especially BFT where we prefer liveness you kind of need 66% to switch or you need both to be like contentious hard Forks right so you cannot keep the chain that like no changes chain anymore because there's like you don't have a like budget like super majority to produce blocks in the first place even if like more than 33% left so it's actually like and and the kind of somewhat bad part about this is actually if there is something like this happens and both chains modifies their state to produce new like Forks then the choice is actually not at people's hands but it exchanges hands because the people could side what which one to value and which one has steak is like you know whoever whoever values it and whoever puts a price on it which right now are exchanges and centralized exchanges for the most part so there's a lot of there's a lot of like mechanics as we need to be aware of here I don't think that miners decided on Forks in in proof of work because miners are you know miners have to expend in extra CT in order to to mine and so they're gonna follow Marcus and Marcus gonna follow basically social consensus so it's you know it's a bit of a circle where everyone is trying to pre-commit very hard to one branch of the fork but it's hard to create you know it's hard to make credible commitments where there's so much on the line it's kind of a giant game of chicken between you know users maybe exchanges miners and you get an outcome which basically you end up with rooms having like massive messy leverage just because it's just so entangled and you have this crazy game of chicken and that's I think the beauty of having option governance is that you bypass this saying I also say that even if you have you know even if you have VFT like testicle BFT for for doing it consensus you're still you can still have contentious hard forests because you will have that leaders who just decided to go on post ranch and it's you know they can't be slashed you know it's easy to modify slightly the code in one wrench to make sure they're not going to be slashed from one to the other and so it'll just a signpost I think it depends on the mentality of the validators if you have values which are convinced that yes it's important to maintain the integrity of the network it's fine but if they you know if they are of the school of thought oh you know we're just building technology platforms or Suffocation's then you know in other words they don't get it then yes it's gonna be yeah they're gonna be on multiple platforms yeah I would just add to that that if we just look at history with what happened with etherium classic there were some really small number of miners maybe like one or two or something that kept the old chain going originally but etherion classic didn't really exist until the exchanges started offering it offering trading on it so you know it really was a situation where the changes are Sheila and the exchanges themselves would say it was the users who led because they were demanding trading in it so you know just from that one example I I don't know if I would say miners were the ones who decided but when think I just wanted to ask was it I don't remember who it was you know I just wanted to mention like when I said - I said miners can not though they are dry but like in general if there was no miners right there will not be seen in classic like somebody actually mined in proof of steak like if I decide you know to fork off at tells us right now like it's not you know it's not like I will not be able to like produce blocks period like or it will be producing blocks in the state and that is a contentious hard fork like that's a definition of contentious hard fork tweaking the state so like like that's why I'm saying there's no zero choice there's always like like whatever kind of whatever's the super majority wants or or or nothing there's no like kind of splitting into like but the contentious contentious like options and the problem oftentimes the problem is not as you have a fork and there's you know any serum classic or a beacon cash or something like that because these are generally very small the problem is that the one that becomes the nautical becomes canonical for the wrong reasons and so you know the problem is a forest is that what it's not that oh you're gonna have to branch because one branch is almost always been clearly going to be the canonical branch the problem is you know the function they decide which branch is canonical okay yeah I owe is actually did you want to add on this I mean this is interesting well all I wanted to say is I think that like a big part of the design of I think you know so polka dot cosmos and tezo's at very least are people who are like I've been designed by people who are had were like around for the blockchain Wars of 2015 2016 2017 and so they are informed by like the political process that and you know cosmos you know a year into its life is just kind of starting to experience a world where we actually have like real real politics on chain and there are there are real Protocol governance questions and these these things are so we're like very early in the maturity process of that stuff and so our experience with this sort of like political systems are like our experience with the limitations of the technology platform and how that affected the politics inform these like design decisions but they didn't which we are still yet to know how they play out it isn't until you really stress the system and still there is like tension and contention and like disagreement that we really know any of this stuff and how or how our design decisions have played out but like that's like that is where you kind of kind of the rubber meets the road on these protocols is is like is how they're going to process all of these political changes and like how a polity and how like natural community forms so we're still like very early days and these things but I think that would just generally be like I think something that people kind of miss in the like this technology is better than that technology we're trying to operate at this like intersection of like developer onboarding community and politics on top of the technology platform and it's only the combination of all those things that eventually becomes like a significant player not any individual aspect being better or worse yeah that's actually I feel like maybe what Arthur was saying in the beginning but I find it interesting because I do agree with you that it does seem like those tensions from those years have really informed the different design choices that you guys have made but what's interesting and I didn't realize it's actually literally until we were here talking the meaning like before when when we were figuring out who would be in the panel I didn't think of this but it does feel like an Arthur correct me if I'm wrong it does feel like and actually I think even in this conversation you've you've already had like a slightly different vision was were you the one who said that this is like a winner-take-all space and then the others were like no it's not was that you who said that or who said that no I I did say that but III agree with Robert said you know just because it's winner take all those it means that now it's that is negative seven now I don't think it's negative something now because in the world of program you know most herbs are competing against each other's it computers against anyone giving a and clearly blockage today you know they're not startups but they compete for something and right now that competes again anyone's giving a and not really against each other what I find very sad is that I think that the economic insight behind maximum is correct and some people use it correct economic insight as an excuse to you know not only be dicks on the internet but like you know outright called for state violence and I find that absolutely despicable but the economic insight is correct I think it's way down the line and IIIi just think it's better to man to maintain a uh a collaborative environment you know and see and see who makes it out alive rather than president right you are to tear each other to pieces like that early in the game we revisit in ten years okay not now so I'm curious to know like Robert lucky and Ilya so because you guys had this like slightly different vision that you guys were talking about sewed do you agree with her or through that someday down the line it will become winner-take-all or do you just fundamentally foresee a totally different future where you know it's kind of like more this interoperable world that that you guys are trying to build I think that's that's in many ways just the the nature of things that things follow power law distributions and that when you start to run out of resources competition is inherent and you can see that in many different ways and places in the world I don't think that this is going to be any exception but like the road that we have out before us is one that has a long way to go before I think we reached that point of exhausted researchers and fervent competition at the end of the day though blockchain protocols need to provide value for the token and we're gonna provide security like these things are built off of incentive loops where new issuance Brooke you know has to be based off of demand that drives security so if there's no demand or if there's more demand for it platform them down the line if there's a limited amount of possible demand then you can't secure all of the platforms or some of them may grow largely more powerful than others but as Arthur says I think that this is really why you know I'd like to strike the point that things are not settled right now like the best directions to go in are unclear and then it's really a time for experimentation it's for projects to do something different from each other it's one of the reasons that we also are using launching governance and our protocol because we think that one sometimes the I mean the alternative seems to be as we've seen from history oftentimes just no governance that nothing happens and you get caught in kind of obfuscated power structures and your systems don't adapt as they should so a formalized system of government allows the system to adapt bring in new technology but also allows people to just fundamentally put their money where their mouth is and if they want to back a position with a certain amount of conviction they can spend money and they can spend time in order to back that position and well whichever the community decides is the way that it's going to go so my general thought here is that there I expect there to be fundamental trade-offs in in like sort of what tokens can be good at I think they're going to be like sort of politics and governance will will imply that like not everything is for everyone and so you know if you are if a token is sort of pursuing this like monitor like base way or monetary vision it's likely to be like a sort of politics list protocol and sort of optimize for that you know there's a you know I think all of us are serving definitely building systems that are more sort of specific and will tend to end up with like unique characteristics and so I just I'm more skeptical than in the blockchain space that you'll follow the sort of standard technology industry power law distribution because of sort of scalability constraints about communities and and sort of standard practices and around like how your blockchain actually works so more skeptical of anything truly achieving like sort of like a winner-take-all space and Ilya you got cut off earlier what were you gonna say yeah I'm actually was robbed I I do think like it'll follow up our law and like following my example with countries and central banks like you know we do have few super powers that kind of controlling the world in many ways and then there's you know a few other like sub kind of followers in a way I do else like on the other side of this like this face is evolving so fast and like even last two years like we learned a lot kind of new things there's new cryptography coming out there's all kind of things happening all the time so it's both not the time nor it's unclear that like what we think right now is the right way will be right way you know in in a few years right like it may be you know we all switch to zero knowledge proof and we don't need a chain right we all just exchange it or no it's Bruce offline or like p2p right like there's like so many like possible author can if I turn this and I think like us exploring the space and like figuring out what works right now and how we like get it to people is important but also like looking forward to new technologies it's definitely something and like it may reshape completely how we think like this will be evolving right I mean same was like before Bitcoin nobody could imagine this kind of thing like there's a possibility that there will be some new like kind of evolution that will completely change how we look at this so we should be like open-minded about that at the same time like I'm agreeing like we should be evolving and yeah like our planets can continue both working as well as like continue evolving the protocol and like both feeding it closer to like what developers needs what users need and like bring in new technology so like I do think governance is very important I don't think that token holder like director and holder voting is the best way to do it and I don't think we have a ways right now to kind of organize it at the same time like I do think in improves take right now validators are kind of at power one or another like the other people who run in code and they are defining what blocks are produced so like pretty much building from there and kind of evolving that into like operational governance is crucial and I think I mean like I'm here in many ways following Zacky and who is cosmos and like what they have done already just because like like they kind of gave power to validators and like kind of delegate errs to voting and then pretty much like given they are - pretty much producing blocks and signing signing it and writing hardware is like like a reasonable way to to start from but I do think we need to bring more people who were actually like would be introducing our other side services like different like non protocol developers kind of community leaders and in like other other like financial institutions as well to kind of manage how is this going forward well that's actually yeah that's kind of where I want to go next or depending on the time this is probably where we'll leave off but basically like you know if if we're saying like it's so early in the space that we just need to get more people in you know how are you doing that like you know you guys did talk a little bit about the technological things that you think will your technical features that will interest different developers and stuff but like also there are the community aspects and everything so like just in a holistic sense like you know what are all the different things that you're thinking of doing to bring more people in and to get people to use your networks and and to just get into cryptocurrency hopefully this is one not one of those questions where nobody has a plan so I that baby bombing and what Sachi was saying and I said you know exactly where say if you want to be something akin to the money it shouldn't be political and I agree with that but I also think that you know the protocols themselves shouldn't go the best way not to be political is to basically have very strong norms against never changing anything but then you give up on innovation and so I think right now if you look at these cryptocurrencies not quite money is they're pretty money and as such they are political project it doesn't mean they have to be internally political but you have to understand them as political projects and I think embracing that is a is a way of growing is a way of growing communities because you know that's it's accepting the nature of the beast but but how do you bring that message to people out like how do you get people outside of crypto to take an interest in that like like what you just said just seems very kind of internal like not something where like like what would be your message to somebody who's not in the crypto space to be like hey come check this out so my point of view is on this is I think the next sort of interesting big steps for cosmos is you know the atom community is a very cryptic immunity but I think that we have participants in the cosmos ecosystem whether you have like the Agora folks who are you know very native to like the mainstream Java community they've been part of the sort of JavaScript standards worked in distributed like mainstream distributed computing world for you know 30 40 years is there a community that's going to be founded that's sort of more based in that world you have people like region who are sort of based and sort of like the environmentalism sort of sort of ecological transformation movement so all right in many ways I think the way that you get mainstream people to care about blockchains and the way cosmos hopes onboard those people is the ability to sort of sort of go and like land sort of social coordination mechanisms that are native to those community is it sort of and then bring them and connect them to some of the more crypto native communities inside of the cosmos yeah I think it's actually there's a trend that's happening in the real world which is communities wanting to have more control and moving away or like trying to kind of build that control outside of this big distribution platforms like Facebook reddit cetera right and like hiker noon is a good example right they moved away from medium so they have more control over their platform over its our users of a zoomit ization etc and this technology like as part of it provides kind of a substrate for for sounds is like how to build a community how to bootstrap it how to align incentives and create new economies around this so I think that's like an interesting perspective that's the one which with Alec mentioned yesterday was around just like kind of controllers a liability right we have this huge platforms that now pretty much becoming like they need to like em like exercise control over and censorship over their own product and kind of sometimes tensors and governments and like for them like something that actually decentralizes control and and like in the way removes the need or brings it back to the communities to the kind of more local governance provides a new way of doing it right but like I think at the end what we do need to do is like stop you know talking about like how can everybody use blockchain it like I do agree that like it's all it's about money in politics in underlying way but at the same time like most people don't really care most people like when they use an application right they don't think this is like a sequel application right or a you know like they just use application like they don't care so it's the same like they don't think the dollar is you know gold backed or not gold back they just want to use a dollar buy some something with it and we need to get to that point where like like people actually just use this for the function and kind of start operating on that level and like I'm like I'm merging from Ukraine our economic economy sucks we like every crisis that hit us hits like Ukraine twice three times more and like I'm actually very scared of what's gonna happen given what's happening with us right now and like there's a huge opportunity for like this technology and especially money as like a way for people to you know shelters their savings and you know actually like hold up pins are like economic turmoil the problem is the kind of stuff is like companies unusable like no people can actually like you know get it on their phones or devices there's no like markets created in in the local countries right so we're gonna need to like really app the game on usability and really object game I'm actually like liquidity like if you think of like your DT which is like in the way the only right now usable stable coin I mean I love maker but like the amount of dies that exists in the world it's like so small that like it's not like really operational like if we think of used eg out like removing all the issues of like you know how its managed etc again it's just like it doesn't have liquidity in the places where it needs to be right like where people actually have demand for dollars and there's no dollar since there's no like a way to acquire them so I think like we kind of need to like start investing more and just in these types of things on top of like just making this stuff really usable for people so one other thing I wanted to ask about was you know right now while we're speaking we're kind of at the beginning of what will eventually be a multi-phase and quite long transition to a cerium 2.0 and so even though we were just talking about kind of getting people outside the crypto space and I'm sure you know you do want to also get developers who are already developing in crypto interested in your projects and so does that create some kind of opportunity for you like how do you think the transition to aetherium 2.0 will sort of shake up the existing kind of vlog chain space ask me again in 2016 2016 I remember it just doesn't 16 that was you know I was sucking up at it so somehow it had put a stake and everyone and I remember people saying like well who cares this proposed sake she was gonna have proof it was taken into the next quarter so I said it would be great I think there's a lot of super interesting design use here in 2.0 you know but I I feel like a cerium gets all the credit of this year 2.0 which is none of z deployment so let us give credits to the auction tutor out there which are actually char dating which are actually using proof of stake which are actually you know doing these things I suppose talking about them well and it just out of curiosity like would you say that most people that are interested into sews just our developers that didn't have previous experience in crypto like didn't come from another blockchain they just came straight to tase us no I think most people are most for who who do get interesting tasers have interested now had an interest in in cryptocurrencies to begin with although I think we I think more people had an interest in any theory em I think in terms of saying yeah the balance in the community let's say yeah that's it I would say that's the stuff that's the difference Oh interesting and what about the rest of you guys like how are you thinking about how that's gonna affect the development of your protocols or interest in them so one I guess thing that I think a lot about with etherium 2.0 is the theory em has sort of a burped of this strategy that is very much like okay we are gonna sort of ground up design a second system it is an interesting strategy because there's an alternative system strategy which is we're just going to try to colonize our network aspects into other people's technology stacks and that would well it's sort of I guess a an interesting and alternative strategy and it sort of remains open to aetherium the option of pivoting like if you're in could pivot and decide you know there's like a lot of things that we like about the near technology stack it's close enough to the yeoreum 2.0 vision why don't we just colonize it and then try to bring our network effects over into that technology stack it is we are all building open source technologies there is nothing that stops any one of our technologies from sort of colonizing the ideas heed those toad of each other on and I'm kind of surprised that this happens less than than you think so I think the the most the the way to think about all the way I think about theorem 2.0 is a theorem 2.0 will be attempt of the etherium community to move their network defects into a new system to take that Network effect with them into some new technology I think the assumption that like aetherium to point that like how that happens is sort of like a fixed vision may not end up actually being the case and so it'll be interesting to see what occurs okay we probably have time for one more person who might want to jump in on that yeah it's it's a lot about like excitement into space and if you don't do this how it has this kind of ring to it so I think like like from our perspective like we focus on developers we weave and and and and bringing it to end-users like bringing their products and users so I in many ways like like we you know cooperate or like have conversations with the city of foundation on like technology and underlying things we shared a lot of like indeed ideas like with zakian and polkadot folks and like I think like on technology side it I think it's it's kind of a in a way like shared my mind space of of us all figuring out what works what doesn't and how to make it and I think like on on network effects I think it will be more utility and in some some forms maybe like governance and politics but I think the kind of like utility and and functionality and getting this to the users will be the like driving factor first and like I think like all of us are focused on the different aspect of this is how this is brought to developers and then we all kind of proving that this is the best way or this is like at least you know a sizable chunk of the market and we'll see we'll see how it'll play out exactly well know what works when it's all over all right well thank you all so much for joining us and thank you also to the audience and I hope you all have a great day and stay safe and healthy everybody thank you everyone see you guys
