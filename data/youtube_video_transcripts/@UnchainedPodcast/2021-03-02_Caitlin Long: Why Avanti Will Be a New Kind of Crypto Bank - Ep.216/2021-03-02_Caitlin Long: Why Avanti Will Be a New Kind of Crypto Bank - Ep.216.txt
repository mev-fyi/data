with you again appreciate you have extensive experience both on wall street and in crypto and i wondered given your background how you would characterize the current state of the industry in terms of this trajectory and what would you expect to happen in terms of crypto's relationship to wall street in the coming years well i think we're barely in the first inning i think we are finally in the first inning of crypto it's starting to really go mainstream and we're starting to see users use it for mainstream use cases uh in terms of its relationships to wall street that is evolving i still think the two systems are evolving in parallel and not really um connecting to each other so the bridges that bridge the two are important um and and you're definitely now starting to see uh some of the big banks come in in terms of of bitcoin custody but they're not building the platforms themselves they're subcontracting out in a sub-custodial relationship to um crypto-native companies who really know how to do it and so we have so much to discuss when it gets to the meat of the discussion but i actually really want to make sure that all the listeners know your backstory because just in researching this when i was piecing together all the strands of your history which encompass wyoming and wall street and enterprise blockchain and crypto it just sort of feels like you were meant to sit at this place where you're sitting right now so can you just walk us through your story and how you came to be in this position oh boy uh long and windy road um and i tend not to sit too long in any place um uh spent 22 years on wall street uh in in part of that started three new businesses inside the big banks so didn't uh didn't let the grass grow uh was an entrepreneur inside um big organizations uh got the bitcoin bug uh dating back to 2012 um and thought at the time that we would do a wild garden acceptance of this technology and uh sort of an intranet before internet approach among the big banks and it turned out that the technology is just so fundamentally different it just didn't fit into the tech stacks of the big banks and so ultimately um concluded that the open permission list systems were going to actually grow up independent of the big banks and not inside them and uh and frankly the two systems will exist in parallel which is exactly what is developing and now bridges are being built uh so like the sub custody contract is is um for for for the big banks that's one bridge and then what avanti's doing and uh and the other crypto banks that are fed clearing applicants um are are creating bridges between the u.s dollar and uh and crypto assets so um uh the only detour i didn't uh didn't cover is wyoming i moved back to my native state of wyoming after 20 more than more than 25 years on almost 30 years on the east coast um and uh volunteered for a couple of years uh helping to get commercial laws clarified for the to clarify the legal status of digital assets they generally speaking fall in between the buckets and so we clarified that in wyoming so you know in the event there's a dispute that ends up in court what your rights and obligations are as a party to a transaction and judges have a roadmap to adjudicate it so you don't get crazy decisions all over the place um uh and then we also sped up set up this new special purpose depository institution charter that's uh i think actually this year going to be copied by nebraska a couple of other states have tried to copy it but it's really complicated and detailed and intricate intricate stuff uh and and so it does take a big push to get it done and it does look like nebraska will be the fast follower to wyoming great and can you tell us a little bit more about how it was that you found out about bitcoin and why you fell in love with it at that time well it dates back to the financial crisis i did not find it um brian bishop our cto was on satoshi's original email in october of 2009 but i was not uh it took me a couple years a few years but i started to come across it because i got very curious about the mainstream explanation for the financial crisis i i realized that the mortgage problem was the symptom not the cause and there was definitely something else going on underlying it went on a deep dive in alternative schools of economic thought ranging from mmt at one end to the austrian school at the other and a lot in between just did a lot of reading and it was through those alternative economic circles that i started to see bitcoin come up in 2012 finally dove into it um in in depth in february 2013. got my set up my first wallet uh and then i again like i said i thought um after it was actually after i met ripple in 2014 at morgan stanley because at the time um we all thought all the wall streeters thought we would be fired for being involved in bitcoin so we kept our heads down and i was only doing it on my own time and my own dime you know after work and on weekends then this company called ripple came in with one of the big hedge funds and i was pulled into that meeting and i remember putting my pen down during that meeting and saying oh my gosh this is going to tip and i was thinking at the time enterprise blockchain would be the thing that that would tip because that somebody figured out how to apply that technology to um mainstream payments it hasn't worked out that way not as much as as as i thought back then and some of us um jimmy song is a prominent bitcoin core developer also took a tour through enterprise blockchain thinking that that was the way it was going to play out it didn't and then we um independently there are others who did the same independently all came out and came back to decentralized open permissionless systems and are working on the infrastructure in that industry now yeah and we're going to circle back to this in a moment because obviously with the game stop robin hood stuff that's been in the news i see more chatter about that and so i want to ask you about that but we'll actually do that a little bit later because one other thing that i wanted to ask about was um i feel like another kind of philosophy that you're known for is you know understanding that rehypothecation or you know acceptance of kind of like fractional reserves in traditional banking has been a problem and that to me at least and you can correct me from what i've read of your history it sort of seems like you just sort of didn't accept that that's the way things should be am i right about that and if so why do you think that you didn't view things that way it's so interesting you ask it that way because it just struck me when i realized how the system worked this is just a violation of property rights most people think that they own their gamestop stock in their robin hood brokerage account but i think the world is now waking up uh certainly the wall street bets world has woken up that that's not the case it's just that that robin hood owed it to you and they may or may not actually have it in their inventory and most folks i think still don't realize that's the way it works when you deposit your dollars at a bank they're not yours you've lent them to your bank and the bank owes them back to you so what you really own is an iou the same thing is true of your brokerage account you know if you if you deposit your apple shares at schwab schwab is the legal owner and they owe it back to you uh and then same thing with your bitcoin if you deposit it at an exchange they're the legal owner and they just owe it to you so you don't really own bitcoin you own an iou to bitcoin and the system's wall street's bookkeeping systems figured out that they can make money off that because the systems are never in perfect sync with each other that's how the game stop situation occurs where you can have a a stock 138 percent sold short in other words there were 38 more claims to gamestop shares than there were game stop shares we saw that in the dole food situation i've experienced it in my pension business and it just hit me in the gut that this is just wrong and it's the inaccuracies in the ledger systems of wall street um generally are not nefarious they're just a function of bad system design and bad technology and too many layers of intermediaries that are not in sync at the same time but it definitely has been shall we say um there are people there are hedge funds out there who figured out how to arb the system arbitrage of the system and try to double dip in those kinds of situations it's like a double spend problem in bitcoin um yeah there were hedge funds who double dipped in the in the dole food situation they had sold the shares and then they they went in and filed a claim for consideration in a lawsuit after the company had been acquired because their brokerage firm statement still showed that they own the shares and they figured they could get away with it and you know it's a double spend problem um and it's a it's fundamentally a bookkeeping problem and at an even deeper deeper level it's all about clarity of property rights and we don't have clear property rights in our financial assets in this country and the great thing about bitcoin is it allows you to own your asset outright you have legal title and you have actual possession of your bitcoin if you if you custody your private keys yourself and um just the way you're talking about this it reminds me of something that i read i believe it was in the coindesk profile of you this idea about property rights if that's something that really is ingrained in wyoming's culture is that right absolutely in fact actually one of the many civil wars that's been fought in the united states was the johnson county cattle war and it was fought between um between uh ranchers and um uh who wanted to fence off their property and actually fence in their cattle versus the open range supporters who thought this is you know they can they can graze their cattle anywhere and so the fencing of the west um is absolutely one of we don't call it a civil war but it was really and it was fought in johnson county wyoming over this exact issue does a property owner have the right to put up a fence to keep other other people out and the answer very clearly after that war was yes and then the west got fenced and and the west definitely changed after that but it you know we we've literally fought fought a war in wyoming over over that very issue yeah because when i was reading about that and then reading about how you kind of didn't really seem to accept that this rehypothecation is the way things should happen and i just thought oh i wonder if you know that is why you had that perspective because probably there weren't like a ton of people from wyoming on wall street and so maybe you could see that in a way that other people couldn't um maybe yeah but but there's one really interesting thing that that i've been thinking about relating to stable coins um which is as as you may be following stable coins have really high velocity i just looked at updated velocity numbers recently uh for tether and the annualized velocity is 1247 times for the m the m1 velocity of tether and the m1 velocity of the us dollar is four okay so we're talking just not even in the same zip code what's going on tethers just better technology all of its problems aside it's better technology it's better faster cheaper way to settle a us dollar trade and so what's happening is you can get velocity through technology it used to be that you got velocity through leverage and what i mean by that is in the traditional banking system the central banks used to before the securities marcus really came along so i'm talking about up through the 1970s central banks would inject a dollar of so-called high-powered money monetary base into the system and then the banks would take it and lend it out through fractional reserve banking approximately 10 times and so you'd have an m2 velocity of 10 so each dollar that that was created by the central bank was lent out 10 times okay that's leverage right that's how fractional reserve banking works we got m2 velocity through leverage well now tether and stable coin technology is enabling velocity through technology we don't need that leverage anymore to create velocity in the payment system and so what's fascinating is that's going to have a big impact as these technologies as we get faster payments generally even leaving crypto aside we're going towards real-time ach we're going towards um fed now which which will be a 24 7 365 replacement for fedwire that the fed is putting together we're speeding up payment settlement cycles and what that means inherently is that we don't need that much leverage in the banking system anymore to create velocity because technology is going to create the velocity in and of itself it's going to create some interesting challenges for central banks around the world because things used to settle really slowly they still do um and now we have now we have technology to settle things quickly that's banks can't afford to to be super leveraged and have um the traditional fractional reserve model where they take a demand deposit and turn around and lend it out in a mortgage for 30 years and so there's an inherent mismatch between the assets which are really long duration and the liabilities which are available on demand and that's how you could get a bank run historically there's a lot of tools banks have now to manage that interest rate risk but i think what's going to happen is all of this is just going to deleverage the banking system across the board because we don't need to get velocity through leverage anymore we'll get velocity through technology it's a really a big important point yeah that is so interesting like do you think so what in general do you think what kind of impact do you think that will have on the economy how will things change in terms of the way yeah the way that our financial system grows or the economy grows well i think it's deleveraging the banks and we're seeing that already actually with the fed monetizing uh the debt that it has over the last uh 15ish years since the financial crisis not quite 15 but um but but literally what the fed is doing is taking debt off the private financial sector and putting it on its own balance sheet that's exactly what it has done um and so this is the reason why we haven't seen inflation in cpi yet we've seen it in other places but we haven't seen it in cpi yet in the in the consumer price index because actually the new money the fed is injecting isn't really new debt it's basically monetization of old debt it's swapping from the from the private sector financial institutions to the fed which is a public sector financial institution so so long story short what's happening is it's already leveraging the banking system we're just going to keep seeing more of that banks are going to deleverage because they have to because everything's settling faster they can't afford to take that much that much leverage risk it starts to pose risk to the payment system and by the way this has nothing to do with crypto pile cryptocurrency that's what that's just accelerating that's what i really was asking that once because if we're going to start to see orders of magnitude faster velocity then what effect do you think that would have on our economy well it's it's positive for the economy and by the way this is part of you know maybe part of the reason why we're seeing inflation heating up the the the cpi is is popping up a little bit it's obviously related to covet as well but there are monetary dynamics to quote milton friedman inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon um there are monetary monetary dynamics underneath it and increasing velocity is one of them it's not showing up in those traditional measures though because to go back to the m1 velocity of the us dollar right now is four it's not coming from those traditional banks it's coming from the securities markets it's coming from other sources where velocity is heating up um and we're seeing it in interest rates uh we're recording today on a day when the 10-year treasury is spiking and it's it's actually um causing some concern in the stock market um so we're gonna dive into the wyoming crypto laws but before we do that just one last quick thing about your history that i want to ask about um i did also see that you said that even as far back as spring 2014 major multinational companies were quietly using bitcoin to execute foreign exchange transactions and was that just being done experimentally or was that a part of their regular practice and was this ever publicly announced and maybe you couldn't reveal something now because enough time has passed no i can't reveal who they are because they're still doing it and i know they are because i've talked to them recently it's small it tended to be in emerging markets um uh where there were not well-developed banking systems and you know corporate treasurers generally don't speak out publicly you hear on on financial media a lot of interviews of hedge fund managers and you know traders and speculators but the real power behind the foreign exchange markets is actual movements of money in corporate in the corporate world real um money moving overseas not just for speculation it's corporate treasurers who actually control the bulk of those markets and they don't talk publicly and they don't have an incentive to talk publicly i mean certainly back then everyone would have been horrified if they understood that you know well well-known brand name companies were using it um and so now it's funny i'm kind of hoping some of them come out and say we've been using it all along but just knowing who they are they're probably just going to keep it quiet and and ultimately what's what's going on it's not an ideological decision it's just that corporate treasurers have an absolute incentive to find the the best fastest cheapest and safest way to move money around the world and if if if it happens that in an emerging market they don't trust the banks um or there's no liquidity and bitcoin was the cheapest way to do it then they absolutely have an incentive to do it and they've been doing it all along you'd be floored how many have been doing it all along wow really interesting i mean it makes it makes sense of course all right so let's now talk to wyoming um let's just talk about how it was that you helped make wyoming one of the state's most welcoming to bitcoin well it got started when i tried to donate uh appreciated bitcoin in the last bull market and uh and realized why we had a bad money transmitter law i tried to set up an endowment for female engineers at my alma mater undergraduate the university of wyoming and they couldn't accept it because as a wyoming corporation nobody would do business with them doing due to the bad money transmitter law in wyoming and so um we got that uh i i volunteered because i've been always kept kept close ties back uh back home here in wyoming even though i was on the east coast for a long time a few decades um uh and so i volunteered to help fix it i knew i'd been an intern at the legislature in college so i was at least familiar with it and i figured if i went back home and rolled up sleeves and sat down and talked and and walked legislators through bitcoin and why it's not scary that we would be able to get that money transmitter law fixed and uh lo and behold we did that but um a number of legislators said what else can we do what else can we do what else can we do and then it just the snowball just picked up and i knew we had some thorny issues we had to solve in this industry one of the biggest ones is that the legal status of of crypto assets is not clear wyoming was the first state to step forward and clarify that so again if you end up in a dispute and a judge is you're you end up in court a judge has a roadmap for adjudicating that dispute now in other states like the cred bankruptcy in delaware there's no law in delaware um regarding what digital assets are and so it's a little bit of a crap shoot because a delaware judge doesn't have a roadmap for adjudicating that dispute and then the other big problem that we knew we needed to fix which may be on a resurgence again is that the banks were all debanking crypto companies a lot of startups literally had to close their doors in 2017 because the banks closed their bank accounts in the fall and they didn't have enough time to get a bank account at like silvergate or signature because they were overwhelmed by everybody trying to get through the door at the end of the year at the same time and so there were a number dozens actually of of um of examples of startups that testified in wyoming that losing their bank account caused them to have to close their doors uh it's turning out i posted i saw a tweet from somebody who had his bank account closed in the uk i posted because i've been hearing about this and seeing it in chat channels i think there might be a resurgence of this has any and i by the way i know something i can't share yet because i can't prove it but there is a resurgence of this going on and sure enough guess what i asked that when i put the tweet out i asked is anybody else having very recent experiences with this and a whole bunch of stuff came out so this has been a problem for quite a while that that the traditional banks don't want to deal with customers who um even individuals who've been customers for 15 20 years and they send a payment to a crypto exchange and then the bank closes their account and there is a reason why it's it's resurging again i just i'm trying to get a little bit to the bottom of what's actually going on but it's one of these behind the scenes things in the banking industry and um it's not good for for for the crypto industry overall and was that peter mccormack of what bitcoin did that you're talking about yes yes and so yeah but i i like it seems so counterintuitive because now with uh interpretive letters saying that banks can custody crypto assets you would think that actually now the kind of like taboo against dealing with uh bitcoin or other crypto currencies is you know old so why do you think i mean i know you're you're still kind of investigating it but what's your theory well it's it's a great question and and i know the reality is that the occ is only one of three federal bank regulators and the fdic didn't sign on to those letters to my knowledge and the fed didn't sign on to those letters to my knowledge they were occ letters usually when the bank regulators move they move in tandem but that was not the case and so when um when one goes out and and makes a major policy change it doesn't necessarily mean that the other two are on board and they all have power over the banking system and and so what you really need to watch is what is the fdic doing and what are what is the fed doing and are they as friendly as the occ um and so you know part of it is just knowing how to navigate this labyrinth we have a really labyrinthine financial services system because you actually have you really have really have five bank regulators you have the occ you have the fed of course which runs the payment system you have the fdic which of course ensures most um of the banks in the united states the occ is the national bank regulator but then you've got state chartered state regulators all 50 states have a have a regulator and banks can either be state or federal and then you've got the the consumer the cfpb the consumer financial protection bureau um so all of them and plus vincent in the treasury department i mean actually if you start broadening out the definition um the alphabet soup of agencies that actually have um regulatory jurisdiction over banks is pretty incredible and you've got to understand how all those pieces fit together i i've definitely seen a lot of um jumping to conclusions in the crypto industry because of reading a headline without fully understanding how all the puzzle pieces fit together to know is this really actually a sustainable change or does this mean that one of the agencies you know did something without the other agencies being on board um and we will know we'll know over time um one of the interesting things that i that came out that i haven't seen anyone talking about is that the banking trade association sent a letter to the occ this is public demanding that because the occ made a major policy change without putting it out for public comment um two days before they granted anchorage the occ trust bank charter um that that that the charter's invalid and uh and the same thing with protego on the protego charter um what's interesting is that the um that was granted after the regulatory moratorium in the biden administration so what you have now is the traditional banks challenging what was done by the occ will those challenges work i don't know um but there there are some substantive issues there that are procedural issues probably is a better way to say it when the occ made that major policy change did should that have been put out for public comment it's really funny because it's the shoe on the other foot the crypto industry when fincen put out a major policy change at the end of the trump administration without having much of a comment period there was a huge outcry and when the occ did it in the opposite direction in a way that was favorable to the crypto industry there was no outcry um and so you know we'll see how the process plays out and very very much it all depends on um what the new occ head will do but uh where i'm going is on this whole notion of you know seeing more evidence that that people are having bank accounts closed just for sending wires or ach payments to a crypto exchange um there is something going on and it and it's and it's not the occ that's doing it it's uh it's one of the other agencies okay i guess we'll we'll have to um keep an eye on that and see what happens and just to clarify so this isn't talking about the original interpretive letter saying that they can custody digital assets it's about the bank charter okay right it's it's about it's about regulatory exams um for the existing banks what what happens is you know the regulators will typically never say you can't do this unless it's a violation of the bank secrecy act what they'll say is i want information on your activities in this area and in the regulatory exam if that's deemed high risk then it hits you in your safety and soundness rating and if you get hit in your safety and soundness rating it's called the camel's score reputation risk is part of that and so what happens is just by a regulator asking questions of the banks there's kind of it's an indirect way for the regulators to say we really don't want the banks to be doing this and so the banks naturally will step back and say well i don't want my capital charge to go up i don't want my reputation risk score to go down i don't want to have challenges in my audit and so now i'm going to go through my entire book of business and see who's who has sent a wire to a crypto exchange and close their account because it's just not worth it to to take the risk servicing those customers luckily that's not every bank um but it does appear that um especially i saw a number in the twitter thread a number of people came forward seemingly with bank of america experiences where bank of america actually asked the customers to confirm that they were not a money transmitter and and so that's definitely coming from their compliance department for sure wow all right well before we move on from this um one last thing is earlier when you were talking about some of the changes that you got implemented in wyoming one that and i don't know if you were kind of alluding this to to this obliquely but it was so fascinating to me when i read about it you were able to get past um a law that prohibits judges from compelling disclosure of private cryptographic keys can you tell us more about that law and why you thought that was important well that one didn't pass didn't yeah it's actually coming up this year got it okay when yeah yeah we we did get a free speech protection for developers past okay um so that the developers aren't liable in the state of wyoming for open source code that they um that they write that's used by someone else in a crime unless the code was actually malicious so it's it's designed to help um prevent developers from being held responsible for putting something out there uh that they didn't necessarily foresee that uh that could be used um nefariously but we didn't get the other one passed yet of course you know law enforcement is not necessarily supportive of that last year that bill didn't go through but it's coming up again um and and that's the whole the whole idea of that there is something special about a private cryptographic key it it it is actually not just a password it is actually the ass and and therefore um if if you can compel a private cryptographic key then everything related to that private private cryptographic key even if it's not even if it's more say it's a divorce settlement and you can compel disclosure of the key and let's say that the bitcoin was going to be split 50 50 between uh the divorcing parties um then but the court now has access to the whole thing and the court is not set up to to keep a private key private there is and there's not there's nothing that can be done around it and as you know um once a private key is disclosed it is it is permanently um not useful anymore um there may be forks and air drops that may come in the future that you net that are no now no longer secure there are a lot of things in the future that you don't know will be able to trace back to your private keys as i've rolled my own private keys over time i've kept my old devices because you just never know in my case they're secure but you just never know when those old private keys that are no longer actually securing any of my coins will actually be useful again because there might have been an airdrop or a fork or or something like that and who knows what what's coming in the future we don't know you just private keys are in a category of of their own and we're trying to get that one through um so that they can't be compelled in civil litigation uh the the judiciary committee was pretty strong that they still want to allow um compelled disclosure in criminal litigation though all right yeah that one was so philosophically interesting to me so um we'll have to keep an eye on that all right so in a moment we're going to talk about avanti bank and offit and all kinds of other things but first a quick word from the sponsors who make the show possible planning to buy a tesla with bitcoin well you can with the crypto.com app crypto.com is giving away four teslas to enter the lucky draw download the krypto.com app

support dispute management and fraud detection start building your online payment form today visit square.com go slash unchained back to my conversation with caitlin long so later this year you are going to be launching avanti bank how did you come up with the idea for it well it gets back at what we were just talking about before the break on solving a real problem for the industry which is access to the us dollar payment system and um having been you know a financial services uh regulatory person i've done a lot of work in and around life insurance companies on erisa in my career and reinsurance rules so it was more insurance focused than banking focus but it's not that difficult once you get the skill set to really dive dive deeply and i dove deeply to try to figure out how do we actually keep it so that banks in the united states can't debank the crypto industry in that same way that they did in mass in 2017 um and i learned that was in reaction to regulatory pressure that um that the banks were getting it's the same it wasn't explicit it was never announced but it was implicit pressure and the banks looked at it and said i just don't want the hassle of dealing with somebody who's in the crypto industry thank goodness the ones that did dug dug in and said i'm going to take that extra risk and extra hassle because i can service customers and earn a good return for their shareholders doing that and specifically that was the silver gates and signatures of the world but that's why you saw specialization among the banks because most banks just figured it's just not worth it to take the extra regulatory hassle i'll just close these accounts and then they all ended up in a small number of banks and now we've got you know a single point of failure risk for it for the industry because there's so much concentration among these these few banks that have been very successful so we knew we needed to solve that problem and we created a new type of bank charter that was specifically designed to solve that problem and designed for for providing custody services around digital assets and from our conversation earlier um obviously i'm sure there are a lot of ways that ivanti will function differently from other types of banks what are the principles you've been following in developing your crypto bank well it's it it follows the principles of the of the charter uh and nebraska i think is going to be a fast follower so we're going to have uh we're going to have company um pretty soon with the they they literally um have almost exactly word for word the same uh legislation as wyoming passed and so what are the principles one is they're non-lending banks why are they non-lending banks because the fdic was not uh at the time interested in insuring banks that handle digital assets um that's part of the reason why it's been such a slow process the swiss banks actually not only can can provide custody services for digital assets but they can actually own them and hold them and trade them not even not even the wyoming speedy banks can do that so you have other major countries whose banking systems are and bank regulators are much more welcoming to crypto than than the us um and and that's been that's been an fdic uh point so what the wyoming speedy banks can get fdic insurance um but they're not required to and so therefore to the extent that the fdic has issues with crypto it's just not relevant for the wyoming speedy banks um so that's one but as a result of that these are non-lending banks because if there if there's no insurance then the natural extension of that is well then you can't take the kind of asset risk that a bank typically takes you you you can't lend and so um that's i i that that's that's just the inherent nature of the of the charter and it's inherent in the business model it does happen to uh very strongly align with my strong commitment to property rights because while a dollar deposit at avonte is is going to be an iou that's the way the financial system works it at least is backed 100 percent with high quality liquid assets and so um avanti is not a lending bank it's not taking the typical credit and interest rate risk doing maturity transformation taking taking a demand deposit and turning it into a mortgage loan um that a typical bank would do and ivanti's not doing those things and that's a function of the bank charter uh but it does philosophically align with this again this this commitment to property rights we also have specifically in the in the trust area so um one just to clarify the wyoming speedy banks cannot take deposits of bitcoin we can hold bitcoin in trust that may sound like a distinction without a difference but it's a big difference because banks can only take us dollar deposits um and and if they're a clearing bank uh they get to get access to the fed um that's where that distinction makes a huge difference you have to be a depository institution to get to to become a us dollar clearing bank uh the occ trust banks are not depository institutions the wyoming speedy banks are so we actually are held to a much higher standard which is part of the reason why it's taking longer for us to get through the process as well but we'll be able to do more when we when when we actually open so that all very much philosophically aligns with the whole approach of um these banks we should go back to money to the to the structure of banks that we had um before the modern banking system arose and assets were all bearer assets and that is banks were merely service providers they were not counterparties and we can't quite go back to that because of the way the federal the fed system works so yes your dollar deposits are in iou but when you put your bitcoin on deposit in the trust department that's not an iou in wyoming we are just keeping it safe for you as a service provider we are not your counterparty you you retain legal title to the asset it works the same way under the same law as a coat check or a valet parking arrangement you don't turn over title to your car when you park it in a garage you just give the safe keeper temporary possession of it and and that's the structure we have in wyoming it's very different than the structure of securities and this is the concept that's legally called bailment and this is sort of how you're fulfilling that not your keys not your coins ethos okay that's right yeah which i yeah we may be in temporary possession of the keys but we don't actually own legal title we're splitting that legal title and who possesses the keys um because they don't have to be the same thing you can still get the legal title you can still have legal title to the asset even if someone is temporarily safe keeping it the private keys for you and there's another principle that you've been advocating for which is no co-mingling of funds and why is that important what are the problems that can stem from commingling customer funds and digital assets well this is so interesting because i read the new york attorney general settlement yesterday with tether and this was one of the things that they really were going after they have to prove that the funds are not co-mingled um when there's not you know light shining on financial institutions they tend to want to commingle everything because it reduces uh it it allows them to take more risk shall we say um sometimes undue risk and putting their customers assets at risk more than their customers understand right we saw that in the cred bankruptcy the bankruptcy of of a bitcoin lender cred um they were commingling their assets with their customers assets and doing all kinds of things and there was no disclosure and of course as it typically comes out when when intermediaries in this industry go bankrupt it turns out that they were insolvent for a long time before they finally went bankrupt and that was the case with cred yeah so one of the most important things about solvency again it's a commitment to property rights it's a commitment to fundamental solvency um is is that no commingling is absolutely a requirement of that if you're going to commingle you have to tell the customers they have to have clear disclosures of the risk you can't throw a word that is not understood by most like rehypothecation into a contract and have everybody sign the contract not knowing what it means um you know those words that obfuscate what's really going on are very common in traditional financial services terms of service but not in wyoming we actually have a requirement under wyoming law to give plain english terms of service and really explain what the risks are i like that yeah i feel like that's why a lot of people listen to that well i've heard from my listeners they listen to the show because you know we at least i try as much as possible to always explain all the terms um so i also wondered you know avanti bank is going to serve institutional investors so what kinds of problems do you see avanti solving for them and you know i was wondering like what kind of money you're seeing on the sidelines now while uh institutions like avanti are you know preparing to launch well there's a lot of interest um we've been deluged we're in the thousands now of of customer inquiries it's more than two thousand customer inquiries most of which are are not um going to you know actually become customers it's a lot of people who are individuals and like you said we're serving businesses first the compliance and the reason for that a lot of people ask us why can't i open an account at avonte the compliance requirements to serve individuals are many multiples of the compliance requirements to serve businesses so that's why we're starting with with um with businesses first but what problems are we are we solving the big one in the crypto industry is one that most folks probably don't really understand because it has to do with the the way that us dollar payment systems work when you send an ach payment um which is the most common form of payment by far in u.s dollars it can be reversed by the consumer for 90 days and so um let's say that you're you know a coin base or a kraken or a bittrex or a binance and they uh and you you sell a bitcoin to a customer and you accept an ach payment for it they might take that bitcoin off platform and then turn around and reverse the ach payment and then the service providers out both sides of that trade that's a huge risk issue and it's simply a function of the way the us dollar payment system works it doesn't match in timing and in um and in reversibility to the crypto assets crypto assets settle in minutes with irreversibility us dollar payments can settle sometimes in days with absolute reversibility for up to 90 days right so those two things are fundamentally different and those are the kinds of things that we as a bank are are working to solve we'll be offering different alternatives that can really help the crypto industry solve that fundamental risk problem yeah it reminds me of what you were saying earlier about how with enterprise blockchain you realize that the way financial institutions work is just like fundamentally different and anyway we can get more into that later because i do still want to talk a little bit about gamestop et cetera but we're going to do it after avanti and ovid um so for avanti how will you decide which crypto assets you'll offer well we've announced that we're starting um with in avid we're starting with uh the liquid side chain of bitcoin as well as ethereum so um those are the two most common uh by far the the most secure um because they're the the proof of work um right now for ethereum anyway blockchains and by far the biggest network effects by far um others are interesting we may add them over time we're not committed to uh just those but because that's where we'll be issuing avid we will over time be offering custom custody services in those assets as well and have you figured out any kind of standards by which you'll judge whether or not to add something new or is that still being developed it's a good question it's all brian bishop's decision i i will not interfere with the uh somebody who um receives satoshi's original email in 2009 now you know it's interesting we call ourselves a tech platform with a bank company or a tech company with a bank platform bank charter rather and um and it really is true um brian is on the board and i am not a technologist i know i don't know enough to make those decisions and those decisions are absolutely his uh and uh and and and i'll take his recommendations so um we're going to service our customers of course there's if there's huge demand for something new we will um we we we will put it on the platform we are a customer driven entity we are not a a sell-side driven entity a lot of the um exchanges and service providers in the crypto industry have really more served the sell side so to speak and by that i mean the platforms um who wanted their coins listed and were willing to pay exchanges to get their coins listed we won't do that and we won't we won't accept that from any of the platforms it's a it's a customer driven decision not a provider driven decision it's by side rather than sell side that we are focused on and so just to give a sense of who your customers will be i'm expecting crypto companies but then also like it seems like you would also serve institutions that are interested in getting into crypto is that right absolutely yes um and if you look at who our team is all of us have worked in regulated financial services uh in the past and including a few there are three of the five of us who who are morgan stanley alums uh and and one who i specifically um uh recruited our chief operating officers of shim go to uh to work with me because we covered corporate treasurers together so yes we are actually working on some on some things for um traditional financial services as well as for the corporate treasury oh yeah i'm sure especially that did you speak at the micro strategy event or well maybe next year [Laughter] um all right so you have called avid which is the new coin that will be issued by ivanti quote bank money that happens to be issued on a blockchain so from what i've gleaned it looks like it might be some kind of new stable coin not exactly pegged to the us dollar but it will be some kind of stable coin that gets around the problems that consumers face with existing stable coins can you um give us an outline of what it looks like well i can't say much about it uh you'll see you'll learn a lot more when when uh when a white paper comes out a little bit later probably existing problems with stable coins do you see that could be resolved yeah the the biggest ones are legal and accounting and tax they are not friendly in either in any of those three disciplines uh from a legal perspective like i said earlier crypto assets fall through the buckets um of of traditional assets are they commodities are they securities are they property are they money right and so um when it's issued by a bank you know exactly what it is and the structure that we've chosen um is different and that and the details around that we put we filed a patent for that um the details around that will will come out um and as a result of that there are accounting and tax implications for that that's that's pretty much all i can say um but i i can talk about the problems i alluded earlier that the terms of service from some of the other some of the stable coins um don't don't uh actually they actually have a disclaimer that we're not sure that transactions in the stable coins are legally enforceable anywhere in the world and usdc is the one that actually has that in its terms of service i don't mean to single them out because i think it's true of all of them um they don't fit in existing legal buckets and so you don't know under commercial law what their real treatment is in the event that you get into a dispute and they're just being responsible and warning warning people about that but as you can imagine in the institutional world when the lawyers go and look at something like that and say i don't know if this is legally enforceable uh boy um that's that keeps most of them away um even though they'd love to uh participate because of the payment system benefits that they'd get um same thing with the accounting um there was a lot uh made of the accounting for bitcoin which is which is really ugly and needs to get fixed um but accounting for stable coins also is not as favorable as you might think uh depending upon the facts and circumstances of how the coin is is set up most likely it's an investment which has to get marked to market through the balance sheet um or a receivable but it's not a cash equivalent and so most businesses really care about having a cash equivalent a bank deposit is a cash equivalent it's not cash cash is physical dollar bills most of what um in u.s gaap financial statements for publicly traded companies is reported as cash is actually a cash equivalent usually it says cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet line item but you cannot uh from what i'm hearing from the accountants necessarily treat a stablecoin as a cash equivalent and uh michael saylor is definitely an exception to the rule the other companies um really do care about that because um that's that's how credit analysts look at their balance sheet that's how banks understand the liquidity profile of the business they'll look at the cash line item and investments are not deemed to be liquid enough to be considered cash and if they're not presented as cash on under accounting standards then it's then then it limits the usefulness of those so i i set about to specifically create a structure that is true to the technology the open permissionless back-end systems but um solve those structural problems it's just an example of where the innovation happened driven by the technology and it wasn't backwards compatible with what the users really needed but yet look at how successful they've been in spite of that if we can actually get them to be backwards compatible to what the users a a different group of users really need the users ie who are not using stablecoins today but would love to be able to have access to that technology that's that's what we're trying to solve yeah yeah just when you were describing that and then thinking about what we were saying earlier about how corporate treasurers move huge amounts but i was just like whoa you know you know i don't know what you've created but i'm very excited to see it because um if it does you know what you're saying it does then i really think it would be huge so well it's going to take time though i i i am definitely cautious that corporate treasurers it's it's just like you know big banks they don't move fast um and and there's a lot of inertia in order to switch systems or to switch to something new the switching costs really have to be justified by substantial increases in efficiency a lot of people have been trying to solve some of these same problems for in the payment system for a long time they all fundamentally trace back to inefficiencies in ach and fedwire but that's the best that that's available for us dollars right now to the mainstream users who have to report under u.s gaap and really do have to pay attention to the geography on their balance sheet of where their cash is they can't put a lot of cash into something like bitcoin or investments or receivables they want it in cash equivalents and so yeah that's what we're working on okay yeah yeah i'm really glad you brought this up because i have been trying to learn more about how it affects accounting um when companies put bitcoin on their balance sheets um it's ugly from what i can tell um and i just out of curiosity is available when avanti launches or do you expect that that will happen later we'll have announcements about that a little later it's coming okay so let's circle back now to the gamestop thing what do you think was the core problem that happened there well there were a lot of core problems but the co the fundamental one is that gamestop was 138 sold short um what does that mean it means that that there were 38 percent more claims to gamestop shares than there were actual gamestop shares so wall street's accounting systems went haywire and um created more supply of gamestop shares than there were actual supply and that artificial supply of course suppressed the price of gamestop shares so i actually think that the fundamental problem had nothing to do with robinhood that was a secondary problem it's kind of like the mortgage problem in in 2007 that was a symptom not the cause robin hood was a symptom not the cause the cause the fundamental cause was gamestop's stock should never have been allowed to be sold 138 percent short and um and and the real legitimate owners of gamestop stock had their pockets picked as a result of that they had the price suppressed because anytime you increase the supply of something um artificially all else equal it's going to suppress the price think back to your supply demand curves you you have you push the supply curve out to the right it pushes the price down right that's what happened to gamestop stock and the you know the re the wall street bets folks figured it out and realized that they could fight back and did um but the fact is that that situation would never have arisen had gamestop not been sold 138 short in the first place and then what about the settlement time of two days how do you feel like that like do you feel like because some people have been saying um particularly chad cascarola who was on my podcast recently he was talking about that do you feel like if that were eliminated then and by watching tech that you know he's see this is actually why i wanted to talk about your experience at symbian because he has this you know paxos settlement service or not he but the company right and it's a private permission chain for stock trading and you know given your experience i kind of wondered like do you feel like that might go somewhere or do you feel like that probably won't or sure and i wish them well absolutely this is um there's a lot of innovation happening in this area and i do believe that gary gensler at the sec the new um sec likely commissioner if he has confirmed um he's been officially nominated by biden um he's a former um mit um cryptocurrency teacher professor and uh and so he's he's obviously very familiar with this technology and here comes this whole gamestop thing that you know is going to be you know is going to make his confirmation hearing you know a cnbc news story and he's going to be asked about it and um what is he going to do about it and one of the questions is going to be are you going to greenlight um um blockchain versions of securities and absolutely paxos has been working on this for years and um you know it takes a long time to get to to get inroads in some of these infrastructure plays and absolutely hats off to everybody who is trying he's absolutely trying to solve the same problem that that i've been trying to solve for years part of the reason why i'm focusing a little bit more on payments is in part because one of the reasons i think we've never gone faster than t plus two in security settlement the big reason is that too many people are making money off securities lending in that two-day period they don't want to close it down with but this is exactly what causes the gamestop type problems right um but the other reason is that u.s dollars settle really slowly and if we can actually get faster u.s dollar settlement i think that's going to drag the securities industry into faster security settlement too so so chad and i are working on the same problem from different angles and and absolutely i i would expect to to meet and hopefully work with them oh interesting future announcement of it in paxos yes blah blah blah no nothing coming now you know what's fun about being in the position that we're in is literally we're frenemies with everybody in the industry we may be competing with them in certain areas but we're also going to be in a position where we can actually help them solve their problems too right and so you know i'm not trying to um either get you to criticize a competitor or or anything but but i am still just curious about this idea that um you know as you were saying when you worked in traditional finances you felt like the tech stack was just so completely different and the mindset was so completely different around kind of like closed source and then versus open source and and and all these things and so i just did wonder like and generally do you think that means that it is not likely that these kinds of problems that we saw with gamestop and robin hood would be solved with blockchain technology or do you think that potentially that could it could be oh i think they absolutely will be i think it's really hard to get um to get decentralized stock trading platforms because by nature as a security has an issuer right and so by nature the fact that there's an issuer it really is tough to be decentralized i mean we've seen it and the sec has implied that ethereum even though it had an issuer became decentralized but i don't think securities even for the largest companies you know the giants like apple i don't think they'll ever be sufficiently decentralized to take the issuer out of the equation um and you know keep in mind that for corporates um things like dividend payments and corporate actions like murders and acquisitions stock buybacks those kinds of things are inherently issuer focused um functions and so uh absolutely i think that that is more conducive to private blockchain systems however um one of the interesting things about that i learned about the tech stacks of the big banks is they're just all very centralized and layered um they're designed for a delayed net settlement system with multiple intermediaries and even private permissioned blockchains are decentralized a lot more than that there's they are set up for something closer to real-time gross settlement as opposed to delayed net settlement but they're really not that um they're not that they're they are still pretty fundamentally different so the point i was making isn't necessarily that the tech stacks um are so different that it's permissioned versus permissionless it has to do with the degree of centralization and the degree of the layers of intermediaries and all the netting that happens that's the fundamental system difference that even permissioned blockchains were running into they just weren't supplementation of existing systems they were rip and replace and for a company to to to rip and replace entire systems i mean the australian stock exchange is doing it look how long it's taken for them to do it because they basically had to rebuild it from scratch these are not incremental upgrades well okay all right well so we will see how this all plays out but certainly i do think that this has put a spotlight on the potential for blockchain technology but um i do sometimes also think oh just the open system is moving so much quicker so anyway all right it absolutely is for good reason yeah yeah all right so switching gears with your background heading up morgan stanley's pensions group i was curious when you thought we'll start to see pensions investing in well no i get when i wrote this guy i realized we had one or two that did right we've had well a number of them have through their venture capital allocations um so pomp's uh for example i think he um he announced there was a fire fireman's pension fund in virginia as i recall that was one of the first ones we've seen endowments um invest a lot of endowments have invested through their venture capital arms um we're starting to see endowments actually directly on crypto and i don't know much about pensions i don't i don't know a lot of um of of examples of the pensions directly owning crypto mostly they're doing it through either a vc fund or a or some sort of a fund structure like even gbtc and so what hurdles do you think we'll need to overcome before we'll start to see that happen where they uncrypto directly and in a big way well the biggest hurdle is operational asset managers are not set up to custody their own assets and a lot of that has to do with the um investment company act and investment advisors act of 1940 two different acts that were passed after the great depression in response to fraud that was taking place where asset managers were custodying customers assets and then making off with them so there's been a fundamental approach to separate asset management decisions from custody and that's why you have the sec custody rule now bitcoin is not a security but what has happened is that as best practice a lot of asset managers will apply the same standards for non-securities because they have to do it for securities anyway and so if something's a commodity they may as well just use it use a third-party custodian they didn't build up their their custody capabilities internally and that's the biggest the biggest hurdle is getting true institutional qualified custodians that meet erisa standards and that's a higher level of service and higher level of legal protections than is generally available right now one of for example the things i like to point to is there's a reason why the big securities custodians are banks with fed accounts state street is technically a trust company but it was grandfathered in so long ago they all have fed clearing capabilities they are full depository institutions um trust companies are not and uh it was the best that was available state chartered trust companies were the that was the best that was available to the crypto industry um until last year when the speedy banks came along we are depository institutions and then the occ trust bank charter is not depository institutions but it is a step above a state chartered trust bank all right so um i know avanti is launching later this year you have tweeted that avanti will bring together strange bedfellows so i wondered um if you wanted to elaborate a little bit more on that and give us a sneak preview of what we could expect and when from avanti well we're we're sitting at the bridge of the traditional financial services industry and the crypto industry and so even already our shareholders uh um who have supported us uh in our early stages are an eclectic mix of of bitcoin ogs so to speak and the traditional financial services world and so yes everyone should expect to see that this is uh we we have to live in that traditional world and it is really important that our executives our board and our shareholders understand that traditional world and come from there but of course we also have very crypto committed folks too um and it's it creates um you know interesting fault lines because the the banking world is very regimented and very rules-based and uh the crypto world is the opposite of that and so it just it creates strange bedfellows yes all right and so maybe there will be a launch like in the summer or when do you think yeah we haven't put out a specific date yet right well we'll just it's coming though we'll just have to the light is at the end of the tunnel yes great great well congratulations early early congratulations thank you um so where can people learn more about you and avanti um um on twitter uh i just joined clubhouse a few weeks ago too i've been uh fairly active on that as well uh and then obviously uh avantibank.com perfect all right well thank you so much for coming on unchained yeah appreciate it good to see you
