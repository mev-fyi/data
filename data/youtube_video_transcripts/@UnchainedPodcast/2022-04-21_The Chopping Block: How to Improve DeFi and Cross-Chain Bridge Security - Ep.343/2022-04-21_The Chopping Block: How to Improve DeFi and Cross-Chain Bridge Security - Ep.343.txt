hey everybody welcome to the shopping blog uh every four weeks the few of us get together and give the industry insider's perspectives on the crypto topics of the day so um quick intros first off we have tom d5 maven and master of memes next we have karoon the gigabrain and grand pub at gauntlet then we have laura that she is the ceo of the show has how she asked me to intro her oh please you just called me that and you said i look like i asked you how you wanted to be interested you said the ceo of the show so i said fine okay actually just called me that and before you said you were looking for a way to intervene i said just call me that then fair enough fair enough okay so she is she is the ceo of the show and she's uh chief journalist and on the shopping block and then i have myself haseeb head height man at dragonfly so all four of us are sorry three of us are early stage investors in crypto but i want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice life advice or legal advice for that matter so uh this is our first show that we're doing in person it's honestly kind of weird because every show in the past that we've done until now has been over zoom and now all of a sudden we're sitting here in this like hot studio in manhattan and uh it's like it's suddenly um breaking the fourth wall a little bit compared to how we usually do things yeah and it's also weird because it's like so close we're like still kind of in covet but like everybody's super sick of covid and yeah they just lifted the mass mandates you know so now you have to wear masks and uber you have to wear a mask in a plane uh nobody in the subway is wearing masks so it's very very different environment i just came from singapore which is the exact opposite where people are still extremely technically the mass mandate in singapore is lifted but almost everyone there is still wearing masks even outside which is bizarre because it's extremely hot in singapore it's like you guys are super human probably not going to catch covet outside i'm just going to tell you that i know i know i know it's it's it's just i think it's a cultural thing if you go in singapore and you're walking around outside the only people you see not wearing masks are the white people oh all of the locals not crypto libertarians there aren't that many there aren't that many and well most of the crypto people in singapore are asian and so they they like bring the asian energy of like okay follow the rules like you know at least at least within your normal day-to-day life in your alter ego you break all the rules and then you you know run an unlicensed exchange or whatever so yeah it's interesting how has been the book tour oh my god amazing yeah you know like i've been putting out these shows every week twice a week and doing it for years and you know i don't get a lot of feedback and so like doing these book events has been like just so lovely like people come up to me and they're like oh i work in crypto because of you or like someone came up and was like i'm your number one fan and later his friend also saw me and his friend was like he puts you up there with vitalik and i was like oh my gosh wow wow um i had like a group of four college friends they all listen to me i've had like whole families the whole family listens to me you know there was like a person that he was like oh i got my wife into your show and now she works with blockchain technology like like she like added it to like what she was doing with government and like i don't just there have been so many stories like that i mean there was somebody she read my book so closely that she was asking me these like very detailed questions about the book and i was like whoa like you like studied this thing you know so the whole thing honestly it's just been amazing like i sold out the first event in new york which like they were turning people away i didn't expect that i have a ton of fans in utah big surprise to me wow you're like a crypto rock star now like yeah there's been so many like just delightful things so yeah it's everybody who came thank you because it's just been like yeah so lovely pretty much and yeah really really unexpected how do you feel about the reviews how do you feel about the reception overall on the book really good yeah i feel good yeah i mean you know it's like i've worked on this for years and honestly i'm just grateful that people are even reading it you know what i mean it's like people you know there's there's a lot of content out there now like a lot of things compete for people's attention and like the fact that people i'm like taking the time to read my 400 page book you know all of its footnotes by the way if you're a crypto og you can totally geek out in the footnotes they're very fun lots of blockchain transactions and like wayback machine things and social media posts whatever but yeah like the fact that they're doing that and like you know sometimes they're like screenshotting things that they're just like like interested or surprised by and yeah i don't know like a lot of people have been buying like bulk orders as well like you know for their whole company or their whole dow or like oh yeah so i've been doing like a bunch of kind of um events for companies where like if you buy a certain number then um you know i'll do a virtual event for you or even something in person and so there's been a lot of i like and yeah like they're like yeah there was one last week where actually what happened was it was just a conference i gave a speech and then one of the companies had bought the book to give away and so there was like the signing line and the signing line was huge and like i had to stay for two hours signing these books i like couldn't even finish because i had this other appointment i did not imagine it was going to take that long and people wanted selfies with me and like it was interesting because not like most of the events everybody already knows me it's already like a fan of my show or whatever but here a lot of people didn't know me already but just from the one talk i gave they like loved that talk so they were like already fans from that they were like we loved your speech and like sometimes yeah anyway i could go on and on but like the whole thing has just been like a dream and just so lovely and yeah so i'm like basically savoring every moment of it because i'm going to have to get back to work because i have like a lot of other projects coming and so it's just like i'm going to enjoy this time because like pretty soon i'm going to be hitting the ground running again because i know you and you're a grinder right like you just you're a workhorse like you've been putting out content consistently for years and i know you've been grinding on this book for a long time and so you know i i i know that feeling of like you're you're just working you're putting out stuff you're being consistent and then eventually you come for air and you realize oh wow all this stuff like someone was actually consuming it all that time and they really like me now and like that doesn't it it's often hard for that to land especially in the era of like post covid and you know living in crypto which is all online all the time and it's like it's very there's so many elements of it that feel impersonal uh until you finally make contact you show up at an event and people are like you changed my life and now i have a you know i went into the industry because of you and it's like holy crap yes i've had so many people say that to me over the years like it's really surprising i remember when it started happening like back in i guess it was 2017 um and just being like oh weird but now it's like having so much i'm like oh it's kind of crazy i'm just yeah putting stuff out there and like it gets people interested and then they want to work in it and it's cool you know it's super cool yeah well we are super proud of you and seeing all of the incredible reception that your book has gotten has been just awesome to see and i'm glad that you're saving it because i know it's hard sometimes to actually really feel the um the success that you've had and so it's awesome to go in person and feel that yeah no i know i definitely did not expect like even a fraction of what it's been frankly so yeah i'm i'm very grateful for all of it and honestly i think the other thing i'm really glad about is you know we were a little bit nervous about the dow attacker reveal so the fact that that went so well and like nobody because you know i i forbes was not the first place i pitched it i pitched it to multiple outlets and some of the other outlets were like oh what if this is like when newsweek tried to reveal who satoshi nakamoto was and i was like because it's like a weird thing when you pitch it i couldn't reveal who it was because then if they wanted to they could steal that and then like you know front run me essentially because there's a long lead time between when i had the information when the book was going to come out and so like some places just backed off and they were like you know what if you're wrong and i was like but like because i couldn't reveal all the evidence but i i just knew like there's a difference between the kind of evidence i have and like what's previously been done around satoshi but anyway so you know my forbes sitters they know me and whatever and like we have a very good working relationship and you know frankly we just love working together so it all worked out super well but like you know it was definitely kind of like a dicey thing and so the fact that that reveal went well and like people are accepting kind of like i know i've literally not seen a single person been like you were wrong so yeah it's definitely you know let's just put it away journalists when they're revealing that kind of thing in the crypto community they don't generally get that reception so i'm very very glad that it worked out well it's like the uh convex bug disclosure from uh from last week you know and really the solution there is to have them add you as an editor to these publications then you can reveal it yourself i think that's the solution or we have zero knowledge proof yeah that would be great that's like that's really more the like ten year version of this that's your reveal though i agree certainly well so speaking of big reveals actually one of the um interesting stories of the week that kind of goes into i guess it'll be the next chapter of the addendum to let's say the next version of the book so last week or it was two weeks ago last episode we talked a lot about the actual infinity hack and we talked a lot of about um you know the the hero i just said i talked a lot of i put on you guys about the irresponsibility of um the the sky mavis team for their opsec and allowing this hack to take place so in the last week we've learned something about who the attacker was and we learned actually in a very indirect way so what happened was so the the ofac list which is a list of basically sanctioned entities or in the case of crypto addresses that you're not allowed to send money to otherwise you're in violation of sanctions they added to this list for a group called the lazarus group which is associated with north korea so it's a hacking group that basically is i guess a part of the north korean government or associated with a north korean state and uh they're very notorious they've engaged in a lot of fun attacks and one of the addresses that was added to the sanctions for the lazarus group was the one that was also used in the axe infinity hack which implies that it was north korea that attacked x infinity which is kind of wild yeah because if you look at the you know the previous instances i mean we're looking at the 10t or was it 10x the 10x guy most of the previous hacks that we've seen in crypto have been crypto insiders or like you know in my mind i always imagine that it's like some eastern european teenager living in their basement or just like you know just just reads you know random transactions on etherscan all day but it turns out that like okay north korea is getting in the game because of the amount of money i don't know if you know like pretty much all those south korean exchange hacks they were all like lazarus right yeah because i actually did an episode i forgot what year that was was it 2018 or something but i had two north korean experts that talked about like why north korea is interested in crypto and stuff so it's actually been going on for a while but before it was like i said centralized exchanges in korea south korea it's scary i mean i mean do you remember that um around the time the uh virgil griffith thing first happened there were these rumors that like the big lps on uniswap were like lazarus group this was like a a very popular conspiracy theory so like who was minting most of the early die wow and wait did so did was that ever confirmed or no no no no no it was like there were some addresses that happen to be depositing into some of the south korean exchanges around the time of the hacks but there that was like it's very like circumstantial like it wasn't it was it was a little bit too much of a justice story but the the the north what i meant by that is like saying north koreans aren't crypto insiders might be the wrong i feel like they actually have been around they've definitely they've definitely been around they've definitely been around but i think the um it to me it's a good reminder so one it means that at least for me i i it makes me more inclined to back off a little bit from how how much i was blaming you know sky mavis although i mean clearly they messed up in a pretty significant way but um it's pretty hard to defend against nation state level attackers and obviously the lazarus group is really really good at what they do and it just kind of means that everything in crypto now is under the same level of bombardment and attack as the most valuable kind of you know state level targets as well um and so it's scary it's a good thing to keep in mind that there's the the standard of security that you need to have in order to withstand all the pressure that d5 protocols and on-chain applications have today is orders of magnitude what it was just two three years ago yeah but i don't i well i mean not to i'm not like passing judgment on the sky mavis team but i don't know if i would if i'd back up on your judgment frankly i guess because the way that the security setup was like it's it wasn't you know truly decentralized it wasn't it wasn't but you know to to um robert made the point in our last episode that look these were probably not all like these were probably all different servers that the attacker was able to move laterally through within their network and then they were also able to find another bug or a daisy chain this attack with this other thing that had this super like it was actually a pretty complicated attack and i would assume that rob was probably right that not all these uh you know not all these addresses or sorry not all these uh private keys existed on a single machine and so they probably infiltrated the entire network well a lot of it was phishing right uh that well they got in initially yeah but we we don't really know exactly what by the way i think i think probably everyone who is in crypto has received one of those i probably got like five a week of these like hey like chris at a16z.com shared uh doc's google doc with you but then you like about stable coins yeah yeah or like i get we get that like twice a month it's just like fishing attack related to stable yeah yeah yeah i get them too the solution is just archive all your email every day you just gotta clear out the inbox and if someone wants to you know they'll message you on telegram and that's uh yeah the telegram spam has been increasing too i i'm wondering if there's going to start being more like spearfishing type things in telegram so be careful yeah but but i just wanted to say like like i actually feel that this particular hack was like similar more to a centralized exchange because of the setup like it wasn't like a normal d5 hack you know it wasn't like an economic hack it wasn't yeah one that kind of like uh you know exploited a vulnerability in the smart contract it was really more like a centralized setup that they were able to exploit similar to the way that they had done with the south korean exchanges so um so anyway so i don't know what that necessarily means that like north korean hackers can hack defy contracts the way that you were kind of implying earlier um i just feel like you know it's it's what i was saying before like it's similar to a centralized exchange but also the security set up for a centralized exchange is like that's like pretty standard or i don't know it's about scanning but it's been around for a long time because centralized exchange attacks have happened for like years right so i feel like it's easier to do security for that kind of setup than it is for like a d5 smart contract and that's why i feel like this guy made this team kind of is you know they they screwed up you know yeah because this is something that probably like most people would know how to prevent whereas like a d5 thing i think is harder to provide one thing though is like they're kind of in this worst of both world scenario because the centralized exchange at least benefits a little bit from security via obscurity like everyone can't see the code for their their actual internal processes and multi-sig and manage key management whereas the sky mavis thing was almost like overly transparent in the sense that you could see it because yes no i mean the fact that four of the nine keys were held by them was actually not like that's true in that you would have been like what the what but um they they obscured that right like nobody knew until the actual compromise like when you had to explain how did you guys get popped and the answer was that well for we actually had 49 keys and it's like what that it's kind of the inverse of it's like insecurity which you obscured yeah yeah but i think you know to laura's point these are more sort of social engineering style attacks which i think they probably have more experience with rather than exploiting you know super obscure you know bugs and and you know solidity yes clearly it was not like a super deep you know there's some corner case of solidity or like some you know vm hack or something but at the same time like it's it's also pretty hard to defend against these at scale yeah right like eventually if you're you know bridges are like exchanges because you have to have like a hot wallet you have to continually be finding things and moving money around and so um it is actually really hard to secure that um but you know look i mean i don't back off entirely from saying this guy maybe screwed up like obviously having four of the nine keys controlled by a single party is absolutely ridiculous but right yeah i don't know that anybody uh is is able to fully resist i mean we just saw a recent hack of where's octa that uh recently got hacked oh yeah uh which is like an authentication company that you could basically think of them as like multi-cigs for normies like that's what octa's business is right it's like effectively emotional i mean it it's they just like do i don't know why they don't put that that seems like that would be a big business it is i mean they are the businesses they're a huge company they're three billion dollar company yeah they're big okay yeah yeah but like in a world where crypto actually succeeds basically like multi-stick should basically replace octa like there shouldn't actually you shouldn't octa as a company might be gone or like they'll just be a front end to a bunch of multisig uh that i'm saying like in the like i'm trying to like give you like the like idealistic future i'm not saying it's like likely oh god no but actually it's interesting that you mentioned that because when i was in miami somebody actually told me about their idea about this and it was actually really really interesting but then i don't know then i kind of was poking some holes at it but anyway the point is i think a lot of people are noodling on this for sure for sure i mean gnosis obviously has the advantage but i think on especially on solana there's a lot of teams that are trying to like effectively do like treasury multisig type of stuff um that will be kind of are are out and out soon so i think people want to really do it i just don't it's like hard for me to imagine like fortune 500 buying this whereas like octa literally has like every fortune 500 company using them yeah so that's that's like sort of the difference as a frame of reference they're a coin based sized company okay so that's okay that's and like every every big company uses them so they are a single point of failure though because of that when i used to work at cvs so i'm sure yeah i'm sure you have a lot of places in the internet use often you don't even know okay so do you mind if we uh detour for a tiny second about the one other technical hack identified this week which was actually quite scary which is like for a certain particular zero knowledge proof uh implementation almost all the implementations had this sort of one crucial piece implemented incorrectly and uh there was this like 20 minute period where i was like trying to look through the monero code to see if like the monero code did the same way because obviously live network a lot of money versus like most of the other ones are like layer twos or in tesla and not totally live but effectively like a very high level description of what this attack is is what can you name the project oh so so trail of bits basically showed that planck which is this zero knowledge proof algorithm the paper for it actually had a bug in like what they wrote in the algorithm like in the in the math and but then everyone implementing it was just like basically implementing the paper directly yeah so they like basically copied it line by line and it turned out the piece that they used they copied incorrectly from like the bulletproof's implementation which is in like partially in monero and on other places so plonk is implemented in a bunch of places like aztec blue i think maybe loop ring um not starkware because starkware is completely different and then a bunch of the snark implementations on different layer ones so like what the one tezos is using yeah the one one the polygon ones yeah so just to give a high level understanding of like what what this bug is it's like kind of a little bit it's not super complicated when you describe it in terms of like uh sort of high levels of treatment of zero highest level description of zero knowledge proof i own some proper some object and you want to know if i have it so what you do is you ask me a series of yes or no questions you say hey is it golden and i say yes or no you say hey is it spherical and i say yes or no and then you say hey is it bigger than this room you say yes or no and so after a sequence of those questions you can be convinced i have it without actually knowing enough about the object that's like the very like five-year-old ex i think that's five-year-old understandable explanation of their knowledge group sure and one the problem with that is it's very interactive so you have to communicate a lot like i have to keep asking you these questions have to wait until you get the response and so there's this thing called the fiat uh shamir heuristic which is basic instead of me giving you this back and forth which is hard to manipulate but very slow i actually give you a sequence of questions all at once but they're randomized and you have to prove that you you or uh answer them in a random order and so i give you some random number and then you give me back the answer in like the correct random order and that's like as if that would be kind of the same as if i ask you those questions randomly the problem is if you don't see the randomness to that correctly it becomes like this deterministic list and you get the same exact ordering every time and that was basically at a very high level what the bug is uh so then people then can like memorize the answer and then always answer the same question back effectively that was that was that that was really great nine out of ten suddenly i understand zero knowledge proofs they just it all clicked for me right there but but but that the idea with that is like you only have to send all the questions at once right it's like i sent you the test i don't don't i'm not doing it like you know interactively yeah yeah yeah so i think the the the takeaway from this was that actually as you mentioned it was a mistake in these papers that were all kind of copying each other and nobody actually understood the particular mistake in the fiat premiere part of the paper and so they were kind of like okay well you proved this part you proved this part you added this thing onto the end of it but like somewhere up the chain somebody should have understood that like hey you have to you have to be very very careful in how you use the fiat should your heuristic and um that sort of got lost in translation and then the engineers were actually implementing stuff you know they're not cryptographers for the most part they're like security engineers or cryptographic engineers but they're not themselves the people who are deriving this stuff in the first place and so it's a good reminder that although you know we talk about this a lot with the spectrum layer 2 is how layer 2 eventually is going to replace everything because it's so secure it's got the same trust model as letter one that's only true if the engineering is like completely sound and everything we know about engineering tells us that there is no engineering that is completely sound there will always be bugs there will always be mistakes and um you see it even in the history of like zcash which has had a history of these kinds of cryptographic errors that were not even the original paper actually the paper was sound but somebody messed up somewhere down the road there's like some basically the equivalent of like a transcription error that just gets amplified down the road and then pretty soon it's like hey although the paper was right because the paper can be proved in this closed form way the stuff that we're doing that like kind of works around the paper to make it implementable ends up having a bug in it yeah it is funny i feel like when i first came to crypto people were obsessed with like consensus level attacks like 51 attacks like that was always a discussion like how is someone going to prevent a 51 attack on this network and like we basically never see 51 attacks like only on kind of the tiniest shitty network and if anything is all these other types of attacks that really proliferated which again is not really solved with like a layer or two necessarily yeah yeah i mean one thing i'd say is um you know my my co-author guillermo always likes to say like the only real proof is actually being implemented and like running in live and like and one of the other things about you know my personal pre distaste i think for a lot of the zero knowledge papers is they're written in this this like the the proofs and the algorithms are written in this way where it's like here is a model of the adversary and here's a model of like the user and like here's an algorithm of like how they interact with each other but the way you analyze how they interact with each other is kind of like piecemeal you kind of like are like this little way of like me sending you a challenge gives you you report with like this type of reply and when you when you prove things like that instead of like trying to prove like broader properties a your proofs are all very case-based so you have like 500 cases and like it's very it's very hard to actually check every single one like as a reader like as a reader when you're reading a math paper you should be like reading it and when you get stuck like you go try to rederive something and like verify the the things but the problem with these proofs of a million sub cases is like no one's going to verify the 128 sub cases right you try to like spot check and like that's effectively for better or worse that's what peer review does too for these papers and so just so i understand what that is that means like when you're creating it people don't go through and test all the things that have already been written about how to implement it they're just like testing specific like random like sort of like a random check at an airport so like when you write like a math proof you say like okay i'm assuming a and then there's some property aim plus b and then b implies c and then c and plus c but the problem is you can also have not linear proofs where you say i assume property a property a implies properties b1 b2 b3 dot dot b128 and then you have to look through all those cases separately and the reader usually that's not considered like an elegant math proof it's usually considered like ugly when you have a lot of cases and like aesthetic people just don't won't read all 128 unless they're formally verified and it's kind of like you know imagine that you were proofreading someone else's book and they had like 500 citations you're like i'm not gonna read like if you have like one citation for like the core thing but if you have 500 i like i'll check a few of them but like i don't know no matter how good of an editor you are unless you're like being i don't know you're working in a swat shop you're not literally gonna check every single citation because yeah that's not how it works in book publishing but anyway but this actually leads me to you know because the the copy editor proofreader or whatever they will read everything and like check everything um i mean not that i've not that i've done this job before i mean well no they're much more rigorous than the mathematicians yeah i mean trust me peer review is a very broken process you don't have to tell me but i do have a question because this is something that i was wondering about in general about like the defy hacks and everything so do you remember back when this was a long time ago but was it called imbtc when they did that like er 77 yeah okay so so just to catch people up in case they didn't follow this there was like this exploit that happened and people were like what were they thinking because the exploit was known already had been known for like a month or something and then they implemented it in this way where everybody knew that it would be vulnerable and so it was just like this is such a stupid mistake but i did have a question because now that i'm seeing all these hacks like so for those of you who've been on my show you might know that i have this checklist that i do um before i uh record and sometimes people are like oh it's like a really good list and i'm like oh you're listening to a list of all the mistakes i've ever made on the show um but it made me wonder like for defy and stuff like is there a place where people are kind of like you know collating all these different errors and where people can kind of like look up like oh okay so i'm about to implement such and such like whether what are the known vulnerabilities like if i mystically implement it this way or that way like are people doing that because if not there are these collections of them but the problem is that you know there's a lot of translation error that can happen where you know you might write in your code base you might write like a equals one i equals seven and you always use that convention but in someone else's code they write baby equals one and iota equals seven and then you have to like go through and translate and you rename the functions like no one is like consistently naming things right there's not like a single the language is the same but like the choice of sort of like uh dialect of like each programmer is actually quite different which leads to these kind of like divergences between like a specification and the real thing it's actually very hard to keep them like one to one okay to determine also due to this point about like you know like non-linear math proofs and like these weird combinatorial kind of issues when like many different factors interact with many different factors i remember in the imbtc thing so i'm btc is sort of like a competitive wptc that's it uses erc777 which is sort of a you know different version of your c20 that adds some extra functions and stuff like that um and then there was d force which deforest was just a pure fork of compound uh v2 which is a money market protocol and so in isolation these things are fine right like a fork of compound will behave the same as compound there's nothing inherently wrong with seven seven seven or three notation but when you put these things these two things together well it wasn't really built for this and that sort of introduced the bug and so it's like right if you're not thinking of all these different you know you have many many different dimensions that these things are intersecting on and one bad intersection can sort of cause you know a terrible cascade so right yeah and automatically checking these things may have more cases than the number of particles in the universe so you're not going to be doing it yeah and that's and that's the thing right like we do have static analysis tools that will automatically run over code bases but to your point it's like backwards looking right it's like the last hack is the thing that you're able to check for and the new hack or like the sort of the generative interaction of multiple different potential bugs like it there there's so many ways in which things can interact in a way you didn't predict before that if you deeply understand how all these things work and how they interconnect with each other well that's just being a super experienced security engineer that's what security engineer is for yeah i have another idea i think samsung should like kind of put his learnings into a course and then train people to do what he does well is that like crazy have like a big uh is it consensus that has like a big repository of all these executives yeah and stuff so there are things like that that do exist that people do learn from and there's a there's a theorem security bootcamp i think called securium yes um i've heard they're pretty good um but the reality is like learning to be a security engineer is just actually really hard because it's like learning to be a great editor right like i can you can read a book on like here are the big mistakes that previously i mean a lot of it's just like sitting and monitoring things and finding stuff and then like no but also i think you have to like think very creatively like samsung must have some like good imaginative tools in his brain to like combine all that to like see things that other people cannot see like he i bet he has a very creative mind well the other thing that is it's very different to be a an attacker versus a defender right like the kinds of people who are very good it's called sort of red team red team is like the people who go in and try to attack protocols and break them the kinds of people who do that are not necessarily the best security engineers right to be a security engineer you also be thinking about how to solve application level problems and make sure that okay we're going to build this thing in a secure way but we also got to make sure that it works that it's performant that the ux is good and you have to balance all those things together or to build a protocol well and of course like with most of these protocols like i mean we see it because we're vcs and so we're backing a lot of these guys you know there there are very few security engineers who have meaningful experience you know doing security on insulin maybe more kind of trite way of putting it is like an attacker only needs a proof of existence they need just like one counter example right but a builder and security engineer need to be for all they need to like consider for all cases clearly one is like way less work than the other right um and like that ends up being like the biggest problem it's like the combinatorial search space for the builder is like just so much bigger than the attacker the attacker just only needs like one right entry point for there are so many more attackers than there are totally totally the way to imagine it is like if to be a security engineer in crypto is like you're a goalie like you know soccer football or whatever i don't know where your audience is yeah but you have to work 24 7 365 yeah but everybody on the field is trying to get the ball and they all have their own balls right like all these different balls are all kicking in you're constantly trying to catch things right and um if one person gets the ball in the money yes right but i didn't see like i i think this is about beanstalk some security for auditing terms perfect perfect perfect yeah you are the ceo you are clearly i was like where did i read this okay so you put it in the notes yes so i will give you the prefix okay yes so beanstalk got hacked this week for 180 million which makes them the fifth largest d5 hack in history so it's been a pretty bad month for on chain x um we had the number one hack with x infinity and then number five with beanstalk so um the attack was actually pretty wild and so i was looking into this yesterday trying to understand exactly what happened so the attacker made off with 80 million meaning that 180 100 million of it was just i guess lost or unclear yeah nlp fees or something but also they like donated it or something right no that's not that's not really okay so let me explain let me explain what happened so um now the thing about being so beanstalk is a stable coin it was like getting a lot of hype on you know remember you guys were talking about a while back so it's like a stable coin protocol and um the governance in beanstalk was designed to be able to protect against drive-by governance attacks right and the way that it does that is right now that's the first time i've heard that and i love that phrase so the idea is that when you put up a governance proposal the governor's proposal has to be live for at least 24 hours before it can be voted on and then if you you know press crosses the threshold of voting then it gets implemented so what the attacker did so they needed some lead time because this is a governance-based attack which is crazy we haven't seen a lot of these right so now normally if you just put up a governance based attack that says send me all the money and then you take a bunch of tokens and you vote on yourself getting all the money obviously no one's going to vote on that they're like who the hell is this guy and i'm going to kick you out right so what they did they did two things simultaneously so first is they they put in two proposals almost exactly the same time so first they put in this thing that was like you know their their government's proposals are called bips like bitcoin but it's for bean stock so they did bip 18 bip 18 was send all the money to the attacker and then they sent in bip 19 but they changed the name of it to bip 18 to make it seem like it was a name collision and that's what they put up on the governance forum and bip 19 which was which they called bip18 was let's donate 250k to ukraine because ukraine's having a really tough time and like it's so great you know we want to support ukraine and so both of these government proposals were live for 24 hours but no one noticed the real bipay team which was send all the money to the attacker and after 24 hours passed these things were up for a vote and what the attacker did so this was the the big mistake that beanstalk had in their governance is that they did not uh make it resistant to flash loans so somebody who flash loaned the the token was able to vote in governance and use that to cross the threshold to implement a protocol change so the the attacker was able to flash loan a huge amount of the governance token instantaneously vote on the proposal pass it right before it ended right before the vote ended oh wait did they do they have the the the borrow live no no no i think they they put the proposal up and then the flashlight was later right oh i see i see yeah they took the flashlight and then voted flashlight was like right before it ended right before right before the period ended yeah yeah so they so they flash loaned a crapload of tokens voted for their proposal right before the proposal window was about to end which passed the proposal which transferred all the funds into the attacker's wallet and they made off like like thieves and and you know dumped all the tokens and washed it to tornado the ukraine wall still got that also also that there was some very clever low-level bit twiddling to make it make the payment to themselves not look like the payment to themselves they routed it to another function call so like if you wanted to inspect it you would actually like have to like go through a few layers before you realize there was a transfer call it was like they were like making it look like it was doing like some very kind of complicated like updating what did it look like it was doing like like it looked like it was like doing some function to compute like what the new interest rate should be or something and it was like like that and then like at the bottom like th this person was actually quite very quite clever this is a very sophisticated attack i mean the thing i personally enjoyed about it was i had a there were like all these people who were just like oh yeah like i made like five million dollars and b and i'm like i can't read their paper without like even being able to like analyze it like forget about their code like the code reads like nonsense because like they just name everything like after a farm animal and like as i'm reading the code it's like pig.tape.herd it's very reminiscent of makeup i almost i almost yeah because the problem is the maker words very few of them were english words or like right right right they're all so for people who don't know so this is a very famous thing that everybody in smart contract world picks on maker now for so maker dao has all these weird words that they invented for concepts inside of their smart contracts that nobody other than the maker team understands so there's things there's like there's vats and there's jars and there's tubs and there's yeah but you know flap flip flop yeah they are real words but yeah they are real words the reasoning behind it though is it forces engineers to build to spec right when you have common english variable names it's like oh well this is the interest rate and this is whatever and you sort of create you know shortcuts in your mind of oh that's what this variable means that was fun that's what this function means as opposed to you know we're going to sort of create this abstract you know spec for what the function what the uh protocol is going to do and you build it this way and then we check to make sure it was built this way versus like you know humans sort of playing tricks on themselves i understand the logic but it's still it makes it very annoying it's incredibly impenetrable because the fact honestly i i actually think their design's way better than this the bean thing was like i was like i remember looking at you like you know what i'm not gonna analyze it it is like a it's like a senior shares coin but with like two extra coins there's like multiple levels of like expansion and contract it's very weird but yeah um someone actually made like a translated version of the maker now code base at some point actually had like the real variable names in yes uh van de san yeah yeah yeah he made it oh i see it but but but i will say i just like enjoy the shot for it mainly because like the the the only other tyrone and twitter who is uh in crypto twitter was the biggest bean shill and like now he hasn't tweeted for three days and i'm like yes you need to tag me on this episode um wow his name is roon on on twitter oh oh oh oh yes that ruined he was really chilling on crypto twitter well i feel like crypto people always yeah i see the biggest deceib uh actually this is a related story so the biggest deceive is the ceo of ifani which is like a phone porting oh yeah yeah you know him yeah yeah so like i remember i met him in a cafe a long time ago because he was like you're the other hasid i need to meet you and i'm like okay i don't have the same need but it sounds like you really want like this is very important to you and so we we we met up and he was um he was working on leandroid at that time which was like a big ico at that time and um he was like i have the twitter screen name haseeb i'm like i know i know you do he was like it's like he's like yeah it's really important to me it was like i can tell he's like but i don't have hasib.com it's like some doctor in the uk and i'm trying to get him to sell it to me can you help me and i'm like no help him i don't know i don't know i'm like no i don't i i feel no affiliation despite it i know i know but he's he's definitely uh he's crushing me right now so i gotta i gotta play catch up he's crushing you how so he's i mean just look he's got to see he's got to see the twitter handle i'm playing from behind well i think you have more followers i i don't think that's actually i don't think it's true i think he has i think he has more followers than me oh so yeah i'm eclipsed in every way by the other receive it hurts this this other rune has been on a very fast growth path because of the word cell uh structure yes that's right that's right he's the inventor of the word i think that's so stupid you think it's so stupid i do okay about people love false dichotomies humans are just like easily bandied into just beliefs it's not a false dichotomy it's a it's a it's two axes yeah yeah whose probability of success is one half plus epsilon or epsilon is 10 to minus 80th is not very useful okay i didn't understand yeah whatever i don't like simplistic things like that jump down things like that and i also don't like it that it like somehow like immediately portrayed journalists as like in some negative way and i'm just like oh this is like part of the whole whatever silicon valley like bashing of journalists and i was like oh that's stupid okay let's let's so you're in a very interesting position because you're like you're you you obviously have been a journalist but then you're covering crypto twitter what i've been a i am you are a journalist you are yeah you are a journalist well i mean i think what you do now is like much more than just journalism oh really how so yeah i mean i think it's like you're i mean you you you're more like a commentator you know like you've taken on a broader role i think you have well i mean i get interviewed by the press but like yeah i mean i still consider myself a reporter fair enough okay okay well you you might you consider yourself before i don't think of you as a reporter i don't think of you as a reporter but um i i think i think most people think of you as just like you know you because you're not affiliated with a brand i feel like it's very rare for reporters to not have their own like i feel like you know all these guys are going somewhere like crypto louis thoreau you know you're documenting all the weird that happens in crypto but you're amongst us yeah exactly exactly you're one of the people you're not like uh you're not like uh like i'm i'm from forbes like hello right now tell me all your secrets and then i'll write about you yeah but hunter s thompson it's a different relationship it's a different relationship with what you're covering than i think for for almost any reporter well i mean i feel like my understanding of crypto is probably beyond that of a normal reporter but like the way i conducted my work i still think of as journalism and i'm not doing any differently from how i did it at forbes except that like yeah i probably go deeper into it than you would for the forbes audience but people often do think of me as being in crypto i do not think of myself as being in crypto i think that i'm like as close to being in crypto as you can be without actually being in it what does it mean to not be in crypto well because i'm a journalist covering it so there's like you know i'm like if you guys are all like the players playing the game i'm the referee where i'm like kind of in the game but not in the game like i'm not supposed to play i'm not you know but you did you said people can we're convinced by you to like join and you know change their life oh well yeah yeah you're playing the game i mean you might you might think you're not playing the game but you're part of the game you're a referee wearing uh uh yeah you're like you're like you're like in the wwe when the referee like tears the shirt off and like starts beating like you're you're in the game oh my god i don't think of myself that way i mean like like do you think that i'm like influencing events in crypto that's a normal journalistic thing to do like you you know find out like who did this thing that's what i mean i mean people on crypto twitter who are like calling each other out and getting into fights i would say journalists and crypto have not had as much success at doing it right like the satoshi thing is a great example it yeah so i don't know like if you're successful at it i think it somehow does impact the market oh interesting but i don't think revealing who the dow hacker was affected the market at all well not not in the sense that like it impacted prices immediately but impacted how people's perception of certain projects was right and certain people at different times and maybe yeah it's like their future i think maybe part of it too is like frankly i feel like the bar is very low for crypto journalism in general like there's there's maybe five crypto journalists i think of who are like smart and competent at their jobs and obviously you are one of them and so it's like thank god we have laura to actually like cover the industry well because that would be kind of screwed so i'm serious no yeah but i i wouldn't be too hard on journalists like for getting things wrong because the the i mean this is like the basic thing about journalism like like i've had people like my like my mom for instance she was a pharmacist she's retired and she like couldn't understand what i did because she learned this body of knowledge and then she like applies it every day right and like my job is i'm supposed to take things i don't necessarily know and learn them fast and like learn them well enough to explain them to other people and it's a skill it's like not like having the knowledge it's a skill so it's more about like being able to learn quickly and then being able to like explain things well yeah in that regard like i don't feel like i'm a crypto person anyway whatever like you get what i'm saying like like you guys have the knowledge like i don't think of myself as a crypto person like i can learn things and whatever but like i'm not in there doing it like yeah people often come to me and it's weird like sometimes people act like like they think that i know like everything in crypto and i'm like no no no no i'm like behind all my sources my sources are the people who really know what's going on and i have to like do my best to like eek it all out of them but like you know i basically harass them a lot till i get that information but i don't you know like it like if you were to ask me right now to do something in defy or like on ethereum or whatever it would take me like i don't know like five hours like i would be like he would like people would lose all respect for me they would be like oh we thought she knew what she was doing cryptid but clearly she doesn't because i you know i i spend all my time like creating content i don't spend all my time like actually using this stuff whatever i like call people up and i want them to tell me things so it's just different yeah you would also be surprised at how many professional investors in this industry have all themselves never used crypto oh yeah no that actually doesn't surprise me because i actually think journalism and vc are like not that different yeah it is true that a lot of the early tech crunch writers became like ventures exactly it was like very like soon after yeah but techcrunch is like i think especially chummy with the industry it covers in a way that like the wall street journal is not you know like techcrunch is like a kind of a different animal than like other media but anyway okay but we didn't we never got to my audit point about the beanstalk thing so can we talk about that oh let's talk about it yeah because like so you know somebody tweeted about the beanstalk thing like oh and they were an auditing company they were like this is why we only pay ourselves by the number of vulnerabilities that we identify so they were saying like we get paid by you know every time we find a vulnerability when we audit something we earn money from that but like they were saying that other companies just charge by project or whatever and so there's no incentive for them to like actually find things that went wrong because they're going to make the same amount of money no matter what so this company was saying like we're incentivized i don't remember if you wasn't it you that put it in there it was the other ones um was it peck shield actually yeah i don't think i don't think i don't think we linked to it okay i mean there's this other problem though that happens because like if you actually look at different audit reports different auditors will consider different types of things vulnerabilities different security and like there's no like standards yeah for what a just the basics of like what a low medium and high vulnerability are every other makes ones that are different and like obviously biased towards with the things they're better at so like i'm not so i feel like you're it's kind of you're going to have this like good heart law type of thing like if you make that the thing everyone's just going to optimize for like the low vulnerability ones that everyone has by accident which are actually gas saving things but like and it it'll it'll have this good heart type of thing of like the toad the metric you use will suddenly get like well there's never i mean like that's true no matter what you do though so like i can believe that it would be better but um at the same time like i mean it's a good question of like what are you actually buying when you buy an audit and the reality is that like okay one thing you're buying is like okay if there's an obvious vulnerability we want you to write it up and explain it to us but a lot of what you're buying when you're buying an audit is you're buying like a stamp of approval of like basically a trusted third party saying like you are good and it is safe to use you right now the the vulnerability here in beanstalk like the core of the vulnerability was really that you did not have to lock up funds in order to vote right that was the core vulnerability and it allowed a flash loan to go in and participate in this vote which is like if you remember maker dow had to scare a long time ago yeah who was who like published brandon curtis what was b protocol that did it called one thing to go through and they're like oh that's right that's right yeah and so so maker had this big scare that like all of maker could have been turned off or something you know some horrible thing could have happened through a flash float and so naker was the first one to say okay we're going to make it so you cannot flash loan governance um but this is a very basic vulnerability that beanstalk could have done to mitigate the whole thing the other very basic issue is they don't have a delay between when a proposal is passed and when it's actually implemented so something like compound even if a malicious proposal goes through there's a 48 hour delay between libby before it actually goes live and seems like 0x and those other protocols well they did have a time lock the problem is their time lock had like some sort of like the two proposal thing actually messed up their timelock execution oh really no no it's it's actually not it's a little bit more subtle uh unfortunately with that like the the person who did this did not notice a lot of like kind of nuance about the time i'm curious about that because i know there's like obviously between when a proposal goes live and when it can be voted but even like you know again for compound even something gets approved like it doesn't actually go live for another 48 hours yeah yeah yeah so so the problem here is that when you have two proposals that are proposed at roughly the same time you have this problem where like the time lock only really applies to one if you don't set it up correctly and so a lot of places will just be like you can only have one proposal live at a time or like or they have to be staged in some way whereas the beanstalk thing did not have that i see did they roll their own governance no everyone just modifies compound like pretty quickly but they didn't include those parts yeah so in general after these defy hacks how did they get like how did they turn into real money do they and because like a lot well we've seen that a lot of like exchanges or whatever will kind of blacklist the addresses but like are people actually getting money out of it oh yeah it depends sometimes it is very hard to liquidate um like you know if you have a stable coin and you can't get across the bridge but in this scenario there's put a bunch of ethan like tornado cash and then depending on the size of the anonymity pool for the asset also that you're hacking you may or may not be able to anonymize it effectively but i think for this amount it should be like too difficult depending on how long they wait and how long they are you know it is significantly easier for bitcoin though i will say like oh interesting just like the volume of just like wasabi which now we all know you can de-mix that so yeah yeah you can de-mix it with a lot of resources right so the question is like is someone willing to pay that much to do mix and and so for like an 80 million hack it might actually not be like you might not get someone who's wait hold on are we actually do do we all agree that you can just d mix wasabi transactions now oh i because i registered i think uh when we originally talked about this i was like i'm skeptical of this yeah that reminds me i know we'll discuss we'll discuss this another time what because there's a video i will somehow have to find this in my twitter mentions that i did mean to watch where someone like made some video where they analyzed kind of like what happened with the dow hacker and like what happened with that d mixing and it was like a twitter handle where i was like oh this person would definitely know and i meant to watch it i never got to watch it so let me do that okay i've had like such a whirlwind two months or whatever so to be continued yeah yeah but at least you're right some partial information that's right if you if you messed up if you messed up kind of post mixing like yeah i can totally understand that there i just think the bitcoin mixing services have way more liquidity and and also the tornado withdrawal sizes are like they don't have enough yeah they don't have something like 10ml a day yeah yeah that's why i'm saying i agree the 80 mil could get out but like if it was bit like the ronin hacker would be something you can yeah yeah i mean didn't they just like mass sell on curve and just turn the bean into yeah into the ufc so then how much do they get 80 million wow okay because okay so then that answers my question because the question i was going to ask is like i thought that a lot of these people couldn't even cash out because you know cashing like turning it into a different asset is one thing cashing out is another thing yeah yeah do you mean like getting into dollars in the bank account well just getting away with something where they can actually make money from it what however you get like you know you can sell it and report it as income i think the irs is very explicit that like they actually don't care if you're committing crimes as long as you like declaring taxes on it um oh my god so you think these hackers are paying money on their hacks you could use it like other other income i mean if they don't want to get caught by the irs they should be paying taxes that's how they got al capone right yeah wow yeah it's fine to do crime as long as you pay your taxes well but the reason i was asking was because i was wondering you know some of these bounties are like somewhat generous i mean well so one of the i don't remember which one it was but one of them was like roughly two million or something and i was like oh well if they can't really cash out then like it's better if they they can do that they can catch that one okay yeah well yeah clearly try to renegotiate and i said hey you know send us back 70 you can keep eight for yourself and uh we won't let go after you won't look after you like it'll be done and right that's the guy so yeah that does not sound like it wouldn't work i do think it's still a little hard to like sell all of it at once not at once you know i feel like usually what people do is they really where your collateral and then they start just like collecting you know kind of like earning spread and by perps and things like like like buy bit used to be kind of the exchange that the hacks the hackers all go to because they never did no yeah yeah yeah they used to just never came and seen that right i mean there's still a few non-kyc exchanges but they don't they don't most of them don't do that much there's no volume yeah you can't really get out there yeah so also most a lot of banks won't like ach to wire to them and stuff so it's like you you kind of yeah i mean after assuming those these attackers are not american anyway so but they still may want to wire to a real bank account eventually yeah right yes because like i i we're not in the world where everyone's using stable coins yeah for everything yeah yeah uh yeah at that size it becomes it becomes difficult but look if you're north korea then if you're north korea it's fine right yeah obviously if you're in north korea then yeah you're not gonna you're not gonna pursue a bug bounty you're probably not probably not okay the last piece of news um that i want to discuss was so a lot of what i was i feel like i was getting on twitter and a lot of chatter from people was about the merge being delayed and um i feel like this is like the biggest non-story of all the stories this week that like somehow everybody was talking about this and i was like how on earth did you think that like the ethereum foundation was going to hit this deadline of all the deadlines they've missed in their entire lifetime like clearly they're awful at software estimation and we should just like bake that in through the numbers that goes but somehow like nobody was doing that it's probably because there's been so many delays that like it just feels like at some point it's gonna happen and so yeah when people were saying june and they were saying it for kind of a long time but you're right i had tim baker on my show last i listened i listened to it yeah yeah i thought it was like again like very non-answered like oh we're not good at estimating i'm like yeah we know we know you're not going to know but i can't remember if this was in the recording or not if you just said it before but he was just like i'm surprised that people are all up in arms about this because he was like i kind of offhandedly said june and you know it wasn't like a fixed thing but everybody had it like as a fixed deadline it's exactly the problem with your theater foundation that they're like well we just say things why would anyone care what we say like we're just well i i also i also i also i also i think a good if someone wants a little data science project to dox a lot of the development correlate the commit times to the hackathons and you'll see this like it looks like a heartbeat it's like that's why they have to have a hackathon every month because otherwise nothing like really totally gonna check that out yeah there's like a lot of weird correlation with the hackathons but one other one thing i would say is like i think that the longer that's delayed the weirder or worse it is for each security because like the sheer dominance of staking derivatives at this point and the percentage of the network that's like sitting waiting for like in the one-way contract just like uh and having like safety it's being levered kind of just like means that there's just gonna be this huge amount of cell pressure as soon as the network goes live because there are all these people who've locked up capital for all yes sure they're earning some interest on their stakeholders somewhere but it's not like a lot and there's just an enormous amount of capital locked up that's just waiting for it to come out on the other side and like all those people have to sell at some point right like especially if they're funds they're gonna get like capital calls et cetera right i i don't know how many funds are gonna return but because we don't know how much is going to come in the other way right like once the opportunity cost of staking goes way down because of the fact that you can actually go two way i think you'll see a lot of capital is like look i'm not going to risk going into proof of stake when like i don't know that proof of stake will ever actually be that two-way street and even when the proof-of-stake merge happens it's what like another upgrade until people can actually withdraw but but i just mean the people who are going into lido there are people raising funds that literally are just taking like five percent fees just to put you into lido yeah they're people it's the same as these people raising funds to go into anchor so there's there's these people who are raising funds where they're basically charging people five percent to take stablecoin to take dollars and they convert to ust and then they put it into anchor get twenty percent oh yeah yeah yeah back then yeah yeah there's a ton of people doing the same exact thing for lido and they're all doing the levered light or so to give some context if you have a bunch of eath you want to lock it into the bridge contract so you're validating the beacon chain you can earn interest on your ethereum but you can't really get it out so you've locked it up and you're earning interest but you can't actually remove it staking derivatives allow you to pull each with other people's eats and then there'll be validators that go earn that yield and then there's sort of this iou called state teeth that you get and state teeth is extremely liquid and then every d5 protocol so you could effectively treat it like ethan it stays pegged actually weirdly stays pecked because theoretically it should actually be worth more but everyone is discounting exactly by the rewards which is like a very funny fact it's sort of like a weird weird anomaly in some ways like other staking directors don't have this property and so people have the stake deals but it's all an iou for the real youth right and they can't actually get back there really and if people are raising these funds where they're like hey we'll earn we'll we'll go do the whole like staking thing for you and it's like some institution that like bought a bunch of eats and they're like well you know we'll we'll take five percent you get like the remaining those funds eventually have to close out right they have and they're not either they're going to return state deed to the if that happens then everyone who gets to stay teeth is going to just sell for really eventually right so like there's some some there's some kind of the longer this takes the more the crazy levered behavior we're seeing we're seeing people like lever up on stake these like crazy actually like babylon finance really something this week where i mean this is your whole thing around basically automate the the strategy of putting on stake teeth borrowing youth turning into steak d putting it back and just like levering up and you know they're estimating like eight ten percent using this strategy but the question is just like when do we see each interest rates go up to sort of compensate and like exactly on the market and this whole ultrasound money thing only works when this type of levered game is not happening yeah like that is going everyone wants anchor yields like dough has basically made it so that everyone has to be chasing 20 and like everyone in east land thinks that's not true but when you look at what's happening with stake east it's like oh yeah everyone is literally just trying to chase joe yeah this is this is why the fed's hiking race they're like we gotta we gotta match anchor right now really competitive out there i i just yeah i just wanted to point that out there's like something weird on the financial side that i feel like the developers don't seem to give a about because everyone in every heath developer i talk to is like drivers are dumb like they'll never survive and it's like well actually there's such a huge portion of youth in there now that it's a little bit not true that's fair wait so i know this is like a slight detour and we don't have to address it right now but i am curious what you think of the whole anchor thing because like i had uh kevin joe on my podcast i love that clip you you had the twitter clip of his thing was excellent frank yeah i mean because like he thinks it's not gonna you know it's not gonna pan out and it's definitely you know just gonna go south at some point um so i was just curious like what you guys thought because like yeah just if you follow that whole thing on twitter like there's very polarized views on either side yes well first caveat we're investors in anchor so we we invested in early round what's up what's our view i don't know i i guess i'd say like i mean so anchor did modify the protocol so that the interest rate can actually move over time so it can now adjust compared to what it was before which is like this flat 20 percent um but it's over much i think it's like once a month it can yeah we can calibrate by like a percent and a half or something like that so it can't actually respond that quickly or in real time i guess it's like closer to the fed i guess and then kind of very staggered moves you know by and large i think the biggest risk is not actually to anchor itself but more to terra although they're both obviously very interlinked at the end of the day like all these algorithmic stable coins have to get exogenous usage otherwise it just doesn't work and so the question i mean kevin was sort of pointing like look there's no exogenous usage for this which like okay i mean i mostly agree so the answer is that they got to get exogenous usage otherwise the thing's going to break i i think another interesting thing that scares me more about it and this is not necessarily a knock on ust this is more a knock on the type of people who are putting ridiculous amounts of money into anchor he's like a lot of the dumber trad five people that i i've i know uh who are like don't probably couldn't tell you what a hash function is they don't know what addresses they're the ones who are really aping into this stuff and putting in like 100 million dollars into like um like these anchor funds and they don't they don't know anything about crypto they're just like someone told them 20 on cash and they're just like god and so that scares me because i'm like wow that that it's like it's like this psychology people who don't even know what they're investing in there's always like the that to me is like feels very like big short yeah something about that's like scary going back to the crypto journalism stuff we were talking about earlier there were like two um profiles on doe out this week and luna specifically i think there was like one in bloomberg and like one in the journal i i just feel like it's it's a testament to like crypto journalism like where have you been for the past year like you know this has been a thing for the past year like the luna ust rise and it's like oh now that it's at you know whatever 10 billion or whatever it's like oh what's going on with like luna what's going on with like anchor i'm like what like i was like um yeah just very and anyway there was a lot of concern and yeah about the whole anchor ust situation but i just have to say like that's the nature of our job is like news has to happen and then we like write about it so it's like always like after the fact but anyway i think the one thing i do really appreciate i think long term for usc from a developer standpoint if they can get to it is actually building good smart contracts on cosmos that can interact with all the other cosmos chains and like if they do that i think the usage will come i i actually am more bullish on the cosmos like app chain world for certain types of applications i mean the problem is that usd supply is so big they have to i mean right well the united supplies are big because they're these random like private equity yeah they're at that size now it's kind of like when you grow your government too big you have to like find some use for them otherwise it's going to be extremely painful to get rid of people and same thing for companies right but like governments are the most obvious example because they tend to they tend to get bloated and then not like you you're not controlled exactly exactly and the problem with ust is kind of similar it's very difficult to drain usd and say okay this thing got a little out of hand let's like kind of wind things down a little bit and like it's so sensitive to deleveraging that it's very hard to do it the answer has to be you have to find the growth to justify your current supply yeah then they need to do a qt you know then you start winding it down yeah yeah and that's probably well so i i i didn't know that much about these headphones and these uh anchor yeah no they're just people marketing these like vehicles right they're like oh there's like that's very you can't get 15 on anywhere else in your dollars just give us dollars we're only putting in dollars that's ridiculous yeah no that is scary and it's funny because like so many of the pitchers that we get are like oh you can use anchor to like bank the unbank you can go start a neobank in like you know africa or in indonesia or whatever and you can give them 20 interest it'll be so great everybody will sign up for this and like the story from anchor from the beginning has been like anybody can go get interest on get yields on stables i mean the difference between the outcomes i think for tara and cello are that you know cello tried to go for the banking the unbanked narrative and i mean they're converging like people with money people with money and everything and it like clearly you know that that did have a cycle i mean it's funny because i mean there's like so many of these like crypto backed neobanks out there that are basically trying to do this right hey give us dollars we put in a compound or ave or something else like not necessarily anchor specifically and they've had a lot of trouble growing and people have sort of thoughts as to you know why that is like they're not spending enough on acquisition or whatever but one of the thesis and sort of what i've heard from some of these companies is like it's really hard to advertise we'll give you eight percent on your dollars like don't ask questions and because people think it's inherently a scam so it's very funny to me that like at least anecdotally from them retail is like very skeptical of the eight percent yield institutions are like sign me up that sounds yeah middle of the bell curve is where you die it's unfortunate yeah um but so i don't know if this is like taking us too far off talking and also i don't know what the time is but um i feel like just to go back to your cosmos comment i feel like i hear a lot of chatter about cosmos but not about polka dot and i just wondered for a reason yeah so yeah explain that to me do you want to explain i don't know if there's like a pretty strong reason other than like cosmos was able to bootstrap a lot of liquidity like it's just easier to boot to get started writing cosmos app chains um and once osmosis became kind of like the connector so the cosmos model i would say the initial weak part in my opinion um you know obviously extreme cosmos fans will probably maybe disagree is that the atom coin has pretty much no usage there's no reason to actually go to the hub which is like the the main place that adam is staked and instead it would be much better if you had like something like a dex that was sort of like secured a dex chain that was secured because then everyone has to go through there and it kind of like had can kind of have this like you know virtuous cycle and so osmosis did that that kind of bootstrapped everything in cosmos because everyone in cosmos land was running their own app chains like no one was using ibc but then you the killer app for ibc was really dexes and like being able to go between these chains and like have liquidity on different chains and i think the ux on cosmos chains the wallets are really really magnificent i think like probably the best acquisition in crypto in the last two years was the osmosis team buying kepler which is the main wallet and is probably the best wallet for crypto better than phantom better than metamath better it is the best ux period wow i will also try it you should try it yeah there's about to be a new record for best acquisition but that news will probably come out soon well i i still i think that the price that the osmos that that was the best acquisition like like they literally made the whole ecosystem it went from a billion dollars like 17 billion because of that wallet yeah and they paid a very tiny amount relatively specific right and then what about polka dot so i think the the thing about polka dots so there's a bunch of stuff about the actual tech stack and also about kind of how top down uh polka dot has always felt relative to cosmos which has always been kind of more bottoms up that was also much older i still also caveat where early investors and cosmos as well but um the big thing that i think polka dot messed up is the pair chain model and the pair chain auctions right so like polka dot decided that in order to use polka dot instead of like on cosmos where you just you kind of you know it's much more open-ended and you kind of you know you find your place in the columbus ecosystem and you care about your own niche the idea for polka dot is like hey if you want to use polkadot you need to sign up for this auction and you pay a bunch of money or like you know stake a bunch of assets and compete in this like big pageant of you know who's going to win the next auction like oh it's going to be this guy or that guy and so projects have to raise a crapload of money to pay it to polkadot and wait or raise debt and wait a very very long time until they get actually integrated and win the the auction now if you're an entrepreneur and you're like okay i could go to any chain i can build anywhere because i'm an awesome entrepreneur and i'm in very little supply because there aren't a lot of ground first and you say okay well i can go to solano where they'll pay me a lot of money i could go to avalanche they'll pay me a lot of money go to polygon where they'll pay me a lot of money um i could go to cosmos where i could like build bottoms up and like do whatever i go to polkadot and pay them a lot of money right wait what why are you asking people to pay you money when like everyone else is understands the transaction goes the other way you need to attract developers not charge developers yeah and polka dot like just has well in order to be sustainable we got to charge people otherwise what's the point of dot yeah but it's great for dodd bad for polka dot and cosmos is like great for cosmos but terrible adam is dogecoin yeah it's honestly like it it it truly doesn't really have much of a purpose they tried to make they basically try to copy osmosis build the decks build a bridge all this stuff but like none of their they just kind of missed out on liquidity i'm curious actually to get your your thoughts on no no there's a new cosmos proposal right now to basically like allow people to use existing cosmos validators so like sort of bootstrap their own like validator set which sort of more polka dot like like what do you think of that i think the liquid staking is effectively the easiest way to do that and like that's why i think you're seeing a lot of these chains have these staking derivatives where basically like i can pay validators validating another chain in this other chains coin which is basically a version of the polka dot crowd loan except because there's so much liquidity on cosmos it's like actually easier to bootstrap because it basically will feel like wideo to the end user but i actually think that the polka dot crowdlawn model is actually very elegant the problem is it's like impossible bootstrap for this reason like who wants to pay to use it sorry and like yeah they have this thing called a crowd loan where basically you pay some portion of your token supply up front and then people basically fund your wii with dots but then again the dot folder base is not that diversified so you don't really it's like i think if there were like more dot holders who were like not super close to the original team like there you might see more you might have seen more crowd loans no but the flaws that you're describing now that i know more about cabin from writing my book they sort of make sense to me actually what do you mean i was going to say you're the gavin expert here so you should be telling us about polka dot well but from your read of the book like do you agree that it sort of makes sense for his personality totally yeah it's like kind of megalomaniac style like everything has to go through me yeah like yeah i think that was yeah it was so this is cryptopians yeah it was pretty interesting i think there's like always these like cult of personalities around early crypto people or crypto people in general like i know a lot of people cite their investment thesis for polka dot being oh well cabin what is the cto of ethereum like yeah but like what what do you know about gavin and when he found out what i did he engaged me in this kind of long conversation about crypto and at a certain point he was like what about cardano as he called it and i was like oh my god and then i said to him i was like you should read my book i was like if you're interested in this you should read my book but no i mean sounds like the worst dentist appointment ever if my dentist started talking about i would i would not come back dentists are exactly the demographic 100 the average user of cardano is a dentist no no the average owner ever sorry that's right yeah it's getting some stuff it is it is the thing that nomad is bridging to they they have an evm chain which is generating almost all the transactions it's like none of the cardano native apps are running yeah wow that's hilarious gavin does have a lot in common with dom from dfinity i feel like it's very simple oh my god that is such a good call i never thought of that yes yeah so i mean that's the thing it's like everything in crypto that works has been very grassroots right well i i should that's not true that's not true uh not everything most things in crypto well bitcoin ethereum yeah solana probably is like biggest exception solana i think avalanche is also you know less grassroots i think uh terra obviously terra's like the least grassroots yeah but i consider all of those like new and non-established solana avalanche tara sure but i think i mean cosmos i think is very grass roots there i guess there are different approaches right so maybe that was a bad comment because i think we've seen success in both both different yeah i think it is very more bizarre and less much less cathedral like any time anyone comes in with like their their master plan of like how to solve crypto it's like this is not going to work like what did we say about stable climate inventors very related to that discussion last time okay well i think we're over times we're going to wrap for today um so thank you laura for joining us today as a very special guest i hope i did a good stand-in of robert you were very robert like you were you were almost as good as the robert i didn't say gm gm you did you did well [Laughter] you did you did you did bring a lot of deep daddy energy today what was it lending daddy lending daddy you didn't bring a lot of lending daddy energy yeah sorry to do it all right well that's it for today thank you everybody for listening and uh i think next time we'll be back in the metaverse so yes we will that's it all right all right thanks everyone you
