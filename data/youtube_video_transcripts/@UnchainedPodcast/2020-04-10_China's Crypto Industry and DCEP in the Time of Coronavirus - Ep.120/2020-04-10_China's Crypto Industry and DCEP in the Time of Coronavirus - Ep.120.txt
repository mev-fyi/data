hi everyone welcome to unconfirmed the podcast that reveals how the marquee names of crypto are reacting to the week's top headlines gets the inside scoop on what they see on the horizon I'm your host Laura Shin in response to the challenging times crypto to calm is waiving the 3.5% credit card fee for all crypto purchases download the crypto comm app today today's guest is Matthew Graham CEO of sino global capital welcome Matthew hi Laura pleased to be with you here today since China was obviously the first country to experience the world's big out the first the world's first big outbreak of the corona virus since this originated there in Wuhan describe first the economic impact so we in the West might get a glimpse of what we're in for but also note any differences that you think might exist because you know China's an authoritarian country as opposed to a democratic one I like especially one thing I'm curious about is like the level of unemployment that we're seeing in the u.s. if you know China saw anything like that sure so first I think they as backdrop here's how I tried to explain to people back home in the States in January and February because people had started asking questions I saw Han what's going on what's that all about and I would phrase it thusly I would say because it's the only way I could get at the resume I would say look I lived in China for eight years now I work in crypto that's the wildest region and the wildest industry keeping that in mind is by far the craziest thing I've ever seen in my life this is like nuts that's how I would try to explain it to people back home in January in February because I'd literally I had no way of I had no way of establishing a frame of reference so people could appreciate the gravity of the situation so that that's first kind of as backdrop but what it all happened really really quickly which I'm sure resonates for people elsewhere in the states etc have been now gone through it as well so at first there were some really alarming things coming out of one where the information was scarce and conflicting but what I always like to do is just focus on the actual government actions rather than the messaging to try to get an understanding of what's going on and the government actions were so draconian that it was clear that something was extraordinarily wrong so that was kind of the first thing that we saw and I'm based were based in Beijing but typically I spend at least half my time traveling throughout China such as today and so during this period of time I was I was traveling in various first and second tier cities and the situation continued to get more and more severe and at this time I was I was sorry I'm traveling right so I'm staying at a hotel plan to stay there for for about seven or eight days and so the hotel's five-star hotel normal capacity 200 rooms so about three days into my stay and like everybody's gone so and so I stopped by the the front desk and I said you know how many people are still at the hotel and what's normal for this time of year this is in mid-january right and they said well normally we'd be fully booked at this time of year but you know we've gone from more than a hundred out of 200 rooms booked a few days ago and they said we're down to five or six and and so shortly after that a few days later they they closed the hotel so it just it just escalated so fast and everything was a very extreme experience my last day I thought you know staying at the hotel it's like me and like one other guests with the huge hotel and they sent all the staff home except for you know like a handful of people so it's like three pieces it felt like I'm like in the the Stephen King hotel right in in the movie it was like a abandoned hotel practically and last one there almost right so all this happened in such a short period of time where it went from very alarming news in area that at that time was about 1,500 kilometers away from me to now they're closing everything down everywhere very short very short turnaround time for that whole process to happen and no and was that similar to the US where like that resulted in really high unemployment or like how how was that all managed like who is the economic impact you know like you know I mean yeah it's just I'm curious to know how it's being managed economically sure that's a great question and the short answer would just be yes it affected everything the initial period of time was over the the the initial period when it escalated so very very rapidly happened - with the exception of Wuhan which was a few days earlier but nationwide happened to coincide with the Chinese New Year's holiday which is of course the biggest holiday of the year and it's you know people take at least a week right so it coincided with that but then and then that ended up just being people took an extended holiday and then he kept extending but you know again running back to your question the short answer is yes and actually that was what was so hard for me to communicate to family and friends back home I mean they're frankly they're used to crazy Chinese story China stories you know that I that I felt but but it there's no right way to explaining so I'm trying to explain the whole country shut down like the whole thing so and that's really what happened so the difference I would say is that starting I'd have to go back and look at my calendar but let's let's call it two or three weeks into January starting at that point whereas in the West there was more of a period of I should speak more of the United States in the United States because I follow that obviously more closely it's my country right so there there's been a very delayed response very straightforwardly there's been a slow response and there's been a lot of debate about things like the extent and this is continuing actually right but there's debate about the extent to which there should be social distancing whether or not people should wear face masks things like that so I would say that the major difference is the decision was made in a very short period of time to effectively shut everything down basically well almost everything essential workers and services only and then you know you literally there wasn't really an extensive debate it was just everybody pulling inside everybody's gonna go inside and we're gonna stay there except for its central workers so now that china is opening back up do you feel like businesses are kind of like quickly bouncing back and are they doing so equally and what is consumer confidence like so these these questions quickly become complicated because of the data quality and data integrity issues and such in China with the official statistics and things like that I would frame it thusly the initial period and I think you gotta take a step back because these are related so the the initial period in December and through at least a good part of January the initial response period response performance quality was was not good and and I think that the kind of like many other places as well kind of tried to wish it away and and and we're gonna dig we're digging our heads in the in the sand and it wasn't handled well since then since they made the decision to take drastic nationwide steps I do think it has been handled overall pretty well and I think it plays into this the strengths of an authoritarian society very importantly right where we can just say look you're gonna go inside and we're going to use big data to implement these extensive contact tracing algorithms and we're gonna do all these things and we're not gonna talk about privacy or how it makes you feel we're gonna do it so these are authoritarian strengths right very very straightforward drinks and air quotes well no actually yes no no give me you're absolutely right look I mean I'm I'm a fan of the Chinese people who are amazing authoritarian is a tricky topic and I probably can't talk about it too much but every system whether you or I are a fan of it or not every system does have strengths and weaknesses so I think if you do have a top-down extreme command and control capability built into your political system certainly in a time of crisis that there are some strengths that go along with that but you know - yeah it's your point I should just clear that yeah yeah well I was gonna say that obviously we have that there are democratic countries who also have managed it well like South Korea and Germany and you know like I think Taiwan so you know it I don't think that that goes Hansen but so let's do this let's take a quick break because we're gonna hear from the sponsors to make this show possible and afterward we will talk about how this will all affect the crypto community in response to the challenging times crypto comm is introducing three measures to help the community first the 3.5% credit card fee for all crypto purchases will be waived for the next three months second you can now get up to ten percent back by using the MCO Visa card on food and grocery shopping lastly you could buy gift cards on the crypto comm app from merchants like Whole Foods Safeway Burger King and more and get 20% back on food and 10% back on groceries download the crypto comm app today back to my conversation with Matthew Graham so how would you say sure so that the thing that I wanted to run back and I wanted to provide context before getting back to your initial quote the thrust of your actual question so the the point I want to make is that I think that the statistics regarding covet 19 probably are more true than not but I would but what running back to your question I'd be very skeptical of the economic information that's coming out because it really was a situation where much of the country shut down for a very long period you know a period of many weeks actually right and since then there have been a factories ramping up again and there have been other types of businesses that are more in the work-from-home mode but there's still a lot of travel restrictions I didn't check today but I checked a few days ago where if I wanted to go to Beijing I would have to even though I'm in China now but if I wanted to travel to Beijing I would have to be quarantined for 14 days there are still very extensive restrictions in place even though we know that one is is opening up again things like that so I tend to think the coal bed numbers are probably mostly true but I'd be very sceptical and cautious about genomic data Oh interesting yeah yeah and then the final thing I just wanted to express is that your point about countries that are democratic that have handled the situation very well I based on what I know I do think that's an extremely an extremely true point it's just that we really are trying a special lesson so I'm familiar with my own country and with especially mainland China and not as familiar with some of these other regions that's all yeah yeah yeah from what I can tell in those other countries the key was aggressive early testing sue let's talk about the crypto community how did the shutdown affect the crypto industry there and then what are you seeing in terms of opening things back up so I think that it probably affected the crypto industry mostly just through the market volatility I think that was probably the primary factor I think that most likely was pretty similar to how crypto was affected in other countries as well were was just kind of a shock to the system to see the dramatically increased volatility as well as as well as especially one very dramatic decrease in prices so I think that kind of period of time where there was a period of time where people were a little shell-shocked I think that was probably the primary impact at the same time I think it's important to note being a subset of blockchain it's important note that although this app dcep the Chinese digital currency national currency digital currency is still very much a top line item pipeline priority 4 for the mainland Chinese government there were obviously obviously has had some delays as a result mayhem wreaked by but do you know if there is any kind of like increased impetus to develop that because of the difficulties of keeping cash clean and virus free keeping cash clean was a real thing that happened where they were actually destroying paper money mostly as I understand it one because of the obvious concerns that's I would view that more as a short-term super-weird thing that had to happen or that was perceived as having to happen I'm not sure something like that would become a major factor in the impetus for implementing dcep I do think that larger concerns about needing to really get to get economy up and running again could increase the impetus certainly it was certainly it will be pushed back at least a little bit weeks if not once as a result of everything that happened but to your point I it's at a minimum it's still very much a top-line item and then even possibly because of the concerns about drag on the economy 2020 GDP potentially it becomes even more important because of those things yeah yeah even in the u.s. they were discussing using digital dollars excuse me using digital dollars for the stimulus so in terms of the crypto industry there one obvious place that people are looking at right now is what will happen at the time of the Bitcoin having because you know the Bitcoin price did suffer a little bit and I've also heard at least of some mining companies in the West that shut down because they were deemed or I don't know about shut downs but you know we're affected because they were deemed non-essential businesses and had a hard time keeping their farm staffed so you know what are you hearing in terms of mining in China sure so actually two nights ago I had dinner with a group of investors including one of the largest miners in China 40,000 836 I think that's a fair amount right my name is not our core competency but we have because it's not something we do ourselves we have many mining friends but for example two nights ago having dinner and drinks with a mining friend of ours fascinating guy by the way he started out the miners by the way the Chinese miners I think are the most fascinating people in crypto they they're almost like like 19th century Texas oil drillers in terms of their personality they're real cowboy types and they're just so interesting and they're just so down-to-earth and super cool but anyway so funny mine who started out he was an electrical wiring type business but at a large scale where he was the I guess the number one company that did electrical wiring for an entire Chinese province so it's a major business and then almost on a whim five or six years ago he entered the mining business and it's like a side hustle but it's a side hustle of considerable size he's got 40,000 he six but anyway and and he mentioned two he said he's never sold it because it's inside it's just almost like a hobby and he's just he just accumulates so these guys are really interesting I was talking to him and I think overall the the Chinese miners are less likely to be affected in a dramatic way than some of the international miners for a variety of reasons but you know certainly a major one is the electricity cost in China is extremely competitive especially in regions such as as such one province where many of the miners are located and from talking to various minor friends including the one I just mentioned overall I would say that the mining mood and China is cautiously optimistic going into the having the consensus seems to be which I would agree with that it is a bullish event but more of moderates feel not something akin to what we saw in in previous having have having's happenings okay well we're a bit over time but just for a last quick question you know you work in VC and I wondered what you how you think the coronavirus will affect venture capital and you know if you have any words for crypto entrepreneurs I think that a lot of so I would phrase it as yes I personally I think that if you look at the historical returns the 2008 vintage was one of the best in recent years so a lot of people are gonna get gun-shy but we look at that very much as an opportunity we don't one of the cool things about us is we kind of combine a lot of different things China and Western knowledge finance and technology but also we very extreme in terms of being independent thinkers so we don't we don't really care we don't we're happy to be the first money in we don't really care what other people are doing but a lot of people are gonna get gun-shy no question and I think that's an opportunity for people that don't from a VC perspective from a crypto perspective I mean it could be kind of if I were to put myself in a crypto entrepreneur entrepreneur shoes in the project shoes I think it's gonna be tough for people like 2017 no question but you just got out you got a really cut down on expenses and focus on product and and try to make it through a tough period probably is what's gonna need to happen that's just you know the the straight-up truth there's no sugarcoating okay well I guess we will end on this tough love note um so it's been so great having you on the show thanks for coming undone confirmed Thank You Laura okay let's jump into everyone's favorite news recap first headline 11 token issuers from 2017 ICO craze served class-action lawsuits last week 11 lawsuits alleging securities law violations or filed in New York federal court against token issuers and crypto exchanges involved in some of the biggest icos

civic cue coin and others in the block steven pally writes these lawsuits will be dismissed by the defendants in press releases as ambulance-chasing lawsuit rolling but it's not quite that black-and-white upon closer inspection referring to a preliminary injunction that asserted telegrams Graham tokens are likely securities Palli continues without judging the merits of each case I personally find it hard to believe that it will be too hard to prove that a substantial number of these tokens were in fact securities under US law he says probably the first question to be resolved is whether or not this jurisdiction can be applied to these defendants who are in places as wide-ranging as from China to South Africa from the Cayman Islands to Singapore next headline the

Western capitalism generally if foreign businesses can bypass America's gatekeeping banks what Washington will lose its power to impose sanctions on other countries also if they no longer face
