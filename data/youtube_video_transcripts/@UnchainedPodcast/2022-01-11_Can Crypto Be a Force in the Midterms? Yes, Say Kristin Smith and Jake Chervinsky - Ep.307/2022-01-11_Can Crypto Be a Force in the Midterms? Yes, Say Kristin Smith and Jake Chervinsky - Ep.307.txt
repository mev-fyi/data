here to discuss are kristin smith executive director at the blockchain association and jake travinsky head of policy at the blockchain association welcome kristen and jake it's great to be here thanks for having us laura we are starting 2022 after a pretty momentous year for crypto advocacy in washington for people who may not be aware that 2021 was such a big year for crypto regulation and lobbying kristin can you give us a recap of what happened that made it such a watershed year yeah well i think um at the beginning of the year i was wondering if we were going to make it and at the end of the year i know we're all going to make it so i'm feeling pretty good about that but if you look back to where we were last year at this time we had an outgoing administration that was pretty hostile uh not not across the board but but at least within the white house at the treasury department uh pretty hostile toward the crypto ecosystem and uh we were actually at this time uh working with paul clement kirkland and ellis preparing to sue the treasury secretary um over a midnight rulemaking that would have been um very harmful to the ecosystem dealing with unhosted wallets um and you know if you kind of look across the year i think that what happened in january with this midnight rulemaking started to wake people up to the fact that oh gee we really need to be paying more attention to what's happening in washington and it wasn't until august when um once again there was a last-minute provision uh that was starting to move through the senate that we really saw the political power of the crypto community for the first time we had a tremendous outpouring um that was really something that's very unique to crypto because crypto can communicate quickly we are used to processing information very quickly we can get out messages and and the community activated and got over 40 000 phone calls into the senate over the course of five days and and it was it was a around washington like this this was noticed and i had colleagues from other industries calling like how did you do that how did that happen and i was like this is a very powerful community they're very very in tune to what's going on and they're not afraid to speak their minds and so it is because of of that event in august that so many companies across the space have started to think about washington invest in building teams on the ground to work on policy issues in washington and i think now in 2022 we are finally starting to see the the infrastructure in place to be an effective advocate and educator in washington for the first time so i'm super excited looking forward i think we've absolutely turned a corner and that there's still a lot of work to do but that we are going to have the resources in place to be effective and jake you've been on the show before but that was in your previous role as general counsel for compound labs which is behind the defy lending protocol compound what made you decide in late 2021 to join the blockchain association yeah well it's it's kind of funny so i worked very closely with kristin and the blockchain association for both of those events you know pushing back against secretary mnuchin's midnight rulemaking and then uh trying to work with the senate to change the tax provisions that were snuck into the infrastructure bill and after both of those events i think i came to the point where i realized the way that i can have the most impact for the industry is not as general counsel for one crypto project but rather it was to spend all of my time working closely with kristen and the amazing folks at the blockchain association as head of policy and you know i probably spent about half of my time when i was in house working on policy anyway uh and i really just decided that i wanted to wake up every day and just think about how can we move the ball forward to advocate for good policy here in the u.s and also you know i went really deep down the d5 rabbit hole over the last few years and i really love that experience i had a wonderful time at compound but i also as as folks who have heard me on your podcast before uh you know i also am a true believer in the future of the entire industry and i felt like it was a good time and a great opportunity for me to step back and start wrapping my arms around all of the amazing you know different unique corners of the industry so so really you know what what did the the trick for me in the end uh after kristen and i were you know all day every day for a few weeks in august on phone calls you know late into the night working on the infrastructure bill um what really did it for me was uh you know conversation after you know everyone had sort of calmed down from from that experience and kristen said you know if you come to the blockchain association uh you can run and build out the legal and policy function however you see fit and you know let me know what you need and we'll go out and get it and to me that was just an offer i couldn't refuse so i'm really excited to be in this new role as head of policy at ba i am also excited that he is in this role yeah kristin i mean you you've definitely been um not exactly a one-woman show but you know clearly you've really put in your time so i think it's great that you've been able to expand your team so at the moment you know i mean we're coming off this really you know watershed year as i said earlier and i was wondering how you felt uh the state of crypto policy and regulation is in the united states at this moment you know i think it's i think we're in an okay but not great spot um you know there there has been guidance you know over the years we do have um some areas of policy that are a little somewhat settled right i mean i think if you look um at least for the moment and kind of the bank secrecy act like there seems to be at least for now a steady agreement as to how that applies to the crypto space um you know if we look at tax policy uh i think there's more work to go but there are some basic things that are in place now now the um you know implementation of the broker definition and uh 6050i there are a lot of questions around that that that we're working through um i think securities laws are still quite a bit unsettled i think um people have sort of moved forward um and and are you know the ones that are here in our building are confident where the policy stands but you know i think agencies have tried their best for the most part not not exclusively or not not entirely but um have done their best to try to figure out how crypto fits in but you know these laws were not written with crypto in mind and i think that having a fresh look at the framework and figuring out how to make some changes and modifications to make it instead of like a square peg and a round hole a square peg and a square hole you know i think that that is sort of where i see us going over the next few years um you know of course we're probably going to have a few more defensive things going forward that we need to to look at but jake may feel a little bit a little bit differently than i do but i think it could be it could be worse but it could definitely also be better yeah and from my perspective i mean i i agree with that i think um i am approaching 2022 with a lot of optimism i think that one of the things that um that we gained from last year is a lot more attention and desire among regulators and policy makers to genuinely understand what's going on in this space i think before last year there was an assumption among most policymakers that crypto was just a flash in the pan that you know maybe bitcoin would survive but that there wasn't really much interesting going on around that and i think that all of the work that we ended up having to do you know even in a crisis mode last year showed policymakers that there is something very real here right there's a reason why billions of dollars of investment is flowing into the space there's a reason why large traditional financial institutions are excited about finding ways to incorporate crypto into their business models and so i think that we still have a huge education project that we need to carry out in dc right the more that people understand what is going on in this space the more reasonable their approach is and i think to the extent that we've seen some really unreasonable attempts uh to you know force through regulations or other rules or legislation that doesn't really make any sense for the crypto industry it's come from a perspective of ignorance or just lack of information about what's really going on in this space so i'm actually very optimistic that with this opportunity to educate people on dc about what's really going on we'll have a much better opportunity to advocate for and be proactive in advancing good policy for the industry and i think the last point i would make is crypto is sort of a sexy topic now in dc right everyone wants to to have a piece of what's going on in the industry right they want to be around um what's going on here i think part of that is driven by celebrities taking an interest in the space uh and so i i think you know although often we talk about how there's going to be a regulatory crackdown or the sort of loudest and most hostile voices in the room tend to uh soak up a lot of the attention i actually i think that the perspective in dc is looking pretty positive this year and for those loud and hostile voices you know earlier when you were saying that you felt that most people with a negative stance simply don't understand the issues or ignorant have you you know and we don't have to name names because i understand you have a lot of relationships that you're you know trying to either work on or preserve but i you know i was curious like do you find that um they are people who have either not received that kind of education from you or are they people who no matter how much you quote unquote educate them they just want to remain you know in that negative stance or kind of what do you think is yeah well i think i think a lot of the the you know with the exception i will name names of like the brad shermans of the world right who just decided that they hate this thing i i think a lot of what we've had um even you know even within the house financial services committee were a bunch of members who [Music] didn't want to take the time didn't have the interest um just didn't didn't really care about the space and so when asked about it the only thing they knew were the negative headlines and so they kind of revert to like oh i saw this was used in a you know some criminal activity and that's what i want to talk about but they've had to rethink that right and it was because of the outpouring of the community's support during the infrastructure debate um you know those those that just you know didn't want to get into it realized oh great and the g i have to figure this out this is something people care about and i can't just delegate this to gary gensler or something right like they they realize that they have to learn about it because their constituents back home care about it and so that um that sort of awakening and realization um that this is something a broader set of people care about has been has been a critical piece and so i do think over time as people realize all of the different types of things you can do with the crypto network and even just what a crypto network is it's you know such a fundamentally different way of organizing economic activity you know they do start to get excited about it we i don't think we've had a situation where somebody's actually sort of a policymaker has gone down the uh rabbit hole and come out the other end saying this is really bad stuff right once they truly actually understand it um you know they can have a much more educated conversation and and you know realize that this is going to be something that's here and part of our economy going forward i was just going to say i i won't name names but there is a specific conversation that i'm thinking of that i wish i could name names and tell you more details about but um what i can say is a specific conversation with a particular policymaker who everyone would recognize as someone who has been very hostile who once this person learned about and honestly you know we should talk about this a little more but the web three narrative this is someone who only really understood to some degree the concept of bitcoin which is a very challenging concept for policy makers right uh once this person learned sort of more about the web3 narrative the idea that this isn't just about highly volatile or speculative alternatives to the us dollar or something of that nature but rather that that this uh industry is trying to build a new and more fair version of the internet uh there was a lot of progress there in the thinking uh for this person so i you know kristen is nodding right now because i'm sure she's thinking of the same conversation that i am but i really do think that these narratives are breaking through and we see both folks who didn't take an interest before starting to take an interest and folks who were purely negative or hostile before starting to come around and so obviously this year we're looking at a midterm election year and i'm given everything that happened last year and how the lawmakers did see what a galvanized community uh the crypto community is i wondered what you thought crypto or what kind of force you thought crypto would be in the midterm elections i i think it's been fascinating i think there there are multiple candidates across the country who have decided to make crypto policy part of their campaign platform um i mean it's absolutely amazing we've seen this in ohio we've seen this in california um we're seeing it in oregon um this is a really really amazing thing to see and it's it's because they see that this is a community that's vocal on twitter right where they're trying to create a name for themselves um and i do think there's a political giving component to this i mean one of my one of my top priorities for this year is to get the crypto industry more organized around supporting champions of crypto um and this includes long-time champions who have been with us from the beginning but it also includes building you know supporting candidates and building relationships with candidates and sitting members of congress that you know are interested in learning about the space and want to get more involved you know a lot of people don't like money in politics but the reality is it's a really valuable tool for building relationships and i think it's one where so many people have done so well in this space that you know we need to give a little bit back and kind of invest in this process because um you know that is something that as i remember being a congressional staffer on the hill and i had ideas about legislation i wanted my boss to do and i would take it to the chief of staff and you know one of the questions they always asked again you're not supposed to ask this but it's asked is well can we raise money off of this and and so it's a really important piece of the puzzle and i think it's one that the crypto community is uniquely poised to have an advantage in um we just need to get people more organized more willing to open up their checkbooks and support you know their local congressmen and and also those candidates that that are making this a priority in their campaigns the other point i would add to that beyond fundraising and i mean all that is absolutely true and fundraising is very important but the other point is in an election year uh candidates are really looking at their constituencies to try to figure out what do people care about right what should my policy positions be and i think that even in 2020 during the last election cycle in dc there wasn't really a lot of reason for candidates for office to think about crypto it just really wasn't on the radar at that time now it is and i think what this means is candidates are realizing that there are millions and millions of americans right the people they want to vote for them who care very deeply about this and one of the many ways that they see this is actually on twitter i mean this is something that has really shocked me as i learn you know more and more about how dc works but uh you know members of congress and candidates watch twitter very closely right often they pay more attention to what's happening on twitter than the phone calls that are coming into their offices or the you know the emails or the letters or things like that and when these candidates tweet something positive about crypto they get more engagement on those tweets than basically anything else that they ever put out there and that really moves the needle so i think aside from you know just the question of can candidates raise dollars for their campaigns on this issue they're realizing this is something that really matters that they need to have a position on and that they can't just act like brad sherman and and get away with it with their constituencies i actually i have to say i find that hilarious um well you know they're politicians right like they're like what are people saying about me they're obsessed with it and they're looking at twitter okay good good to know good to know that that's what my representatives are up to so one other thing i wanted to ask about was obviously we saw with um the fight over the infrastructure bill that crypto provisions and and for listeners who maybe you know are newer basically it uh proposed some tax reporting and other kind of requirements around crypto that didn't make sense in terms of the way terms were defined and things like that like it would be basically not possible for certain actors to comply with these uh regulations and so we saw at that time that the amendments to improve this would be introduced by both democrats and republicans but the general perception i would say is that the more vocal critics tend to be democrats while the more vocal supporters of crypto tend to be republicans and so i wondered if you thought that all you know all these things that we've been talking about in terms of how uh interest in crypto from their constituents and the money to be had in this community and uh frankly the popularity of pro crypto uh stances if all that uh you thought might influence uh you know what we're seeing in terms of this somewhat partisan-ish split i think the if there's a partisan gap that that is closing um um yeah i think republicans and and you know partially kind of the libertarian origins of bitcoin uh republicans kind of historically have tend to be more excited about this space than democrats but there are very compelling messages to both sides of the aisle and i have to be honest i was pretty worried about it in kind of the april may june timeline um especially again when elizabeth warren went on her bitcoin mining energy rant at a uh it was like a cbdc hearing or something it had like nothing to do with bitcoin but uh but yeah i began to be very worried about it in fact i almost thought to myself gee do we need to just drop trying to educate democrats and go all in on republicans or you know i was thinking through all sorts of scenarios in my head but infrastructure brought that back right i mean having ron wyden come in um and be you know he's such a long time leader on internet policy generally having him come in um i think was a game changer and you know even in kind of the aftermath of infrastructure there was a letter with i believe it was 10 or 12 democrats in the house to nancy pelosi saying we need to do something about this um i think that this um and in what jake was alluding to earlier on the web 3 narrative i think that's compelling to both sides of the aisle so i think we've definitely turned a corner on that it's you know still maybe slightly more um republican support than democratic but but that's shifting very quickly i totally agree with that and i think you know this is another point where um until now i think most members of congress just haven't paid a lot of attention so yeah there have been more loud voices in support on the republican side and maybe against on the democratic side but it's still just a tiny tiny fraction of congress overall and the vast majority hundreds and hundreds of representatives and senators just haven't really thought about this issue yet so i think as we move forward we're starting to develop much stronger arguments for progressives especially around the potential benefits of financial inclusion and like i said building a more fair version of the internet that isn't controlled by big tech companies which is a major concern for for a lot of democrats and progressives so i think that crypto is bipartisan or nonpartisan i think it will increasingly be and stay that way so the infrastructure bill as we discussed you know showed how easily the community can be galvanized but that was you know a reaction to a negative event or or you know um event on the horizon brady dale of coindesk sent a great question over twitter and he asked what's the ground game how do you plan to mobilize this support yeah well i think you know i think there is a couple elements so going back um before addressing um brady's question yeah crypto has really only been reactive right um we're very good at reacting by the way when something negative happens like we've got that playbook down that's great but being proactive is is a much more difficult thing um and you know it takes it takes people working in coordination it takes professionals in washington that are you know not going to the same congressman over and over but spreading out and inter you know educating more congressmen it takes people coalescing around the same ideas um and there are definitely a lot of ideas floating out around there um but there isn't a consensus yet within the industry about what exactly would we want legislatively right i mean there's been some great ideas the token taxonomy act the digital commodity exchange act you know every single bill that tom emmer has introduced you know lots of great ideas out there but there hasn't been anything in kind of a comprehensive way um and i think that you know 2022 from the policy maker side is going to be like all right let's get everyone educated let's talk about this over and over and over until it's starting to make sense but from the industry side we really need to figure out what we want and and that's one of the reasons i'm so excited uh jake is here is because he he's taking a fresh look at everything out there and and it's going to be a process i think to get everyone coalescing around the same ideas but but it is a process that is doable um and it's going to take some some time and some coordination but jake probably has deeper thoughts on specifically what those policies could look like yeah i mean i i mean that really is sort of uh how i envision my job right is stopping being so reactive and defensive which is really all we've been able to do so far and coming up with proactive ideas of what what goals do we actually want to achieve and then how do we rally support around them right uh it's really hard to rally support for just sort of a general pro crypto sentiment what we need are specific initiatives whether that's legislation or efforts at rulemaking or something like that where we can actually rally people around that idea and then push for something that we can actually achieve right something that would be a concrete goal that we can get done i think that the challenge especially in this year in an election year is we probably only have maybe five or six months of the year kristin probably knows more about this than i do but maybe five or six months where members of congress are really paying attention to legislation and then everyone is going to be overtaken by the election so it's really hard to get legislation to move in an election year it's also extremely hard to get legislation to move in this congress at any point in time right our congress is generally pretty gridlocked it's it's hard for them to get anything done let alone get something done on on an issue as controversial and novel as crypto so i actually think honestly one of the things that we will be most successful in rallying support around this year is around the elections right is around which candidates do we support where do we do fundraising where do we you know raise awareness around candidates who if we could add them to congress that going forward in 2023 and beyond we will be able to achieve some of these goals that we have and so i think you'll hear us talking a lot more about the election as time goes on and not just us right i mean one of the most amazing things about the the crypto community is there are so many amazing leaders in the community who take it upon themselves to get active in this way so you know ryan selkis admissari is one phenomenal example of this and missouri is a new member of the blockchain association but he's been very vocal about this concept of being a single-issue voter right voting on the basis of whether a candidate supports or is against development in the crypto industry above any other issue that might motivate a voter so i think that that's really what we're going to see a lot this year and what is the blockchain association's budget and given the wealth in the industry do you feel that your organization and others like it such as coin center or hotel pack or the chamber of digital commerce or others do you feel that the in that you know groups like yours receive an adequate level of support no send more money i need more money yeah i i'm super transparent on our budget so you know if you look back to you know 2019 and and 2020 um you know the operating budget all in for all of the people doing work which again wasn't many was about 2 million like that's that's embarrassing right the valve manufacturers association of america spends more money lobbying in dc than that um you know this past year uh the blockchain association i think we were closer to about five and a half or six million in total expenditures and you know i think we're looking at about 10 million dollars for for 2022 at least at the moment hopefully that'll that'll grow but if you look at you know mature trade associations in other industries they're very easily you know 20 30 40 million dollar a year budgets and and most of that money goes to people right you have to have um people like jake who are thinking about policy you have to have lobbyists um we just hired a new head of government relations dave rimaldi or ron hammond too many in the crypto space now you know we need to be able to pay people to be present and and and communicating um you know we also need lawyers those don't it's not not cheap to try to to sue the treasury secretary you know that costs a lot of money um you know we have marketing consultants that are trying to figure out how can we better you know explain these ideas to people so um it's really um a very people intensive industry and i think that you know we you know the blockchain association at minimum needs to double the number of people working on it we're at um 11 right now we have two more starting at the end of the month so we'll get 13 full time but yeah we need we need to double or triple our budget and we've had some companies that have absolutely stepped up um kraken the digital currency group uh filecoin foundation gave us you know a bunch of money to help turbo charge this and um we've also been doing a matching drive with our members and and um a vast majority of them have come back and said here's more money for next year you know go build it but um yeah it's you know this is a non-profit um effort here and um our only um you know source of revenue is is from the companies that are members of the association so um but yeah everybody's been very generous but you know we need to continue to grow that and you know i think that that this has been a very successful industry and we need to um you know start putting putting more money in and it's been great to see that a lot so many companies are starting to meet that challenge let me just take this opportunity to say how amazing kristen is and what a phenomenal job she has done on a shoestring budget for the last two or two and a half years it is to me unbelievable how effective she has been and the amazingness of this organization she's built without having even close to proper funding i will tell you we have 10 times more ideas of initiatives that we could carry out than we have funds to actually pursue those initiatives there's almost no limit to how much we could do if we were to increase our resources and so i think you know i'll leave this to kristen because she is the expert on this but i you know everyone in crypto has done extremely well over the last 12 to 18 months that's wonderful it's it's great that everyone's gotten really rich i think that it would also be great for them to pay it forward and protect you know the industry by investing in this policy infrastructure which has been built out in a pretty amazing way in the last 12 months or so as we've been discussing but there's so much more that we can do and it just requires us having the resources so that we can do it all right so in a moment we are going to dive into all kinds of juicy topics uh you know in the crypto regulatory space but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible join over

laura link in the description back to my conversation with kristen and jake so in the fall the president's working group on financial markets as well as the federal deposit insurance corporation and the office of the controller of the currency released a report on stable coins recommending that stablecoin issuers be insured depository institutions that custodial wallet providers be subject to federal oversight and that stablecoin issuers be limited in their affiliation with commercial entities what is the blockchain association's take on these recommendations i think the general idea that regulation for stablecoin issuers is appropriate is a fine idea i think we all understand that where there are risks that are created by stablecoin arrangements that are in some way similar to the risks created in traditional finance it's reasonable for us to have a nuanced conversation about what those risks are and what kind of federal oversight might be appropriate in order to make sure that people who are using these products aren't exposed to risks that they're not aware of right it's so important to make sure that folks know what they're getting into when they decide to use or purchase a financial asset including a stablecoin i think we completely disagree that stablecoin issuers are like in short depository institutions or that the same regulatory requirements that are imposed on those institutions would be appropriate for a company that is for example holding u.s dollars already in an insured depository institution and then issuing a token that trades on a blockchain representing a claim on those dollars the risks posed there are just orders of magnitude less than if you are an actual bank uh that is is you know carrying out all the types of lending operations for example as as the large banks in this country do um i think what was really notable about the president's the pwg report was the recommendation or really the the um the urgency around saying that congress has to take action in order for stable coins to be regulated in some way i you know it's very rare for the government to admit especially for the federal agencies to admit that they don't have regulatory authority or jurisdiction to regulate any type of financial activity whatsoever but the report basically goes as far up or as close to that line as they possibly could without actually saying hey we do not have jurisdiction to regulate these these assets so i think that this conversation appropriately should be in congress and i know that there are a lot of members of congress now who are thinking very deeply about this uh senator pat toomey is one of them he's issued some principles around stable coin regulation that i think are really really uh you know sharp and smart and on point so i think we're going to see some proposals coming out of congress and that is really is where the action should be just as the report recommends and china has issued a central bank digital currency or cbdc and other countries are considering issuing one in the us we already have a lot of private us dollar based stable coins is your sense that the us will eventually go down the road of issuing a cbdc or in general like what is it that the blockchain association would advocate for when it comes to dollar-based stable coins so i i wrote an article on coindesk about this recently i would encourage listeners to take a look at this i do not think that the united states should pursue a cbdc um i think you know we can talk about if there is the potential for a cbdc that would not box out the private sector from also creating uh their own types of stable coins and maybe there is some room for us to talk about a cbdc that would either compete with the private sector if the government wants to compete with the private sector i suppose they're welcome to do that i would be curious you know how effective the government is going to be competing uh in the private markets but um you know certainly they're allowed to do that if they want to i think another really interesting idea would be a cbdc that is open source that the private sector could build their own solutions on top of i think the concern though is that the government will instead of supporting private sector development of these technologies instead say the private sector is not allowed to innovate here the government is going to have a monopoly on developing this type of technology and that is exactly the opposite of how the united states of america has traditionally and going forward in the future can compete with our foreign adversaries right the chinese model is for the government to have absolute and total control over everything going on in uh you know in development of technology the way that we out compete china is empowering our private sector to do what they do best to figure out what the market wants and then to build those products and services better than anybody else can so my concern with any development of a cbdc is that it will either chill innovation in the industry or will stop the industry from doing again what what america does best i i think in terms of whether there will be development of the cbdc there's a lot of interest in this and the boston fed has been working very hard on a proposal which i think has not been been published in its entirety yet so we'll have to see what they come out with um so you know i think uh practically speaking there will be a lot of discussion uh going forward about whether there will be a cbdc how quickly uh we will actually see development of one i think is another question government tends to move slow under the best of circumstances i think it would take a very long time for them to put out a cbdc but we'll just have to wait and see what the fed's proposal looks like let's talk about the securities and exchange commission a number of tokens started out centralized and then are working toward becoming more decentralized over time sec commissioner hester purse has proposed a three-year safe harbor for such tokens which would grant those teams a grace period in which to decentralize what's the blockchain association's opinion of this proposal and also your sense of whether or not this would ever be adopted or in general what might be a solution if not this one i think it's a really good proposal it's um very well thought out um probably some ways it could be improved like anything but really appreciate commissioner purse's leadership on this front um i don't think it's something that gary gensler is going to pick up and adopt um but i do think there are a lot of people in congress that like the idea there's been legislation that has been been introduced and and i think it's really good to get these ideas out there so we can discuss them and debate them but yeah it's not something that's going to be enacted anytime soon yeah i would just add um i i think that the safe harbor the underlying principles of it are outstanding uh which is when it comes to the the driving force underlying the policy goals of the securities laws it is closing information asymmetry between the issuers and the holders of assets and the purpose of the safe harbor is to say we need to craft disclosure requirements for issuers of assets that actually make sense for cryptocurrencies and for other digital assets in a way that the rules for issuers of equity securities right companies that are going public just just don't really address it in the way that we would want i think it's an example though of how quickly the industry is moving and how hard it is to come up with rules that you know survive even a couple of years of development and advancement in the space the safe harbor is really focused on icos right development teams that are creating usually layer one you know native tokens and then selling them to investors and that's really not what we've seen in the market over the last couple of years so i think that the goals of the safe harbor are exactly right i think the safe harbor itself is is unfortunately probably not going to move forward but hopefully we can come up with something similar that achieves the same objectives i think that's the right way for us to adapt the securities laws to what's going on in the crypto industry and so when you say that what would that look like because um and then just to lay things out for listeners at least my read is that chair gary ansler of the sec believes that a number of crypto assets are securities and so that the issuers do need to be registering with sec and providing registration statements and disclosures and then it seems like maybe and again tell me if i'm wrong that he also seems to think that the exchanges would also have to register so um i'm presuming that's not the blockchain association stance i could be wrong but um yeah what kind of what do you think would be a reasonable middle ground and what do you think of gensler's stance that is certainly not our position i do think that you've accurately diagnosed what chair gensler at least has been saying about the space i think as i was mentioning before as with so many policy makers there's a lot of education that needs to be done uh when i listen to chair gensler talk about d5 for example it strikes me that i'm not sure that he has a full and deep understanding of the difference between for example a centralized financial institution that is taking custody of the assets of customers and then lending them out for example or a centralized exchange that is operating a central limit order book as compared to a decentralized exchange protocol that uses an automated market maker uh look these are these are difficult and nuanced issues but i think there's a lot more education that needs to be done i think when you consider the realities of these very new and very unique types of protocols what you see is a very different circumstance from a traditional issuer who is an essential actor in an investment scheme who should be making disclosures to the public so that the public can understand the likelihood that that central issuer will make good on their promises to increase the value of those assets that's just fundamentally not what we see with the vast majority of digital assets out there now to the extent that there are digital assets that are like traditional securities and they are masquerading as something decentralized when chair gensler says some of these assets are decentralized in name only i think that's a fair take and those assets probably should be treated like securities and i think it's incumbent on the industry to understand where that line is and then figure out how to make sure that these assets function like commodities not like securities and it's just going to take us quite a bit of effort to explain that to the commission and then come up with like i said before a disclosure regime that for those assets makes sense so that we can close those information asymmetries facilitate capital formation ensure market integrity and achieve the commission's goals in this new context so a16z andreessen horowitz crypto released a report outlining how it thinks crypto should be regulated with the suggestion that there be a single crypto czar they wrote forcing all digital assets into a regulatory framework designed to cover investments in centralized enterprises such as corporations does not work what do you think of this suggestion to have an overarching regulator politically not feasible or practical for sure that's true i think even if it were politically feasible it's just too early right i mean this goes to the point i was making earlier uh a proposal from even a year and a half ago about securities regulation based on what the market looked like a year and a half ago just doesn't make sense anymore and i think for us to say today we know how this market should be regulated we know that we need a brand new regulator just doesn't make a whole lot of sense i also i to me i i think that as we play this out over the course of years and decades basically what we are building here is just a technological upgrade on the infrastructure that we've already had in the financial system and we've never created new regulators based on the presence of new technology before we've assigned to the appropriate regulators with competent jurisdiction the role of regulating the same types of conduct that uses that new technology personally i don't see why we would approach that differently now but to the point maybe in 12 months i'll have a totally different view based on what the market looks like then but i do think it's good to throw these ideas out and discuss them and debate them i want to i want to clarify that um but yeah i just we're not going to create anything new yeah my sense of why they were proposing that was simply because of the sheer number of regulators that the crypto entrepreneurs have to deal with it's which yeah we don't need to get into that but um it's something like in the dozens which is a lot bananas that's a lot so defy has come up repeatedly and it definitely seems like regulators and lawmakers are very concerned about decentralized finance and in particular i think they're concerned about the current lack of anti-money laundering and know your customer processes on these protocols what do you think is the best way to manage privacy on one side with preventing d5 for being used for illicit purposes on the other side so i actually don't think that there's as much concern as a lot of people make it uh sound like you know we just got new data from chain analysis uh recently um which said that only 0.15 of crypto transactions involve illicit finance uh that percentage continues to decrease year after year after year and you know we also heard secretary ellen uh you know give an answer recently about her views you know she's the treasury secretary this is her job to make this decision and what she said basically was she stands by fincen's guidance from may of 2019 that that you know adequately addresses anti-money laundering concerns in the crypto industry and it's consistent with guidance from the fat f uh from from 2021 so i actually don't think that this is a huge concern among regulators um i think that there are also many different new projects in the industry that are trying to give more insight into um you know financial integrity and the risk of abuse of the crypto system by bad actors i think that it's going to take a very long time for us to figure out how do we handle anti-money laundering in a disintermediated financial system um but i i think that everyone is up to that challenge and no one is particularly concerned at this moment uh about how to handle that well one question is during the fight over the crypto provision in the infrastructure bill i did see some commentary that people felt that the real target of the provision was defy um what was that the case or what was your take on that i do think that ultimately and you know tax reporting is is a separate issue from anti-money laundering but i think for tax purposes yes i do think that the irs wants to understand who is realizing capital gains in the defy ecosystem and you know those requirements the tax reporting requirements look a lot like the anti-money laundering requirements in the sense that they also require a central intermediary to identify the users of protocols and collect personal identifying information from them social security number home address birthday things of that nature and yes i do think that one of the goals of the the addition to the infrastructure bill was to capture defy um i think we're going to get some guidance from the irs on this at some point uh hopefully soon um certainly this year and maybe in q1 of 2022. um i'm again optimistic maybe i'm too optimistic but i'm optimistic that at this point uh the treasury department will understand that the vast majority of digital asset transactions are on centralized exchanges that look just like traditional brokers and defy is such a complicated concept at this point um that we don't need to jump out ahead of the anti-money laundering of concerns uh and solutions to try to capture d5 under a new tax reporting regime so i think this is an issue that again is going to play out over time but i don't think that uh and maybe this is just wishful thinking but i i don't think that there's uh imminent regulatory pressure to fundamentally alter define market structure in a way that will change tax reporting okay i guess the reason i'm a little bit confused is because i do feel like a number of the d5 protocols and developers have been very concerned about operating here in the u.s so what is their concern about i think the main concern the one i hear the most is the one we were discussing before which is about the sec and the potential for uh chair gensler to decide that he doesn't believe in d5 right he thinks that everything that claims to be decentralized is decentralized in name only and so there's a lot more concern around uh sec enforcement than there is around anti-money laundering compliance or tax reporting i think it's more a securities concern than anything else okay so this actually leads me to this other line that really stuck out at me and the a16z regulatory report which was ironically the innovators that seem most interested in ensuring compliance and pursuing constructive dialogue with regulators often find their willingness to engage makes them vulnerable to regulatory action while others operating in a less transparent fashion escape scrutiny do you agree with that opinion and can you talk a little bit about how you think both crypto entrepreneurs and regulators should manage that yeah i mean i guess that the problem is when you go and and engage with regulatory agencies they they know you exist right and um though though i mean and jake may have have other ideas i i think that on the other hand if you look at a lot of the enforcement actions the sec has taken um a lot of them not not all of them um but a lot of them are sort of you know these more obscure kind of smaller um you know projects that nobody's ever heard of right um and so you know i don't think that by not engaging that means you're you're off the hook i mean i think they're sort of looking everywhere but but i do think that yeah unfortunately by being active and attempting to be a good actor um it's sort of like no good deed goes unpunished sometimes so um but it's unfortunate because we need to have the good actors that want to comply um you know we need a way for them to get feedback but also a way for them to to educate regulators and also educate policymakers and so yeah it's it's it's an unfortunate situation and um yeah i um you know for better for worse you know make sure people are fully aware of the risks before they they go in and speak with regulators um it's not exclusive it just sort of depends on the regulator but i think with the sec that that's unfortunately probably true that's exactly right from my perspective and you know i've heard a lot of stories of folks who have gone into the sec to try to have constructive discussions about a protocol they want to build or an asset they want to issue and the sec for euros has said come in and talk to us and we'll figure it out and they've been met with blank stares and then sometimes after having that meeting they've then been contacted by the division of enforcement with a subpoena and you know that uh is a really you know chilling has a really chilling effect on projects who you know have i think over the course of time uh come to the conclusion and this really seems to be the industry's view at this point that there's nothing to be gained from going in to have that conversation you there there is only punishment on offer and really all you're doing is providing free discovery to the division of enforcement that otherwise they might have to work a little bit harder for so i do think that that is extremely unfortunate because we should have a productive and constructive relationship and discussion about these issues i just think that's you know on the government side there hasn't really been a constructive view taken so far no let's talk about taxes in an ideal world how does the blockchain association think crypto tax reporting should be handled i think centralized exchanges um are very willing to do tax information reporting i mean i think it's something that you know come taxis and their customers want guidance and advice on how to do this and it would be you know sort of a helpful and welcome part of the process but the key is it has to be limited to those entities that are truly acting as brokers and not stakers or miners or software developers or others that don't have a customer relationship that's exactly right and i think you know there's a win-win that we can that we can eke out here which is the centralized exchanges and custodians know that they should be doing tax reporting and they want to do tax reporting for the reason kristen just said their customers want it it makes their customers lives easier uh you know one of the challenges of being a defy user is it's really really hard to figure out how much you owe in taxes and most people i know and you know everyone i know is using defy wants to pay their taxes and they want to pay the right amount they just literally can't figure that out so i think i think there are a couple of solutions that we can figure out as as time goes on there are some really fantastic third-party software providers who can help people you know plug in ethereum addresses into their software and then the the software will you know spit out some useful information about what taxes are owed so i think we'll get there on d5 but i think in the near term we can solve 90 of the challenge of getting the right taxes uh paid just by giving clear rulemaking to the centralized exchanges and custodians about how can they produce these reports right the the typical form that a broker produces is a 1099. we need a version of that for digital assets and i think once we have some good guidance about what that should look like we can solve a lot of this problem uh you know pretty soon so another one of the issues in the infrastructure bill was that 6050i provision that kristen mentioned earlier and that would require people who receive digital assets worth more than ten thousand dollars to report the personal information such as social security number and address of the person who sent them that asset to the irs within 15 days so this is actually an existing provision that applies to cash or i'm not sure what the other assets are but how do you plan to recommend that lawmakers or regulators apply this regulation to crypto if at all i think um the best way to apply that rule is to make it as close to the requirement for cash as possible that is to say it it makes some sense for it to apply when there are transactions of cryptocurrencies being used as a medium of exchange to pay for an asset that is off-chain that the irs or that the treasury department would otherwise not be able to identify or track um i will say that you know i've had some interesting conversations with our good friends at coin center you know jerry bruto about this subject i i think uh he and i are both of the minds that that requirement is likely unconstitutional and we'll see sort of where that goes i think that if there was an application of the 6050i requirement beyond something that looked very similar to its application in the traditional cache context that might be an opportunity where we will find ourselves in court over over that implementation honestly i am again optimistic that the treasury department understands this and knows that uh you know two pseudonymous users of a decentralized exchange protocol who are swapping non-monetary assets are not similar to someone who walks into a car dealer and wants to buy a used car with a briefcase full of cash and that they will not apply the same cash transaction reporting requirements the same way but it remains to be seen we'll just have to see what they do so going back to something that kristin mentioned earlier we've seen this whole past year of 2021 that non-crypto people really take issue with the environmental impact of what many of them seem to think is all crypto assets in general um but it's really mainly proof of work mining and i wondered when you deal with different congress people or regulators what do you find is their general attitude around this issue and how does the blockchain association typically try to address that well this is an issue that is really you know emerged in 2021 as an issue and um you know there is a hearing coming up that is going to go um in detail um on this um you know i think listen if you don't understand what the value of bitcoin is then you're not going to understand why devoting energy to bitcoin is valuable so we have kind of that like base level um education that we need to do i think you know the members of congress that are particularly active on climate issues um are on different committees than we've traditionally engaged with and we're now starting to work with members of the house energy and commerce committee for example to talk about bitcoin and um i think this is something that we're going to continue to do but there is a really good story to be told around renewables and actually making it you know an incentive to deploy more renewables by you know pairing them with bitcoin mining and so i i think we have a good story to tell but until we've told the story um people are gonna jump to the you know kind of like i was saying in the beginning they're gonna jump to the easiest thing that that that they think they understand when when there's so many so much of the picture that's missing so i think it's going to be a big big priority for the blockchain association in 2022 to engage um start engaging on this front i definitely agree the the story we need to tell about renewables is a really important one there's also a foreign policy story that we need to tell that i think has been underemphasized at this point i think that it was an unbelievably massive mistake on the part of china to ban miners from that jurisdiction the us has overwhelmingly benefited from that mistake we need to make sure that we don't make the same mistake and we take advantage of the fact that one of our largest foreign adversaries uh just didn't understand you know what they had in their own borders and make sure that we attract as much mining activity to the us as we can so on a related note nfts this is where we see a lot of the backlash about the environmental issues they're also a somewhat new phenomenon and i wondered you know so i actually don't know kind of what are the major regulatory issues around nfts but i wondered if there were any that you're focusing on and how you think those should be addressed i mean i would say right now nfts have actually been pretty positive i think for us i think there's some maybe negative elements that are percolating out there but for the most part nfts have driven a lot of interest um particularly at the congressional staff level um but but also with the the you know congressman level you know people people are like this is something they can visualize right they can see these nfts and it's helping them to understand what digital scarcity is and what the blockchain is so it's very valuable um in the education context but yeah it's like anything else there's certainly securities laws issues there's tax policy issues you know there's anti-money laundering issues and i also think there's going to be like intellectual property issues that we really haven't had much opportunity to go to go deep into but jake can add to that probably kristin nailed it i i think um you know yes there has been some controversy and some critique of nfts i think overwhelmingly the narrative around nfts has been positive i think it's one of those things that gets away from um bitcoin which again very challenging concept separating money from state not necessarily something a lot of policymakers want to get behind has sort of changed that narrative to artists and content creators who are finding ways to make money right to make a living on their art for the first time in a way they never could before um and and that's a really important story for us to tell i think in terms of the unanswered questions probably tax reporting is the biggest question you know um the the exchange platforms where folks are buying and selling nfts are not currently required to do tax reporting uh in many ways i think that it would be inappropriate for for them to have to do tax reporting because they are not like traditional brokers but nonetheless there is this question of how do buyers and sellers of nfts figure out what their tax liability is um and so i think that's the main issue that we need to figure out going forward so another new phenomenon well not that new but really mainly took off last year was dao's and downs are really such a new thing in history that many regulations were established when something like a doubt was not possible and as was pointed out in the a16z regulatory report daos cannot enter into legal contracts they cannot benefit from limited liability they also cannot pay taxes so uh how does the blockchain association think that these issues should be handled and are there any other regulatory issues you think that need to be addressed related to daos so i'm really excited about daos i i think you know every once in a while maybe on the order of decades or centuries we and when i say we i mean us as humans come up with new ways to organize ourselves and coordinate in large groups and across long distances and dows are just a new way for all of us to get together in a digital era and and you know come together around a particular goal that we want to achieve i think that requires us to figure out how we want to treat dows but this isn't the first time even in recent memory that there's been a new type of business form you know one of the most popular types of business forms now in the united states is an llc llcs are comparably very very new there were no llc's uh you know 100 years ago so i think we just need to come up with what are the unique benefits of dows what are the unique challenges what kinds of statutory boundaries should we put around these entities i think we will get to the point where dows can be treated just like any ordinary legal entity i think one of the main concerns that we have now is that members of daos should enjoy limited liability just like members of llcs and corporations do and that's that's a challenge that we need to overcome i think we will see a lot more activity on daos in the states rather than at the federal level you know we already saw one effort by wyoming to create a statutory framework for the registration of a dow i think that framework fell short in a couple of of important ways actually one of my friends and um a new blockchain association member gabe shapiro at delphi uh wrote a really good article sort of flagging some of the problems with the wyoming statute but i think we're going to see a lot more states come along and say we want to be the delaware of taos we want to attract daos to register here and do business here and we're going to see a lot more evolution of the concept of what a registered dow looks like so i'm excited to see which states decide uh to come forward with with those types of proposals this year and moving moving on so crypto lawyer grant golovkson asked over twitter what the blockchain association's position is regarding what he called all the bad actors in the space in particular tether and celsius then he asked if there are any realistic chances of self-regulation to clean up the space and whether or not the blockchain association is trying to advance that and yeah i was curious about these self-regulatory organizations because they've been talked about a lot and are used in traditional finance yeah i mean i think and jake may have some things to add to this um there are a lot of actors in this place in terms of companies that are sort of pushing the edge i think that you know some are pushing the edge more than others but there's nothing wrong with going to the edge and so if companies are out there and trying to figure out where the edge is i think that's that's fine um but yeah some some people are some individual companies are doing more than others but you know i think um in terms of self-regulatory organizations to be a proper self-regulatory organization you have to have a very clear regulator to coordinate with that self-regulatory organization and that needs to be approved by an act of congress so i think that is potentially part of the solution down the road but not something that you know we should be focused on now because there are a lot of pieces that would need to be put in place but jake may have different or more developed thoughts on that i agree completely about the idea of the self-regulatory organization i'm not saying it's a bad idea i just think it's a very premature idea for the same reason as we were saying earlier about creating a new regulator i just don't think we have a good sense yet of who the members of that self-regulatory organization would be what the goals would be how they should move forward so i think it's it's an it's certainly a worthwhile concept for us to talk about but not something that we should be prioritizing now um you know i don't want to cast aspersions about any particular company or actor in the space but it is important for us to acknowledge that there are bad actors using this technology just like there are bad actors using every type of technology and i think that it's really important for us to figure out how do we promote the good actors right and the beneficial positive use cases while also making sure that the people who are showing up uh just to you know pull scams or do rug pulls uh how how we can identify those people and make sure that they are investigated and prosecuted and punished where necessary it does not help us at all as an industry to pretend like 100 of what happens using digital assets is 100 aboveboard because that's not true there was a really great thread i would recommend people look at written by a candidate for senate morgan harper in ohio who is extremely positive in general on the industry but was noting that there are people out there who are having money stolen from them by frauds and scams and i will tell you as someone that you know is very active on twitter laura i'm sure you have the same experience whenever i tweet i would say at least five to ten of the comments are people who are promoting scams and every week there's at least one imposter who has stolen my profile picture and is pretending to be me and is dming people pretending like i am running a trading group or something like that which is a totally ridiculous concept but we know that this activity wouldn't be happening if these fraudsters weren't making money off of it and what that means is there are people being victimized out there we need to take that seriously and we need to figure out how to address it yes at the moment for the last several days i've been trying to remove this telegram group that is claiming to be unchanged podcast and is clearly scamming people out of their crypto and um it's very upsetting because telegram has not responded to any of the reports or any of my tweets or anything um so totally get you but anyway okay so i'm sure there are probably some listeners who have been listening to this podcast and they're probably maybe pumped up about the different regulatory issues that um need to be addressed here in crypto so what would you recommend people who want to get involved and want to support sensible crypto regulation in the us do well i would say first be informed you know follow jake on twitter follow the blockchain association follow our friends at coin center um you know we want to be you you need to know what's happening first of all you know number two if you're working with a company um and have control over resources you should join the blockchain association if you're an individual you know support coin center support fight for the future support hotel pack there's a lot of organizations out there that are you know kind of geared towards support from individuals and then i would say you know get to know your local congressmen go attend a fundraiser get to know them build a relationship and uh you know if you're a very big company open up a washington office and hire lobbyists and a policy team and smart lawyers to think through this stuff and have them coordinate with us right um you know we need to have um you know a lot of smart people working on this um but also doing the less glamorous work of going around and doing all of the educating that needs to be doing it's a lot of the same conversation over and over and over and over but when we have people that are armed with the right arguments and the right talking points you know we can we can get through that period of education that i think really really needs to happen at a large scale in 2022. i second all of that um you know i think for me a priority is growing our membership i think the more uh industry members who we can represent when we go talk to policymakers the more effective we are as the voice for the industry you know kristin mentioned there's a hearing that's coming up on bitcoin mining and proof of work because of that i've had the pleasure of speaking with leaders from many different mining companies in the us that's been a phenomenal experience i hope that many of them will join the association so that we can work more closely with them i feel the same way in every sector of the industry across the board you know the more members we have the more effective we can be i think for for you know the average uh person out there who just is interested in getting involved in their own way everything kristen said is right the only thing that i would add um you know circling back to our conversation about the importance of twitter is show some engagement to your your members of congress right um just as an example uh representative gonzalez wrote a phenomenal op-ed that was published recently about web three and uh you know showing him some love for for having taken a stand on that and for for being so forward thinking really matters so it feels a little bit silly but honestly you know clicking like and retweet on these members of congress tweets that really makes a difference so that's that's the easy thing to do all right well i know that our listeners love to do that kind of thing so good suggestion all right where can people learn more about each of you and the work of the blockchain association well you can check out our website theblockchainassociation.org which is about to undergo a massive revamp so you can get the before and after after picture and you can follow the blockchain association on twitter at blockchain assn um or you can follow me at km smith dc and you can follow me on twitter at jay travinsky and yeah that's the best place to stay up to date perfect thank you both so much for coming on unchained thank you thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about kristin jake and the blockchain association check out the show notes for this episode unchained as produced by me laura shin with without from anthony yoon daniel ness mark murdoch
