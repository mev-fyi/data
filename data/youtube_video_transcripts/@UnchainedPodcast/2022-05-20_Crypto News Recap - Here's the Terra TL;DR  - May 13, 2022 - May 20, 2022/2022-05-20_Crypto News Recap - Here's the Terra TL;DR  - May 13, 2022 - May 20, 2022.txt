[Music] thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap tara struggles to revive amidst infighting and regulatory pressure in the wake of ust's collapse the terra luna community sought a way forward even as it demanded more details on what happened to the luna foundation guard's three billion dollar crypto reserve and as regulators came knocking terraform lab's co-founder do kwan made two proposals to revive the chain both were massively criticized by the community and even by big names like ethereum creator vitalik buterin and binance ceo chiang peng zhao jo kwon's third proposal consisted of forking terra into a new chain without an algorithmic stablecoin the idea is to rename the current chain tara classic and the current native token as loon c luna classic the new chain quant proposes would be called terra with the native token luna the new chain would have 1 billion luna tokens and would be air dropped across luna and classic stakers luna classic holders residual ust holders and essential app developers of tara classic the proposal was put out for an on-chain vote on wednesday as of press time thursday afternoon it seems it is going to pass as it has the support of terraform labs and terra builders alliance a community of developers and builders within the tarot ecosystem however some validators are not fans all node ceo constantine boyco romanovsky said to the bloc the whole governance process of this proposal looks like a dictatorship model it looks like the launch of the new chain is decided even before voting is finished as for the three billion dollars in bitcoin reserves the luna foundation guard which was in charge of defending the ust peg with the bitcoin finally sheds some light on what happened according to an announcement on twitter when usd started deep pegging lfg said it converted the 80 000 bitcoins or 3.1 billion dollars in its reserve to ust to defend the peg after the massive sell-off it was left with a reserve of 313 bitcoin or 8 million according to elliptic a blockchain analytics company 52 000 bitcoins were moved into gemini and the remaining 28 000 were moved into finance however tom robinson co-founder of

here's another reminder not your keys not your coins in light of coinbase's announcement that the exchange would retain user assets in the event of a bankruptcy officials from joe biden's administration are pressing congress to demand cryptocurrency exchanges keep their customers money separate from corporate funds don't think you actually own your tokens when you go into a digital wallet said sac chair gary gensler however gus culdabella partner at trueventures tweeted that the biden administration's logic gets a lot wrong polta bella thinks the problem is how bankruptcy law treats exchange wallets for this reason a legitimate fix that forces cryptocurrency exchanges to keep their customers money separate from their own corporate funds is no fix at all it's not the source of the problem and it doesn't solve the legal issue he wrote on a related note sec chair gary gensler testified before the house appropriations subcommittee on financial services and general government this week and asked for a bigger budget to control the crypto space two other regulation adjacent stories caught my attention reuters reported that finance ministers from g7 countries are calling for more crypto legislation in light of their recent turmoil in the crypto asset market the g7 urges the fsb or financial stability board to advance the swift development and implementation of

investors according to some tweets and press releases major vc firms and investment funds have confirmed that they had no or very little exposure to luna among these companies are pantera capital galaxy digital multicoin dragonfly framework and on juno which disclosure is a sponsor of my shows on wednesday after saying nothing for more than 10 days galaxy digital ceo mike novogratz broke his

investing requires humility on the latest episode of the chopping block dragonflies hiseb qureshi said he wasn't inclined to believe all these stories everyone i talked to says they are okay somebody must be lying he said laughing in agreement with haseeb kevin jo the chopping block guest added there is no way that's true but what would be even more harrowing is that if it was true it would mean
