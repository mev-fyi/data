thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap ex-coinbase employee accused of insider trading the u.s department of justice arrested former coinbase product manager ishan wahi along with his brother and a friend for committing insider trading in crypto assets the doj alleges that waukee leaked confidential coinbase information regarding which assets were scheduled to be listed on the exchange the men are being charged with wire fraud conspiracy and wire fraud in connection with a scheme to commit insider trading and cryptocurrency assets with a maximum sentence of 20 years the sec brought similar charges as well overall the men allegedly generated and realized roughly 1.5 million dollars in gains according to the doj notably the doj press release referenced an april tweet from crypto twitter stalwart kobe who had posted information about quote an etherdress that bought hundreds of thousands of dollars of tokens exclusively featured in the coinbase asset listing post about 24 hours before it was published rolling on the floor laughing while he had attempted to flee the country in may after coinbase asked him to appear in an in-person meeting but was stopped by law enforcement from doing so he along with two others are now in custody in the press release u.s attorney damian williams thanked coinbase for cooperating and had this to say about blockchain fraud today's charges are a further reminder that web3 is not a law free zone our message with these charges is clear fraud is fraud is fraud whether it occurs on the blockchain or on wall street the sec's naming of nine crypto assets as securities without explanation sparks criticism what may end up being even more important than the insider trading case is that the sec named nine coins amp rly ddx xyo rgt lcx power dfx and krom as securities in its own complaint regarding the actions of mr wahi coinbase reported that the sec declined to comment in response to a set of questions about whether the action set a precedent for how the agency would identify crypto assets as securities or whether it intended to bring enforcement actions against the issuers behind these assets or any exchanges such as coinbase that have listed them however the circuitous way in which the agency identified these tokens as securities caused a fair amount of criticism cftc commissioner caroline pham spoke out against her fellow agencies decision via a statement describing the sec's move as an example of regulation by enforcement and calling for a more transparent process for digital asset rulemaking jake cervinski head of policy and the blockchain association tweeted the sec alleges in today's complaint that nine digital assets are securities but don't explain their analysis for even one they also didn't sue the issuers or exchanges where the tokens traded the people with resources to fight back or as crypto lawyer stephen palley put it how can you charge people with insider trading without charging the massive publicly traded exchange for listing unregistered securities after consensus lawyer bill hughes hypothesized that the defendants may settle with as you see chervinsky surmised and then the sec acts like they've established precedent and moves on to the next target yes that'd be my best guess immediately after the news about the complaint became public coinbase made its own commentary on the roundabout way in which the sec labeled these crypto assets as securities it released a petition calling for the sec to develop a new regulatory framework for digital assets rather than continuing with arbitrary enforcement the ethereum merge has a date an actual well tentative date during this week's proof-of-stake implementer's call ethereum core developer tim baiko suggested that the week of september 19th is a realistic target for the merge depending on the success of a rehearsal on the test net corally as cited in meeting notes written by ethereum developer ben edgington on thursday during the all core devs meeting it was projected that the date for the merge on gourley will hit between august 8th and 10th furthermore even if the merge is kickstarted on the week of september 19th it won't finish then at least according to galaxy digital researcher christine kim who reminded excited ethereums that the merge is actually a bundle of two hard fork upgrades which will be scheduled roughly two weeks apart having a named date however tentative may have excited investors for example eath is up 34 over the last week as a thursday morning additionally the price of steath or staked eath a derivative product that will unlock at some point after the merge is completed is trading at just a two percent discount to eth up from a roughly 3.5 discount last week according to coin gecko tesla dumped 75 percent of its btc according to tesla's q2 2022 earnings report the electric car company sold 75 of its bitcoin worth 936 million dollars for fiat currency investing youtuber dave lee divided the dollar value of the company's remaining bitcoin by the value on the close of the day they had sold and came up with the number 42069 bitcoins as the number that tesla had remaining musk responded we don't have that many bitcoin but it's close during the company's earnings call tesla ceo elon musk explained the move was not a verdict on bitcoin rather he said the sale of bitcoin allowed tesla to boost its cash position during covet lockdowns in china musk did note that tesla had not sold any of its dogecoin while not mentioned on the earnings call it is notable that if tesla

that celsius has roughly 1.7 billion dollars in assets as of july 14th down from 14.6 billion at its all-time high and about three billion dollars away from being able to pay out creditors the bankrupt lender cites losses from tara the overall drop in prices in 2022 and a number of losses including losing access to 50 million worth of eath via a partnership with stay count as causes of the massive hole in its balance sheet to recoup the losses celsius is hoping that celsius mining will become a cash cow with the company asking for permission to spend five million dollars to finish constructing its center in texas celsius says it already has 43 000 mining rigs and then it could be in the position to mine 10 000 btc this year if all goes well which is a big if even if that happens mining operations would only yield 225 million dollars in cash a far cry from the billions necessary to make celsius whole celsius's second bankruptcy hearing will be held on august 10th

of nfts with minecraft are generally not something we mojang studios will support or allow additionally blockchain technologies writ large are not permitted to be used inside the minecraft client or server applications nor will any skins persona items or worlds be allowed to be tokenized on a blockchain mojang cited multiple issues with nfts for example the purchase of an nft provides the token that states the ownership of the original digital file and yet with any digital file that file can be copied moved or even deleted mojang also mentioned that speculation was another signal to stay away however the main reason for disallowing nfts is a lack of inclusivity nfts however can create models of scarcity and exclusion that conflict with our guidelines and the spirit of minecraft wrote mojang to ensure that minecraft players have a safe and inclusive experience blockchain technologies are not permitted to be integrated inside our client and server applications the announcement seems to have surprised nft worlds a third-party blockchain focused on nft minecraft integrations which saw its floor price fall 70 percent according to coindesk circle a fully backed stablecoin in its july
