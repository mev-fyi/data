safer wallet visit brave.com unchained to get started today's guest is california congressman ro khanna from silicon valley and author of dignity in a digital age making tech work for all of us welcome congressman canna thank you so much laura for having me on you're one of the congressmen who has introduced numerous crypto bills in the house and you're also a member of the blockchain caucus how did you become interested in crypto and why are you a supporter first of all uh a lot of the innovators in the crypto space or in silicon valley in my district so i've seen the impact on job creation i've seen the utility that crypto has in terms of expediting the transactions in terms of decentralization uh web 3.0 to me is actually beyond crypto it's about this philosophy of decentralizing people's participation in the economy i've seen the prospect of what it can mean for the unbanked uh so that's why uh it's something that i support and that thesis actually comes out in your recently published book dignity in a digital age you talk about spreading out jobs digital jobs in a way can you just talk a little bit more about that theme of decentralization and also how it relates to the thesis of your book absolutely and the thesis of the book is there's 11 trillion dollars of market cap in silicon valley in the surrounding areas 25 million digital jobs in a few big cities uh expected to be in a few big cities and then we have to decentralize it that we need communities that are left out to participate in modern wealth generation that we need black and brown communities to participate in modern wealth generation so decentralization will allow people not to have to leave their hometown will allow more people to participate will reduce some of the tensions and web 3.0 is all about decentralization it's saying you don't have to have the concentration of economic power in just a few places new york or silicon valley and that's why as a progressive in the argument i make in the book uh you should we should be four but moves towards web 3.0 and in crypto because of the prospect it has of decentralizing power and i give a specific example of the book about crypto's use for artists uh or authors and how this could cut out middlemen and the prospects that actually could get more people access to to to a market uh without the barriers of entry and while you're you know talking about this trend and also kind of pushing for more of it at the same time we are seeing this new breed of crypto mayors who are coming into office obviously there are some really prominent examples like mayor francis suarez of miami mayor eric adams in new york or mayor scott conger of jackson tennessee how do you see the crypto industry playing a role in bringing tech to more cities beyond just those usual suspects well they are of course uh passionate advocates and they see it firsthand in their cities the job creation the amount of people who are participating the fact that there are so many people black and brown communities young folks who are active uh in the the crypto space but what crypto does is it it doesn't just require a passionate mayor you could be a small business person and now you may have more access to a global market especially as we get people who are unbanked to have the ability to use crypto and so it may increase your ability to thrive you could be uh use tokens to participate in the governance of a company and more companies will be set up in that way you can have much easier transmittance of payments across the world so i think the technology itself will allow for some degree of decentralization now there's more that needs to be done as i write in the book about policies that can encourage decentralization and technology jobs to move to rural america and black and brown communities but web 3.0 should be part of that solution and that's again why i think that it shouldn't be something that progressive sphere we need well regulated the space with predictability and certainty but we shouldn't just be reflexively against a technology that has decentralizing potential well so that's the perfect segue to my next question because as you probably know in the crypto community there is a perception that democrats are more anti-crypto than republicans first of all do you agree with that perception and second you know regardless of whether you agree since the crypto community does have that perception what is your response to them about that there have been louder critics i uh acknowledge on the on the democratic side but there are champions people like senator wyden and i uh darren sorrow and florida we're working on a fix to the bipartisan infrastructure bill which would define software engineers as brokers it just doesn't make any sense which would define some of the miners as brokers in the howie test is is important in terms of what is a security but just because something may be a security doesn't mean that you should be necessarily filing 10k and 10q forms if it's decentralized enough and what we may need is a new regulatory regime for digital assets so there are places where regulation is absolutely necessary let's consider stable coins i want to make sure that stable coins have enough dollar backing just like we have reserve requirements and banks fine let's have that uh regulation but let's understand what stable coins allow first of all they've had a higher rate of return than people who just have money in the banks and they make it easier to transmit money with large sums of money fast and without large fees right this isn't rocket science they're just lowering significant transaction costs so when people say it's just digital gold no it actually has transactional values or let's have regulatory disclosure on what the blockchain is but you know you you're not going to have full control over the blockchain especially in a case like ethereum which has basically become a commodity so you don't have one company controlling it so i think a lot of the criticism stems from a lack of awareness i mean i don't know how many i i don't have much crypt i have less than 50 bucks but i have a wallet on coinbase i have a meta wallet i know you know that you uh have to go on what with what you need to do to buy an nft i just think more members of congress need to just experience uh the basics so let's say that later today you were to have a meeting with some of those very vocal crypto opponents such as congressman brad sherman or senator elizabeth warren what would you say to them about this technology i tell you if you're opposed to the power of the banks and if you're opposed to oh too much power of con of companies in my district you should be for decentralization now i understand that they've been scams let's be clear and we need to make sure that we have basic protections against scams we need to make sure that we have protection against the abuse of uh crypto for illegal activity but the irony is that the blockchain is the most traceable source and so you could actually help law enforcement uh figure out uh illicit activity and so there's some concerns of privacy that every transaction uh the government may not know what you're doing so but let's understand though that this is a technology that could actually decentralize it could help a lot of people who are unbanked have access to markets it could help small businesses avoid costly middlemen and then let's have thoughtful smart regulation about it uh but don't just be reflexively against the technology so a line that i've been hearing more frequently about crypto from either liberals such as economist paul cookman or democratic politicians is that non-whites are more likely than whites to own crypto and then their conclusion is that therefore crypto is either preying upon or could harm the most vulnerable what do you think of that take well first i i think what it shows is that a lot of times non-whites don't have access to the opportunities for wealth generation that many people do have access i mean how many people get to invest in pre-ipo friends and family rounds how many people get to invest in venture capital how many people get stock options only 50 of americans are even in the stock market so the aspiration that a lot of young folks that a lot of people in the black and brown community have is to to build wealth to build assets uh to uh participate in building their companies and we ought to recognize that now we ought to make sure that there are regulations to protect them but it should be a wake-up call for us that there's so many people who are viewing this is their way to build wealth and to to have a shot at uh a flourishing prosperous life and then i don't think that that's a negative i think what we ought to do is think about good regulations that protect them but allow them to participate so in a moment we will discuss more about congressman khanna's book as well as some of the more specific areas of crypto but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible it's time to bring

browsers on the market whether you're new to crypto or a seasoned pro it's time to ditch those risky extensions and switch to brave wallet get started at brave.com unchained back to my conversation with congressman khanna in your book you talk about the need to regulate big tech and in the book you also talk about an internet bill of rights that you drafted and the principles actually seem in line with what many crypto entrepreneurs say they're building these you know decentralized competitors to big tech uh do you think that that vision of these decentralized crypto networks that compete with big tech and give users a piece of ownership does align with your internet bill of rights and if so how well the lines if we can see alternative platforms emerging before social media conversations if we can see alternative platforms emerging that facilitate a business because then that means we have more competition more discursive spaces you don't just have a few actors controlling a lot but the other thing is in terms of data right now you have so much data flowing to a few companies and what i say is you need to have affirmative consent before having your data go to these companies so that protection that needs in my view needs to be regulatory now if there are alternative companies emerging that have a better protection of privacy and data that's a positive thing and so earlier you alluded to some of the i guess some kind of pending decisions around how tokens will be regulated and sec chair gary gensler has made it clear that he views that tokens that are parts of these networks are basically thinly veiled securities and they need to be regulated under a securities regime what's your take on that and in general your take on how a team that is launching a coin can start centralized but go to decentralized overtime well there are two different issues one is that something is security and then two is how do you regulate it under the howie test which has done us a lot of good over time anything that has central control and that appreciates is a security so you could say okay these are digital assets digital securities but then they can't be regulated in the same way as something that's completely centralized i mean bitcoin is totally decentralized but there are places that are hybrids i mean ethereum is now largely decentralized what do you do if something has 10 20 centralization and 70 80 non-centralization and i think what the important thing is is for us to come up with clear predictable rules of how we regulate digital assets even if we think there is security that doesn't that means that there may be new ways of regulating it that protect consumers but acknowledge that you don't have centralized control over the price and that you don't have centralized control over all the disclosure requirements i am working with the white house the nsc the leap singh who's very thoughtful about this to do two things uh one to get input from the crypto community i'm calling for the white house to have a crypto roundtable on these policies to to have predictability in whatever we do so that we can keep the crypto industry in the united states one other point i often hear is uh uh on the energy costs and the issue of you know coal mines being used to to power mining for for blockchain i'd say a few things first bitcoin is about a trillion dollars as i understand it anything that has a trillion dollars of value is going to use energy that's just uh obvious uh so then the question is how do we make bitcoin more green and there are things we can do to do for example we could incentivize mining companies to institute demand response where they use the energy at times that are non-peak and provide tax incentives or credits for for doing that uh we could incentivize them to promot promote or use renewable energy we could incentivize them to use the wind in texas that isn't being fully used or the hydro that isn't being used so we've got to get past the boilerplate oh it's not green or is green and think about innovative solutions to something that's not going away if you talk to all the young folks they'll tell you that so another aspect of crypto that is taking off is decentralized finance or d5 and it's basically a parallel world of finance to wall street however it does not have the typical know your customer or anti-money laundering controls and there's definitely been hints that not only the us government but maybe other world governments would like to push that kind of system that has intermediaries that can do those kinds of kyc checks even though d5 builders would say the whole point is to remove intermediaries so what do you think is the best way to handle that issue in d5 well that's a very difficult question and there honestly i support a balanced approach i mean i know coinbase for example you do when you sign up for a wallet they have a basic background check on on you and you do they have to do it know your customer you don't want certain platforms to be basically money laundering sites that's why the know your customer requirements were there you don't want them to be facilitating terrorism and that some of these requirements came up after 9 11 where we wanted to make sure transactions of a large size were ones that we could could follow so i think there has to be a balance there of making sure that you don't have conduit for large transfers of money for illicit activity or terrorism but you aren't being overly burdensome but i'm not for sort of a libertarian let's not have regulation because that i do think would be uh too dangerous so a similar issue is that the way the internal revenue service runs its tax system is through what's considered an account based system and what we mean by that is that consumers have their accounts at different financial institutions and then those financial institutions will report the financial activity to the government and then when the taxpayer submits their tax return they can the government can match that up against what was reported but if crypto gains adoption and there's kind of more wallet-based transactions where there isn't that third party that can do that reporting then the irs won't have that same visibility into people's financial transactions so how do you think the irs should handle those types of transactions in terms of taxing them well if you have capital gains they ought to be taxed you know there's no question that if you have capital gains whether it's in attack whether it's in crypto whether it's in agriculture manufactured you ought to pay tax if a school teacher has to pay tax under w2 if a amazon worker has to pay tax someone who makes money off crypto ought to be paying uh tax now how we enforce that uh this if it's self-reporting and what the irs needs to do to uh enforce that we need to figure that out and have a rational regulatory regime but i am when people say you need regulatory regimes to make sure people pay tax i say yes i mean just because you're doing something online doesn't mean you don't have to pay tax for appreciation so essential bank digital currencies are on the mind of the fed and they're already being pushed by other countries the us at this moment has numerous private stable coins or at least private stable coins that are pegged to the us dollar are you in favor of a central bank digital currency for the us and also what is your stance on these private stable coins so i think the private stable coins right now are an important place so where you can have basically the dollar transferred and used for bitcoin and that they uh or uh other cryptocurrencies and they make that process faster and they make that process less painful and it allows for you to move money around much faster and in a way that is uh with less fees and it also is appreciating more right now than uh in traditional bank accounts but i want to make sure that there isn't a run on these stable coins that they have some capital reserve so that they have the dollars to back it up and that seems prudent given what happened in the wall street crash you want to make sure that there's some reserve requirements i'm for the u.s government having a digital currency in terms of just the the efficiencies it brings and they they should be experimenting with being innovative i don't think that anything will displace the us dollar or 51 percent of reserves i wouldn't want to bet against america we have a lot going for the country and so i i'm not concerned from that perspective but i think we ought to be as innovative as possible and and looking at the values of a digital us dollar that would allow people to have some of the benefits that cryptocurrencies bring i asked crypto twitter what they wanted me to ask you and at one question by ryan selkiss the founder of massari was what can they do to help you bring more democrats and progressives to the crypto side tell the stories of uh what crypto actually means tell the use cases how is it benefiting people you know uh right now there's still a lot of work to be done you know it's like i went on coinbase it still charges your fees you you know it's so complicated to uh have to use meta wallet for some things and you can't buy nfts on some things it's a whole it's a lot of gobbly gooks so you need to simplify it you need to show the clear use cases you need to show clear people real people who are benefiting from this technology not just in the hypothetical don't just say well it helps the unbanked tell me the story of someone who a small business owner or a person who's using crypto to remit money or to to get paid and uh and make that clear in how it's helping and then to tell the story about young folks who have crypto in investments and are doing well or uh where it has gone down how they weren't hurt by the recent downturn because maybe they already had bought uh the the crypto earlier and large the large uh downturn was for hedge funds but you have to just be be clear about how this is impacting uh real people so obviously we're in a midterm election year and this question was suggested by twitter user bricks bounty farm although i'm going to tweak it a little bit they asked does crypto legislation such as what you have done with congressman tom emmer offer an opportunity for bipartisanship in this congress both in this midterm and for 2024 it does it should that's such an obvious fix to what was wrong in the infrastructure bill we should make sure that we're fixing it but we have a lot of education to do still with our colleagues about why crypto has use cases why this is important one of the interesting things is i've been told there are about 40 million people in america who have crypto that that could go up to eventually almost 100 million uh but that those numbers need to be better broadcast people should be talking to their representatives about crypto uh but i am optimistic that we can have this fix we need some of these fixes or we'll see the industry go to britain to singapore and we don't want to lose an industry that's going to be critical to web 3.0 and so going forward when you think about everything that you put forward in your book and what's coming ahead for this year in terms of the election and also all these developments in crypto what do you hope will transpire over the next year and um and speak you know partially to the crypto audience here i hope we will have predictability in the regulatory regime that is the first point uh in a point that i have advocated i hope we will have clear use cases like i demonstrate in the book about what artists and authors can use crypto for to reduce uh transaction costs and help protect a person's intellectual property while providing access to things like college textbooks at a much lower price and uh finally i hope we will embrace the fundamental philosophical principle that animates my book and i think animates a lot of people in the crypto space and that's one word decentralization that that is what we want ultimately in this country for every individual to feel empowered to have the freedom to participate and contribute uh and flourish and at its best that's what crypto does it it takes power from a few centers and it says no we want to get other people participating in the modern economy that was the promise of the internet that it would allow for that kind of democratization of participation yeah i will say reading the book that it definitely feels like even though you're a democrat there's so much in there that would appeal to republicans because a lot of it just seems more common sense rather than um something that's obviously political so i do recommend it to listeners all right um well it's been so uh wonderful having you on unchained thank you so much for coming on the show all right i'm a fan of the show i appreciate it i'm good luck with your book and thank you for having me on i look forward to being back maybe with a republican at some point yes yes we will we will do that because i think that would be super fun all right don't forget next up is the weekly news recap stick around for this week in crypto after this short break join over 10 million

the sec goes after block five for 100 million dollars block fight a popular crypto lender is paying 50 million dollars to the u.s securities and exchange commission and 50 million dollars across 32 states to settle investigations into whether blockfish interest earning accounts in which customers lend digital assets to blockfy in return for yield are a securities offering current customers will remain unaffected by the settlement though they will not be able to deposit more crypto into their accounts and blockfi will discontinue offering it to new u.s customers as part of the settlement blockfi will be filing an s1 for a blockfi yield product which would allow the lender to offer interest earning accounts to u.s customers as a security registered with the sec said sec chair gary gensler in a press release this is the first case of its kind with respect to crypto lending platforms today's settlement makes clear that crypto markets must comply with time-tested securities laws sec commissioner hester purse had a different take on the settlement writing is the approach we are taking with crypto lending the best way to protect crypto lending customers i do not think it is so i respectfully dissent she went on to add it is difficult to understand how the civil penalty will protect investors and called on the sec to do a better job in accommodating innovation rather than hurting companies who attempt to work under the scope of us regulation the blockfi settlement does not come as a surprise as the lender has been under scrutiny since last summer when five states issued either cease and desist or show cause notices against blockfi crypto's super super bowl performance while the rams and bengals battled in los angeles crypto fought to make it fully mainstream with multiple crypto exchanges taking out commercials during last weekend's super bowl coinbase ftx and crypto.com disclosure a sponsor each ran ads and turbo tax and etoro mentioned crypto coinbase ran its ad in the first quarter in an on-brand move the company purchased a minute-long ad showing a qr code bouncing across the screen viewers who scanned it were prompted to download the app and participate in a 3 million giveaway data from the block shows that the ad was a roaring success with the exchange jumping from 186 to 2 on the app store in the day following the super bowl and speaking of on brand coinbase had to briefly throttle back access to its website due to increased traffic where coinbase stayed simple ftx swung for the fences its ad was headlined by the famous comedian larry david from curb year enthusiasm in seinfeld foe denouncing inventions like democracy portable music and of course crypto crypto.com also ran an ad starring nba superstar lebron james

a stroke of genius according to bloomberg's matt levine i feel like the tiger is a good idea if you walk into the offices of an investment bank there should be a roaming tiger to make you nervous keep you on your toes obviously in a real bank the tiger would pose liability problems it might eat the clients or the bankers for that matter but in the metaverse it is just some nice symbolism wrote levine jpmorkins crypto team onyx also published an 18-page paper outlining its metaverse thesis in its report j.p morgan revealed a bullish outlook for the metaverse the asymmetrical risk of being left behind is worth the incremental investment needed to get started and to explore this new digital landscape for yourself the bank recommended our long-standing core competencies in cross-border

blocks bitcoin and ethereum transactions from truckers reports indicate that canada's royal canadian mounted police aka mounties and ontario provincial police are barring all firms including cryptocurrency exchanges registered with canada's anti-money laundering authority fintrac from transacting with 34 cryptocurrency addresses tied to funding the trucker-led protests in the country the protests began in january over canada's vaccination requirements for all entrants of the country the protests were deemed illegal by canadian prime minister justin trudeau this week via the emergencies act giving banks the power to immediately freeze or suspend bank accounts tied to the truckers for 30 days in a leaked document it appears that canadian authorities believe this power extends to crypto addresses regulators ordered crypto exchanges to cease facilitating any transactions associated with 34 crypto addresses where donors had already sent more than 20 btc in an attempt to continue funding the protests once canadian authorities froze the 9 million dollars that had been donated to gofundme notably canada's decision had many on crypto twitter pointing to bitcoin for years it was difficult to explain to canadians why bitcoin is necessary it was always a conversation of yes banks are currently reliable in canada but they aren't in other countries now their own bank account is at risk the transition is inevitable wrote atomic wallet co-founder matt black trust makes the travel rule a reality 18 companies have banded together to bring anti-money laundering technologies to digital assets via a coalition called travel rule universal solution technology or trust headed by coinbase the group includes other industry leaders like anchorage bitco block fi circle fidelity digital assets paxos kraken and robin hood essentially the group was formed to implement the travel rule recommended by the financial action task force which requires financial institutions to store information about customers with transaction partners according to coinbase trust is built in such a way to protect the security and privacy of customers personal information which is of paramount importance in the privacy-focused blockchain space the coalition has a three-part plan to make this happen one information will be sent directly from exchange to exchange via encrypted channels exchanges must provide their identity before receiving customer payments and finally coalition members must meet core anti-money laundering security and privacy requirements through a partnership with compliance and risk management firm exeger the group does not plan to stay at 18 or in the us the next step is adding new members so that trust can provide comprehensive compliance across the crypto industry the travel rules reach is expanding internationally and so must the trust solution trust is focused on expanding to many other jurisdictions this year concluded coinbase in its launch statement sequoia goes crypto sequoia capital a prominent venture capital firm based in silicon valley is moving into the crypto space in a big way sequoia is looking to raise between 500 million dollars to 600 million dollars in its first sector-specific crypto fund according to its press release sequoia's foray into the crypto space will be focused primarily on liquid tokens and digital assets and sequoia plans to dabble in staking providing liquidity and governance of protocols sequoia has previously invested in ftx block starkware and fireblocks time for fun bits the generational gap is real and here we are going to talk about two stories first this week charlie munger berkshire hathaway's 98 year old vice chairman had a few choice words for cryptocurrency i certainly didn't invest in crypto i'm proud of the fact that i've avoided it it's like some venereal disease or something i just regard it as beneath contempt i admire the chinese for banning it i think they were right and we the us have been wrong to allow it he said and yes he did just compare crypto to an std on the other hand paradigm one of the most respected firms in crypto and a recent investor in citadel securities just hired a high schooler as a research engineer the engineer who goes by transmissions 11 was a core developer and founding member of rari capital and will work at
