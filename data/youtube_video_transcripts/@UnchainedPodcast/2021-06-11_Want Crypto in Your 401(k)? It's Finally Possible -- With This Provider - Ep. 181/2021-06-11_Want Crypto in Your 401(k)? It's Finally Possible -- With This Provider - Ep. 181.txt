its fast scalable low cost and climate neutral blockchain protocol learn more at near.org today's guest is jeff schulte chief executive officer of 4s all a retirement investment platform for small businesses welcome jeff thank you it's a pleasure to be here this week your company made an announcement that will surely be interesting to my crypto audience tell us about your news so we're very excited to uh have announced that we've launched cryptocurrency into the 401k um this is something that we've been working on for a while and we're thrilled to finally have the word out and so what does that mean for employees at companies who use for us all as a as a 401k provider yeah so let me let me back up if it's okay and just start by just saying why we even did this in the first place um over the last few years there's been an absolute revolution in the financial services world and we've seen institutional investors like harvard brown yale making use of cryptocurrency as part of their endowments um 60 of all professional managers actually now say that cryptocurrency has a role to play in their portfolios average americans mostly invest and get exposure to the to the market through their 401ks and nobody was making this available so we have now um brought cryptocurrency into the 401 k so here's how this will work employers that have our force all branded 401k their employees will be able to log in they'll have their traditional mutual fund options right there there'll also be an option for cryptocurrency and they'll be able to transfer part of their balance over to the cryptocurrency window where they can buy and sell uh tokens each bitcoin up to 50 different uh cryptocurrencies available through this through the window they will also be able to set it up so that every time they contribute to the 401k part of their portfolio a part of that contribution will go directly into bitcoin if that's the way they want to set it up so we're really excited to to bring access to cryptocurrency into the 401k and it's not just access we've thought very carefully about how we uh provide the guidance education and guardrails to help people make good prudent use of cryptocurrency as part of their portfolios and when you say that what do you mean well there's uh educational content available what is cryptocurrency how does it fit into a portfolio common pitfalls to avoid that's delivered via online and through webinars um and then there's uh guidance we believe that as part of a diversified portfolio it may be appropriate to have somewhere between zero and five percent in your uh retirement portfolio allocated to cryptocurrency and we'll help people figure out where they fit in that spectrum but there are also guard rails and in this i say uh i mean that there's a limit to how much we'll let you transfer over into the crypto window right now that limit is at five percent so people will be able to transfer up to five percent and be able to contribute on an ongoing basis up to five percent and should the portfolios grow as we expect they will and the position exceeds five percent there's proactive monitoring and alerts that goes out and encourages them to rebalance lets them know that their crypto position has exceeded what we think is a a prudent threshold and that might be a good time to balance into the traditional mutual funds but it won't force them so if it ends up as some of my listeners have told me where their crypto portfolio ends up being you know something like 90 of all their net worth it won't kind of force that rebalancing we're not forcing rebalancing it is a self-directed uh crypto window so in the end the individual will make the decision whether or not to to sell that position um but we will you know cap how much they can put in there and if it goes to 90 of their portfolio well we think that's an extremely aggressive position to take and we would strongly encourage them to take some of those gains and rebalance them into their traditional funds and what are the advantages to buying crypto in a 401k as opposed to just keeping it in a regular crypto account on an exchange or withdrawing and putting it in your own hardware wallet yeah well so there's a lot of real good reasons to do this in the 401k and let's start with the people that are already investing in cryptocurrency the obvious reason that people use foreign case in the first place is for the tax advantages and many people don't realize this but in a 401k you can put in money on a pre-tax basis which is what most people do you can also put money in on a post-tax basis a roth contribution so you pay your taxes at the moment that you've earned the income it goes into the 401k you can then invest that into cryptocurrency among other things and at that point you've already incurred the taxes all of the gains are tax-free even at retirement when you take that money out it is tax-free so it's a huge advantage to be able to reduce and mitigate your tax liability and i think that that's not just on the taxes what we've seen in in the past when there was some periods of extreme volatility and there was a people would buy a position see it go up sell the position roll that into something else let's say they sell bitcoin they put that into eth they've now incurred a big tax liability if that if then goes down they may or sometimes have to sell at a loss to cover the tax liability that they had so in a 401k all of this goes away the tax issue is solved so that's one but here's the second thing and that is we believe what we know there's a ton of people that are what i will call crypto curious and for them the ability to use their 401k to dollar cost average in in small incremental ways get help and guidance not have to open up another account not have to worry about keys not have to think about which platform i should be with simplifies this tremendously so we think this is actually a huge step for bringing more and more people into uh the crypto ecosystem and just to ask about the roth 401k i as far as i understand i don't think that's a super popular option but is that something that all the uh small businesses that use for us all can offer to their employees absolutely yep so that's a standard part of all the 401k plans that we work with because we do think actually it isn't as well utilized i think as it should be um it makes a ton of sense and when you're dealing with something like cryptocurrency it's even more important to consider now we don't provide tax advice um but it does make a lot of sense for a lot of people and and we think that it's unfortunate that perhaps it's not more widely used yeah and just to draw that out a little for people if you qualify to have a roth account then at that time it's because your income is below a certain threshold and so one could imagine you know you would be in a lower tax bracket and if the crypto assets were to go up in the same way that they had uh the last few years then of course yes the tax savings by the time you withdraw the money would be tremendous phenomenal right and frankly that's one of the things that um prompted us to really explore this is we were talking to a lot of people in the crypto community that were doing incredibly uh uh difficult trying to find ways to help mitigate some of their taxes um and when we talked about maybe being able to do this in the 401k the response was incredibly enthusiastic yeah that makes sense so up until this point why haven't most americans been able to invest in crypto assets through their 401ks or why have most 401ks not provided it well so the 401k industry laura is notoriously slow moving and um so it's it i do believe it's inevitable i think that we will see this more and more um but there's really a combination of two things that you have to get comfortable with there's regulations and then there's integrations and you know on the regulation side 401k world is governed by a body of laws called erisa it is a very specific set of rules that give a lot of people pause we worked very very carefully to make sure that we understood exactly how within that framework we could do this and it's very clear that we can and so we were able to solve that but the second is that most 401k providers simply don't have a cryptocurrency um platform to work with so what we had to do is we we partnered with coinbase so we're using coinbase for both custody as well as for transactions we've integrated that into our 401k platform and maybe one of the reasons we were able to do this um so quickly is that we've been building integrations with 401k providers and platforms and payroll companies for the last several years so we're not a traditional 401k company we're a 401k tech company doing the integration was therefore very much in our in our dna so bringing coinbase in integrating it with the 41k platform we're able to provide something that nobody else is all right so in a moment we're going to discuss other comparisons when it comes to retirement accounts but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible with over 10

community-led projects over the course of five years to power sustainable innovation through its ecosystem with fundraising opportunities and support for dows and dapps to engage fans and reach new audiences come learn why nier is the infrastructure for innovation at nea.org back to my conversation with jeff schulte so there have been a few bitcoin iras that have also come out in recent years how is the alt 401k different so that's a great question um i'd say that the the the l41k is different from self-directed iras for a couple of reasons i mean it's it's two maybe two or three primary things a self-directed ira is a great vehicle um but that's for an individual and there are uh limits to um who's eligible and how much you can contribute to that but mostly that's a great solution for a person that um has the the is proactive to go out and find it and take advantage of it the 401k allows you to contribute substantially more to it it's available through your employer and therefore it's a lot easier and more accessible for most people i'd say the other key thing is in the 401k world um we are providing institutional pricing so the costs of what you can the cost of this through the 401k is substantially less than the self-directed iris that we've seen out there so you can contribute more at a lower cost and this is maybe the most key thing with the 401k you can do the ongoing contributions with every paycheck and that's just not something that you can do as easily in a self-directed ira so we think those are some some important differences but i have tremendous respect for the folks that are also doing this in the self-directed ira world and you know hats off to them too and so one thing that listeners have heard me talk about is early on i had been pitched a bitcoin i ira and the fee on that was 15 of the assets that you transferred over and that you know really struck me as being outrageous frankly so what are the fees when it comes to the alt 401k yeah so first of all for the employer there's no extra fee for employees that choose to use it there's a one percent uh platform fee per year so that's eight eight point three basis points a month and then there is a 50 basis points transaction fee so we've worked really hard to try to keep the costs we think very low and competitive um and we think that that's part of the reason why doing this in a 401k makes sense institutional pricing and so who is this available to is it available only to employees at companies that use for for us all as their 401k service provider today yes it's only available to companies that choose to hire for assault as their 401k provider we're thrilled to see so many people doing that um you know 60 of all the people we talked to have said that they want to have cryptocurrency as part of the 401k uh but certainly we are looking at how we can expand that and we have some exciting plans in the future that i'd love to come back and talk to you about some other time but right now the alt 401 k is is the only place to get this and so how many companies is that and how many employees does that cover so today we reach over 70 000 employees across hundreds of different companies and we'll be turning this on for our customers starting in july we expect that we'll see broad adoption across all of them when you went to create this was it because you were seeing demand from those companies or was it just you were looking to service what you believe will be upcoming demand it's really a combination of both i mean i'd say a really big part of this was just observing what's going on with professional and institutional investors and i'd say that you know part of the reasons started the company in the first place was to give average americans some of the same access and help that the professionals do that's really why the company's been called for us all it really came out of that ethos so when you start just looking around what's happening and you recognize that people like the yale endowment are putting well beyond i mean they're putting 50 60 70 into alternative investments and then you look at what's going on in the 401k oh and part of the reason they're doing that laura is the the pool of publicly traded companies which is what the mutual funds are all invested in has been shrinking over time there's actually fewer publicly traded companies today than there were 10 15 years ago so you see the institutional investors they're doing this they're making good use of this for a good reason that was one of the first clues the second is we started talking to employers and as i mentioned 60 of all the employers we talked to said i want to do this and they want to do this for a whole host of reasons but we also started talking to the employees and employees also said i'm extremely interested in fact you look today 49 of millennials are already using cryptocurrency and they're asking us why can't i do this in the 401k it frankly it was everywhere i mean the real question is why hasn't anybody done this before so once we started seeing all of those pieces and it just we said well okay you have to figure out how you do with the regulations you have to figure out the technology you got to put but we could do all that because of who what our background is so um it was really a combination all around i expect that over time the interest and demand for cryptocurrency will continue i mean this is to me we have crossed the rubicon it is absolutely irreversible and there's going to be some uh i think really um key benefits to incorporating into the 401k we're the first we expect that this will become commonplace over a period of time 401k industry doesn't move that fast um as i'm sure you know the saying goes not your keys not your coins how is the security for these crypto assets handled so we are um there's no separate account that they're creating and and there's no keys that the folks have to keep track of um it's all on the uh the coinbase prime platform um assets are held in cold storage except for those moments when they're being traded in which case they're briefly uh moved into a hot wallet um so you know when we were looking at who the potential partners were security was clearly one of the key things we had to evaluate and making sure that we could do this in a way that was both really simple easy and convenient but also extremely secure it was critical so you're starting with 50 cryptocurrencies on offer how are you determining what to offer and how will you determine which new ones to add that's a great question so we're certainly not making everything available that's you know not everything on coinbase will be available one of the roles that we play as a fiduciary to the 401k plan is to review and evaluate and monitor which tokens cryptocurrencies will be available in the 401k we have an investment committee that has a process that they run to make that determination and it really comes down to a combination of factors in the end though i would say part of it is market cap weighted part of it is coin utility things like doge will not be available so we're clearly applying a screen in a subset um and then we'll evaluate that on a quarterly basis and make determinations as to what to include going forward and can you elaborate on that like why doge because i was going to ask you if you were going to offer you know it's a question that comes up a lot um i mean this would be a better question for some folks of our investment committee to answer but but when you look at doge i mean this is a coin that clearly was created as a novelty it's a meme it's got entertainment value um so it's not something that we think is appropriate now what we're looking at is you know this developing a screen that that is uh very sort of um objective in nature um and when we when we when we apply that certain like as i said novelty tokens like dosh they just don't make the cut despite how big that market cap might be today or how popular it is there's a level of prudence that we have to exercise over 400k portfolios and well just out of curiosity so would you allow trading in something like gamestop or amc or whatever the new you know when i or i guess trading in the word are we going to allow trading and game stuff and amc so any of these uh sort of name stocks right no we're not doing that right now um not through well that's not what we're we're talking about really this is you know the crypto the alt window and as i should elaborate the alt window i call it that because it starts with cryptocurrency but we do anticipate adding other types of alternative investments over time um it is not uh we're not catering to every whim on the internet um there's a an appropriate use of cryptocurrency in the 401k world um and the job of the investment committee is to make sure that we apply a screen that protects the employees as well and so if a bitcoin etf and other etfs representing other crypto assets came out how would buying those differ from holding these assets directly in a 401k and which do you expect would be more appealing to investors so this this is a good question um so a bitcoin etf or cryptocurrency etf um at some point someone will get one of these things approved and and it'll become an option um but i think there's a couple of issues with what we've seen anyway um the first is that many of the ones that like that you're even just mentioned focus on one you know it's truly a bitcoin etf what we've seen is that there's a real interest in being able to hold a diversity of altcoins um so we wanted to make sure that they had a choice that's part of why we decided to work with coinbase the other is that what we've seen so far is some of these products um do have an issue where they're trading at a discount to their nav and they're quite expensive so we believe that that's a reason why in some cases these products are perhaps not the best option for employees at all but i think really the key thing is it has to do with the fiduciary risk and when you the 401k that we're providing with a cryptocurrency window does not increase the fiduciary risk to the employers when you choose to make an investment like an etf uh available in the 401k that's a fundamentally different decision for the employer than choosing to make an alt window available making an alt window available is what's called a settler decision it just means it's like an administrative decision making a mutual fund available that's an actual fiduciary decision and because of that we think that most employers are going to prefer a solution where they're not taking that fiduciary position does that make sense interesting um i don't know if i fully understand the distinction i mean one they're both going to be available but you're just saying by virtue of the fact that the etf is focused on one crypto is is that what the fiduciary decision is no what i'm saying is i'm sorry let me attempt to say it it's slightly better choosing to make a mutual fund available in the 401k is a fiduciary decision when you choose to make a fund part of the the lineup that's a fiduciary decision choosing to make a self-directed crypto window available is that oh i see what you're saying exactly and so by making this a self-directed window that the employees ultimately choose to use helps reduce the risk for the employers really it's a different type of decision and so that's one of the reasons why we think that this is the right approach for retirement plans all right so you've kind of hinted that you have deep have plans to go deeper with crypto can you give us a sneak preview of what those other crypto features might be well what i will just say is um sure there's two there's there's two things that i think we're very excited about today what we're going live with provides education guidance and and help for employees we will be introducing a solution that we can actually manage it for them so if people want exposure to crypto but they don't want to make the decisions as to exactly which coins to buy we will have a managed solution for them and then you know i think what we really look at is there's really it's about trying to provide access as broadly as possible today we're very excited to make this available through the for us all 401k i think we'll be looking at how we can go beyond that and possibly being able to make this more broadly available without having to switch your 401k plan to us all right great well i look forward to seeing your future news thank you so much for coming on unconfirmed thank you very much for having me don't forget next up is the weekly news recap

the us government had hacked darkseid's bitcoin wallet to recover the bitcoin a fee theoretically impossible without holding the private key or owning a quantum computer decrypt speculates that these rumors helped spark bitcoin's eight percent decline on monday while it's unclear how the bitcoin was specifically recovered it is likely that u.s authorities were able to track the bitcoin addresses
