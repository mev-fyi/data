feud between Gemini and cryptolander Genesis as well as its parent company dcg just to give some background for people who haven't been following this although we have covered it on the show Gemini has a program called earn that has been offering yields to its customers and in order to earn that return it's been lending those assets to Genesis but because of the numerous bankruptcies that are happening Genesis is having at minimum liquidity issues and quite possibly unlikely insolvency issues so it cannot pay back Gemini earned customers last week Cameron Winklevoss sent a public letter to Barry silbert the head of dcg giving him a deadline of January 8th which was Sunday to publicly commit to working together to solve this problem the deadline came and went and Cameron just sent another letter so Kareem Can you tell us what it is that he said and why this letter was significant sure absolutely yeah it's very interesting because this letter unlike the first is very pointed um it's some big allegations in there in terms of what's been going on at dcg in Genesis and one thing that's very interesting in particular is um I think within the first line of of the letter uh he almost directly States fraud uh as being kind of the root cause of all this you know from my perspective I try not to think about it from that standpoint and rather kind of look at what has gone wrong and what are the issues that Genesis and dcg currently face and I think the reality is that you know the legal process will will kind of ensue and ultimately that's where we'll get more clarity but without a doubt um you know what's been put forth to uh the dcg board is uh is pretty pointed and and what I found more interesting is Barry's response okay and before we get to various response I just wanted to clarify when you said that the legal process is going to bring more clarity what kind of legal process are you referring to well it's clear that at this point there is you know lawsuits ongoing and and there's a lot of concerns over what's gone on at dcg in Genesis and I think the reality is that this is only going to get more and more Focus over the next you know few weeks and a few months as as the resolution to what's going to happen to genesis's creditors doesn't get result um and I think this really only puts dcg and Genesis in a tougher position to try to figure out their their situation sooner than later then ultimately it becomes a massive burden for all of the customers of Gemini but all the other creditors of Genesis as well all right so let's now then talk about Barry silbert's response what did you find so remarkable about it yeah I mean there's a few things and I think the reality is that not many people have actually seen the financials behind ECG uh or Genesis for that matter uh so you know any snippet that we get is really revealing and you know I I think one thing that I found particularly interesting is as you scroll down through that note that he kind of sent to uh to his board of directors there's an FAQ section in the FAQ section outlines a few numbers that I found really interesting one that we already knew about obviously was the 1.1 billion dollar promissory note that dcg wrote to Genesis with a 10-year maturity which was meant to effectively uh take on the 3ac liability that Genesis has one thing that's very important to know about that is that you know this is a 10-year asset at this point for Genesis um so it's not a current asset and another thing that you know we knew prior is that dcg has a 500 million dollar loan from Genesis that is actually due in May in 2023 um which I think uh a lot of you know analysts or people following this are keeping a close eye on because I think the reality is is that that means some sort of liquidity situation is going to need to resolve itself by then unless Genesis or dcg tries to find in our way around this all right so earlier when I asked you about what you meant by legal process you surprisingly didn't mention that you expected that Genesis would file for chapter 11 bankruptcy but that has been talked about a lot so why is it that you didn't mention that it's interesting because I think the reality is is that you're in a situation where dcg has some labor lovers to pull here but the reality might be that those levers are kind of diminishing as time goes by and so while it is a possibility that Justice kind of gets forced into chapter 11 in some way or another it's hard to really say what the ultimate way out is here but it's clear that dcg's choices are are really you know shrinking pretty quickly one other thing that I wanted to mention about that FAQ section in the dcg shareholder letter was that silver also said that the 1.1 billion dollar loan is not callable correct which is what a number of people had been concerned about and suggesting that if that were the case then Genesis going under or filing for chapter 11 would also cause dcg too as well so what did that say to you because I think a lot of people thought that it was so what does that mean to you about how it might be structured realizing that it's not callable ultimately means that it doesn't fix the liquidity issue at Genesis the reality is that this is a promissory note somebody showed you know showed me a meme yesterday which kind of showed up a paper napkin saying an IOU of 1.1 billion which I thought was amusing but I think the reality is is that when you realize that Genesis has three billion dollars in creditors and those creditors are all short-term creditors who who effectively are asking for their money back then the reality is that that asset of 1.1 billion which you know is a 10-year asset than a day for Genesis can't really be monetized unless gcg puts up the capital and the fact that there's no call option in there it guarantees you the fact that this is a long duration asset and nothing less okay yeah and just to make clear for people um the amount that the Gemini earn customers is our owed is 900 million dollars so that would be sleeping amount of money that would cover that so one other thing that I wanted to ask about was Cameron Winklevoss laid out a number of allegations that he was calling accounting fraud and I wondered how credible you thought the claims in his letter were I mean I think the reality is is that if anything is actually if anything that's longer than a year is actually listed as current on the balance sheet then that is problematic without a question I'm not an accountant so I don't really want to comment on what the legal consequences of that would be however what I will say is that you know as a risk manager and somebody who's kind of worked in fixing them for a long time as a liability matching is a big thing and and that has big implications from that regard and it's pretty clear at this point that you know that whole cannot currently be filled because that promissory note is a 10-year promissory note and not then not anything shorter than that if I can add to that you know I think it's worth noting that we know that dcg has been trying to uh to sell off some of their assets and I I think it's worth thinking about how you know what does that really mean part of that could really mean that their conscious stats there you might have to plug a hole and they might need to make those you know that pay back that 1.1 billion sooner than later or or actually monetize for example that loss from 3ac right by covering it up with other assets and liquidity now I think the reality is is that we're going to be in a position where dcg and Genesis are going to have to you know empty their pockets and see what really makes sense in terms of plugging that hole but being in this situation as it is right now with creditors kind of sitting and waiting is not very sustainable and the further the longer this goes on it's going to become worse all right so in a moment we're gonna unpack a few more of the details around this really sticky situation but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible join over 50 million people using crypto.com one of the easiest places

subscriptions and zero annual fees download the crypto.com app now and get 25 with the code Laura Link in the description back to my conversation with Kareem so another thing which you kind of alluded to but I want to unpack it a little bit more is this terminology of current because both Cameron and Barry Silver have been using it in potentially different ways I'm just going to quote from the letter that Cameron Winklevoss sent he says first as a matter of generally accepted accounting principles and common understanding a current asset refers to cash cash equivalents or other assets that can be exchanged into cash within one year and promissory note with a principal repayment due in 10 years Falls outside the definition of a current asset by a country mile now you might have seen also that after you know we saw then that silver responded with the letter which said that the promissory note was not callable Ryan sulcus of massari posited a theory that silver might be using a different definition of current and said that you can use the word current also to say like this borrower is meeting all payments on its loans although as RAM alawali pointed out in this case there's only one payment which will be the one in 2032. so is do you think that that's what's going on here and if so is that kind of the obfuscation that Cameron Michael wants to talk about I agree with Cameron in regards to how in accounting practices current means something that's within a year I from you know I've reread uh the tweets that uh Barry has put out and at least the way I interpret it I I do think that what he's trying to say is that dcg is current which basically means he's the loan is performing but I mean I think it's pretty clear that this has you know various interpretations and I don't think ROM is necessarily wrong um and I just think here just a matter of how you interpret what's being said but the way I looked at it is you know all he was trying to really uh communicate was that dcg is not currently late on any payments due to Genesis and basically say that dcg currently is fun oh okay so he's not saying that that should be counted as a current asset on genesis's books I would not I would not interpret it that way at least at least the way I I kind of look at it but I think the reality is is that anything on Twitter can be kind of misconstrued in different ways but I would imagine that Barry's also advised not to put out something that would be misleading and I think that would definitely be misleading because there's nothing about a 10-year promissory note that makes it current okay okay so it seems like he's using a different definition I think we're nitpicking here to be it to be to be honest and uh that's really it but but I mean don't you think that that's exactly what's going on behind the scenes before they post all of these that the lawyers are combing over everything and I mean I I feel like parsing the language is probably useful no yeah I I think you're I think you're absolutely right it's hard to really gauge some of the motivations and how people are thinking about it I'm just kind of giving kind of the way I would look at it as somebody who's kind of worked in loans before is that using the terminology current on on loans is is is is uh is fairly common in terms of interpreting that uh the loan has no late payments and the the borrowers currently you know not in default for example right right but but you also agreed about Cameron's definition of current asset so so that then supports Ryan's Theory Ryan selkis's theory that they're using this group current in two different ways okay so at this point what questions do you have for dcg or Barry silbert or Genesis like what do you think people don't yet know that would help determine either where to lay the blame or how the situation could potentially be resolved or how it might eventually be risk of course I'd like to see I'd like to uh to ask dcg for some sort of plan between the two entities dcg and Genesis as to how they look to fill these liquidity gaps because the reality is is that we have an idea of what the assets are we know what the liabilities are we also know that those liabilities are going out the door so the question is that your asset base how do you monetize it how do you monetize it so that you can pay back your creditors or at least come to the agreement with your creditors and I think that's something that's really important and it's important to bear in mind that these are intercompany loans so the realities when we're talking about Genesis we kind of end up talking about dcg because this promissory note you know I think you know while it does it serves a purpose the reality is is that in a situation you know what's materialized over the last few months that no longer cuts it right it it was meant to kind of cover a hole um and over the long run be repaid but in under circumstance in which you have liabilities going out the door you have to be in a situation where you can monetize your assets so that you can cover those liabilities all right well who knows how all of that will play out but uh another wild collared here is that Bloomberg reported that Federal prosecutors in the eastern district of New York as well as the Securities Exchange Commission are investigating the transfers between dcg and a subsidiary that people are positing is probably Genesis and and also looking into what it is that investors were told about that's those transactions dcg says they don't know anything about this but I was wondering what you think investigators would be looking for if if that is the case I think it's the goal here would probably be to understand to what degree the arms length arm's length I say is that you know the nature of the promissory note was really conducted in right to what extent was Barry for example directly involved in you know constructing that loan that promissory note to Genesis because I think ultimately that becomes a potential issue it's also important to kind of note that when you kind of zoom out a little bit this starts to look pretty ugly right we're talking grayscale another subsidiary of dcg who obviously has gbtc uh which is kind of their their big product and and one of the most important Revenue lines for dcg and its subsidiaries you know one that's guarded tons of attention three AC was involved ultimately got liquidated dcg has now a relatively large stake or 11 stake in gbtc and it's kind of worth noting that this is their most valuable asset as you know a you know Empire if you want to call it that so I think the reality is that you're in a position where the inter-company kind of relationships start to look fairly shady and and I think it's pretty standard for Regulators to look into this stuff like it's worth noting that kind of when you look at traditional Finance there is tense there needs to be kind of an arm's length nature in the way that companies deal with themselves even between subsidiaries and that that's going to be uh that's going to be a sticking point here and I think that's actually a lesson that we're probably that we can take away from in 2022 and what kinds of terms on that promissory note would kind of Meet the standard of arm's length and what kind of terms and conditions would not sure I mean you know the one that really sticks out to me is uh the interest rate on the loan the interest rate was deemed one percent now if I were to just look at dcg as a venture capital firm that has kind of you know exposure everywhere it's quite a bit of concentration in terms of Earth's exposures especially into crypto right and then look at for example all our crypto firms that do have bonds outstanding one thing is clear is that one percent is not really the appropriate rate to quantify that the credit risk behind dcg especially 10 years out so that's something that I would look into to to kind of question because I have a hard time believing that one percent was really the right place to price this but then again from a legal perspective I'm not sure exactly what those rules would be in terms of what defines arm's length or not so as you alluded earlier Genesis owes creditors more than three billion dollars and dcg is exploring selling some assets from its Venture portfolio to raise money do you think that strategy could be successful and get them out of this pickle in time yes I do think that that is it is potential it is a potential solution uh when I want to caveat that right I think it's worth noting that a lot of their assets are Venture Capital Investments which at some point are marked at a certain valuation but it's very possible and in fact probably likely that those valuations are not you know Mark to Market currently and uh it's also worth noting that you know typically a market when they know that participants in trouble and has to sell the Market's not going to be very kind in terms of giving you the valuations you're looking for so you know I think the fear ends is something you might have brought up at the very beginning of this conversation is that you know liquidity issue but could very very well end up being a bigger issue solvency issue at that and but do you also think that they could sell the Venture investments in time to raise the amount of money they would need it's uh it's definitely possible I mean I think you know it's important to note that obviously we have the main maturity coming uh so that's only a few months away so I would imagine that if they're going to get it done it needs to be sooner than later and to be frank with you I would have liked to have seen this in December uh I have an idea in my head as to how this gets resolved for gcg in Genesis but you know what I think the truth is is that that's something that you know barrier dcg doesn't necessarily want to go on with or doesn't necessarily want to admit the situation they're currently in which I think ultimately only risks harming them over the next few months and when you say that you have an idea of how this works out is that selling the Venture Investments or or what is it yes partially selling the Venture Investments I mean it's worth noting that obviously they own 11 of gbtc gbtc Trades at a 40 discount in my mind this whole thing has amounted to one very big gbtc discount trade which ultimately has ended up back in the hands of the parent of the issuer of gbtc um which I think you know if I were to kind of interpret it my own way I would look at it as he's made a levered bet on his own products getting converted to an ETF and um it's it's unfortunate where we are right now but um I I just doesn't look very good you know amidst all this what do you think is likely to happen to grayscale very difficult to say but I I think the reality is is that when you have a parent who who's clearly in some sort of liquidity situation uh especially with the Genesis issues don't get resolved soon then I think the reality is they have to think The Regulators are going to start asking questions and and and I think at that point you know it's probably in the best interest of the shareholders to ultimately have a management company who's considered healthy and can take on the responsibility you imagine gbvc but I mean the reality is is that it's kind of unclear how this plays out from here um it's also unclear because you know we know that the SEC is looking into dcg in Genesis but you know we don't have further details to that okay yeah one other thing that doesn't look very good is that um two board members who are quite prominent Glenn Hutchinson Larry Summers left and that was actually um back in November so you know again not not really promising developments for dcg um I guess the only other thing that I'd like to ask you about is that there was another company bit Volvo that revealed that dcg had offered to pay it at least 70 percent of the 300 million dollars uh that it gave that it loaned to Genesis but that vavo refused that offer saying that Genesis does have the ability to repay the total amount within the agreed-upon period so what do you think of that development I think it's interesting um I think the reality is TCG might be trying to work with creditors who could uh be willing to work with them and accept some sort of discount uh it's at all to the overall borrowings I think the reality is that it's not really panning out properly and what vivavo's probably trying to State here is that there's assets there you just need to do what you need to do to make them liquid to pay us back in full and I think that's really the sticking point and the fact that vivavo has rejected that kind of means I think broadly means that creditors are are not going to really be budgeting at this point because I think most you know most who followed the crypto space pretty closely it's hard to ignore how messy this situation has gotten and I think ultimately a lot of this ends up falling on TCG um which is which is really unfortunate so just to draw out something that you said earlier it seems like your basic recommendation to dcg would be what to sell the 11 percent of gptc that they own in order to recoup whatever they cut from that and and sell some Venture Investments and then use all that to pay anyway you you fill it in I'm not going to of course no I mean the problem is that there's no good recommendation because the reality is that had you risk manage yourself properly you would have never put yourself in this situation and that's the really tough part now if you want to tell me how if you want to ask me how do you get this resolved quickly yes you gotta sell what you what you can sell which I would suggest is probably some of your more valuable assets that if anything very probably Treasures but then if anything is well the way I kind of looked at it in the math that I kind of did in November suggested that if there were Redemption mechanism that were enabled for gbtc then you would see a large increase in the asset value of their gbtc Holdings which are obviously 11 of all gbtc outstanding which would fill a big chunk of that hole now it's worth noting you know dcg grayscale make a lot of money off those fees uh which I believe are currently at two percent and that is kind of the price possession for the dcg Empire and so giving that up is tough and I think that's really the situation I've kind of taken the stance spoken to ROM about this over the last few months and I've spoken to plenty of people about this is that that the best solution here is probably to end this gbtc trade by ultimately allowing redemptions to happen and kind of get this Saga over with because we know that this has been going on for the last call year uh and you know three AC was involved we know our hedge funds were involved we know Genesis got tied up I think the reality is that the Saga just needs to end well okay well we will see what they end up doing thanks so much for explaining it all on Unchained of course thank you very much for having me don't forget next up is the
