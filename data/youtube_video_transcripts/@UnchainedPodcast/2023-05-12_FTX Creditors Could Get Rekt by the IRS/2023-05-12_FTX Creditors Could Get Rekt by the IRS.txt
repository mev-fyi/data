with the code Laura Link in the description today's guest is wassi lawyer a lawyer specializing in restructuring and insolvency welcome wassi hi it's good to be back late Wednesday coindesk reported that the IRS is claiming 44 billion dollars in taxes on FTX and Alameda both of which are in bankruptcy I see people commenting on how can that be when Alameda may never have made that much money how do you think the IRS is coming up with these numbers I mean I mean obviously it sounds like they don't actually have the details to figure out what what the number actually is so they just go for as high-end numbers as possible so there's been a lot of experts in space I'm not a tax expert but I've been saying that meat meat PC has an incredibly bold summary of what's going on and why the IRS is saying all these things but um the the view which is uh what is explained this that the IRS is basically reclassifying some um uh contract contractor Arrangements the employee arrangements and sort of claiming back taxes on that um and essentially because they don't have the details they just go for as higher number as possible and then we'll probably expect the number to actually come down quite significantly um if and when it actually gets paid and one other thing is that the claims are being filed as admin priority what does that mean yeah that's the um annoying bit so under the U.S bankruptcy code um the amount of money is owed to Uncle Sam Pick priority over the average unsecured creditor which you know unless you unless a sort of more creative trust arguments hold um a bad fruit that's what the average um customer is an unsecured creditor so what you you potentially have is you have these tax claims coming in in priority to unsecure claims just just to be just to be sort of clarify a bit further because people have been asking how does this how does this affect FTX International the positives given the large tax bills hitting Alameda so to sort of recap FTX is an unsecured credit of Alameda so that's what happens when you know when Sam takes all of our money out into Alameda and uses it to you know invest in stuff um what what actually has happened is that he's borrowed the money from FTX International and in order for FTX International to recover that money they recover in the capacity of unsecured creditor so having let's just say if it's a 20 billion dollar tax liability show up at the Alameda level it means that the tax man gets paid before any money goes back into FTX International where it can then be used to pay well us and the other thing I notice is that they're also being called unliquidated what does that mean I mean a liquidated claim is basically a claim for a agreed amount of Damages if if that makes sense so when you've liquidated damage is closed it means you've agreed that if there is a breach this would be the amount of liquid of damage is payable under the created just means well they're just they're not liquidated okay meaning that there's a dollar amount but that hasn't been agreed upon yeah that's the dollar amount is not agreed okay so it's like one size it's a certain still has to quantify and assess the damage if that makes sense okay so you started to talk about kind of like the order of preference when we were talking about the admin priority but obviously some of these tax claims are not just against Alameda but also FTX so in general now when you because obviously if so like when you look at the docket you'll see there's like many many many different um IRS claims against all these different entities um in the FTX Alameda Empire so in general now how does this affect the bankruptcy proceeding I mean you're basically applying the admin priority rule to each individual entity right so let's say um I I noticed as a tax claim against FTX International as well so that's the kind of the that's the straightforward in a way straightforward one right so FDX International you've got your customer deposits in there all of your customers are claiming I'm assuming at this point it's unsecured creditors there is a tax claim from the IRS on top of it it means the IRS needs to get paid its money first before any of the customers can take their money out now you apply that across the board to all these entities and so for instance like I explained about Alameda Alia Alameda owes FTX International 10 billion dollars if Alameda sells its assets and manages to get 10 billion dollars and moves it and uses it to pay FTX International FTX International can then now has that money which can use to pay its its own unsecured credit this I.E asset deposit this now if there isn't 20 billion The Tax Claim sitting in Alameda which is which ranks a hit of FTX Internationals Kilim against Alameda what happens is your 10 billion dollars that you may have gotten from liquidating whatever random Sam coin shoot coins um Investments now that all just goes to the tax man so no money comes into effects International and that um that means no money is there to pay pay down it's um the customers so as we alluded to earlier the way that these numbers are being presented in the bankruptcy is not with like some kind of um I guess what's the word um proof of how they are they were arrived at and I saw some tax analysts calling in to question how it was that the IRS came up with these calculations so meet TC who you mentioned um his profile says he's a principal at D gen legal and he tweeted it he tweeted about the 20 billion dollar tax bill in Alameda and said quote in part it appears the IRS went back and reclassified all employees from contractors to employees and hit them for unpaid employer-side employment taxes so um for people who who don't know this um when you are an employee then your employer will pay a 15 tax on your income and then you also pay taxes um if you're like self-employing you you are responsible for both sides of that another tax related person it seems Mr purple DJ tweeted quote the IRS claims eight billion dollars in same tax for 2022 which would exceed all revenue um he also says that it claims 122 million dollars per quarter for payroll taxes which are 15 and he said that would imply that they had 3.2 billion dollars in salaries um and then he also flagged that the IRS is not claiming any interest or penalties and he said typically that's where you usually see large amounts so it looks you know like people are kind of skeptical of how it was that the IRS arrived at these numbers so is there any point at which the IRS will have to show its calculations let's be honest I'm not tax lawyer so I can't comment on that um I can I can sort of a quote from meat right um the bankruptcy court require the IRS to show how it's arriving at least presumably at some point that they're going to have to you know I think this this will certainly be defended and litigated like John Ray is not going to sit there and just hand over money to the IRS this is something that's going to be an ongoing matter and it's something that will be you know determined for the downline for a amount that is going to be vastly smaller than the 20 billion dollars even if it's a billion dollars it's painful even if it's 500 million dollars it's painful because of the administrative priority right but I guess what I'm asking is um so so it seems like you think John Ray is he's not going to just accept these he's fine absolutely absolutely not no is that a typical thing or is that uncommon or how does that even work I mean what the IRS have put in is a claim right it's just that it's a claim and anyone can go in and put it put in a claim against the FTX estate at this point of time the question is whether or not that claim actually will exist and and the the Quantum of that claim that is something that needs to be worked out and flashed out over the coming weeks and months and presumably the estate is going to start doing a lot of homework to figure out look even if we reclassify of our contract agreements the employment employment agreements this is the maximum amount of tax will be payable and you'll be paid out of this Silo and this Silo as opposed to that Silo so yeah I fully expect a lot of work going to be done the southern Chrome was definitely calling out the tax department and putting them on you know making them work late today okay so in a moment we're going to unpack a little bit more how all this will affect the proceedings but first a quick word for the sponsors who make the show possible ever wanted to use D5

need way more than 15 minutes probably like an hour or two hours maybe five um it's it's a shot the argument that a rules a very long time ago I think we may have discussed this briefly around how the FTX terms and soft Services worked where customers who put in digital assets retain title to those digital assets the the trust argument is simply that does those assets um those digital assets that customers put in were always held on trust by FDX of the national and when they transfer them to Alameda they could the customers continue to have a proprietary interest in those assets so if you have a proprietary interest in those assets you are not a unsecured creditor you want a credit at all you're just taking assets that's yours you're asserting the proprietary interest that you have in those assets um the reason why I said it's going to take a very long time to flash out in detail is because it isn't the Silver Bullet which a lot of people seem to think it is people seem to think hey if I've got to try if the trust argument works that means that my Bitcoin which is sitting on FTX is my Bitcoin so FTX has to give it to me in full without you know and effectively in priority to everything else the thing is that it's not it really isn't that simple because it has a massive massive knock-on effects for for instance you you can no longer have your preference claims right your preferential withdrawal period because I didn't withdraw any money I'm not accredited I just took assets that belong to me so you're not you're no longer using that preference action of U.S bankruptcy code to start clawing back assets against other customers you're using something else completely different potentially something you know founded in unjust enrichment which is which again is going to take us a very very long time to talk about if it's that those assets simply belong to the customers and they are not unsecured creditors then like basically the notion of clawbacks almost doesn't exist anymore at least for customers not in not in accordance to the US bankruptcy code because now now what what what happens if you essentially think of everything as if you think of the substantially of the customer funds as being on trust as opposed to you know customers being unsecured creditors of the company then you're you're looking at bankruptcy law anymore you're looking at trust law you're looking at a trust shortfall clearly and someone who's withdrawn has withdrawn in priority to others and therefore not taken their product or share of that shortfall and you're basically back to you know trust law common law um it's it's going to be incredibly incredibly complicated to to almost to add to that digital assets if the trust argument does bear fruit it's gonna it's basically gonna pick winners and losers it's a good pick there's gonna be customers who wire it 10 million dollars or 100 million dollars to Alameda or or or FTX well they watched Alameda because FTX used to add them in his bank account but there's going to be customers that wire it Fiat money and there's going to be a customer that why the same amount and send the same amount in usdc and the guy who sends it in usdc gets all of his money back whereas the guy who's wise the money via Bank Trust I get zero or or close to nothing so it's gonna it's gonna end up in a pretty crazy situation you're gonna have a situation where there's gonna be a lot of litigation around what assets I entrust what assets are not in trust if you started using the leverage trading functions of FTX do you then give up your truck do you then give a proprietary claim I don't know I don't know the answer to that okay wait I'm gonna we're gonna have to put a pin in that one um yes but what I wanted to ask first was just when you were talking about the the person who wired money and how um if they were wiring US Dollars and they might not have any claims um or or get any money back so but what if you know you were wiring money because you thought that you were buying a whole Bitcoin like you wired you know 20 000 bucks because you thought you were getting one whole Bitcoin then you're absolutely seeing the um absolute Insanity the ensues because if I wired a 20 20K to buy a Bitcoin and I buy the Bitcoin do I now hold the Bitcoin the bitcoin's not on trust then the guy who deposit the Bitcoin does he no longer have a proprietary interest in the quote-unquote trust does he now only have a you know claimers answer good credit against the FTX estate you see why this creates a lot of well I don't see why they wouldn't both have their assets and Trust there the only problem would be is if Alameda didn't actually buy the Bitcoin at the time oh yeah with the US Dollars which it looks like maybe they didn't for some of them uh yeah um that's that as well of course [Laughter] so you are looking into very very complex areas of trust law and look I I I I can't say that I have all the answers right now there is literally no one here who can say that they have all the answers right now if we were to end up in a world where customer assets were held on trust it will okay and yeah and before we I still want to get to that leverage question but before we move to that I just want to ask like it sounds like all of this is raising the exact same issues that came up with the mount gox case but at that time the Japanese Court decided to denominate everything in dollars and not return Investments to People based on the amount of Bitcoin they had so is this kind of like a question that keeps coming up and over and over again in different courts worldwide and do you think that it's just we're just going to end up with different jurisdictions that have different standards or do you feel like we'll start to see it start to see a particular standard emerge so I mean I spoke with gonby about this mongox thing as well um and I think what happened I mean the the there was some sort of arrangement that happened um where I think the creditors are in fact getting the Bitcoin back because the value of Bitcoin has gone up so massively that um I can't recall the exit details of the arrangement of the process the use but it's very different from the um from the from the US court system the issue of the nomination of crypto claims is going to be something that will be that is going to be an issue it is likely going to be litigated it is an issue it it doesn't really have to be determined unless you actually liquidate you complete liquidate the company because you could you could agree as part of the chapter 11 plan or agree as part of the restructuring plan how you're going to deal with those assets you could the the one where I can see this being litigated very seriously is three arrows Capital because that's a liquidation scenario where there is a lot of finality to it um so I'm sorry like what is it about the um three arrows case that makes it different oh because it's a liquidation scenario where oh now we're looking at chapter 11 chapter 11 is a reorganization procedure for the most part right I mean we could still end up having to liquidate bits and pieces of it I mean the customer claims may end up just being denominated in US Dollars Okay so all right so I yeah I guess we're just gonna have to see how yeah but the denomination of crypto claims is very different from the trust argument it's it the trust argument is and almost uniquely FTX matter just to clarify oh okay yeah there's no other bankrupt I mean I guess like with Celsius that Celsius is custody correct it's basically the the custody lawsuits in in Celsius right whereas people would say by SSN custody the thing is Celsius actually had a custody function and a non-custody function where it was very clear that those are the non-custody functions were not secured creditors and then there was a custody function and then there was a withhold function somewhere where I think there was there was where a lot of litigation was now in FTX the argument is that even though FTX never really had a custody function or anything like that they are arguing that from the terms of service the FTX never had title to any of those assets and therefore FTX using those assets lending them to Alameda um when when they did so did so it was an appropriation of custom assets and there was a trust over those assets over those assets am I right that that probably is the correct interpretation like any crypto person would definitely say when you have your money on an exchange that it's still your money like it's not like you gave them money to The Exchange it's just like they're holding it but you own it yeah probably um except it's also complicated effect it's been a while since I Revisited this but I've had quite quite long discussions have gone B about this and it doesn't help that the terms of you terms of service would change semi-recently to the English to the English terms of service which kind of provides this your title does not transfer um on provision which everyone is hanging their ads on so potentially you then have a timing issue as well as to which terms the service your specific deposit came on under oh wow wait and I'm sorry you what did you say in under English law your title does not transfer no so the terms of service that everyone's referencing in order to make this trust argue in is a terms of service governed under English law which specifically states that your digital assets remain yours and title does not transfer to FTX and this is the provision which people use to say the digital assets belong to me yeah um they're held on trust I have the right proprietary interest in these digital assets the slightly complicating bit is that these terms of service were fairly recent and there were previous versions of it which may not have language that put it in such a specific Manner and from recollection they were also not English not gathered okay but in that case is the basic reading what that FTF owns the money or the creditors or the the customer oh I have to dig it up but I have to dig it up but I recall the language not being that that clear like if you want to have a photo chat about the trust argument I'm happy to you know I mean I thought we're talking about texting here but uh if you're talking about the trusting I could sit down with you for an hour okay and we can go through the we could go through the eventualities and what the arguments actually are if that helps well okay so obviously we're not going to do that right now but at the moment does it look like the bankruptcy estate is leaning toward that interpretation I think the the chord is going to decide on it so fairly soon as well if I'm not wrong so we'll we'll we'll probably hear a bit of it soon enough communication on how the judge is leaning no idea absolutely no idea all right and then the last thing because you said it so fast but I I didn't quite catch it you said something interesting about leverage as well the leverage but it just goes back to the trust argument that we were discussing earlier which is if you're using leverage functions but to use your digital assets right and you're saying I've directed proprietary interest in those digital assets but you then borrow money from FTX secured on those digital assets what is the nature of the security on those digital assets do you give up your proprietary title when you use any leverage functions maybe maybe not depending on what the security ends up actually being obviously it's not specified um and to what extent do you give it up if you do no idea absolutely no idea there's a lot of open questions with the trust stuff that's what I'm saying yeah it's not a silver bullet where trust binding means I get all my money back and everyone else gets okay yeah it sounds like um in this pick a path Adventure um every ending is a little messy yeah I mean personally as a lawyer I really I want to see the trust the argument because it'd be so it would be so interesting I think a lot of lawyers want to see it because it's interesting but if you are a customer of FTX you do not want to see it because I say you don't want to see it I think a lot of people do because that may that may or may not give give them better recoveries but what's happening is this is all going to be litigated on the FTX customer dime right so do I want new law being made with with the estate's money paying lawyers probably not it's just going to be a very very convoluted complex and annoying matter matter okay right but it sounds like it would be good for this space as a whole if it was decided in that way at least in my opinion because I feel like well I don't know or maybe not maybe it would be good if if it was decided that quote unquote wrong way and then nobody would put their money on centralized exchanges I would like I would like it to to to to be as a crypto participant there is an implied understanding that your keys your coins belong to you and when you put them on Exchange they still belong to you and the exchange can't just steal it and you know or basically convert it into credit I think I think I mentioned previously FTX were basically trying to do what your Voyager in your Celsius did except Voyager and Celsius at terms and conditions that allowed them to use and rehyporticate customer assets or STX did not and now we're now we're figuring out what happens if you do not have those terms and you do it anyway that is such

platform in the last 24 hours withdrawals are back now but Bitcoin prices have fallen 3.5 percent which honestly does seem like a normal weekend but we should still be mad at Finance people can't just have their Bitcoin withdrawals halted okay what if they need that Bitcoin to pay rent said dozens of Bitcoin traders who live rent free in their parents basements binance is calling this issue a learning opportunity that's not what a learning opportunity is a learning opportunity is when I hire an unlicensed plumber because he's cheaper and he ends up creating an issue that floods my
