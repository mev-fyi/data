chris thanks for having me laura you recently wrote an epic article called hype man of the century for the verge and it was about justin sun the founder and ceo of tron tell us what that story is about the story is about how he uh basically came to america in in some ways to put it short he acquired this company that's very famous in the us and silicon valley bittorrent um and uh through that acquisition sought to sort of expand his empire by adding new features that could help promote his cryptocurrencies and so the story is really about his acquisition and how he suddenly straddled this difficult relationship between the us and china and um how in some ways the decisions he made flew in the face of you know what i suppose you could say seasoned businessmen decide to do in those cases uh so he pursued um ethically and legally dubious software projects and the workplace in the united states in san francisco changed dramatically and so the story is told through 18 current and former employees um who spoke to me uh only if i wouldn't use their names in the story none of them sought to uh uh none of them wanted to face retaliation from an uber millionaire like justin's son so we agreed one of the sources however is on the record in the story and i reached out to justin son to try to interview him uh twice and also sent him a long list of detailed questions based on the allegations and observations of all the people who talked to me for the story and the product is this uh narrative that takes you through this wild ride inside of tron when justin sun came to san francisco so let's talk a little bit more about sun and let's go into his background a little bit just so people get a sense of where he came from what was his upbringing and how did he come to become a millionaire well he was born in king hai which is a province in china and it's not a super well-known uh province uh he moved around a bit when he was a kid he uh among other things went to a academy for studying go the um it's like a combination between chess and checkers it's a pretty complicated game um and he he says in his autobiography which is called a brave new world or brave new world uh that he wanted to be a go master and his parents essentially said well look if you're gonna go do this you gotta commit like you can't you know back out of this and so he was thrust into this world of go in in the city of wuhan there's a famous essay writing contest in china that is sort of a way you can get into some of the most prestigious colleges there and he uh wrote this essay that captured the attention of of the judges and helped him get into a prestigious college and so um he he however was by his own admission not a great student he was he played a lot of video games and stuff and uh went to college and then went to do a graduate program at penn state in the states in east asia studies and it was there that he was an early investor in bitcoin and according to him uh or and according to the lore uh and legend on the internet invested a significant portion of his tuition in bitcoin and made a lot of money and then began uh trying to hatch ideas for various uh tech projects among them was pay well which was sort of his big hit that uh had 10 million registered users and was a sort of a mashup of um tinder and also live stream chat rooms and it was all audio based that's what was sort of different and unusual it wasn't really a visual app that said it it eventually edged into the territory of this sort of uh i suppose you could say audio pornography and in in the long run was shut down by the chinese authorities for quote disrupting uh socialist values that app was among many that were shut down for those reasons but uh he made quite a bit of money off of that and he got involved in ripple among others and he made money quite quickly quite early on and made his foray into cryptocurrency after that yeah so tell us how he got his start there and then came to acquire bittorrent and also what began happening after he acquired this peer-to-peer file sharing company well uh his first successful currency was trx and the initial coin offering for that made him but according to what he told others extremely extremely wealthy uh he said to an employee for one day he was richer than bill gates do i have the financial documents to back that up no i mean it's what he said to someone people i mean took some of the stuff he said with a grain of salt but there was no doubt that people at the company to this day believe he could be a billionaire uh he says he's a multi-millionaire he told bloomberg that but in any case that initial coin offering just made him so rich and he sort of wanted to build on that in the midst of this attended this university seminar created by jack ma a business seminar and he'd graduated from that and this is a big part of his personal story is meeting jack ma sort of being mentored by jack ma he sort of builds an image of himself as a protege of jack ma but in any case part of his his thesis for uh his thesis he wrote for that seminar uh i believe uh was about decentralized blockchain technology and so that was where his head was at where he was heading when he made all this money with with trx and so bittorrent meanwhile across the pond in san francisco was doing okay they were having trouble making uh good revenue and uh to some it looked the company looked like a distressed asset to others it was just sort of you know stagnant and so he saw something ripe to purchase and bittorrent came with a bunch of decentralized technology which was right up his alley and that's how that um purchase happened and so you alluded that to this in the beginning but there were definitely some differences in the way that sun um and his employees uh interacted with each other in the us versus in china what were some of those differences and in general what were some of the changes that happened in the bittorrent office once sun acquired bittorrent well just from a person-to-person interaction thing if you were in the office and you were chinese you knew mandarin you grew up in china or you know even if you spent a lot of time living in the u.s sun would expect you to call them sun zong which means sort of you know mr sun boss son it's a much more formal thing and uh meanwhile you know the american employees who had lived in san francisco or wherever their entire life would just be like oh hey justin what's up and so uh right there there was a difference in how people were treated and um uh chinese employees uh were scared of him so the fear that he inspired him in employees began as just sort of like high expectations he sort of saw himself as a a famous person he would um he rarely smiled when he was you know walking around the office and he projected a sort of aura of being up on a pedestal i suppose took lunches alone in his room on a tray um as it started employees were sort of curious about him they didn't view him as threatening but a big turning point in that came when finally tron the senior employees in in beijing and justin we're going to do a big q a a town hall q a uh and questions were submitted anonymously um and you know this is pr this is a thing that is done quite uh broadly in silicon valley it's you know this idea of putting tough questions to the leadership uh testing their vision and so those are the sorts of questions that showed up in the q a and before the q a sun asked to have a meeting where he could see the questions beforehand i was told that part of that was to censor them but in any case he began reading them and some of the questions were you know these existential questions i'm talking about and one was what if trx drops to zero what happens to the company and he immediately loses it and throws a tantrum and says we're gonna find out who wrote this we're going to hunt them down like i want to know who wrote this and i want to kill their entire family and people who understood what was being said because he was saying this in mandarin were taken aback but this is what began to really characterize how he treated employees a couple i spoke to had been threatened in their own way the the screaming you know tantrums this sort of thing continued on and on and on and uh there whenever there was a big pr setback for his business uh he he would go into these dark moods and um lash out at employees and eventually it led to actual physical violence in the office well so in a moment we're going to discuss more about that plus also some major ethical lapses at the company but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible crypto.com the crypto super app that lets you buy earn

harland dunaway so you talked about physical violence in the office what happened there well uh one of uh sun's main deputies was this guy is was this guy song lee and um for i was able to piece together song lee's story about his relationship with sun by talking to all these employees and what i learned is that early on because he was willing to tolerate sun's extremely high demands he became a sort of insider close in the inner circle basically uh he was always you know at justin's beck and call and always within reach of justin and so i'm sure many people who listen to this conte uh this podcast are uh familiar with the win a tesla debacle where sun tried to raffle off tesla's to twitter followers and it went very poorly and he had a meltdown over it and one of these days a young software engineer named lucas yareshek came into the office and witnessed son coming out of his office in spitting rage and striking song lee song lee was the first person you know nearby and he was just in this fit of rage and he was screaming and he just pummeled the guy and uh yoreshek who witnessed this reported this to hr and he was assured you know there won't be any retaliation that kind of thing but things went very differently for got very strange for him very quickly when he tried to report uh and hold son accountable for what he had done in addition you also detail a number of major ethical lapses of the company stemming not from the employees but from sun himself one of the first was around an app store on the tron network another was around piracy on this bittorrent project called bt movie there was yet another one around a streaming product called bt live why don't you give us an overview of what happened with these projects sure so um the app store on the tron network essentially you can come in as an independent developer and put your app on there and people will you know use it and cryptocurrency flows through it um and uh but the thing is tron doesn't really know much information about any of these developers and so as one employee told me these developers would get on the blockchain and scam all day 24 7. there was no accountability they had no way to reach these people but they did hear from the people who were getting scammed and they would write in with messages dms on twitter just trying to reach the company every which way even better business bureau complaints showed up at the office people were really trying to get some accountability for these um developers who were running scams and and sun was aware of this he attended weekly meetings where this was i mean his style was he expected a report card from essentially everyone who was at the meeting and so he was constantly apprised of what was happening uh on the blockchain he decided not to to address it when it comes to other products that i mean the two big products i write about that he had a vision for were bt movie and bt live bt movie uh was going to basically decentralize movie sharing and use the bittorrent protocol to do that and um one source explained to me that once something is seeded out there amongst in peer-to-peer sharing world it's very difficult to root it out so if a hollywood movie ends up on this platform good luck trying to take it down i mean it's out there now so that that was one of the worries but the other worry was that i mean if if really gnarly stuff ended up on bt movie they wouldn't be able to take it down if it was terrorist content if it was you know child abuse imagery they wouldn't be able to take it down and employees pushed very hard to get some type of moderation introduced among them was this young software engineer i told you about uh lucas jurassic and um nonetheless the product went ahead uh yorashek discovered it had actually gone completely live it was operational he went and took a look at it and he saw just a long list of hollywood movies already you know out there being pirated essentially and you know the line that bittorrent had maintained for a long time is we provide a technology we have nothing to do with the content uh that's on on this platform but here's the thing yodashek went into the source code this is available on github you can go look at it yourself and uh saw the the tron wallet identifiers for people who were altering the code the the admins of the code and he discovered that people had put uh you know it's an uh let me back up it's an altruistic platform in some sense you get tips for sharing these movies well in the code it shows that someone takes 20 of the tips well tron takes 20 of the tips no question about that all the users who upload the torrent so you can access the movie wherever it is on whatever server get 80 of the tips okay well yorashek being an insider of the company knows the unique identifiers for those tron wallets that are modifying the code and he told me that these were employees who were uploading the torrents that would allow you to download pirated content and so essentially tron was taking a hundred percent of the revenue on the sharing for that so that was bt movie uh this i mean uh yurscheck basically got fired as a result of his opposition to this this project he filed an ic3 complaint uh to the fbi on his way home from work one day uh when he was on you know caltrain going back to you know down near san jose and so um that was bt movie and it you know it flies right against the united states chief objection in the trade war they're all about stopping intellectual property theft fbi director chris wray said this requires a whole of society response to try to stop uh yet here was sun you know with in in san francisco doing precisely that the other project he was simultaneously pursuing was like you said bt live now this was an interesting app uh the idea at the outset was just to do something that was like a a streaming app you know and people were puzzled the product team was puzzled they were like well why would we do that there's facetime there's skype you can do all sorts of things there's zoom you know what's what's the market for this and then uh the order came down to centralize it and the the the engineers and everyone were like oh that's really interesting decentralizing this uh live streaming app okay well that would have been cool if we had that during the arab spring because syria for example turned off the the internet to try to shut down activists broadcasting massacres of protests you know by the regime there so um they actually got quite excited about this product but as they as they went on working on it it would you it would use uh the bitcoin protocol uh basically it would use all the users uh who have it to support the network that would do the streaming and they began to get concerned well like you know what if someone starts streaming themselves murdering someone what are we gonna do about that and an employee named richard hall this brash british expat who's a silicon va valley veteran went to india to research bigo live which is sort of like what sun wanted to mimic for bt live and they discovered that the people who were on the network streaming to get the audience going were enduring just torrents of lewd remarks from users and so he came back and broached this idea that they needed to moderate bt live there has to be some way that we can you know either prevent terrorist content you know from being live streamed we don't want isis in syria or iraq to you know live stream beheadings or something and you know we also want to protect the streamers and so they pushed sun really hard to try to moderate the platform and they had a tool set they said it would be cheap to hire an office full of moderators in india to take stuff down they had some automated tool sets that would automatically recognize things like you know a gun in a picture and take the stream down so there were ways to try to moderate this thing sun wasn't just uninterested in that he opposed moderation 100 and no one really knew where he was going with this uh why would he oppose moderation so strongly ferociously even and then one day he walked into a meeting and he sat down and you know he's listening to everyone and he says something in mandarin and most of the product team and you know all the designers and everyone in the san francisco office they just don't know what he said but then shortly after one of the main guys in the team this guy oscar coe just quits up and quits and people are puzzled one employee reached out hey oscar why'd you quit and he goes talk to me offline and they have this conversation turns out oscar knows mandarin and he kept it a secret and so he when justin came in and said this thing that no one understood what he was really saying was what his true vision for bt live was he essentially wanted to bring the dark web into the light he wanted all of the things that you can't access on the left on the web that are censored that are taken down that are extreme to be available to everyone not only that he wanted i mean bt live would easily because of the bittorrent protocol peer-to-peer sharing the way it was designed it would be able to in theory for sure subvert the great firewall in china and so as one source explained to me wow i mean these people will be able to talk about tiananmen square without being censored but also everything else all the worst of the internet the pandora's box as he described it would be open in china and everyone would use trx to buy in and use this product and so sun saw this as a way to get quite wealthy by bringing all the stuff that's been forbidden to a place where you can't access that and when the team found that out they pretty much went into full mutiny and sun wanted to transfer the whole project to beijing to china that he has there are a couple offices in china but he wanted to hand it off to uh the office that he saw as more pliant and more willing to fulfill uh his goals interesting yeah there's just so much in your article you also detail um all the shenanigans that went down behind the scenes around the warren buffett launch and you uh um yeah just also end with how a couple employees actually eventually sued justin's son um but you know we're running out of time so why don't you just maybe say you know from your investigation what your overall takeaway is about justin's son from what everyone told me this is a man who lacks fundamental empathy and that is one of the biggest weaknesses he has as a businessman and as a tech entrepreneur he's not able to see or he ignores the negative potential consequences of the technology he builds and while he is has he channels the entrepreneurial mindset of trying to be disruptive he doesn't think about what the human cost is of the stuff he wants to make into a reality all right well thank you so much for coming on unconfirmed thank you very much laura don't forget next up is the weekly news recap hi everyone thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap first headline square purchases 50 million dollars in bitcoin jack dorsey square has become the

crypto in a twitter thread mercedes suggests that while historically anonymous teams in crypto are viewed as a risk he says that now identity is an attack vector and that the future lies in embracing decentralization and pseudonymous on-chain reputation without relying on the legal system and social capital next headline 60 employees have taken coinbase's severance package so far in a blog post published thursday coinbase ceo brian armstrong revealed that five percent of coinbase's 1200 employees had so far accepted the severance package offered to those who disagreed with his recently updated mission statement that coinbase was an apolitical company although the deadline to take the severance was wednesday armstrong said the number would be higher after the company completes several other conversations he wrote quote it was reassuring to see that people from underrepresented groups of coinbase have not taken the exit passage in numbers disproportionate to the overall population an employee told coindesk that those choosing to leave are mainly engineers as opposed to customer support staff armstrong attempted to clarify that the company's new stance does not mean employees have to quote pretend politics doesn't exist still it remains unclear to many inside the company what counts as political versus apolitical armstrong admitted that what could be considered as politics is a blurry line jill carlson an investor at slow ventures wrote in a coindesk column that the real message armstrong is sending is quote if you want to push a progressive social agenda in the workplace this company is not for you next headline not ethereum 2.0 but ethereum 1.5 and a post on the fellowship of ethereum magicians forum ethereum creator vitalik buterin noted that ethereum may scale in an unexpected way according to the ethereum 2.0 roadmap scaling for applications is still years away however scaling is already in test net for a number of layer 2 scaling options such as rollups plasma and state channels making those a more viable near and mid-term solution this leads him to say that some popular apps whose data and applications live entirely on layer 1 such as the ethereum name system should be adapted to have their data such as accounts balances and assets move to layer 2. his conclusion is that if everyone moves to rollups then that makes phase two of the transition to ethereum 2.0 obsolete and so ethereum may instead be a quote single high single high security execution shard that everyone processes plus a scalable data availability layer he writes quote this implies a phase 1.5 and done approach to eth2 as quote by that point it will be easier to continue down that path than to try to bring everyone back to the base chain for no clear benefit and a 20 to 100x reduction in scalability whether or not ethereum goes down this path remains to be seen but one other interesting comment he made in his somewhat technical post is that focusing on rollups will leave more space for layer 2 protocols that can fund their own development with their own tokens next headline doj publishes cryptocurrency enforcement framework on thursday the department of justice published an 83-page cryptocurrency enforcement framework detailing how it looks at cryptocurrency crimes defy and its enforcement strategies it categorizes illicit uses of crypto three ways as one financial transactions that commission crimes two money laundering and shielding transactions from tax reporting and other label legal obligations and three hacks or theft of cryptocurrency particularly at exchanges the agency indicated it also has its eye on d5 saying quote the ico boom from a few years ago has given way to the exponential growth of decentralized finance markets in recent months months with all the associated complexities and difficulties for enforcers seeking to stay ahead of the curve and keep investors safe next headline what the future may hold for crypto market structure arjun biology of paradigm wrote an overview of the past and future of crypto market structure recounting the 1.0 phase from 2010 to 2017 in which peer-to-peer training emerged from bitcoin talk mount cox temporarily reigned and otc desks launched to serve some early institutional investors he then covers how phase 2.0 from 2018 to now has seen derivatives eclipse spot trading otc desks go electronic lending firms firms emerge to provide two billion dollars of bitcoin and stable coins on loan and stable coins function as reserve assets he then says that we're already in the early stages of moving to phase 3.0 which he believes will be more capital efficient bridging centralized markets with the ever-growing number of d5 markets he says that defy is disrupting centralized exchanges but that throughput and high gas fees remain barriers to full-blown defy adoption he believes that as layer 2 solutions come to fruition we can expect to see the convergence of decentralized and centralized finance this intersection of d5 and c5 will result in better d5 interfaces institutional support and an attempt by major centralized exchanges to capitalize on cd5 or centralized decentralized finance next headline the growth in d5 in charts the block research has compiled 37 different charts that analyze various metrics across d5 projects the total value locked in defy has now surpassed 11 billion dollars with the three largest protocols by value locked being in order uniswap maker dow and ave and on average around 4 000 new addresses
