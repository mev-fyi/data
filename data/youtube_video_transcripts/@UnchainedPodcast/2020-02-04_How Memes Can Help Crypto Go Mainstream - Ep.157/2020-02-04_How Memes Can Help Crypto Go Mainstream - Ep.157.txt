Intel leading exchanges virtual currency businesses banks and regulators themselves use cipher trace to comply with regulation and to monitor compliance crypto means an adoption might have seen the Doge meme on social media it's an image of adorable Shiba Inu dog with colorful comic sans font saying silly things like such Wow the photo of the Shiba Inu was initially posted in 2010 by its owner who was a Japanese kindergarten teacher the image later took on a life of its own as it was shared widely across social media gaining significant popularity in 2013 when the meme was spammed on a subreddit by 4chan users in 2013 even members of Congress used the meme on Twitter and a cryptocurrency named dogecoin featuring the Doge meme was launched dogecoin started off as a joke currency but managed to develop a strong online community and gain traction through people tipping each other online for providing good content in 2014 the dogecoin community raised $30,000 for the Jamaican bobsled team which had qualified for the Olympics but could not afford to attend even though the dogecoin cryptocurrency started off as a joke it currently has a 300 million dollar market cap and 100 million dollars of volume is traded daily the dogecoin meme represents how memes can shape reality memes are ideas that spread through communities and represent a shared subculture a perception of reality memes shape everything around us from politics to religion to the very concept of a nation-state if you out currencies are memes to a reality made even clearer through the merchants of cryptocurrencies while money isn't the only use case for crypto and the memes worth encrypt will have evolved over time crypto being used as money is the longest and arguably one of the strongest running memes around the 2008 Bitcoin white paper by Satoshi Nakamoto is titled Bitcoin a peer-to-peer electronic cash system and there is even a prominent group of people within the etherium community frequently promoting the meme eath is money memes are ultimately critical for crypto going mainstream whether that's as currencies stores a value or something else entirely however not every meme magically appeals to everyone now they're certain memes resonate with some cultures better if crypto is to truly go mainstream then the community needs to know how to make memes that will catch on and that means tailoring them to the many different groups of non crypto people who could benefit from this technology what are memes and their properties the term meme was coined by Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene Dawkins compares a meme to a gene in biology that is able to replicate itself using people as hosts both memes and genes ultimately affect how humans evolve you can also measure how prominent a meme is within society for example if the meme is a scientific idea and spreads among scientists you can measure its survival value by counting the number of times it's been referenced in scientific journals memes themselves undergo natural selection as some memes die off and others become more prominent there is natural competition among memes on which one survives people have limited attention capacity and time to store information so the strongest memes that can get passed on quickly in a society and through generations will dominate Dawkins summarize this concept nicely with the line we are built as gene machines and cultured as me machines the 1951 book the true believer by Eric Hoffer on the nature of mass movements discusses the idea of religion which is art of turning practical purposes into holy causes in the most successful mass movements people begin to remove their individual identities and view themselves as members of a specific group becoming part of something greater if people start viewing themselves members that support a specific meme whether it be religion governments or organizations then the attachment to that meme and it's cause become even stronger interestingly the discussion of certain topics within crypto communities such as the Bitcoin block size and Bitcoin versus theorem have already turned into an almost religious debate people label themselves as things like big blocker and Bitcoin er to demonstrate their beliefs the book get together on community building discusses the notion that people share identity through words and used Eminem's a word used to describe someone from a certain place Eminem's helped people to identify themselves so it's easier spot others in the community for example Beyonce fans are known as beehive and Green Bay Packers fans are known as cheese has this creates a stronger bond between members a 2011 presentation titled tutorial military memetics by dr. Robert Finkelstein discusses the military study of memes for national security purposes as the military acknowledge that memes can change people's values and behavior as well as enhance subcultures DARPA has supported research amines with the goals of being able to identify how to make sure an idea spreads and what the consequences would be this demonstrates how Bassem an influence memes have in our society and that the crypto community would benefit from making memes that will catch on memes have varying level of propagation and persistence for example a story could come across a few people for a few hours while the religion may spread among millions of people and persist for thousands of years studies show that smaller memes are more important because larger memes can be complex and difficult for people to remember Finkelstein discusses a memetics fitness factor to create a method to evaluate the quality of memes including attributes such as number people propagated to persistence and impacts of the meme a report by CNA a nonprofit research organization called exploring the utility of memes for US government influence campaigns states that memes with the most engagement our audience Pacific being more precise about which audience demographics you're targeting will get more people to consume and also believe in that meme the report discusses the importance of visual memes and how they're often able to transcend cultures and languages to read broader audiences various government campaigns have utilized visual memes due to effectiveness the report also states that it is helpful for memes to be in reinforced with in-person engagement there is a significant amount of research involved in how governments can use memes to influence individuals and groups we should use this type of research and do our own additional research to see how we can bring more awareness to crypto popular memes within the crypto community gold is one of the most successful memes in history gold is an element used in the production of electronics and jewelry but its use as a store value has given it an almost eight trillion dollar market cap investors now put their money into gold to create a more diversified portfolio and Country Store gold themselves or overseas so it is not surprising that the digital gold meme for Bitcoin has been successful with the investor crowd gold repatriation is the plan for governments to physically bring the gold they store overseas back home which can be a complex process for example during 2013 to 2017 Germany brought back fifty four thousand gold bars worth twenty seven billion dollars from New York and Paris they had initially been storing gold overseas due to cold war fears and wanted to bring it home the process becomes even more complicated as these countries have to get insurance on the gold should something happen to it in transit the digital gold meme is effective because transporting Bitcoin across borders is significantly easier and cheaper than transporting gold Bitcoin being referred to as digital gold might have sounded observed to some in the beginning we were now at the point where even US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell recognizes this pal stated almost no one uses Bitcoin for payments they use it more as an alternative to gold it's a speculative store value putting price volatility aside since we're still in the early days of Bitcoin theoretically it is a better store value than gold itself because there's a known limited supply of 21 million Bitcoin that will ever be created and it is far more portable than gold talking about digital gold to some institutional investors has helped them understand that concept better since many of them have gold or could easily understand someone holding gold in their portfolio while the digital gold meme works very well for some audiences it does not resonate with everyone we need to have grassroots in local communities screams that will engage people of all different kinds of backgrounds for example when crypto people talk about how Bitcoin is censorship resistant many people in the u.s. can't understand why this is important some associate the need for censorship resistance for doing illegal activity which in their minds is only a bad thing while others have no idea what censorship resistance means residents of one country who believe its laws are just and reasonable may not immediately consider that illegal transactions by residents in an oppressive country could be completely appropriate if not good for that country's residents another popular meme among crypto people is Hottel which is used to positively reinforce the idea of holding cryptocurrency rather than selling it during volatile periods halal originated from users misspelling of the word hold in a 2013 Bitcoin talk forum post memes like Hottel make the crypto community stronger since they stick together during hard times while having more of these kind of memes is difficult it doesn't necessarily bring more people into understanding or using crypto since non-encrypted people have no idea what the meme means we need to be working on memes so I'll bring people from outside of crypto into the community to get a better understanding of how memes and crypto very globally I wrote a post on Twitter asking for crypto people who live outside of the US to reach out to me then I asked them when you talk to people in your country about crypto what aspects have you found resonate the most with them and what heavy found doesn't resonate well I quickly received over 100 responses across 50 countries which shows just how global crypto is note that these replies are individual opinions and by no means represent an entire country still I found their perspective helpful and understanding which narratives work well and surprisingly many people do not find the digital gold narrative appealing people also have different views depending on demographics for example it seems that the younger generation who grew up with the Internet are more interested in and open to cryptocurrencies will the world follow France and advocate banning privacy coins will government-backed stable coins become the new Fiat are distributed and peer to peer exchanges just a flash in the pan the answer is maybe virtual currencies can flourish and create a new private and more versatile economy but that grand vision can't happen without keeping crypto clean and that requires support of governments and accountability

event on February 12 2020 sign up on the crypto comm exchange now popular crypto means outside of the crypto community a common theme among people was that crypto has a negative connotation that can put off newcomers Bitcoin still has a stigma due to transactions for illicit purposes such as drug purchases despite a study from elliptic finding that they account for less than 1% of Bitcoin transactions two exchanges some memes really stick and for Bitcoin its uses drug money on dark net markets it's a persistent one that means it needs to be replaced with an even stronger meme in order to remove this mental hurdle however many early technologies such as the internet and video streaming have gone through this transition from being associated with illicit activity to ultimately become a staple for society the way that these technologies were able to overcome the initial association was having the emergence of prominent legal mainstream use cases will hopefully go through the same transition with crypto another common thing was that crypto is an investment opportunity well this doesn't sound ideal since we want people to understand the technology first I believe this meme actually isn't so bad the opportunity to earn money helps pull people in and spreads the meme as some people are investing your crypto they start to learn more about how it works teach others about it and possibly stick around out of interest some of the smartest people I know in crypto who have stayed to build amazing things initially got in because they first heard about crypto from their friends the media following a huge run-up in price I don't expect everyone to stay because they care about the technology but I believe there is nothing wrong with this as a meme itself it's not much different than people investing in stocks gold or real estate on the flip side there are people who are taking advantage of this mindset and prey on the get-rich-quick mentality by creating Ponzi schemes guaranteeing returns or other scams so it's important to call it this type of behavior and set reasonable expectations through people outside of crypto another consistent theme was that a lot of people who are unfamiliar with their world of investing don't really know what digital gold means this was one of the least effective ways to get them excited about a technology imagine someone who has never invested in gold or cared about gold being encouraged to learn about something that is it's digital equivalent why should we expect them to be excited by this many sophisticated investors who consider gold to be a good store value are also skeptical with deeming bitcoin is a show of gold right now given the price volatility I've heard that some investors often prefer to look at crypto is just an alternative asset class many felt the word crypto has a negative connotation but the word blockchain has a more positive sentiment as it is often cited as a promising innovation for governments and companies for example in China President Xi Jinping praised the benefits of blockchain many crypto people have stayed away from using the term blockchain is has been frequently used by banks and enterprises as a buzz word to describe permission databases that lack the openness of public blockchains block she not Bitcoin is a meme that developed among traditional financial institutions and enterprises to demonstrate that they thought clock sharing technology was interesting but that Bitcoin was irrelevant given these connotations it could be worth adjusting terminology used depending on who you speak with so they're open to learning more for example the terms blockchain digital currency and digital assets could be more appealing to certain crowds that are skeptical whenever they hear the word crypto one response I found interesting was that as young people were perfectly comfortable with crypto being labeled as magic Internet money which is light-hearted meme that was initially created as an advertisement for joining the subreddit our Bitcoin it contains an image of a message on wizard in what appears to be Microsoft Paint along with the text match Internet money this caught people excited about learning about the technology and and I previously dismiss using this mean because it sounds like a silly fun thing for tech enthusiasts but if you're trying to get that crowd interested in crypto then that phrasing can actually be helpful I've also heard many people use the mean that crypto is the Internet of money which seems to have also retinue with a tech-savvy crowd in the end even if you have strong pre-existing opinions about a meme it's always important to think about the audience and what would appeal most to them different country perspectives there were interesting country specific highlights from people I spoke with that I felt were worth summarizing this does not include our responses I received and the goal is to show how responses vary by country again please note that these were individual opinions from people interesting crypto so it is not a representative sample the censorship resistant aspect of cryptocurrencies resonates more with people who have had experience of high inflation capital controls or distrusts of governments or institutions I received by far the most responses from Argentinians ajan tina seems to have a perfect use case for crypto with the environment of high inflation restrictions and accessing dollar and limits on sending money abroad censorship resistance resonates with some people because residents generally don't trust banks to keep their money safe I learned many people in Argentina are economically savvy since they have to be able to manage their savings so it does not get eaten away by inflation Argentinians care most about having easy access something that is not the peso and this usually means the US dollar since there is such a heavy focus on the dollar I believe the best name in Argentina could potentially be access to a stable digital currency stable coins could be presented as another option for Argentinians to escape the peso long with the dollar I highly recommend Mario and Conte's inspiring presentation at DEFCON 5 on getting paid in the sabre coin die and how that has helped him survive Argentina's inflation people living in countries were sending and receiving money across borders is difficult and expensive seem to connect with the idea that cryptocurrencies are borderless and cheap descent multiple people in Nigerian Wanda shared that use of crypto for remittances resonates well since it is currently inefficient to move funds across borders among tech professionals in India there are a lot of IT service providers where foreign clients that often have to pay a high transaction fees or her that crypto has also made sense that crowd the digital gold narrative might be better suited for countries that have a strong existing gold culture such as in India where people buy gold jewelry and pass it down in the family however it would take time for crypto to catch on there because it is currently heavily associated with speculation and scams and politicians in the media are further driving negative sentiment people living in countries where there's artists on banking system resonate more with crypto bring about financial innovation and creating a new asset class the perspective from several Canadians was that people in their country do not relate to censorship persistence since it's not necessarily accepted as a good thing it consistently heard that Canadians have a high level of trust in banks so decentralization does not appeal to them what seems to have drawn in some people is that crypto is an evolution of money and not necessarily trying to replace the entire financial system similarly in Switzerland investors seem to understand crypto of being an alternative asset class that adds diversification and leads to innovation and finance such as the tokenization of assets people who live in countries where residents care about privacy might find the privacy benefits of cryptocurrency appealing Germans are very conscious about privacy which I learned is partly why they are such a cache heavy country particularly in Berlin there's also a strong tech scene which when combined with the high value on privacy could attract people to cryptocurrencies my suggestions to the crypto community my goal is not to pinpoint exactly how a country's residents are thinking about crypto or be comprehensive across all cultures but rather to demonstrate the memes are extremely important to the success of cryptocurrencies and we need to be creating new ones that stick there have been many attempts to push the digital gold mean but it does not appear to resonate with a lot of people globally it's important for people from diverse communities to help identify and share memes since they would be best to understand what would be most effective it is not in our best interest to have a small group of prominent crypto individuals who are typically tech savvy to generate the memes that would resonate with people around the world there's also worth experimenting with new narratives and formats forming propagation that said I can try to offer a few suggestions that hopefully helpful to the crypto community in reaching a mainstream audience number one make your meme short and simple it's important to make it as easy as possible for someone to inherently want to share it with others which creates the strongest chance of virality we can determine its probability excess by testing this mean with people and seeing if they remember it afterwards ideally memes should be no longer than a few words and should be easily translatable into different languages number to tailor your meme to your audience there shouldn't be anything wrong with using the terms blockchain or digital currency if it helps make someone more open to learning about the technology then as the person ends up getting more involved in crypto we should educate on popular memes within the crypto community like hotle to strengthen their bond give a name to that group like Bitcoin er also helps strengthen that identity number three use a visual meme or possible visual memes can often transcend different cultures and languages and spread quickly a joke currency like dogecoin with adorable Shiba Inu dog was able to have a 300 million dollar market cap bunny memes like these can be equally effective and we shouldn't shy away from using silly memes like the magic internet money wizard to tech-savvy crowds that might be attracted to it we can measure a visual meme success by counting the number of times it appears in Google search or social media number for track which memes work well the crypto communities should openly collaborate on which means the methods are effective and continue iterating from there we should be tracking factors like the number of people the meme was shared with how long it lasted and its impact I'm optimistic that with this technology community and the right memes we can get crypto to become mainstream thank you to Laura Shen well Warren and Jordan Clifford for reviewing my post and to the many people from around the world who reached out to me
