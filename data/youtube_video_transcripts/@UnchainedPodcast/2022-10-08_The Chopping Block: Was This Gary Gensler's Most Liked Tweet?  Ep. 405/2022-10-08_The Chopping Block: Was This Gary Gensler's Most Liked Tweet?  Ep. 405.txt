not a dividend It's A Tale of Two fun now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet generally speaking airdrops are kind of pointless anyways um my name's trading firms who are very involved I like to eat the ultimate D5 Protocols are the antidote to this problem excellent all right hello everybody Welcome to the traveling block every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry Insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day so uh quick intros first up we got Tom the defy Maven and master of memes next up we have tarun the Giga brain and Grand Puba at Gauntlet uh today uh unfortunately Robert couldn't join us so Laura is filling in Laura CEO of the show thanks for being with us Laura and then you got myself a massive the head height man a dragonfly so the uh the three of us excluding Laura were early stage investors in crypto but I went to caveat nothing we say here is investment advice legal advice or even life advice so I just got back from token 2049 which is the big Marquee event in Asia in Singapore I am extremely jet lagged but it was it was a really fantastic event I had an amazing time I I felt I tweeted about this a little bit earlier but I feel like um the energy in Asia feels really different than the energy in the US right now uh Laura I was listening to the last few shows you've been running and it's kind of all very doom and gloomy a lot of people kind of feeling Sullen about regulation and about you know the SEC and you know we're gonna talk about some of that stuff with with all the stuff going on in the US macro feels terrible everyone's kind of sad in Asia people feel great did you miss the episode that came out yesterday with SPF because he actually was seen he's felt optimistic about what was going to happen with regulation in the US and I was like what so I I have a cute up I have a cute up I want to listen to it uh I I've heard that I've heard that SPF has been doing lots and lots of behind the scenes action with respect to Regulators in the U.S so it's basically him and Katie Hahn kind of have the whole us industry on their back is what I hear I don't know how true that is pretty much that makes sense I don't know what's telling me say I'm spending like half his time in DC these days which is I guess a testament to that yeah yeah I wouldn't be surprised yeah you should listen um but I you know one thing that I was curious about was like what is he talking to them about and um I think there are certain things that like the crypto Community is super super kind of um uh just really into or like think he meant a lot and I think like his priorities are slightly different um not you know 100 but you know I think like everybody has been talking about like the tornado cash sanctions and privacy and stuff like that and like I don't think that's top of his list you know so um even though he's spending a lot of time there I think like there are certain things where you know that's really what his priority is is like you know having FTX infrastructure being used to clear derivatives you know I'm sure that's probably actually number one um because you talked about like exchange kind of stuff was one of his priorities but I feel like some of the more hot button Topics in terms of Regulation um or maybe not his priority I mean that makes sense right you can't I I don't think one should expect for Sam necessarily to carry every pet issue of the crypto native community on their back um I I think I I have a lot I have a ton of respect for Sam and for anybody who's kind of in their day in day out especially at a time like this when there's so much there's so many headwinds for crypto especially in the US where people have been by and large um they're they're more negative news stories and positive news stories over the last six months and this week this week was no exception to that so maybe we should just jump straight into it one of the big news this week so historically um the crypto the crypto industry has been really pushing for the cftc try to become the dominant regulator of cryptocurrencies and the the party line within crypto has been cftc way nicer to us than the SEC way more reasonable we really want them as a regulator of choice and there was something that dropped a lawsuit that dropped uh within the last couple weeks that I think caused a lot of people to change their tune uh and this was the cftc lawsuit against ukidao so quick backdrop on you know what the hell is ukidao so ukidao you may remember in its previous form which was bzx bzx was an early D5 lending protocol um back in the very early days of defy that got hacked repeatedly they were they were it was kind of a mess in the very early days they were one of the first ones definitely a mess definitely a mess definitely a mess um so they re-ran it to ukidao and whatever they continued doing stuff uh it's iterating on product they obviously didn't have a ton of success but um the cftc filed the lawsuit against them and the the lawsuit so you might uh be you know unsurprised that the lawsuit is like you know doing kind of derivativesy things as uh you know offering these things to us customers which is legal they have they're supposed to register with the with the cftc which they did not do but the other part of the lawsuit which is what freaked out a bunch of people is that the lawsuit basically declared that ukidao which was the DOW that was voting on chain to do certain things or whatever that this was an unincorporated partnership and as an unincorporated partnership that meant that every person who had ever participated in ukidao governments in governance was jointly and severally liable for the violations that that uh bzx Uki committed meaning that running an unregistered uh I can't remember what the actual was it a commodity pool operator commodity pool operator that sounds right yeah so you're not supposed to do that without registering with the cftc obviously ukidao on the whole did not do this and therefore every individual member of ukidao is liable and this is maybe unsurprising but it's unprecedented now ukidao unlike a lot of other daos is not Incorporated so a lot of downs what they do these days is they actually have some kind of corporate entity somewhere some kind of LLC that limits the liability for the individual members of the Dao uh ukida did not have any such thing so it's known as an unwrapped Dao there's no corporate shell or anything that would prevent people individually from the Dow from all all being liable for anything the Dow does that's illegal so nowadays most Dows are not like this but ukidao being a relatively early dialed bzx being a relatively early protocol they had a totally kind of naked Dao and as a result basically this is kind of what people were afraid of and exactly the worst that's come to light which is this idea that anybody who participate in governance is therefore also liable for anything that ukidao did wrong this caused a lot of people in crypto to get very upset and say oh my God cfdc help me do this to us I thought you're a friend you know the top 10 anime betrayal type energy so what are your guys thoughts on this whole ukidao drama one thing was like Gabe Shapiro came on my premium offering and I was really shocked when he said that so you know he's he's a lawyer a crypto lawyer for Delphi labs and um so I'm sure like his understanding of this is just well beyond even mine but like I was super shocked when he was like oh this means all of defy could be illegal and I was like what is so there's two things right there's like what they were doing was illegal I think like nobody um will question that right but then like he was kind of saying that any sort of thing where you're like trying to have decentralized governance that uh could be illegal um but the other thing I wanted to say was like that commissioner who um dissented I read her descent I thought it was actually really um interesting you know I this is not an area I'm super familiar with but her main thing was she was like first of all look um this now creates this like weird separation in terms of the class of individuals right there's like the token holders that participated in governance and then the token holders that didn't and um she was like look the chtc is sort of setting this precedent in this enforcement action without having gone through like a normal process of you know putting forward a proposal and then listing comments and then you know kind of like coming up with whatever the best solution is to um deal with these kinds of situations where Dows are engaging in some kind of activity that is against some sort of law so um you know obviously that she just was like look this is sort of um just creating this thing off the fly without like really thinking about it and then second she was like you know the the side effect of this is that a lot of these down elves well there are token holders will feel less inclined to participate in governance which she you know was pointing out was like seemingly a bad effect which I would agree with so um yeah I think there were just a number of things where um you know it either wasn't clearly thought through or um you know the effect that they wanted was to sort of like chill Dao activity so you know I I don't know by the way I looked it up and fcm is Futures commercial commission Merchant so um that was yeah but anyway yeah it definitely is going to cause a huge showing effect on people participating in Dallas right the idea that you are liable for what the Dow does like anything the Dow does if you ever participate in governance once or is you participating once in governance like three years ago then you kind of forget about the tokens you still hold them and then three years later the Dow votes to like you know go rob a bank or whatever okay well now you're liable for robbing a bank that seems like a pretty crazy legal theory about liability right like normally that's not how anything we think of works like if you're not actually if you have no men's Raya meaning you have no actual intention to commit anything illegal then the idea that someday the Dow does something illegal you are now liable for it seems um pretty ridiculous so you know the the the the dissent from the one commissioner uh was was notable because I think it pointed out a lot of the weaknesses of this of this legal Theory um but of course like you know again filing a lawsuit is not law so there's a very good chance that this thing is going to get challenged I think the legal theory behind the challenge seems pretty plausible but like everything with basically the government slash Regulators going after something it's very it's much easier for them to start a process than for it to get stopped by Civil Society or by you know a particular set of defendants right so it's going to take years in this case for there to be anything that is like set of law on the question of how does the Dow liability work um but this Theory by the cftc is is going to scare the out of people because it's like okay well if it maybe works like this and that's terrifying and it's going to be a huge disincentive for any institutions or any large corporations or even even you know people who who are wealthy enough to consider themselves targets with the cftc um to ever participate in down governance yeah I think uh the specifics of the of the lawsuit are particularly interesting like I mean I think on the one hand I agree like a dow does not have limited liability the same way like a corporation does and so yeah it's I don't think anyone who's operating or something not was operating an assumption that like you know if you're part of a Dao and then the Dow commits fraud like it's all cool because it's a Dao and so it's like you know it's fine but I think the thinking was more well like the Dow is Unstoppable like if you like how would you go about stopping the Dow from doing something like that like you know maker right like makers have an entity per se that is operating maker but like you know it's like how would you even go about stopping maker which and so I feel like those are kind of two different it's a distinction that I think maybe people didn't really appreciate and I also agree with with Laura like the uh setting the bar as voted or participating in governance is is pretty bizarre to me as well um I people would be curious to see how that holds up in court but my favorite bit from this was actually how they were served basically they uh hosted the notice in both the Forum as well as the like intercom chat bot on the ukidao website um because I mean they said there was no email address and there's no mailing address so they're like this is how we're gonna do it and apparently this was upheld by a judge recently so now you can get served uh on your Forum or um through your intercom chatbot so you got to watch out for that yeah so I actually have like the like yeah my reaction to This was um like so I just think about how like for me as a journalist you know like when um I was reading my book and there were people that definitely you know you could definitely say their portrayal in the book wasn't like positive and they hadn't spoken to me like I went through so many Hoops to try to make sure that they knew what was going to be said about them in the book and to give them a chance to respond and there were certain people where I just did not have their contact information so I literally like sought out all these different random contacts of theirs and was like can you please pass this on to them you know and like even if they said oh they don't want to talk to you whatever I would say look just please send this document you know with these statements and like just make sure that they have a chance to read this and then they can decide if they want to respond to me and I would just I like I wouldn't do it just with one person I would do it like with multiple people to make sure I just had tried everything to make sure that they could have a chance to respond right and so like when I think about kind of that standard and it's just for a book it's not even for like a legal thing which is you know that has like real consequences I I just I'm surprised that the judge said like that was a sufficient way to serve people about something so important uh to me it's like whoa like what am I doing like jumping through all these hoops for what I'm doing if the government could just you know so I knew that was my reaction yeah it's like how do you verify receipt right or um someone got served via an nft last year as well and it was again the nft had like a link to the actual documents in it but it's also like you know how is that legit right like like how do you know that someone actually viewed it and uh received it I guess so yeah I thought the theory was that like is checking the server log to see that somebody actually visited the link was supposed to be the proof that the serving happened which obviously doesn't work with nft because anybody could look at the nft it doesn't have to be the person who actually owns it especially after it made news and then there's thousands and thousands of people looking at the nft it's like okay well maybe the real person is somewhere in there um so yeah the the the whole concept is a little absurd I mean to be clear if you are a member of ukidao probably you saw this when it got posted on the Forum because I'm sure everyone in ukidao was like guys did you see this we just got served so it I'm sure it worked right that actually seems like a great way to get it done um but uh you know it also does seem like maybe uh an excellent way to defraud another or like to scare another Dao is to you know serve them through their chatbot and to see if you can scare them without it being real there is this other question too of like how do you actually identify the Dow members right like even if you've voted on chain you don't necessarily have you know identifying you know characteristics of the address I mean I've interacted with a you know uh kyc you know uh exchange account or something like that so it's like who's going to step up and you know raise their hand and say yes I uh you know uh was part of ukidao and I want to be you know sued by the cftc so it's a bit tornado like in that way where it's like you know who's going to be the defendant here really or yeah how are they going to find these people yeah let me dox my wallets yeah I I think again this is a large part of the the kind of game theory behind Dallas in the first place right it was not that Dows are impossible to identify but that the connection between the person and the Dao and the real person is difficult to identify so in in some way like the real measure of this ukidao lawsuit is okay let's say that nobody raises their hand and says you know hey I'm part of ukidao I'm ready to get sued um what are they gonna do are they going to try to like chain analysis people and you know cross-reference with coin coinbase and try to figure out who these people really are um how how aggressively is cftc going to go after the people in the Dao um and of course a lot of people in the Dow are probably not Americans anyway it it does feel like part of the test part of why this is such an interesting test case is not just okay the legal theory behind going after Dallas but also what happens what are the defendants gonna do if the answer is that like no defendant shows up and basically there's just like an empty seat when there's like great here's the here's the case against Suki Dao and nobody shows up that might be in some way like the strongest defensive Taos is that you try to sue it down and nothing happens and then you just you know you you kind of just have to go wasting a bunch of Cycles trying to figure out who's in the Dow it becomes you know in many ways like the whole theory of why Dows are supposed to be legally robust or not legally robust but legally difficult to attack is because it's kind of like the early P2P platforms right like BitTorrent uh you know when when in the early days when the you know the music the music labels we're going after users of Napster right and other peer-to-peer Services the idea is that look you can only kind of go after like one person at a time at great effort to yourself to try to nail them with something but the the like if you actually want to stop this thing on mass it's just not realistic right the only way ultimately that the the record labels we're able to get people to stop doing peer-to-peer file sharing was to basically inculcate people into things like iTunes and Spotify such that they didn't want to do that anymore and you know the belief is that that's what Dallas are about it's about lowering the barriers to coordination among people who want to coordinate and if you don't let them do it they'll find other ways to do it we'll see whether that works in practice Yeah if I don't know if you're a call I forget the name of it the recording Association of America or whatever they did Kill after individuals and it did they did have a chilling effect so um you know maybe that would be the same Theory with ukidao it's like okay so no one shows up so then the cftc will try to match identities with the token holders and then go after certain people to make an example of them I don't know to be clear I don't think the lawsuits were that much of a chilling effect right the main chilling effect was shutting down Napster that was the big chilling effect but the the lawsuits against individuals like I mean peer-to-peer flowers training was so huge even while all this stuff was going on it was still growing and it also had you know massive backlash for the riaa right like that basically totally killed their reputation that's pretty much everyone all anything associated with them now is just like yeah they went after a bunch of you know random people who downloaded a song and you know tried to ruin their own teenagers yeah there's yeah there's a lot of the backlash to it too yeah but I don't know if the cftc is like trying to get on people's Goods so I mean they were like it's like different from a record I don't know it but I mean I I think to to some of our previous conversations I think they look the cftc doesn't want to be a villain you know they they do want to be liked because these are people too and they have reputations outside of you know the the period of time that they're actually serving for the cftc I think people want to be perceived as being reasonable and coming up with good laws and protecting consumers where they can yeah actually I think one thing that interests me is like I sort of feel like in a way this enforcement action almost came out of this turf war between the cftc and the SEC where it's sort of like oh oh see you're you're tough with the enforced connections okay we'll we'll you know like match you on that regard like I don't know it may be it's just speculation but um it is out of character for the cftc or maybe it's not maybe this is just what the cftc is going to be like once they're the cop on the beat is that they're like look somebody's got to crack down to this downtown sense and I guess it's us now so we're gonna do we're just gonna go do it anyway we'll see we'll see well speaking of this speaking of the SEC the SEC was also in the news uh in the last couple weeks because of a large uh settlement that they reached with Kim Kardashian so uh we might remember Kim Kardashian uh very famously and prominently Shield this project called ethereum Max which was what is the theory Max is just like an ethereum Fork kind of coin let's just say it's not associated with ethereum I don't know what it is but it's not you know let's just make sure make that part clear okay vitalik was not involved Max this is uh outside outside parties that were innovating on ethereum to make it more max um anyway so she was charged 100 1.25 million for her promotion of ethereum Max and uh pretty much immediately after this so ethereum max is just like dead as a doornail pretty much since you know they originally showed it uh but after the announcement of the Kim Kardashian settlement uh ethereum Max pumped like 130 which is awesome because that that's just how crypto works I don't know that there's much to talk about here other than like look if you are a celebrity that is you know not disclosing your conflicts of interest the SEC will eventually get you a year and a half later well did you guys did you guys watch the sec's video that they released with this can you give us the exposition like give us a play-by-play of the video yeah it was just like warning people basically that you know if a celebrity is promoting something that doesn't necessarily mean that it's a good investment for you because they're getting paid for this and they're going to make money either way and you know your financial priorities might be something different but yeah like so okay so just keep watching because I was watching this and I was a little bit like wait because there's something about the style of it where office hours with Gary Gensler yeah like you could imagine that they would make it in a way where um you know you like you as the viewer would really take away the lesson that like you need to be careful of of these people yeah there's something like so parody like about it where it's almost like they're making fun of themselves rather than like making the Bad actors seem like Bad actors you know what I'm getting at so I was watching this I was like wait if the intended effect is to educate people around you know not um like like they're you know these are such caricatures it just sort of it's not yeah more ridiculous rather than like you know giving people the message like don't trust these people I don't know that was my take it was like super I don't know there was just something that I was like I was like I wouldn't I wouldn't um you know feel I I don't feel like the style of this video kind of fit with the message I guess we can put it that way yeah there's trying to be more relatable you know trying to get those Zoomers excited about you know disclosures and whatnot no it's fine because they know that this is the one thing that everybody's gonna pay attention to because you announced Kim Kardashian and so you pay some you know some like very low quality video company I think we should maybe also point out that the SEC and cftc seem to be going for very different um types of people to go after the SEC seems to go for the high value shock therapy they're like a reality TV show like they're just going for like the clicks and the likes and the CFT scene just goes for the easiest one because bzx was always sort of like Dead on Arrival in many ways in terms of like a bunch of things that have happened in that ecosystem so the the difference in tactics the question is which one will sway Joe Congressman or Sally congresswoman to like vote on the thing that chooses the dividing line in funding and I don't know I don't know anything about politics but I'm assuming that crypto people would prefer the cftc based on that well in many ways like actually the SEC going after headlines is kind of easier to manage because it's like okay you know like they're they're gonna go after the frauds they're gonna go after the celebrities that are getting into the space and the Really complex stuff they're just gonna kind of leave alone you know Gensler might make a lot of noise and a lot of Sound and Fury about how oh everything in D5 is bad but actually going after a uniswap is just like kind of too hard or complex or it's a clear cut enough case so he's going to Veer away from it whereas the cftc like they might be like oh no that that sounds like a interesting legal theory for us to try to challenge uniswob let's let's go for it if anything it seems like cftc actually is scarier if that's the way they're operating it is um we were talking about this yesterday that there's this uh outstanding case was it rensley versus uniswap um where this unit swap user is suing unit swap for allowing like shift coins to be traded on unit swap also its largest investors yes yes that's right um but uh one of the tokens currently traded was ethereum Max so I'm sure she feels you know very righted now that uh Kim Kardashian had to pay a million dollars in fines that's uh yeah feeling very protected there you know I had one sort of semi-saucy take on this Kim Kardashian thing uh which is you know you you know how she just started this private Equity Fund like a month ago yeah that's right usually when you get these SEC citations and you admit wrongdoing you're like banned from Trading or purchasing Securities or being a registered Securities broker of any form for like a year or whatever I'm curious how that how the two things coincide there's like something like pumping something without disclosing your investment is very very different from like Securities fraud yeah yeah but she's she's an investment advisor technically sure sure but like you're usually usually investment advisors have some type of slap on even if it's like a two-month suspension like there's usually some it's interesting to see that this got negotiated out well she is banned she is prohibited from promoting or or I forget what the what the activity is but there's some prohibition on her activities with crypto um crypto asset Securities so it's like limited to just any crypto Securities but not like Securities broadly I do think that's like a kind of funny thing from the private Equity side that you know like I think that's very reasonable I I don't know I think I think you're looking for a bone to pick I think that's very good I'm not looking for a bone to pick you know when I when I fights it's with people who who  up for a reason like like sure well I thought you were going for more conspiracy theory no no no it wasn't really conspiracy theory as much as like I bet you part of the negotiation of her settlement of involved this like hey like like exclude like you can make the fine fire but exclude that certain yeah yeah I mean but also look like it was discouragement of profits right it's not like Hey we're gonna hit you with 1.25 because it's a nice round number it was okay we're gonna take your profits from you Shilling ethereum Max and don't do it again yeah no but one million dollars so that was a fine 250 000 was discouragement the rest was like interest or something but yeah it like this this is not an egregious for somebody of Kim Kardashian's you know stature and how much money she makes just like you know tweeting stuff there's a very good chance that Kim Kardashian never even heard of ethereum X right like they're she just has like a team that manages their social media and they're just like taking orders and somebody filled it with this thing um I I would personally be surprised if Kim Kardashian has any idea what ethereum x is I I I guess I'm just pointing out that like the negotiations for these things are quite interesting and you can kind of see the side effects of them in these observations I'm just trying to that's all I'm saying no that's fair that's right it's definitely uh there was definitely some finessing in the the shape of the settlement uh in order to get everybody what they wanted you know so see SEC comes out with like you know a nice scalp that they can show off on social media and then Kim K gets to keep running her uh her uh private Equity Empire so yeah no definitely it was a great PR move for for the SEC no question they they got so many headlines Gary Gensler have like I feel like that must be his most liked post I I'm sure Gary he was probably every night going to sleep so excited of how Twitter was going to embrace him with open arms after he brought this uh brought the settlement to them there was actually a uh dissenting op-ed in like Forbes I think basically actually saying No this was just like a total you know publicity stunt I'm happy that's you like Fortune rather um it's like who who's actually being protected here you know it's as if like someone was you know planning a nice Diversified portfolio and was misled by Kim Kardashian into thinking that ethereum Max was you know a nice safe investment it's like it's it's just kind of absurd um so I don't know I just like what they're really obvious rules around this right like for anything like even for yeah think about this way in terms of actual dollars of harm cause there's like the bit boys of the world who are like the immediate like U.S citizens to go I I'm not sure but if he was like those people who are promoting on YouTube who are like much more involved in like the constant creation they probably promoted much more in dollars of harm cause for sure Kim Kardashian right but it's clear that the SEC does not give a about dollars of harm cause because Gary Gensler is like looking for this PR win yeah and actually what so Jeff Roberts was the writer of the fortune column and he pointed out that the SEC completely missed Celsius and Voyager and things like that which you know that caused like real pain for everyday investors and you know it was instead kind of going after this big win uh with like the or sorry big PR win um and then on top of that like won't approve a Bitcoin ETF which arguably is also hurtful to Everyday investors uh at least in the US so yeah we should link to that uh in the show notes because I thought it was a really well argued piece yeah in terms of like actual damage like it would have been better if the SEC had gotten after Celsius as opposed to Kim Kardashian yeah and there already are rules around you know disclosure right that's like an issue with the FCC that's like a sec issue um so I don't know it does feel a bit silly I like kind of subscribe to the the Matt Levine Theory which is like you know you should be able to it's it's generally for his murderer credit investors but it's like you should be able to buy anything you want um as long as you you know sign a document that says I'm an idiot and then someone slaps you and then you know you're good to go and um I I Johnny kind of subscribe to that you know theory of markets as opposed to uh uh kind of what we have right now in this model the uh the uh the influencers the person so there's a very funny meme a couple weeks ago of this Japanese like fighter of some form who who passed away and like a few months before he passed away he was at a stadium and people lined up to get slapped by him and I just think of the the Kim Kardashian as the is the guy who's like I see well look it's it's kind of always true of regulators that Regulators are like the drunk looking under the street light like they're gonna find the thing that's easy to find rather than you know it's like it's hard to find Celsius because nobody really knew how bad things were at Celsius until it was out there and so you could say look well you didn't find the most terrible thing wait a minute what are you talking about everyone first of all Xerox B1 being the Celsius funds was like one of the most obvious things that you could see on chain and track the losses of yes I understand if you if you're if you're following crypto drama yes it's very easy to to know that something was not the job of the regulator isn't it isn't that their job if they're going to be prosecuting these things I mean hold on let me okay let me finish my statement right when I say it's easier to look under the street light like you see Kim Kardashian posting you guys should buy ethereum Max it's like okay well clearly this is legal right like everybody is pinging you all of a sudden saying that Kim Kardashian is posting stuff about some random coin and she didn't disclose anything you already know what's up right same thing with like a lot of these influencers in the in the 2021 cycle these they're really easy obvious cases to prosecute that are right in front of you and that you know are going to make headlines and you're never going to look like you're doing your job to retail okay doing a Celsius is hard it requires like basically investigation and insight and hard thinking and like kind of prying facts where they're they're not staring you in the face now you know to ruin your point about like okay bit Boy versus Kim Kardashian I think is a great point that there there's probably much more harm done by a bit boy than by Kim Kardashian just by sheer volume of dollars moved but look I I don't expect the SEC to do like brilliant investigative journalism about we're not investing just investigations about figuring out you know which platform especially non-us platforms are engaged in malfeasance and which ones aren't like that that's hard and the SEC like doesn't have that much sophistication about crypto as we've seen many many times yeah no I agree with you about just the time that investigations take because like oftentimes people send me these messages like you need to look in it blah blah blah and I'm like okay yeah that would take me a really really long time and meanwhile I have like a new book deal and I have like this other narrative podcast I'm working on and I do two shows a week and blah blah blah and but still it does feel a little crazy that that was kind of their big enforcement like I saw that nanson in turn tweeted something like oh what a bummer because you know I was really using Kim Kardashian for my financial advice yeah I mean it it is ridiculous I mean there is also this thing that Regulators in the U.S because they are unable to invest in ever building out technology themselves due to it being much more profitable to spend money on PR videos than uh you know analyzing the on-chain data yourself uh rely on the vendors that they get and it's whatever vendor they're buying their like on-chain analytics from dictates what they see so like if it's an older vendor who doesn't like understand the how D5 contracts work or like doesn't track a lot of like on-chain activity for certain people of like a certain form so they're not going to see that and the only thing they're going to see is like Kim kardashian.eath Got 5 million eighth in it the other thing too yeah like Dolores Point like it takes work you know Kim Kardashian I mean it takes work but like so did that PR video I don't know that that took any work actually I I watched it it seemed pretty low effort you know that's not outsourced I'm just like bad I I don't know how to make content so to me anyone who makes videos already is like you're just very impressed by stock footage I feel like we gotta we gotta Tom can we get some more stock footage in this like just little Clips yeah yeah just like when we talk about the SEC you just get like people like working on you know just filling out clipboards okay okay actually let's let's maybe take a hypothetical question let's suppose you were a dictator for for one week and you're you were tasked how well your dictatorship would be viewed after a week was how well you reformed the SEC or cftc what would you do with your one week of dictatorial powers all right you have to go first you pose the question yeah I mean I think the main thing I would do is like basically fire everyone who's not Technical and like hire a technical staff for them uh okay so you in your two weeks basically you would kill you you'd fire everybody so there's no one left working no no not everyone and then you would like start doing Tech interviews and then you would be kicked out I I I I think what I mean by that is I would instill this mandate that would basically have to be followed that like so the the the company would have like the organization has to like basically prioritize certain technical milestones and if they don't that like Congress is basically going to decrease their funding every year for the next five years and basically make a milestone basis of like how good their their ability to actually like measure on-chain information is and if it's still dog  they it just you know they should keep having their budget well I think I think their budgets are already super low that's probably why also we see this sort of like triage with like the easy wins that to the rest of us seemed kind of dumb and then like little work being done on kind of the more important things so they do have some sort of performance measurements so there are they're like the government accounting organization Geo whatever has this like these performance metrics that they use and the performance metrics are not necessarily based purely on actions taken they're they're also based on like how much like amount extracted per unit enforcement and I feel like they just have chosen really bad kpis and you have this good hard saw thing where like it's actually much easier to optimize those kpis by not actually improving your technical capability and instead making videos and so I I generally think like that's that's the problem like the metrics are just up for these I think that's probably right it feels to me like the the way if you have two weeks the way to try to reform the SEC is basically you get like a CTO for the SEC and that CTO is now heading the organization and you basically say like look we're going to take a quarter it's kind of like a tech company right in a quarter you might say like look we're so deep in Tech debt we need to like freeze the feature roadmap and just go pay down technical debt and that that feels like probably what the SC needs to do is like create a more systematic way to do what they do now of course crypto is a small part of what they do right obviously financial markets are freaking massive especially in the US and they need to regulate an enormous surface area Beyond just crypto but this feels like not just a crypto thing right this is like a kind of broader thing of how can you systematize what you're doing in a way that's not just basically headline chasing which is easy to do but not great at actually creating the right kind of norms around how markets function so an interesting thing about um reg nms which is regulation neutral Market service which is um this the main main U.S regulation that ensures that at the prices you get on U.S equities um across multiple different venues so like naisy NASDAQ baths Philadelphia exchange whatever are guaranteed to give you the like National best bid and offer so this kind of forces this notion of like synchronization of prices across the US and part of the reason this law actually even ended up being enabled was that there was this trading firm that kind of like didn't do that well as a training firm but then basically sold a lot of their uh analysis tools they were using for trading to the SEC it was called trade works I think WRX and uh after that they got a lot better at finding spoofing I mean you can see like the spoofing is working so it was it's very clear that like the genslers of the world are not particularly good at like figuring out how to make that jump right like SEC got lucky in 2006 where that there were failed trading firms they were able to acquire basically the assets for pretty cheap I think it was like eight million dollars which is like less than they spend on like anything technology wise because I mean you can see the contracts right so I'm just trying to point out that like that would be my dictatorial band especially as crypto continues to evolve becomes more complex becomes more uh difficult to wrap your head around it requires more technology in order to really engage with it seriously well let's let's move on a bit from the SEC because I feel like we've I don't want this to be the regulatory show although obviously there was some regular 20s this week so there are a couple of stories that I want to get to that I thought were very interesting first I want to start with um Tyler hobbs's new 17 million tql collection there was a really interesting story that got a lot of Twitter up in arms so we've talked before about royalties and about some of the new nft exchanges that are no longer respecting royalties and I think Laura and I you've you and I have scrapped a little bit about this concept of energy royalties so um so one of the most notable exchanges that don't respect royalties is x2y2 which is this kind of Chinese team that is building a very similar to uh looks rare type exchange for nfts and uh this is one of the first times we've seen this so qql basically decided in their own code base to Blacklist x2y2 from being able to list qql nfts and so this is kind of the first instance of like reverse censorship where the nft collection is censoring The Exchange and it's saying no exchange you cannot you cannot trade our nft collection now you could like wrap qql and then take like a wrapped qql nft and then go put it on x2y2 I guess like you remember this happened with penguins of course yeah yeah dude the Penguins were wrapped um so it's possible to do it but um it's an interesting development where now like you have to be nice to the issuer if you want them to not de-list you basically as an exchange you can imagine the way this evolves is like basically the The nft Collection is like hey open C if you want to trade my nft you better like pay me up front otherwise I'm gonna Blacklist you from being able to list my assets so it's almost like a new back door for nft collections to be able to basically negotiate some of the rent that nft marketplaces are capturing I don't know what do you guys think about I mean I think this is make sure that royalty Zone code is zero for the highest end promoters and it's it's a little bit like the Art Market right like if you're like Larry gagosian you're probably paying like a huge markup to like the hot artists today but then for the new artists you you're like you're getting you know you're not getting anything this is like exactly the same behavior of our Market of like the the fee structure is like bespoke and like not transparent as to why is that but at least here I guess you see the royalty you can see the fees in the Art Market you can't so but I this this this type of price discrimination does exist it is um weird too that also The Blacklist is also updatable by like the owner of a contract and so you know I think there's always this tension with nfts of just like you know how sort of permanent is this is the or the med is the metadata you store an ipfs is the image short ipfs or just like a link to S3 somewhere and this feels like a big step towards no this is just like you know a JPEG on someone's servers and that like the owner could basically step in forever and like you know Blacklist you know transfers or transferees um which which feels a bit I don't know kind of strange I mean sort of antithetical to what amps are supposed to be about it's the usdc of nfts it ties into that that magic Eden thing I can't remember what it's called a ghost or something where basically if you if you traded an nft in a way that did not respect the the royalties that they would basically like Tombstone your nft such that it showed up as like a like a hey you didn't pay your royalty thing if you if you think this has been uh if you've arrived at this page an error please email support or something you know it's like it's like wow holy  this we really are moving pretty far away from the original concept of okay this is like a permissionless artifact on the blockchain now it's like okay the the nft issuer is policing every single instance of a transfer of this nft to figure out whether or not you paid your your you know your toll as you're crossing the toll road like it it seems like we're moving in a very weird direction as the nft issuers are really trying to hold on to their grasp over royalties in particular um which it like I mean Laura you and I have argued about this before this feels to me like a super unstable equilibrium right in the long run the whole point of nfts is that they're permissionless is that they are open is that anybody can do whatever they want which means that you cannot force people to do something if they don't want to do it and so you can try it feels very much like the record labels being like you can't share music because I want to do you know like no it's just not allowed you even though I gave you an MP3 you can't give it to anyone in the long run your business model just has to adapt to the fact that people are going to do what people are going to do and you can try like this like policing stuff and say okay well I'm gonna look through to your transactions and try to figure out if that was just a transfer to a multi-sig or an OTC sale behind the behind the you know sort of behind the veil I mean end of the day the point of crypto is you can make infinite derivatives and like exactly that you can make derivatives basically means that this this type of thing is like going to be like yes there's going to be a couple people like Tyler Hobbs who are like you know fine the van Gogh of the last year artist gets to get away with it right But like everyone else is just gonna there's gonna be someone who just makes a rapping service and ironically the rapping service might get more usage than every single nft derivative that it exists on chain because it's just a way to get around all this stuff it's actually kind of if I were if I were someone who was doing nft derivatives I would actually just go stop and go build a rapping theme people look I'm a man the people these  artists keeping that's a problem you can't have just one wrapping service because that one wrapping service is going to get blocked just like the way the extra Y2 got blocked like there's gonna be many of them they're just going to basic examples like constitute totally yeah but you guys I mean like so you guys are all crypto investors you're like VC people and VCS tend to be the people who at the beginning of some kind of new crypto concept they were like out there being the salesman and like saying like oh like this is what makes this you know new development so great and like one of the selling points of nfts that you guys were like you know Shilling to the world was like oh hey creators they can get royalties on resales of their creations and like now that this has become a thing that you're like nah like we're gonna pull that back I never said any of that about uh royalties I think royalties were cool while they were being enforced but again royalties were totally opt in royalties were not designed on the blockchain to be enforced they were a suggestion I do also think you're painting all capital participateful markets participants with a single brush stroke which is a bit like everyone well how could you treat us like we're all the same just because we're visiting how incredible not all VCS is that exactly exactly starting that hashtag right now but no no I mean I just I'm just pointing out first of all I think most nfts are dog and I hate nfts for this reason it's because it's like me it's just like it's been this kind of like scam narrative for certain Venture capitalists who raise these weird funds built around create our economy like bubble stuff D5 is really the only thing I think is actually like a real innovation in the space nfts are just okay I don't agree with that I don't agree with that but yeah but here's what I will say here's what I will say here's what I will say is that there's always these two forces in crypto between like what you know crypto the term crypto traditionally like kind it's kind of a right-wing term right it's sort of skews like okay hyper capitalist hyper Anarchist you know this uh sort of uh or a narcos really libertarian kind of feeling right and the term web3 it it points to the same stuff but it's kind of the liberal version it's more socialist it's more like oh we're Reinventing the web we're giving power back to the people that kind of thing right crypto always has both elements and those two elements are always intention and in nfts right like you see those two concepts like one concept is okay these are you know just pure financializing anything in the world and allowing it to be traded instantly and in a totally unregulatable Unstoppable way that's like the crypto element and the web 3 element is like oh well but you know you have these royalties and the creators are getting paid and it's like all very Kumbaya and you know everyone is helping everyone and it's wonderful and these two things are always fighting each other right they don't just kind of sit here and nothing changes um there's always attention and that tension is fought over in every part of crypto whether it's in D5 whether it's in layer ones or layer twos about like oh public goods funding but like oh no you have to bear market so never mind We're not gonna do public gets funding we're just gonna like try to pump the token in the long run you cannot fight the evolution of markets right markets evolve over time like they don't stay the same they don't stand still and in a time when everyone's getting paid everyone's making tons of money nfts are all going up it's all one big party um it's very easy to be very Kumbaya and say okay great you know nfts are both this like capitalist hyper Innovation where everyone makes a ton of money but it's also this like socialist Wonderland um when you get into a bear market and all of a sudden people are feeling poor and everyone's losing money and all these exchanges are in this massive Mad Dash for market share like yeah they're gonna be some people are going to say look I I don't want to do royalties like they're not enforced with the smart contract there I don't think they're required and competition forces that to happen yeah but where so where I would disagree with you is like you keep saying that um when creators get royalties then it's like Kumbaya socialist thing but I would say no that's a capitalist thing that's them being entrepreneurial and like like you know this is you know what this person's doing they're saying like hey like you can't trade this without giving me my royalty because I'm a business person and I created this and the more that it gets traded that shows that there's value in it and I should get like a piece of that because it's my creation and the value comes from like what I created and like this actually goes back when we discussed this before I um afterward wanted to ask Tom because Tom was like oh I feel like you know at a certain point like like let's say you know they uh board ap.com becomes like super successful and he was just like oh it just seems ridiculous that they should make um money on every single trade after a certain point so I would ask you know you a question like so for you know some of these things that you've invested in would you say like oh they should only make a certain amount of money and then after that they shouldn't make any more like the more successful they are the more then at a certain point they shouldn't that's right which is why like why why isn't that your thing for creators if they get to a certain point of success that then they shouldn't make any more off of the Trade Center it doesn't make any sense and yes it does because what I'm saying is that right now the the enforcement of uh of royalties is a norm it is not enforced in any way creators can't enforce it that's the whole problem that's why we're talking about Norms I'm talking about I see what Laura's saying like let's say we could snap our fingers and make it enforced my point is like companies require additional labor labor and capital to keep running right so it's like naturally they should be able to pay for themselves because they're performing a positional costs I think actually more like copyright right like copyright laws in the US are like what the artist death plus 70 years that seems a little bit more insane to me the fact that like you can have illegal Monopoly on like a concept you know even well past when the artist is is dead it's like that to my mind doesn't doesn't seem seem right and I think that's kind of more how I think about royalties where it's like this work has you know existed and yet you get to keep basically taking fees and perpetuity but it's also obviously something that has come up with with defy uh projects as well right which is like why does this why does this exchange you know get to just keep taking you know five bits why do children keep taking you know five bips forever um it feels more like 90 game versus I I understand the point you're making Tom but it feels very distinct from the from the point that Laura's making which is that why is it isn't it unfair to say okay most companies get to keep the Perpetual revenues of what they create except creators creators have to get jipped by all these exchanges right the reason why I don't think that is a legitimate Counterpoint is because like the the why was it in the first place that these royalties were being paid to the artists right it's not because the artist asked for it it's because openc decided to respect it right openc just decided hey this is kind of cool it's part of the ethos of crypto so we're gonna do it okay when other exchanges decide not to do it like from the beginning of how these nfts were designed it was not enforced which means that you're at a software you could create nfts that enforce this at a contract level right that's what Tara's doing people are talking about how ridiculous Tara is because the fact that Terra is forcing a tax on every single transfer of Terror right that is obviously absurd and ridiculous but that is the equivalent of how you do it by enforcing it at the you know business level or the contract level right binance does not make a suggestion that hey could you please pay me fees every time you transact on binance and like don't withdraw your full balance right no they take the fee because that's their business that's how it works there's no suggestion within binance of like hey please pay me fees with nfts it was always a suggestion it's not enforced and so if it's not enforced when it when somebody builds a business that doesn't take that into consideration and you say oh my God you're ruining the the value proposition of nfts it's like well you guys were you guys just decided to do this right if you want to enforce something and you create a mechanism that enforces it as opposed to just we're going to be mad at you on Twitter if you don't do it so I have a question for you if we were to uh imagine a world where there were no um royalties for resales then you you think that it would make total sense if the Creator only made however much they made in the initial sale and then if the um project became much more popular later that they wouldn't reap any rewards from that you think that that would be totally you would do that okay so so two things Laura and we talked about this on on a few years ago right if you don't allow resales that means that you are going to capture or sorry not if you don't write resells if you don't capture uh rent in the resales right you don't capture you don't tax the resales then the nft will sell for more upfront because the person who's buying it keeps more of the value as it grows right this is just like this is basic kind of Economics okay the other thing that you can do if you want to capture some of the upside is don't sell everything that's what yoga Labs did right you got Labs held back some of their crypto bombs crypto punks went up a lot and they were able to profit by selling more crypto pumps later there's a very easy solution to the idea of like hey I want to capture some of the eventual upside we just don't sell it all just keep some on your on your balance sheet until you actually want to sell it into where the market's at I feel like you guys are talking over each other a little bit I mean I think a that doesn't work for like one of one collections I think Laura's saying like philosophically let's say we could snap our fingers and design a system where you know royalties are mandatory like on Terra I write for transfers like do you agree with the idea that or should be entitled to this versus Steve saying like technically that's not possible so like where is the market going to net out and I think those are like two different two different questions that's a fair point right like practically speaking it's very difficult to imagine how you could enforce this at a smart contract level without doing something ridiculous like what Tara's doing if you were to do that let's say you were to do what Tara was doing then I would say okay fair game you designed this to enforce this tax and people who buy it get to decide what they you know they they they're operating the thing there the thing there that's different though is that the validators are the ones basically getting paid to enforce the contract that the fees are taken right it's quite a bit different than just like the like IMA application and this all it gets back to this problem of like in crypto unlike normal Computing we don't have a very clean separation between sort of like the base thing running things and the application and the end user might think the application is the same as the base thing like I bet you 90 open to users don't know the difference between ethereum and open C they kind of think they're the same thing which is fair right like they watch some  Tick Tock video that was like how to how to get rich off nfts and then they like downloaded metamask and that's all they know right so I guess my the reason I guess I feel like this this royalty thing is like so contentious to some extent is a the application layer cannot actually enforce a lot of things on its own and B the base layer is not meant to enforce these kinds of like specialty rights and so I think I think it's great when you're an artist if you're Tyler Hobbs Kudos and good for you like this go ahead do whatever the you want you're basically like people are still buying your even in like the worst part of the market for you I just think that this is like the the one percent problem of like nfts like it's only going to be the highest value ones who are ever going to even be able to do this ever the average shits on nft like they're never going to be able to have enough pricing power to do this I actually just had a great idea when you're talking about stack separation I think really something that would make everybody happy is we introduce a new uh Med boost relay that blocks transactions that don't pay artists royalties and then uh imagine that makes everyone mad at that I mean you know I I think I think everyone working at flashbots have had a very stressful couple months and that would have made them have a way more stressful couple months because like they would have the nft djends mad at them on top of just the like layer one politicos and the nft genes seemed much worse to get angry that's hilarious well okay uh let's let's wrap up the last story um after the merge there's been a lot of drama around flashpots in particular because of how much market share flashbots has when it comes to block building so right now um let's see uh Tom do you have actually the stats of what the current numbers are for flashbots uh I just did um I think it is around 40 but yeah that's what I saw most recently on Twitter basically a huge portion of the blocks generated on proof of stake are now being generated by flashbots and this is causing a lot of hand ringing with either within the ethereum community uh it's also causing a lot of handwringing at flashbots they're kind of in many ways a victim of their own success so it feels like a very much analogous to what was happening um when you know a lot of these Bitcoin mining pools were getting really huge and people were starting to get very nervous about decentralization um flashbot support is a little bit different than actually controlling quote-unquote hash rate or controlling stake per se but it does mean that a lot of the software the that is being run is being is depending on one particular third party for a lot of the blocks that are being built on ethereum and of course the Mev that's being extracted on ethereum any perspectives on what's going on with the flashbots well a couple of things so I know tarun you're you're close to that team but you know um so I'm not going to pretend to be like some Mev expert or anything but like I did a show about this this summer and I did some like preliminary interviews beforehand and when I was learning about it I just was like it seems like flashbots is a centralizing force in ethereum that was kind of one of my takeaways and then um it sort of felt like almost like a taboo thing to say out loud or something and then of course when the tornado sanctions thing happened and then they were like oh we're gonna um you know open source our uh relay code uh because we realize that we should have more relays and there should be other options like you know it sort of just feels like oh I don't know it just feels like it like if you'd been kind of investigating it it would have been kind of obvious that that was a risk and then suddenly uh when this you know outside event happens it like highlights that but it just was surprising to me that um they didn't realize it before or that people didn't call it out before because that was kind of one of the things that I noticed when I was researching it I don't think that people didn't call that so by the way quick disclosure so actually all of us are investors into flashpots but dragonfly and robot um so we know the team reasonably well I think the people who are you know kind of close to the Mev World always aware that flashbots had a huge amount of influence and a large uh effect on what was going on with respect to ethereum blocks it's just more obvious now post merge um with the with you know just like the growing dominance of Mev boost and the fact that ethereum issuance is a lot lower so like a larger portion of block awards are Mev yeah but I feel like if anybody had just thought through all the steps like what this is going to look like post margin you could have figured that out before like you didn't actually need the merch you could have I mean there were definitely people who are angry about it let's put it that way I would say that there's a large a large discourse on it but of course it was only amongst the people reading the technical docs so of course that was 10 of the addressable Market of people but yeah like all the other block Builders were like you know if you follow the Rook Twitter like every day keeper Dow was taking like a shot at flashbots and giving them an argument for it so or or block shroud or whatever like every single one of the other builders has been saying this for months it's just that you have to remember the historical context that led to flashbots ethereum was definitely getting destroyed in parts of 2019 because people were spamming the public mempool to to do all these like backgrounding attacks and front-running attacks it became unusable for for a lot of average users because 90 of the block could be someone sending the same transaction 100 times and then like no one else could could get into the block and so This was meant to be a way of moving that sort of bid sniping off chain so that's not clogging the entire block for the rest of the users now naturally such a thing will have some centralization effect but also naturally you know in the same way that a mining pool operator or staking pool operator controls the pending transactions that they send to all the stake or miners that are subscribed to that you will also have a similar sort of centralizing course so the question here was like do we go for some notion of like welfare optimization like we want the welfare of all users who want to get into a block to go up or do we want um sort of you know a pure decentralization argument and so that was that was the original reasons The Flash bought 2.0 flash voice 2.0 Paper was sort of pointed this out uh 2019. right but like at this point I sort of feel like the incentives are it's like a tragedy of the commons kind of situation huh what's the alternative right now yeah because like people the reason why the percentage keeps going up and up is because it's more profitable for them to use that and so like I feel like people will have to be sacrificial they'll be like oh you know I'm not going to do something that's like financially in my own interest uh to like keep ethereum decentralized but then you're always going to get the people that are going to be freeloaders and be like oh well I'm just going to make more money I don't care you know if it's centralized and to be clear that was also true of the mining pools right back in the day when the mining pool like when there was uh I don't know which money pool was that like had 50 uh my equal market share the reason why was because they were the most profitable like most minors don't actually care right they're just pointing their lasers at whatever is giving them the most satoshi's per per hash so they're most people are just gonna be like yeah whatever and when the when the when the crisis basically gets bad enough that's when the mark the market starts to self-regulate by like you know the the Staker at the margin basically says you know what I'm going to stop running flashbots now it's not every single person is going to do that but a few people are going to say you know what I'm gonna stop relying on flashbots because it feels like they're they're you know the block uh preparation ratio is too high they're gonna start relying on some of the other block Builders and slowly it's going to self-regulate but it requires this political activity actually take place right like the conversation that's happening on Twitter of people being mad and people saying like hey this is bad for ethereum the exact same thing that happened in Bitcoin right it took a while but eventually people start caring more politically about what's going on and and that causes people to change their behavior so I think from my perspective um in a way what flashbots is is trading off centralization for efficiency and there are times when you have to do that in the development of a protocol and you know flashbots is always looking if you talk to the team right they're always looking forward to like okay eventually you know PBS is going to be enshrined in the protocol it's not going to be like them running our crap in a sidecar uh to Geth as it is today but um we're not there yet right we're not at that point where the flashboss architecture is basically in protocol and until then flashbots is like kind of emulating that final state of what ethereum is going to look like um and that incurs some degree of centralization the thing is like flashback's just good it's good they're good at what they do they're a good block Builder and if you're good at what you do you're gonna get more market share the same way that these mining pools that were better than anybody else were just gaining tons and tons of market share so this will regulate but it requires us to have this debate in public yeah yeah and for for the record right there's no known technical solution to any of this that exists right now so PBS is sort of a PBS stands for um proposer Builder separation the proposer is the person who the stake distribution you assume there's some sort of Oracle that's able to sample like which person's stake gets used for the next block the proposer has to pick blocks that are built by other people so you think of the proposer as sort of an Auctioneer you can think of the block Builders there's people bidding um for like here are the transactions you should get in the block and whoever is able to pack the block to death and get sort of like the highest revenue split between the proposer and Builder usually wins right but that was the other thing is like when I realized that ethereum was going to move to PBS I was like how is that also not centralizing because uh the the builders there's probably going to be some Builder that becomes like more dominant that is just better at packing the blocks like I don't see how you get around that like that that's an understanding of the actual execution of these contracts correctly and being like oh this particular type of transaction flow has this type of transaction stream I'm willing to subsidize it this much to to get it in this other type of transaction stream has very spiky flow and I can't subsidize it as much and and whoever's the best at constructing that portfolio is going to be the best block Builder and so but the fact that's open is different than normal Finance right in normal Finance you actually can't even participate in that but the the idea that someone who's better is like ends up being hyper specialized I mean that wire jump in Alameda so large in other firms you know didn't didn't grow as much last year it sort of has the same concentration effect because it has to do with the economic value and the transactions not the actual cryptographic content of the the proofs of these transactions and that that's what people don't get but but is that a risk to have that like is that also a risky centralizing factor or force or is it not at end of the day it's hard to get around it what's the vector you're worried about right like I think the most likely thing that you can imagine let's say that um the the most dominant block Builder basically prepares every freaking block right let's imagine that's sort of the the degenerate case with literally no other block Builder is ever competitive other than you know let's say you know super Builder and super Builder let's say they are of fat compliant and so they will never include a transaction from an ofic restricted country right that can get you into a world where basically you have de facto censorship if this one super Builder is just so good that nobody else can ever prepare a block that has anywhere near the profitability of the super Builder block now practically speaking and How likely is that not super likely but it is I think a possible degenerate case in a world of PBS but to tarun's point like in a world with Mev I don't think there's any real way around that as long as there is an open market for Mev the people who are best at extracting it are going to ultimately be able to win the block space so I think I think I think the best state equilibrium is that there are many applications not just uniswap sandwich attacks and not just like front-running myths there are many applications competing for this so many that it's actually impossible to specialize in being good at all of them and you will have Builders who are really good at certain applications and building blocks when there's certain transaction volume for certain applications and the transaction volume is kind of like distributed across all of them because then it will be very hard to centralize the economic value but otherwise we've this is the part of cryptocurrency that I think people don't understand they somehow think oh yes we use we use some fancy photography and we've like avoided all these economic concentration problems and then that's just not true this is still a capitalist system like if you're better at understanding the information flow before a block is billed and you're able to collate that into figure out an expected profit and loss for you faster than everyone else then so be it that that is literally on every blockchain what keeps you know is humming yeah no clearly a crypto isn't a capitalist system I mean these like uh crypto networks they're all built around incentives so like clearly that's you know part of uh what is going on here um it's just like I said like when I was learning about it I was like wait wait wait um and you know it's interesting to hear your perspective since you guys have invested in all this and we'll see what happens there is a line of people who you know I guess I would say like there's like the Mev accelerationists versus the Mev can be stopped by cryptographics mean camp and there are two very separate camps um that can be stopped by cryptographic mean camp that is kind of what are so-called Fair ordering protocols none of them have ever really been built in practice and work and a lot all of them make kind of like quite large security assumptions that are very different than a public blockchain in fact they like either make the latency significantly worse they rely on some fallback Oracle so like the chain link arbitrum version of the world is that everyone will have these like Pharaoh sequencing things and like whatever transaction gets in first most of the time will like be first now of course errors and possibility Theory means like you can't do that perfectly so there's obviously theoretical limits of that but I I guess the main point is the Mev acceleration in this Camp is like hey look if we actually understand how much value is being generated how much people's incentives are we can design a better auction we can design a better option that actually is able to redistribute things it's able to like do other things with this excess value such that it goes back to the users whereas the fair ordering size like we want to just not care about what transactions are going in and what values created there's still could be value extracted we just want these like theoretical guarantees of first and first out and it it's that's sort of like a philosophical debate that has no technical solution at this juncture today yeah yeah no I agree that um like first of all I definitely agree that the two sides are a little bit like oil and water and in some sense they like actually really really dislike each other which I randomly stumbled into and did not expect when I discovered that and I was like whoa whoa whoa like yeah that was kind of interesting um but I agree that a part of it is like a values thing and um you know I other people have talked to me about this potential for Mev to result in rebates for users which I actually think is super interesting um and frankly you know uh in terms of the sort of fair ordering thing like as far as I understand arbitrum is like super centralized so even when you kind of like try to minimize Mev it's centralized anyway so you know uh I yeah I I I'm not a technical person so I don't know how to solve it this is the reason I kind of like you know why do I write the research area a lot of it has to do with like proving these things formally because like everyone who's working on this doesn't seem to care about there are there exists some bounds to how well you can do either side of this and everyone is just like Kumbaya to my side the other side sucks but in reality it's a very subtle trade-off between these two things and unfortunately like you know people's economic incentives don't let them research it so I I unfortunately am left with that bag well we're very blessed to have you doing God's work and uh proving to people what they might know someone is just that the people working on these things otherwise to choose their Camp right instead of like uh being neutral about that fair enough well look I to to to close out this thread the one thing I will say is like look I I we've got a lot of love for the flashbots team but we also like you also need some tough love for them like they're in many ways a victim of their own success and so to the extent that you want to yell at them for being like yo why are you guys like centralizing ethereum like do it give them tell them like hey you guys need to figure out a way to to not make ethereum what Bitcoin was in in uh 2017 when a huge amount of concentration was was uh taking place in in the mining layer um I think this stuff will get figured out but it won't be perfect because there is no perfect right there is no pristine um you know kind of final state that this stuff is going to end up in uh there's always going to be attention in blockchain between centralization decentralization same way as I was saying earlier between capitalism and socialism there's always some tension and that tension gets resolved in part through economics and in part through politics and we're seeing that playing out right now and I think that's important so uh I'm glad that people are pointing this out that people are pushing flashbots to have answers and you know they're they're doing a lot more open sourcing stuff they're talking about how the roadmap is that they're going to make it easier for other block Builders to become competitive with themselves which is the kind of thing that a normal company would not do but when you're so tightly when you when you're tied so tightly to the fate of ethereum um in some sense like flashbots only succeeds if ethereum succeeds in the same way that like you know the Bitcoin mining pools back in the day like they also got the same calculus is that they only survive if Bitcoin survives and if Bitcoin is is going through like the Civil War because the miners are too centralized and like people now think like oh we should throw all these we should throw all this out and like start over it's like okay never mind never mind we're not that centralized We're not gonna try to be monopolists um and so I think that that push and pull is essential to how blushes work and there's also this interesting thing of like off ethereum Mev exists quite in fact I would argue it's it's much because it's less efficient it's more extractive from users in some ways but I think between Solana and Cosmos there's sort of different models of how Mev auctions look how they'll get extracted how the technical details of the chain influence how well this these things work and these experiments are going to influence like how people design around what what sort of the limits of like what what fair means because fairness doesn't it can have many different definitions unfortunately very yeah and actually I know we're over time but like last point on this is just like interesting listening to see you talk about how there's kind of like capitalist tendencies in crypto and also socialist which I had never um like thought of that but like it's weird to me that it had never um occurred to me that that is true but it is which is like really interesting and fascinating about crypto that it's like this thing that's yes capital is because of incentives and what we talked about but then it's also this thing that's like trying to get everybody you know involved and kind of distribute value to like everybody and it was just like a fascinating thing but anyway anyway well this has been super fun uh we got a little bit heated from between you and I Laura but it was a lot of fun and I'm glad you were able to jam with us today um so that's it until until next time thanks everybody and uh signing off yes
