[Music] hi all before we get into today's episode a few quick notes first this is the inaugural show in a series I'm doing called why Bitcoin now which looks more closely at Bitcoin in this macro economic environment we'll do a little dive into the history of money the history of the coin and also look more closely at the first cryptocurrencies monetary policy among other things and we kicked the whole thing off today with a discussion with Raoul Appel and Mike Novogratz on the overall macro environment for Bitcoin plus we touch on other related initiatives like the digital dollar Libre etherium and web 3 while the series won't be consecutive episodes in a row I will flag each one for you with the rubric why Bitcoin now because I think the macro economic conditions are especially conducive to understanding Bitcoin especially from a monetary perspective one more note this is the last unseen episode with my sound engineer Chris at fractional recording he's been with me since day one of Unchained which launched more than four years ago he's been my rock for these shows beyond professional and dependable and just an all-around pleasure to work with Plus helix fractals like me which makes him really cool in my book Chris I'm gonna miss you tremendously thank you for all the work you've done for me and my shows I really wish you all the best now onto the show did you invest in a crypto project I see oh that promised innovation but delivered nothing you might have recourse but statutes of limitations are quickly approaching kelman PLLC run by some of the first lawyers to

payment application or issue digital assets like stable coins or digital dollars stellar is easy to learn and fast to implement start your journey today at Unchained stellar org my guests for today are Mike Novogratz founder CEO and chairman of galaxy digital and Rahul pal founder and CEO of global macro investor and real vision group welcome Mike in row ever since the corona virus started I've been thinking that between the pandemic and all the economic uncertainty is created as well as the recent Bitcoin having Bitcoin might be about to have a moment but right now the price is basically just about where it was before the crisis hit so maybe it was wrong why do you guys think that is well I think it is having I think it's a big moment you know quite frankly I was more confused early in the year while I was going up in January December I was kind of depressed thinking there was not a whole lot of energy in the space and then we had this kind of mystery rally not just Bitcoin but all the crypto is going up and I didn't have a great understanding of why lots of leverage mostly out of Asia that piled into the market and then we had a big deal ever Jing right all the way down to some 5,000 you know when Corona hit and you had the global deleveraging and since then you know the tenor of the the buyer has changed the the amount of phone calls that were getting has changed the overall excitement in the space has changed mostly because we now have a perfect macro backdrop to sell people on the scarcity story on the hard assets story on Bitcoin as digital goals and we're seeing new buyers in new and not just new buyers the new buyers in new asset in an investor classes so Paul Tudor Jones buying it really the first major hedge fund bought it in his fund I got a call last night from one of the biggest hedge funds in the world looking to hire a crypto traitor I told him I wasn't for sale but so you're seeing this shift of new participants and the the macro story is so powerful I think it's a very different story enroll what about you I mean I totally agree I think it is the gift of the macro story the Bitcoin has always been after but not only that I mean I totally agree with what Mike's saying but on top of that I think the whole space and might operates in a much larger space with galaxies is that whole disruption of a financial system is becoming much more obvious to people now because you're seeing the fragilities of what exists so I think you know it's a perfect time in a place it's interesting to me it's not broken out yet but you know if anything it teaches you patience within the Bitcoin world and you know like Mike I don't really understand why it was up beforehand I was not really heavily involved but now it's got you know a lot of focus for me and same thing I'm getting emails phone calls every day from hedge fund saying okay how do I buy for my PA how do I get it into my fund what do I need to do how do I get involved so yeah it's definitely growing in importance across the spectrum well so then two questions I mean first of all why did Bitcoin fall with the larger market on March 12th like if what you're saying is you know that it is this safe haven that it is this hedge then why was it correlated rather you know and and but in the second part of the question is then also you guys didn't answer like why is the price basically the same as it was before like why isn't it higher well so it fell is it's very easy to understand why it fell we had kind of max uncertainty right the VIX over eighty four five six seventy days in a row that's happened once in my whole career and so when you have max uncertainty people run for run for cash cash is your first instinct is a safe haven and leverage goes from here here and so because you know the listen you could buy Bitcoin on orther Hayes's exchange with a hundred to one leverage I don't think many people do because you wouldn't last very long at a hundred to leverage but crypto because it's unregulated and because a lot of it the big futures exchanges are offshore provides so much more leverage then than traditional equities are fixed income if you think about it if I wonder by Goldman Sachs shares and I'm a retail participant the most I can get is two to one leverage and encrypt of 32 120 150 to 1 and so when you have leverage and you have uncertainty usually the price gets the kicked out of it yeah and you know and because it's in retail hands that leverage works very quickly against it the other mechanism why I think Bitcoin is not really rising from here is there's another new development that's gone on over the last few years particularly the last year is this kind of yield enhancement stuff so everyone's getting positive yields out of storing Bitcoin and one of the strategies as ever the same financial markets is selling upside volatility so there's a lot of cool selling that's been up there and this kind of gamma hedging stops it breaking out but we kind of most of us have been around for a while and this stuff knows that once you start breaking levels everybody ends up liquidating these short core positions and it creates a huge run upwards but I think it's that it's very heavy in Delta hedging and gamma what it brings when it breaks ten thousand or ten thousand two hundred it will get to 14000 much faster where people expect yeah you consolidated arranged and and listen this is an adoption story and if bitcoin was easy to buy it would be a lot higher and so we've dealt with a few hedge funds that are buying it right they've got to go through all the new diligence for their funds and and you know it's a two to four week process for their for their back office to feel comfortable and so it's not like the phone call then they gotta usually talk to their board hey we're going to buy crypto for the first time the other I think new group of buyers that are coming they're not here yet the financial advisor community is giant right the bulk of the wealth in America and in Europe is not owned by Jen's ear Millennials though they'd like it it's owned by you know Gen X and Baby Boomers and older and you know the 50 to 80 year olds they don't have bread wallets or clean bakes wallets or venmo apps you know it's so getting the financial advisors to feel comfortable to then sell it to them it's a process that galaxy that we're really working hard on that's being amped up in a big way not just with us with others as well and so I think in the next few months you're gonna see a lot of FAS putting their clients and does and also Mike as you know is the whole the structure of this is everyone's got their eye on it and the if the price moves up everyone gets foam Owen has to get involved and that's the institutional level now yes it goes up further the more it goes up the more the market cap goes up the more they can justify it to their trustees and the more people get involved so I think we're at that tipping point of a virtuous cycle that can continue for a while but we just need to get through these levels first but I think essentially every institution every Raa is almost kind of shortly upside calls not not really I mean obviously there's a bunch of people who are but really what it's all about is people don't have it and they need to get it but they wait for the price for confirmation so it sort of sounds like you're saying the decision makers have made the decision it's just kind of a matter of time to let those decisions play out in the market and we should see the price rise but I'm wondering like so what is it that's driving those decision makers like what is it about Bitcoin that makes them think that this is the investment to make now during the time where the coronavirus is it just as simple as like Bitcoin is scarce and we're about to see unlimited quantitative easing or is there anything kind of more it's just that simple so people ask me all the time for gold yesterday even so I hope I own gold and silver as well but why Bitcoin versus gold if you were to buy gold there's 16 different ways to do it it's very easy and you to pick up a new by an ETF and so there's no adoption curve and gold where bitcoin there's still an adoption curve right a small portion of the institutional world has participated yet and so is that adoption grows you've just got a jacked up upside versus gold it's the exact same macro story and listen you know it's funny Bitcoin really is gonna disrupt one one one thing right the crypto universe was gonna disrupt everything and Bitcoin really right now is being bet on to disrupt disrupt central banks and so the fact that you know backdoor fidelity or real institutions are gonna hold it for you in custody it some of the crypto junkies would be like dude that's not even the whole spirit of crypto right the spirit of crypto was to get away from those institutions well in a meta sense yes but in a specific sense the bet on Bitcoin is a is a hedge versus fiat so it's disrupting one piece and so I think having those trusted names in and around keeping someone's Bitcoin safe I mean it's shocking you know like it's because it it's almost comical and when you originally written started telling the story of this is going to be a disruption for the banking system but can I keep it at JPMorgan but if you think about it the first leg here is disrupting central banks it's this fiat that's being printed like it's toilet paper yeah if you think about it in the terms of right we've never gone through such central bank uncertainty none of us have lived through monetary printing of this kind of magnitude in fact none of us even believed it would ever happen so when you've got something that it's so large and it continues I mean it just doesn't go away it gets worse and worse and worse everybody has to ask the question well what could it mean and bitcoin is the call option on the what could it mean and so simple as that so in a big portfolio a very little bet could end up being a very big thing if something at the central bank level i fiat currency come into a larger problem yeah so it sounds like you two actually have kind of like two theories that propel your interest in Bitcoin because Tomas Paulo Hypatia was on my show last week basically said he didn't think that cope it was gonna be bitcoins moment and he said it's only gonna take off if there's some fundamental breakdown of the system but you seem and and he basically was like yeah I don't believe in the digital gold thesis and stuff like that but you guys seem to see it both ways but one thing that I was curious about is you know so far we've seen that retail investors have really led these different bull markets in Bitcoin but you know with the fallout of the virus I I don't know if a lot of retail investors are gonna have a lot of extra disposable income to you know place on speculative investments so do you think right now we're gonna see that flip and because you guys are talking about institutional investors well but both look here's a staff that'll blow your mind 2020 disposable income in the United States is going to be up four to five percent from 2019 that's kind of crazy with 30 percent unemployment or whatever we have 20 percent unemployment right think about I just said disposable income for Americans is gonna be up five percent this year why because the government's given everyone a ton of money they gave stimulus checks and you saw today you know Trump's losing in the polls he says I would get more stimulus checks right it's an election year this guy's not going to be cheap he wants to get reelected right we took unemployment insurance of $600 you know from from basically used to be get paid about twelve dollars an hour unemployment insurance and now it's 25 dollars an hour and so you know unemployment insurance all of a sudden is fifty thousand dollars a year so it's not that bad to be an unemployment and so we're pumping the money full of liquidity a lot of that finding its way to the US stock market if you see the the the Robin Hood accounts are jamming stocks up and we're seeing kind of bubble bubble like behavior lots of stocks some of us finding his way to the crypto markets Brian Armstrong had a very funny post the day the $1,200 was at $1,200 $1,200 checks how many $1,200 Bitcoin orders he had versus a normal day and it's a graph that goes right right don't buy $1,200 of anything on that day there were a ton of $1,200 buys and so you know shockingly there's a lot of liquidity in the system and I think it finds its way in the other thing I would mention is you know bit coin and crypto has always been about systems change kovat exposed the kind of raw in a Cui's of our country which i think is creating this tension oh I just lost you know we're you we've got you I can't see that I'm sorry it's creating this tension and now we're seeing riots in the streets right the black lives matter movement it's not just the black lives matter movement it is a revolution of spirit of saying we've got financial and equality racial inequality health care of equality we want systems change right people are protesting the straight-4 system change and so while it's not a direct correlation with the price of crypto Bitcoin it's the same macro spirit right and so we're going to go into one of the most difficult elections of our recent history in our country that is going to keep more I think tension dislocation impossible really wacky outcomes which also is is a tailwind for Bitcoin yeah also if you think of the narrative that Mike's talking about it's a narrative of fear right because people don't know we don't understand what is happening and letting out of the fear whether it's fiat money or or systemic social change or whatever it may be people automatically start to gravitate towards understanding things like Bitcoin because they they're looking for answers and Bitcoin appears to be the answer that many people have come up with and so you know I see it even at the office from the people we employ at real vision I mean today my chief of staff is like okay so I've set up my my accounts and I'm I'm now doing my due diligence to get my kyc I'm like why are you buying bitcoins because well I just don't understand really what's going on and I feel like it's an insurance policy and so it's really getting to that tipping point where people are understanding it's something they need to do well I just oh go ahead Mike well I was going to say the last thing to mention is so we have 2008 where Bitcoin was you know first brought into the world by Satoshi and in his Merry Pranksters and you know we had a financial crisis the global financial crisis something we never thought we'd see JPMorgan might go out of business Morgan Stanley might go out of business we don't trust the banks we don't trust anybody so here comes crypto and there was a lot of when I bought crypto in 2012 and a hundred Bitcoin you know we were we had just done QE to Europe was in crises there was a lot of fear of inflation yeah we didn't get it right and one of the reasons we didn't get any and things kind of got put back the genie got put back in the bottle was that the political movement that came out of that chaos was the Tea Party it was this fringe Republican group that said stop spinning her goddamn money no more mister Obama and so we had this stalemate between the central bank having to feel like they had to do everything because the treasury wouldn't do anything right the tea party got eaten up swallowed out and thrown to the side of the road by Donald Trump right he came into this with a 5% fiscal deficit spend spend spend now the political movement that's coming out of this is the radical left you know it's a or C I shouldn't call it radical left it's the it's the but it's it was radical versus the center and so there is no chance in hell that either party is gonna say oh it's time to be fiscally conservative now let's stop spending right they're gonna say let's pay for kids college let's wipe out student debt let's have universal health care let's make this world more fair and just all of that cost a Shack a lot of money and so the printing press goes Birdseye crypto memes I can't imagine the printing press slows down anytime soon I don't see a political scenario that puts us back into you know adults running the show well I guess the one thing that I just wonder is like if we're talking about retail investors buying Bitcoin and having the disposable income to do that like I totally understand that I think it's like two-thirds of people who receive stimulus we're getting more money than their normal salary but that's also kind of the group of people who like tend to have dead and I just don't know how many of them are gonna be like I think there's a really important thing here is if you are a millennial so you're under the age of what thirty five and you look at your 401k and your investment opportunities for your retirement savings you have equity valuations are all-time highs bond yields are all-time lows credit yields are all-time lows you have and property price is pretty much at highs you have zero opportunity to have an expected positive return over the next ten or twenty years but that's the reality here so how do you do what do you do how do you say for your future you can save in cash okay that's fine the reality is is crypto offers an opportunity it is the thing that the the baby boomers got with the equity market and the bond market they got the double and the property market area all three they got a record low valuations gifted to them at in their 30s and they got rich on the back of it anybody Millennials are going to accumulate over time in their 401 KS into crypto or think about saving because it gives them something that has the 50 to 100 won upside if we were landing here 150 years from now and we were anthropologists and historians and we looked at we'd look at the baby boomers and you know unfortunately I'm 34 days of baby born so I always tell my kids identifies Gen Z I the baby boomer generation will look back as the most selfish generation in the history of the planet if you look at what they have taken and the debt they're leaving versus what they put in right and so this is generational theft on a gargantuan scale right the baby boomers are running up a debt that's astronomical that in my poor son and his kids are gonna have to pay back one day and they're not gonna pay back and so in some ways logic would say the only way you pay it back is it's late - it away of your deficit you just look at the scale the debt and how fast it's growing right you've got a positive first and second derivative of the growth of debt that doesn't make you feel good if you're 20 years old or 24 years old or 16 years old now most of those guys don't have economics degrees yet they have actually figured out how to connect the dots but they intuitively feel and so when I really think about it like we're gonna come back as you know these future anthropologists you were like dude of course they were buying something else we weren't that much and key to the point is the millennial generation and particularly Gen Z grew up understanding that digital assets have value right why can I have to take that leap we didn't know this it didn't make sense to us right we were still fighting for our vinyl records and it was all going to Apple you know all of this digital stuff was not a natural thing that we grew up with what we what these guys grew up with is digital assets have value so they don't have to take any leap of understanding at all in fact it's ludicrous to imagine that cash is an easier thing to have than a digital asset so you know the adoption rate from younger people is always gonna be faster in this so I think just naturally they will gravitate towards it and they'll just understand intuitively yeah I guess you know when I asked that question though I was thinking more about like furloughed workers like people who just don't have money coming in I think Laura what you're doing here is worrying about a small point in time and the group of people so there's a number of participants in this space so we're looking at either the structural flows or who is the next person in the next person in I think is probably the hedge funds because I think they understand it the institutions are slower but they will get there and I think that flow will offset you know anything from a few Millennials who is furloughed or even if it's 2 million Millennials furloughed because the relative amounts of savings that I have versus the large pools of capital so if we're looking in that short term I what breaks 10,000 well it's probably the shift towards more institutions coming into the space because a few people can drive this massively and as we said once it starts going through there's a few structural issues once it starts going through the upside it actually quite probably accelerates but just to summarize to make sure I have fully understood so you know it sounds like you think institutions will lead but like I guess where I was also going with my question was you know we have this like record high unemployment and but yet you still think that retail is gonna also drive the next Bitcoin bull market is that the case well I think I agree but I think that again prices are set on the margin right so it's where the new buyers I think the new buyers are coming from 50 to 80 year olds it doesn't mean you know 15 to 50 year olds stop buying completely but it's that you know Bitcoin is a social construct it's how many people can you get to believe in it and there's a whole new group that are starting to believe in it right again if you go on Robin Hood's app Vic wins a big is a big part of it because they've got all young people who already believe it and some we're converting new people and the key point is and the key point here is if you take one person aged 30 and one person aged 60 their relative wealth differential has never been larger in all the history of the United States so you bring in one of those 60 year olds it has an outsized impact because they have much more savings because they're later in their careers and the relative earning gap has been ridiculous for a period of time so you know as those people come in I think but yes sure bunch of those are furloughed too but if you look at the unemployment statistics the actual predominance of people who have been laid off or actually the under 35s okay yeah but so I actually still want to ask a little bit more about how the coronavirus will impact things because just I was wondering like will we see kind of different impacts based on like how well a certain country handles the coronavirus like for instance what we see like less of economic fallout in a place like New Zealand or Australia or Taiwan where they've kept the virus down whereas obviously in the u.s. since uh you know we're had this level of about 30,000 new cases a day and it's actually just frankly increasing at least at the time of this recording so in that sense well the impact and well the economic impact in the u.s. be you know worse you know when the US sneezes the world gets a cold I mean we are still the dominant engine of global growth and so in u.s. sets monetary policy and lots of ways for the world we're still the reserve currency and so I think even if you're a country if you're tahini and you've got no cases the economic impact because of tourism and all kinds of other things it's still pretty severe if you look at China's doing its biggest stimulus ever Japan is doing its biggest stimulus ever the u.s. is doing its biggest stimulus ever Europe is doing its biggest stimulus ever and so you add it all up and it's it doesn't really matter if you've done a little bit better in covent or a little bit worse it's the collective psyche psychotic psychological shift amongst central bankers you know about people believing in in modern monetary economics are praying it works right I mean money they get out to me it's worship right money doesn't grow on trees at one point you got to pay it back and this hope that yeah we can just keep doing this and then put the genie back in the bottle you know it's gonna be really hard to get the genie back in Bali he ain't going back in and so you know the best you can hope for is a long period of three and a half percent inflation to started plating with some of the debt but not going higher but markets usually don't work that way and you know look at the coronavirus in particular as well is if everybody had acted like South Korea Japan and some of Europe it gets contained faster doesn't mean people get all their full freedoms back and the economy gets back to normal the problem is is we've got the US which kind of reopened at peak virus so that's now become a problem and then you add Brazil and India on top and you've got a world that is now impossible to reopen right because you've got 1.7 billion people who are now at peak virus right so that's gay over for the year and game over for everybody else so New Zealand great job people in New Zealand can move around freely and it's all good problem is they can't travel and they can't have open anybody in and world trade takes a big hit so it's really hard so people are getting penalized so if you think of the structure of society what's happened is people have been penalised now for taking the pain so countries that took a lot of pain to control the virus are now being penalized because others didn't do it and so therefore they can't reopen the world economy takes longer to heal it's a it's a yeah it's an issue now could New Zealand's domestic economy or hearing came than we've pretty got rid of it can our domestic economy recover faster possible I'd you know I don't know well I guess role could still have parties even if it's not people live on this island that I'm on right now so it's not much of a party all right well so we're gonna talk a lot more about how other macro factors are gonna affect Bitcoin and the crypto space

Raoul pal so we like you guys have in a way you've painted quite a rosy picture and I just wondered I'm sorry for Bitcoin not necessarily for the economic recovery but I wondered um well you know will that actually be more positive for Bitcoin to have the economic fallout kind of be dragged out the then it looks like it's going to be since the virus cases are you know not decreasing well my view is that my fear at the end of this is there's two camps that go on in macro land and everyone will fight all day until it's proven one way or the other and then they'll claim victory either way but it's the inflation camp and the deflation camp so the inflation camp and is not only about the excess printing and what it does to monetary policy but it's the excess stimulation and can it create a general rise in prices I don't believe in that I believe that the fiat currency valley will devalue versus gold and bitcoin things that have perceived longer-term stores of value on the other side of the equation is what I worry about which is solvency because if you drag a crisis on for a long period of time and everybody's in a lot of debt well if their cash flows were impaired ie the economy slow you end up with a solvency crisis and we haven't had that since the 1930s and my fear is that is the risk here and I think we would have had had a better chance if the US economy had shut down stayed shut down long enough to get the RO down below 1 and then reopened and you wouldn't have had a potential prolonged event I could be dead wrong right everything could go fine and so I don't know a crystal ball but the probability of this being a longer event is higher and if it's a longer event and cash flows are impaired there's two answers either people go bust or government spend more money and prim or money right both of those are extremely positive for Bitcoin and gold which is why I like both of us own Bitcoin and gold because it's almost it's very rare in macro which probably means we're both going to be wrong but it's very rare in macro where both extreme outcomes lead to exactly the same trade what's interesting is it's hard to see government's not pretty more money like the psychology shifted what's funny you know the minimum wage in America is anywhere from 750 to $15 depending what state you're in the living wage in our country is about 1450 I'm sorry $16 the average wage that you get paid working at Walmart Home Depot Lowe's all the big-box retail is about $14 some $2 below the the living wage same thing with working at any of the fast food restaurants right 1350 is the average wage so now at $25 what's interesting people are kind of feeling like that feels more fair that feels more right like it's a staggering difference right it's making $20,000 a year $50,000 a year but there's a social construct that's why people are marching in the streets saying we've been slaves for too long and so there's literally the social social upheaval breaking windows painting you know eat the rich was all over LA you know besides black lives matter of saying the way society was functioning doesn't really work and so I have a really hard time seeing you know I think the Trump in his a gang of Republican senators and congressmen are gonna get wiped out of these elections like it's gonna be a historical beatdown that's my first prediction but even if I'm wrong even if Trump wins he's not gonna like then tighten the belt look at he's been the most profligate president we've had in years in generations he he came in and ran a 5% budget deficit when he claimed we had the greatest economy of all time when we have the greatest economy all time you're not supposed to be having a 5% budget deficit and so you've got a Republican spend a holic and then you got the Democrats who you know who are ready to go and so I just don't see the case for not wanting to make people's lives better with free money and also the other side of this is even if within that these things are deflationary the outcome from that and I think real rates will end up going up in the United States because bond yields are at zero and I think we go to deflation so real rates go up and the Federal Reserve have two tricks in their sleeve one escapes are negative rates to print more money or three is but both of the above and again that's another situation where it massively plays into this whole thesis about so sattell unrest the unfairness the feeling that you've been screwed and then the the the printing by central banks the feeling that the value of your currency is going down the feeling of your own personal value within the economy has gone down all of this plays into this big larger secular thematic that's playing out in front of our eyes and Laura what's what's what's important to talk about it's like listen I don't want chaos in the streets I don't want the dollar to hyper inflate and our currency to become toilet paper like you know I don't want that at all and I guess we're all probably doesn't want either even though it'd be great for a Bitcoin positions as the possibility of that increases as the probability of that increases people want more heads people want more diversity and so this trade can work and it can work in a big way without the world falling apart it just has to feel like the chances of it falling apart are a little higher if the dollar gonna lose it lose its reserve currency status in the next five years most likely and also for me it's not just about the endgame for the dollar it's about you know Bitcoin stands for me stands for a whole bunch of different things and for me it's a call option in the future of the whole financial architecture the whole rise of the digital assets the blockchain tokenization and all this stuff and it is an option on that too so we could be wrong and we don't get to some as Mike saying maybe we don't get to some sort of endgame but we do know that there is a massive progress to this other end game which is going on which is a whole new architecture of how we operate digitally and digital sort of value so Bitcoin is that - and that's what makes incredibly attractive I think two nights ago and I don't fit was public at least I saw the paper it's okay we're gonna go to Japan Hong Kong and Korea and see if we can do an Asian stableboy for trade a crypto you know backed by those four currencies if you're sitting in Stevenage in the seat you gotta start scratching so we got to get the dollar stable clean out there pretty soon before China every goddamn world forever if we're going into a cold world China I wish we weren't it's been seven years my life over there so it's frustrating to see but we are we're going into a cold war Trump killed the h-1b visas yesterday super distinct I think the president's done a long time but it just tells you where that tension is and so right now in the u.s. we've got venmo and a few other cash you know cash happened to the Apple pay and we don't have the crypto alternative yet it's coming Libra is coming soon hopefully by the end of the year that'll be a stable coin I'm guessing they're dollar stable plane becomes the dominant Libra state will point even though they'll have other currencies you can participate in with 2.4 billion users and so the payments game is going to be a monster game and why that's interesting for Bitcoin is the moment you've got a novi wallet you know it used to be called calibra now is called novi there's some room really named it after me the way I like those guys oh you've got your nosey wallet it's really easy to flip between your digital dollar and Bitcoin right that's gonna be part of it and so as we move to digital dollars as everything is in your phone as opposed to you know I was on CNN CNBC yesterday and the guy before me was from some chilies from some change company and as he couldn't set me up better and he was talking about this boy we got we got a shortage of quarters it's because of Cove and they can't print as many clothes and then I was like there's this 20 20 like what are we talking about how much change you have in your pocket first of all it breaks your pocket so much change in their you know China already ninety 90 plus percent is all done digital that's the direction of the future and as the US and Europe Digital eise's their their financial structure our bet is it's going to be a blockchain base that's not 100 percent certainty right you know the centralized apps like been mo are pretty popular their business model doesn't work real well with interest rates at zero but you know listen to you you be arrogant to think it's gotta be and essentially if you've seen you've seen what India did right they rolled out this massive digitization I mean you can go and buy a pint of milk in India with a fingerprint now you don't need a phone you don't need a wallet you don't need anything you don't need money just a fingerprint and you're gonna have all your case kyc and you can have all sorts of stuff problem is it's not decentralized as a number of fragilities potentially with it but the point being is actually the United States and Europe is so far behind where everything you can buy milk with a fingerprint we're a long way behind there so you guys I mean I know you guys could talk all day and yeah I have so many questions about all the things that you guys just talked about but let's start kind of with maybe what is to my mind the biggest question around all this because it's the most global and it really affects the global balance of power but you know I think a lot of people would agree that China wants to make the renminbi more dominant and also reduce the dominance of the US dollar as the global reserve currency and obviously you know as you mentioned they're piloting their own central bank digital currency the dcep they also have this you know vast enterprise blockchain effort that consists of like hundreds of different individual initiatives so I wondered like do you think that they will effectively broke our lay these efforts into leverage to reduce the dominance of the US dollar and if so how would that work they can't do it by trade alone right that the RMB is not a currency yet that everybody wants to use the issue is is the dollar is 25 percent of the world economy yet it's seventy nine and a half percent of all world currency transactions so the dollar is outsized and really what the Chinese and the Bank of England have talked about this and ECB and might was just talked about before people are looking at baskets of digital currencies as trading blocks and there you can have a dollar weighting that's not seventy nine and a half percent but something more reasonable like forty percent it's not the death of the dollar or the abandonment it's something that allows the system to function because it's not enough dollars around as it's just a complicated architecture so I think all of that is coming and I think it's going to move towards a regionalization of currencies and this kind of basket world where you have a much more stable environment where you can Libre was genius because it had dollar the original Libre concept that had dollars yen pounds euros yuan and so therefore it kind of basically moved up and down with global GDP and that's brilliant for well trade so I I think all of this is coming I don't think it's a mass abandonment of the dollar I think it's a de-emphasis but it's interesting you know it's systems change again I go back to that word so how do you get to become the reserve currency it's been 5% year GDP on the military right whoever's got the most powerful Navy in the world has been the reserve currency from a long long period of time we spent 5 and 1/2 percent of GDP on the military the next biggest country it was like 2% and so we in the last ways the u.s. paid to be the reserve currency you get a huge amount of benefits from it you know Trump in this you know kind of post globalization era let's make America great again let's be nationalists let's let's you know turn our back on globalization you can't believe in some ways the other countries to say wait a minute we're letting these guys control the payment system of the world where money gets wired because of the switch system you know it exposes the moment we're not nice actors it exposes just how powerful the reserve currency is and so people don't want anymore hey if we're not gonna overpay for NATO and keep everybody safe with our 5% GDP military but we're gonna look much more hawkish people are gonna be less prone to to want the dollar as their reserve currency and I think China is a real threat and I don't you know I hate thinking it that way because I'm like such a globalist in my core but certainly you know the u.s. is seeing and now both parties which is frustrating but both parties are seeing China more as a threat than an ally yeah and actually just to go back to a comment that Raul made at the very beginning about how he didn't think that China could use trade only to you know to kind of make the RMB more I did wonder though like with all the with a sort of like Belton Road version of these blockchain initiatives that they're doing and you know the fact that they're kind of going into these countries that are developing and have very young populations and that are really going to be the source of global growth probably for the next couple decades like that combination alone I think makes me wonder a little bit especially when you look at how the u.s. is kind of dragging its feet of its own I mean you're dead right the problem is is the u.s. is still the largest economy in the world and it's huge and it has a large share of world's wealth so it doesn't go away dead right all of those countries particularly all the Islamic countries across the Middle East around the Indian Ocean fantastic demographics low debt they're all sort of trade with China there's a new world being built in front of our eyes without question but you can't ignore the US and you can't ignore Europe within that equation and and that's still there and what do you guys think about Christopher John Carlos digital dollar project do you think that that is something the US might actually do and if so do you think that would help the u.s. kind of you know kind of keep up with this competition going on with China even if the US doesn't recognize its own it competition I think you're gonna see one or more dollar based able coins really grow in the next you know six to 24 months you know will the Fed you know the question is does the do the assets get held that you know Bank of New York or do they get held on the Fed balance sheet and that I think is still up for grabs you know right now it's not the Fed balance sheet it's it's you know assets being held at some Bank and so that keeps fractional banking aligned in some weird way if the assets are all held at some balance sheet one for one you know you kind of lose fractional banking so if that has to kind of think about how do I really expand money supply when I want to yeah make changes banking dynamics yeah in his proposal he would keep the the structure that we have now using commercial banks in addition to the central bank in general terms give the central bank the power to be the bank and be able to put money in and out of people's pockets directly it becomes too much of a prize when you mean too much of a prize I don't know what you're saying because for governments the ability to control incentivize penalize people directly by owning the banking system they're a if you're issuing digital currency you don't actually in the middleman the dirty truth is you don't need a bank apart from leverage and a few other bits and pieces now cannot be sold by different layer probably but the fact being if governments are the people who directly pay you take the money away tax you at source all of this that's an incredibly powerful thing once you put that little trophy in front of them they're going to go straight towards it regardless of what we think because that is the new world we're going into it well you look more Chinese system scares the out of me right they've got social responsibility scores based on all kinds of factors they're moving from a digital remedy to a crypto remedy like it's bad enough digital remedy they know what you spend your money on a crypto remedy listen if they don't like you if you're a weaker sympathizer if you're gay and they don't decide to let gays that weak I think it frees your money like because they know who you are because they've already seen what you shopped and they can figure who you are so this combination of machine based learning you know facial recognition and having a having a programmable currency controlled by the state that's not decentralized is one of the scariest you know it makes 1984 look like kids knew yeah yeah so one of the big developments going on is the rise of behavioral economics so yes it's been around for a long time but once you apply big data to barrel economics what you can do and Facebook have been masters on it as have Google is you can influence behavior now what makes it powerful is we've also learned that from the gaming system and again it's behavioral economics is incentive based systems based around some sort of perceived benefit and money being the great driver in humans generally if as long as we don't need food and water if you can if you can attach a token credit system ie digital currency to a behavioral economic system I a reward an incentivization or punishment system then you can control more people and that that is terrifying but that is the world we're going into yeah actually just a few comments I did how Christopher Giancarlo on my show a couple weeks ago to talk about his proposal and he was saying like you know in the u.s. we tend to do public-private partnerships and so he's really envisioning that his digital dollar proposal would be that and I think he and it seems quite allergic to the idea of a central bank currency where it's not his choice because when the market take it it's like man Libre to me now right that was the everyone knew it we was like okay well there we go private currency will exist now and it's not in the you know everything changes once an idea is unleashed you know satoshis idea has grown into this huge ecosystem and if you're thinking of trying to launch a additional central bank currency and assume that it's gonna be a nice fluffy thing that everybody thinks are that isn't that lovely we just say it's never gonna happen because the behavioral incentives are aligned for governments to use it much like the data that's within Google and Apple gets used by governments because they want that data the state and Alibaba have a very good relationship because they need that collection of data you know then it's not good at they're not going to take every single financial transaction goes through the same Clearing House every single penny spank goes to it not in government Clearing House that they they could hook their AI engines to and figure out who's who I just think I just think the u.s. is fundamentally very very different from a place like China so I don't know if our government is gonna go in the same direction that it's just look at look at the way we're dealing with code we like our freedom I wear no mask well my opinion on that is that we're just somehow we put lettuce eyes science and that's really frustrating and so we did mention Libre briefly but I did want to ask just about that a little bit more because the u.s. is dragging its feet on a digital dollar and China is really coming out of the gate with this I mean you know levers coined a lot of just I would say regulatory difficulties yet despite that do you feel like this is sort of the best bet as a counterweight to to the dcep being sort of the first mover you know I think libras very sore I'm thinking about their very aggressively hoping to launch and they're persistent and I think they're gonna try to launch and I think they will launch I think you know Congress the US public has a big skepticism around Mark Zuckerberg and you know if Libra was not a facebook project I think it had looks better a chance of success that said I'm not gonna short him because he's you know you look at Facebook and stock trades on the highs it makes Fortune anything he does that they do seems to work and they have 2.3 million customers I do think if you think of Libra they're gonna do the Euro Libra and all these different libras I think offshore the dominant Libra will be the dollar labor it in the same way you know if you're in Venice whether you want $100 bills you'll take a big point cause you can't get the hundred other bills you'll take the dollar Libra if you can get it and so I think it probably has the most chance of success just because it's got the customers to start and they can do things on scale and all these other places it's harder like the how do you get people from Fiat into currency into digital the first time so those ramps are the hardest thing to figure out how to do and you know they've got an army of people that can work on that and they're in whatsapp which is gigantic so you know the ability to just instantly transfer payments around using whatsapp is is the killer app them and they've never monetized whatsapp they paid 19 billion dollars for what 24 people or however many was 19 it's crazy but in the end the killer app is coming and they know exactly what it is it's going to be being a global payments platform yes so let's now just talk a little bit more about the election because we touched on that earlier and it's sort of my kind of you know was talking about the different parties and stuff like that but I just wondered like if a Democratic president or Congress comes in how do you think that will affect Bitcoin I feel like the Democrats have sort of broadly been more skeptical of cryptocurrencies and I wonder if a blue wave would kind of hurt the industry in any way or what you guys thought personally I don't think it hurts the industry I think as novo said is they're going to spend money yeah we look at it with those simple macro guys here to vote we keep telling you the same thing is there going to put more money and they're going to spend more money and that's only good for Bitcoin and I don't see a world that that doesn't happen yet sure three four years out maybe things change maybe there's some austerity but you know we're looking at that window between here and there is I don't see that and I don't see that they're not going to change the regulation that exists now so we could all buy it and trade it so what's the risk I also think right now bitcoins biggest competitor isn't gold it's it's Nasdaq or story stocks it's what's you know it's beyond meat it's Tesla it's the you know you're making a whole lot of money buying Tesla's going up even though it trades that some spectacular multiple you know it's a lot like a crypto it's a story that people can buy into it's a store a value because people say it's worth something I think if Biden gets elected he's gonna take the capital gains tax right up to where the income taxes also you're gonna take capital gains from 15 to 40 and the stock market's gonna choke on that and you're gonna see a major sell-off in stocks if the Democrats win that I think perversely it might hit crypto for a little bit just the correlations but then all of a sudden people say now I can't buy stocks but I can still buy pick because bitcoins not gonna get taxed like that well it'll get taxed like that and also of those same story stocks are likely to get regulated yes so they're in the risk that Facebook I think Google gets broken apart I think Facebook if they get Lieber off the ground there's almost zero chance they can stay together as one company you can't have all the world's data and the world's currency and the lodging messaging application in the world impossible so they're gonna get broken up yeah and so in that case and I love that I hadn't thought about it before in the world of story stocks because when you're bringing people into markets that weren't traditionally involved the story is the driver and Bitcoin has a really great story and I understand that Esther had a great story but it got kind of crazy and they're all gonna get regulated so Laura I was on stage and right before this all things started and I was on with the guy mohammed el shiet who owns seventy brands like every major western brand that's sold in the Mideast he he owns richest man in Kuwait and you know they put me on state to talk about brands like what the hell do I know about brands and I sat there trying to think quick on my feet and I was like aha Bitcoin might be the single greatest brand created in the last ten years there is no other brand that came out of nowhere that creates a high ninety million dollars it's known globally in every country in every village someone talks about Bitcoin it's got a hundred ninety billion dollar market cap and I hope soon two hundred million and higher and so it's interesting what I was thinking what a powerful brand that's been created that's a great observation I think you know yeah is a brand I mean everybody knows it they kind of know what it stands for now they don't fully understand it but you don't understand how your Apple phone works so what do you care the point being is it stands for something and great brands stand for something that you believe in when it breaks 10,000 by giving diamond shape in the Bitcoin here so yeah I actually also feel like the Bitcoin story is sort of perfect for the moment in terms of you know all these populist uprisings that we're seeing and this movement frankly also against big tech but I I just love you guys because he went right for what my next question was which was you know if a Democratic president would try to break up big tech but so in that vein as you know there are a lot of people in Silicon Valley a lot of these VCS who say that web 3 is the antidote - how big tech is so dominant so do you feel like if that happens that if the dams do break up big tech that we will also see yeah I mean we see it we're seeing it and never know this as well people had brave browser we've seen that block one and launching voice you know all of this social stuff the whole economic to this way world are going to shift right the economic power is all with Google right now and the economic power is going to go back to the individual that is their rebellion that's going on everywhere so you will charge for your time and your attention span as opposed to you getting a product for free and then monetizing your attention span so I think that whole entire shift is coming and it that's going to be driven by blockchain technology for sure so I think there's a whole disruption to Silicon Valley that has to happen we need to own our security I cannot trust we talked about it before I don't want to trust Google with my security has anybody asked you how did Google keep their stuff secure there's the largest repository of privately stored information on earth and not one person asked where the service kept what is their security protocols I want my data and I want it on a secure blockchain so Laura I think listen I you know part of the reason I got into crypto first it was speculative and then I you know my college roommate Joe Lubin is a real firm religious zealot around web 3 and how the you know the etherium block shade or any block shake and kind of fundamentally change how we structure businesses and our data and everything else I still think web 3 is coming I think the gap between where we are and where we need to be on the technology is wider than people want it to be and so it's not happen in the next year or two or three but I think in the next three to ten years you're gonna see more and more of this the architecture being robust enough to have to take a real shot at things and listen it will be a wrestling match you know low Bitcoin disrupt gold I think so or at least a radical will it disrupt the dollar we'll see will the voice you know block one's new social experiment take out Twitter not a high probability but it might right these big these big tech companies are smart and they're fast and they're well well-funded and they all have a blockchain you know the defense angle you know they'll blockchain a little bit and so it'll be a fascinating space to watch I think the move of where people what people want and where history is going is exactly what role said and so but I think that that that fight over what gets disrupted and what doesn't gets disrupted will really be a lot of fun to watch it'll be profitable they'll be a great money-making opportunities both of a long and short side I mean yeah what's going on in defy right now you know which is a little bit of a mini mini bubble that's really the first it's really the first thing that's worked on theory really and so now we've gone from a 500 billion dollar a 500 million dollar ecosystem to a couple you know billion a half dollar ecosystem in five days you know well I wanted to ask a little bit more about a theorem because I wondered if you know aetherium 2.0 would get more interest from you know more traditional financial people like you guys because it will sort of become more like a yield bearing asset you know each of these things have a story right so Bitcoin has this story digital gold the theorem is trying to become the decentralized platform for defy for stable coins and for lots of things I would value it more like I'd value Facebook right as the as the social network of aetherium grows as there are more programmers or programmers as there are more businesses on it as some more people using it I think the value would grow right now that community is buying expected of Lee in the same way you know the clink media buys it it's a smaller community it doesn't have the institutional framework yet you might have a few speculators that will participate but when I think of Bitcoin I can think of 20 billionaire's that made their fortunes outside of Bitcoin that are big advocates I was on a call with Bill Miller earlier right one of the great financial and Esther's of all time Bitcoin guy Abby Johnson Bitcoin guy the etherium committee doesn't have those Outsiders they have the Joe Lubin's the italics plenty of stupidly smart guys that are unbelievably passionate about what they're doing and so it's a different uterus even ripple it's got its community right they're trying to become the the cross cross-border payments remittance shop and they've got the ripple army out in Asia and they've got a community that people continue to buy it and so smaller community than Bitcoin and so it's not that there could only be one of these coins I think the other coins have to really have a purpose for that community and they've got to grow that community and and it could start speculative but in the long run it's got to be used but I'm really asking about stinking in particular JIT like do you think that that will become a thing that financial institutions will be interested in doing in time yes I think you're gonna see it first in Bitcoin with you know getting people to invest in mining pools right getting getting return on your Bitcoin by taking some of your Bitcoin and putting in a mining pool so maybe if you have ten dollars you're gonna put seven in Bitcoin and three in Bitcoin mining and I think you'll see it there I think you're certainly seeing it already in aetherium and it's a good model I just don't think the institutions are gonna be there this year I think when you're dealing with something as complicated as a theory and Bitcoin and all its potential possibilities and futures and what you can do on it as much as it's the most important thing to understand is the story and there's a simple story Bitcoin is kind of the trusted kind of reserve currency and aetherium is a platform from with with which to construct a new world and if you think of it in those terms it's like gold and silver silver is sort of a precious metal but it's really an industrial metal - Bitcoin is the precious metal aetherium is the hybrid model so I they both have a place and I think many of the other ecosystems have a place to they will find their niches and their communities and the whole thing will just grow from that much like you know there's a java world Mizzou Linux and there's all these other programming languages all of this exists and they all talk to each other and I think that's fine you know it's like you know we've got all the different email protocols and they all work you know I can use my Apple email and somebody you can use Gmail and somebody else can use Outlook well so actually Mike mention the defy trend and I just wanted to ask have you guys been watching this yield farming thing going on do you think that's sustainable in the long run yes I mean the point being is we know right you see these outsized returns right they don't exist in the world right there's no such thing as a super normal return that lasts for long so you see this hundred percent a year returns that people are talking about what he and I will know is that well you just haven't seen the defaults yet you don't know what the over cycle actual yield you get my guess is it's probably good maybe you get 15 20 percent yields because not many people are in it but it's not the hundred percent they're talking about but we need to see all the things that go wrong so you can see over the cycle so if people are building that in as an expectation they're all going to lose a lot of money if you don't and you just think okay fine I don't know what it's gonna be cuz you know the day you go and buy you know a hundred junk bonds they're all paying and you've got a hundred percent you know some imputed return the reality isn't doesn't work that way some don't pay so we've got the same thing to come you know one of these you know stable coins won't hold value or whatever it may be whatever mechanism it is but that's okay but it's really exciting to see that stuff like this is coming yeah all right well I appreciate that you guys went over but I just want to ask one last piece because I mentioned it right at the beginning so amidst everything that we've discussed we also had this recent Bitcoin having and traditionally that has driven a boom in the price in the year or like roughly eighteen months after having but because this isn't really a normal time I just sort of wondered how you expected that having to be effect or how you expected it to effect Bitcoin amidst everything else so I think it's just again both of us are storytellers you you got to storytellers on the same podcast when I think of the Bitcoin story the having is like a giant exclamation mark this year like okay the central banks are doing quantitative easing and oh the senator Bank of Bitcoin or quantitative tightening right we just cut the supply the new supply in half and we'll do it again in four more years and so it's such a symbolically cool time for it to happen it's a little bit like you know they've got central banks and I think that you know to me that was much more important than the technicals it's the lovely thing of saying quantitative easing versus quantitative tightening by algorithm you know it's just it's just it's a great story whether it at the margin makes all the difference or not who the hell knows I'm not smart enough to figure it all out what I do know is it probably works whether that's because of the story and the human behavior or the reality of the less supply and an increased amount alright great well this has been so fun chatting with you guys I'm so glad we were able to make this happen where can people learn more about each of you and your work well we have a website for galaxy you know galaxy digital comm or does not work I'm not sure I think it's done and you can find me real vision comm or find me on Twitter at rel RA o UL GMI oh yeah I'm on Twitter a lot so I have no regrets great and I will put the real link to galaxy digital in
