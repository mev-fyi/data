welcome to forbs podcasts hi everyone welcome to Unchained a forbs podcast produced by fractal recording I'm your host Lauren a Forbes contributor covering blockchain cryptocurrencies and FinTech thanks for tuning in for today's episode I'm speaking with Michael Casey a senior adviser of the digital currency initiative at MIT Media Lab a position he began in July 2015 after spending 18 years at The Wall Street Journal where he covered global financial and economic affairs he's also written three books including the age of cryptocurrency which he co-authored with Wall Street Journal colleague Paul Vania hi Michael welcome to the show hi Laura thanks for having me your focus at MIT is to incubate projects that use blockchain technology in social impact projects in the developing world tell us what exactly that means and what you're working on ok great so it just it stems from the idea that there really is we think great potential for this technology to resolve some of the the needs the the failings if you like for you know the governance of the financial system and the governance of our economy in in places like the developing world and it speaks specifically to the problem of financial inclusion but but it could could also you know deal with other aspects in which people are excluded from participating in a broader way in in the global economy and in global society and and whether or not by deploying technologies that allow them to prove who they are prove their assets gain access to services that wouldn't otherwise be there whether or not we can we can sort of expand that that sort of playing field if you like bring bring more people into the global economy so it deals with that and we are focused on a number of different regions of the world and a whole range of different use cases we're working with in a very early way with the government of Mexico to try to figure out ways in which we could expand financial inclusion with this technology we're focusing on things like solar energy and the deployment of decentralized micro grids in developing world and figuring out ways in which we might be able to use the blockchain to bring high-level financing to to that kind of roll out in what are otherwise you know the remote and and off-grid places and you know just just generally we're looking quite extensively at the issue of identity and the construction of you know personal data stores that can be used in a way to to affirm credit scores or affirm people's you know reputations and and how they may or may not reside in a blockchain environment and be able to you know establish concepts like digital identities or at least open the door to services that are being denied them so it's a fairly broad range and and you know this we're still in the process of figuring out pilots and in special places but we've got you know you know potential locations to get going in Africa and as I mentioned Mexico so yeah we're kind of moving into the deployment phase now and it's it's all very exciting and when you talk about using blockchain technology to solve or foster Financial Inclusion what does that look like in a world where you have more Financial Inclusion that's powered by blockchain technology for someone kind of on the ground what what is their day-to-day look like right so I think we can define this in a kind of a generic broad sense right I mean I think what it comes down to is the fact that in under the current environment with the you know what we might call the centralized trust model it's really difficult for people to prove their assets and I use assets and very broad sense here it might mean their property it might mean you know some other like mobile asset but it can also mean the personal asset the data your reputation who you are and so without that people have not been able to to gain access to all the kind of broad array of financial services that we take for granted in places where there is a more reliable registry and record-keeping and reputation system for proving these things so we're talking not just about whether or not I do or don't have a bank account but also whether or not I can you know take my property my home and find a way to to get a mortgage on that or we might be talking about warehouse receipts in in places where farmers can you know deliver their corn to a warehouse gain a receipt but the banks don't trust whether or not that receipt has been duplicated so they can't get a letter of credit and the classic piece of you know kind of working capital finance that small and medium enterprises would get in this in this environment but it also is is this notion of being excluded because you know I've got no way to prove that I'm actually a really good credit that I that I actually you know pay my bills on time that I have a job that I go you know because because without a formal record-keeping system for the payments that people make or the you know their employment history and so forth there's just no way to create that kind of bundle of Records you can get attestations from somebody but can we trust them and so yeah the idea that we might be able to take the data that gets accumulated on mobile phones to do with people's day-to-day activities as well as their payment histories and so forth and develop a profile around that and then potentially place that into a provably approvable environment that doesn't require some form of formal registry could could also help to open personal access to credit it's a sort of another question beyond beyond the idea of a mortgage this is actually about whether an I myself can in getting credit so I think it covers award bra array of concepts but it just generally speaks to this idea that you know not just in the developing world by the way there's lots of folks you know who are underbanked or have have no capacity to participate fully in the financial system in the developed world as well so this way of kind of establishing credit through your personal data and I understand that details of how these systems work may not have been figured out but is the idea that as you transact and pay people for services or you know pay bills on time or you know deliver goods that you say you're going to deliver that all of this is somehow collected via your phone and then that establishes your you know so-called credit or reputation or whatever I really don't think we need to be so kind of limiting in the way we define this yes the clearly the mobile phone you know and and potentially you know even the even richer data that's going to come from affordable smartphones in the future you know is a very very important tool in this process and there's a lot of work being done on how phones can be you know important vehicles for this process of data accumulation and and just as an aside you know much of the important work that's being done in that space is all about how do we gather that information and protect it so that so that on the one hand we deal with this privacy issue that is obviously so so such a great concern and specifically in the developed world about all the data that companies are accumulating on us but on the other recognized that there's also this data deficiency that that these people have and so they want the data to be accumulated about them but how do we do that in a way that restores power that gives them control and there's a lot of work to be done but but you know there's a view that the blockchain could be quite useful in this construct and so that's that's just one thing to think about but I don't think it's just about phones right you know there's there's really interesting ideas being developed around web of trust so you know and again that might be something that exists in a digital environment but it might mean that you also bring in attestations about a person from the kind of people that you that you deal with might be an NGO that you visit on a regular basis or a clinic and somehow if we can incorporate the data from all of that activity and and recognize that some of that data is going to require an external human input but at least it's coming from an entity that we trust in some way and incorporate that into this sort of if you like bundle of information about it about the person all of that's pretty valuable as well and I think you know the thing is how do we actually with the you know impressive big data and data management systems that are being developed create these bundles in in meaningful ways that allow people to to kind of really take advantage of of the opportunities that exist and and and give some trusted relevance to to who they are and what are the advantages of blockchain technology in this application over existing systems you know obviously like in the u.s. we have you know a fully functioning credit system but you know what is it about using this in these developing countries that that makes it a better option right so I mean it comes back to this question about whether we trust the entity that's managing the data and it doesn't necessarily mean that we there's anything untoward about it but it's but it's really the the idea that without the kind of infrastructure and and and much of that really sometimes comes down the rule of law right if there's if there's a at the end of the day we need to better prove to some judge that whatever has been said about us is is accurate and you know if there's some break in it you know there's this is this is whole there were these layers of fiduciary duty that I just taken for granted as we enter we get a credit score from Experian or somebody that that experien is doing this in a you know in a legitimate way and it is following some sort of set of procedures and the like and if it weren't that it could be sued and so forth right so it comes down to this notion of rule of law if there's no rule of law then you really have a trouble have a lot of trouble in building all of those systems so that's that's one aspect of it but it's it's not even to say that even in the developed world these systems necessarily you know as you put it fully functioning we have all sorts of inconsistencies and you know obviously data theft and and everything else that is you know calls into question all the time the reliability of the information that it's accumulated about us or that we accumulate so it's it's about you know being able to create some sort of infrastructure and I'm sorry to be vague because it's it's it's there's so much work that still needs to be done on how this infrastructure works but at the end of the day the notion that we could create with the aid of encryption tools you know data repositories about ourselves that can reside in an environment that no one can tamper with viet myself or you know another party is a powerful concept because it means that I can now port that somewhere else it becomes you know something that I can point to externally from it from a particular server and everybody can recognize that that pool of data you know has integrity because it hasn't been changed now we need to again assume that the input of that data whether it's from a smartphone or from an individual is something we can trust but those are issues that are separate from this it's about the idea that the data retains its integrity if it resides in this block John and I think that allows this sense of portability this idea that I can carry this thing somewhere else and one could imagine that the same you know reputation token if we want to call it that that a person in a developing country could could build around themselves in this blockchain could work in that developed with those developing countries financial institutions but it might also if they happen to go and move to some other place work just as well there because it's it's based on an infrastructure that's not dependent on you know the location and and and the particular situations you're dealing with so there's this portability interoperability and permanence and trust that I think is is really just intensified when you have a dissent decentralized distributed and robust system that the blockchain potentially provides so at this early stage in the technology when there aren't established processes or standards for implementing or using blockchain how do you decide which projects make the best bets well actually on that question in particular the you know the infrastructure I think we need to be pretty agnostic around which block chains to use which structures I think we need to be dealing in test net environments we need to build modular and flexible systems that you know it could could exist either in a private blockchain or you know which is I think is most of our preferences into a fully decentralized public blockchain you know is that going to be a theorem is it going to be a Bitcoin all those questions you know I think are to be resolved and so the the testing around that part of it I think needs to be done in a way that is is that a layer slightly above the protocol it's not to say that there's an enormous amount of research that institutions like ours and others have to be doing in fact it's probably the most important work that needs to be done right now on developing developing that face layer protocol and making sure that they are robust and the smart contracts work and so forth but the other question I think other aspect of what you're saying I think is like where do we take do these pilots and what are the what are the places and I think it's it's an interesting question because we need to on the one hand you know deploy in any pilot needs to be done in it in a sort of contained environment and so you know it's useful to think about places that have something of a functioning infrastructure already since you know it means there are fewer variables that can go wrong to distort the data that you're developing from your testing and therefore you can you know locate and isolate the study that you're doing to it so it's smaller set so that sometimes means you know self-contained relatively well governed places and you know with minimal you know bureaucratic interference but there's this other aspect of it like you know that well if you go into a well-functioning in a middle level country to do your research are you really proving this in the right setting I think generally the the thesis is that that that's the way to go that you test something in a stable setting and then you take it to a more difficult place in the field but the thing that's interesting about a lot of the questions we're pursuing is that I I'm not so sure that there is a universality to the experience that comes from the blockchain because what it's trying to solve is a unique set of social problems it's not really just fixing some technical issue it's all about how do we in beaut rust into the system and since you have great cultural variety and you have great kind of experiential variety across the world what works in one place just might not be relevant somewhere else so you know it may be that we're gonna be to be doing pilots and tests all constantly because we're literally having to define and and deploy applications of the technology you know in different constructs and different places to suit them so yeah you know I I do think there's there's great value in trying to find ways to access some of the most problematic places in some way whether or not it's it's like finding a little village that sits within that area and seeing seeing if we can test it there or whether or not it's literally going out at a bigger scale because only then will we truly know if if we're really changing the way that people act and behave as a result of this technology so you know it's a bit of a mixed answer I know that that you know there's different ways to approach it but I think at the end of the day you know clearly there has to be a process of testing small and making and moving out to something big but you know where and how we do it's going to be based on I think you know on a case-by-case basis to be honest yeah I think a great example of what you're talking about there is there was a project that a company called factum brokered with the Honduran government to pilot a land titling system on blockchain that initially generated a lot of fanfare but I think it's since stalled and then a few months ago the bitfury group announced that they were going to pilot a blockchain land titling system in Georgia where a country that already has actually quite a good land titling system and I you know wrote about what you know there are plans and they said you know exactly what you're saying that choosing an environment that doesn't have other problems allows you to then just focus on the technology but of course you know as you mentioned then it does raise the question of well then will it really truly show what the impact is but it does sound like you know MIT I guess has come up with its own well we're very much at the early phase of working these things out we have a lot of interest from a lot of people to do all sorts of pilots and all sorts of places and we're fairly you know cautious in where we do or don't move forward you know it's also a function of what students are most interested in because this is the difference between what we do and say somebody that's like a team of employees as is really know uniquely research-based with a lot of student input and so we need to find you know students who are passionate about things and my job is partly to kind of you know put out there what's possible to you know work out arrangements that work but I don't have the liberty of you know just having us a bunch of staff members that I can order around I'm gonna need students passion and sometimes the passion lies in in a place that's kind of difficult but you know that might be the way to go yeah it's it's one of those interesting aspects of what we do what is really great about MIT is that it's it's very you know rich in resources and it has a very well-established presence around the world already we do have you know institutions right across India for example and and and in other parts of Asia and Africa that are you know beachheads already and have relationships with with you know different parts of MIT there's a whole host of different labs and different institutions that are focusing on development projects all around the world and so that allows us I think to go into some of these more difficult places because you know we've got that history and those relationships and a fuller understanding of what we're up against and so you know that that that's the kind of counterpoint if you like to the the problematic aspect of having such a variety of potential interests and opportunities is that you know you know there is a there's kind of a well-established platform to come in on your albeit that that we're dealing with some very big unsolved questions so let's switch attacks a little bit you spent much of your early career reporting from places like Argentina and Indonesia I actually also lived in Indonesia around the same time as you did and so I'm very familiar with how difficult it was to use anything but cash back then we were you there in the heart of the crisis and yeah 87 so you remember what we're going into banks and seeing those huge piles of cash on that people would just wield them around on chairs that's like and massive bags filled with cash because the currency had collapsed yes yeah it's quite an experience yeah yeah and I was actually being paid in US dollars so all of a sudden I just remember that for me it was like whoa like I can buy five times as many things as I could when I got here but it was also you know a scary time but you know and and so like I having lived through that saw kind of the impact on Indonesians you know how the fact that their currency was constantly fluctuating affected them but I want to hear a little bit more about how your experiences living and working in countries with less than stable currencies led you to where you are today yeah that's one of my pet topics and not just you know it really if I I think it's very beautiful for everybody to have some narrative about how they arrived at with it where they are why they do what they do and I think all of us have some story and for me the kind of things you just described in Indonesia which which I did experience to to some extent from a different perspective but certainly I saw a lot of suffering but in addition to that Argentina which is a unique experience in itself absolutely shaped my interest in this technology the kind of reporting I was doing and now my belief in in where it can be most effectively applied in fact in our book we lift a lot of material from my experiences in Argentina to try to grapple with this core problem of trust and so you know I look at look at eyes and Tina and think you know it's a country that and I have a love-hate relationship with it I listen something I might make clear in the book because and that love-hate relationship is actually quite telling to the point because in places that have a failed kind of civil civic trust model where there's not good institutions by which society can build systems of trust in each other with strangers what you get instead is he's a real concentration of trust amongst those who are closest to you so you end up with very close friends and very close family and and as I say to people um of the people I love most in the world are my eyes and time friends because I rely they rely on each other I think it's a function of what happens when you have you know a breakdown of these systems so I have a love-hate I love the people but I hated the challenges of getting money in and out of the country of the kind of random way in which you know these crises just come and go and the sort of the sheer inability to rely on some sort of consistent sense of law because what happens when your currency keeps rising and falling and fluctuating and the government is trying to shut one hole and open it up another one and is that the law keeps changing and the changing laws is is extremely difficult to deal with and it's just Bri needs you know corruption and crime and everyone else because everyone's desperately trying to get around it so you know I had that experience specifically and trying to get money out a large amount of money and I tell the story of that in the book because it's it's it's harrowing and you know this is the defining feature for a lot of Argentines and it's absolutely no surprise whatsoever to me that one of the places that Bitcoin has found significantly more traction anywhere else is Argentina because it speaks precisely to this problem so I've you know I've often thought about that and my wife is an anthropologist and she worked with the the Bolivian community in Buenos Aires and she was very interested in how they came to form their sense of identity and that she found that that it was interesting how the sense of kind of Bolivian ethnic pride in what Osiris was tied directly to a place a single street within the you know the kind of slums of that area in which the some woman 2505 years earlier had fought tooth and nail to get property rights recognized across that street and so this street became the center of cultural life for Bolivia it became the place where the schools are kinda says where the businesses are everything because all of a sudden you could establish who you are and what you do because you could actually claim your title registries status there and not in the rest of the surrounding region in which most of the community lived so I was very interested in this issue of property title for some time and it led me to an under the shelter who I got to know and work with in a number of books and things and you know he's I know you know and I know as well or and he's like it's a you know he's become a key player in a lot of these ideas I personally reached out to him and and you know got him to take an interest in the blockchain and now you know it's been a defining aspect of what I wanted to do so you know that that series of experiences was absolutely fundamental so you know when I was first writing about Bitcoin and writing about about the book it just the lightbulb went off in my head you know to two years or so ago that wow this this actually could tackle the property problem that I was so obsessed with when I was living in Latin America and and since that yeah there's there's the bitfury project in Georgia there's which Hernando was involved in and there's there was there Anderson people talked about it all the time so it's become you know an integral part of my own journey and and I'm really happy that I now get a chance to actually you know work on underlip potentially delivering on some of these solutions are not just just writing about it as much as I you know always love them we'll continue to enjoy the process of writing and reporting I loved hearing about that light bulb moment and I want to hear more about what you how you first learned about cryptocurrency and blockchain and then you know what other light bulbs it set off for you yeah right so um I probably do what most lots of journals do did sort of when they discovered Bitcoin I just went what are you talking about this is crazy I was a currency reporter you know it's been a lot of time writing about currencies the isin time paper being one of them you know and so I came a Bitcoin from a currency perspective and a market perspective I looked at this price of this thing that was soaring and just thought wow that's a tulip bubble these are these are crazy people they've got no sense there's no value to this thing on earth would you want it how do you how could you possibly have a currency that's backed by a bunch of computers doing this strange mining thing what's a lot about so I write a column about it I'd dug a little bit more and I think my column wasn't as bad as it could have been and you know I realized that there was some work proof-of-work process that was relevant but it still made very little sense to me and what year was that that was that was actually fairly light in the processes in 2013 so my um you know my discovery process is relatively quick by Bitcoin standards and you know once I wrote it I was invited out for dinner by some folks specifically Jeremy olia from circle and a bunch of other Barry Silbert was there and some others along with some other journalists and to just like talk through what really was going on and that was absolutely illuminating and enlightening III started to see that this was a much something much bigger than a digital currency the digital currency represented something far more profound than the digitization of money that had everything to do with how we could construct a process of trust in a decentralized manner and and why that was important so I actually think I came to a realization about what money actually is at that point you know that I hadn't fully understood and and and from there I just didn't look back I I wanted to write about it all the time I went off to different conferences and and everything else so you know I actually thank Jeremy Elia quite a lot for that it was a very formative experience for me I I'm so curious about this statement that you realized what money is for the first time because I you know as a business journalist you covered for an exchange fixing them global financial and economic issues what was it that you suddenly realized in it and why do you think that you haven't realized it given all your years of experience covering you know the financial affairs I think Milton Friedman once said something like you know if we all thought too much about what money actually is it wouldn't work and and I think that's one of the reasons why anybody where there's journalists bankers I mean everybody doesn't fully get it I don't say I get it now but I think I have much more profound understanding it's it's an incredibly deep idea money is not the point is this and this is this is the thing that I realized I think we tend to somehow think of the money as a thing which is fully irrational but we do we think money is this this piece of paper now in our wallet and then we somehow abstract from that and say oh when it's sitting in a bank somewhere of course we hear about fractional reserve banking but we think wherever it's still it's it's it's something to do with this piece of paper and that's the problem if I can you know the bank has a has a store of it and they share it with me and it all comes down to who's backing with this piece of paper and you know and then and then you'll get a lot of and then you you obviously hear a lot from from the gold bugs about how this is actually all wrong because we need to have a thing we need to have gold behind it because that's the only way it could be anything it was actually backed by something that's gold and you know there's there's there's some truth to this as intrusive as this idea that we need we obviously need scarcity you know an outcome in our currency but I didn't I you know it wasn't until I started to think hard about the ledger and the notion about how the actually money itself is a system it's a social system for how we keep track of our debits to each other so if you go right back to the early days of of currencies as they emerged it was you know gift exchanges and how the various debts that would just accumulate by virtue of the guy that killed the you know the the beast that shared it with somebody else who was able to share something else and this is there's a series of social debts and obligations that emerged and in a more complex society became we had to find a way to actually clear all of those debts and that's that's really the way think about it I think we think you're bartering as being you know as part of that process but there's some sort of flaw in that logic it's it's actually more to do with this kind of big broad ledger that exists in our minds and is everywhere else and it's it's it's it goes to the heart of what human exchange it is human value all these things get caught up in this and there's culture and community and everything else and so you know the more complex societies became we needed to figure out more and more complex ways to manage and clear those debts and we've settled on banks acting as our intermediaries and building fractional reserve systems and and everything that goes right back to the Medici and that's the system we have until today so to think about Bitcoin as a solution to that became really interesting it was like wow this is so we actually can deal with this social ledger this broad-based notion of how we exchange our collective debts to each other and understand all those transfers in a decentralized way so you know is it's kind of important to come to terms of that before you can confront something as as foreign and strange as Bitcoin but I do think that you know whether by design or not the the kind of collective ignorance about what it actually is has been somewhat useful it's obviously been pretty powerful to people to be able to to dupe others and and build these these models that I think you've been pretty destructive over the centuries but at the same time you know living the myth the kind of collective myth that this this piece of paper somehow has value is a critical part of its function I mean there is no inherent value in a piece of paper but there is great value in the collective understanding that once we transfer that piece of paper to each other we've all kind of collectively knows that a debt has passed from me to you that's what's powerful about it and and if you think too much about it is Milton Friedman said maybe it won't work anyway that's just doesn't that answers your question specifically but it's it's certainly a fun one to contemplate and one that we did go to some lengths to discuss in our book what I will show it through one rebek recommendation as Felix Martin's book on money I think it's called an unauthorized biography it's brilliant for this it really really lays it all out fabulous it was pretty useful volume to use and then when you're writing a book well speaking of books I actually also wanted to ask you about your thesis in the unfair trade I did not get a chance to read it but you know I did some searching it on online to see what it was about and it talked about and correct me if I'm wrong about how unbalanced government policies around the world have created perverse incentives that undermine the proper functioning of the global market if you look so I'm so curious you know if this is the view that you take when you look at blockchain or crypto currencies do you believe that they could offer a into those types of problems and if so how yes I do you know it takes it to a much higher level than where any in any position right now to to contemplate seeing implemented but yeah if we imagine a world that had if not a single unique decentralized digital currency as the reserve base or it had a whole host of much more flexibly traded and non manipulatable domestic currencies or currencies that represented different corporates interests or you know human currencies if if out we could either go to a world where bitcoin is the world's reserve currency and therefore you know except over there or we can go to a complete opposite where there's just so many different digital currencies that that we did ceases to be any one that dominates anymore all of that would make for a very different world I basically and it's a key thesis in the unfair trade I basically believe that the the rest of the world is basically given a pretty bad run by the dominance of the dollar and I think in a long run it doesn't help the United States either basically there is no such thing as independent monetary policy outside of almost anywhere to be honest I I think that you know obviously the European Central Bank and and you know the Bank of England and certainly you know - up until now at least the People's Bank of China are able to you know manage their monetary affairs with some level of independence but at the end of the day if you know 70% of the world's reserve held in dollars and if 90% of you know any significant trade has to be triangulated through dollars whatever happens that whatever the Fed does or doesn't do is going to be such an overwhelming determinant of what happens to your own money to circumstances that it becomes sort of certainly a less than complete set of tools and once you move into emerging markets it's you know it's kind of pointless sometimes right I mean what hope does a tiny you know a little country in Latin America or Africa have or even a middle-sized country in those countries have at a time like now when the Fed is just you know and the ECB at the same time flooding enormous amounts of cheap money the Bank of Japan as well into the world you don't really have a monetary policy you know you you can if the Fed were to actually raise rates by you know something like it used to in the past the 50 basis points or a full sentence in sports the damage in emerging markets would be absolutely an awfully profound I mean it would just be just destructive beyond belief so they can't in a way although they do the fact is the Fed thinks about the world from us macro policy imperatives because that's what it's imperative is it doesn't have any responsibility for the rest of the world and yet it will do things and can do things that can be incredibly damaging to elsewhere and it's not to say there's anything malicious about that it's just the structure of the world we have so I often wonder whether or not you know we should be talking to the developing countries and saying hey just just forget about Meineke policy right use Bitcoin or peg your currency in some sophisticated way to to something else and just just just forget about your capacity to control it and and instead you know manage all of your economic risks with fiscal policy focus on you know counter cyclical measures about where the taxes shouldn't shouldn't be and there's some really interesting things being done by the way by the roll in the mouths of you and I met recently Laura when we were you know likely over at Necker Island and you know and how you could actually use micro taxes on monetary payments and the like and to develop pools of revenue for these people you know what if that just became your tool for managing policy and you said so I'm just gonna take Bitcoin awesome it takes something else as out as our base here she's not going to worry about owning a my own currency it's a kind of a kind of an artifact of these independence notions that you have to have your own national currency to mean anything why do you think that's incredibly dangerous they could have in this world so you know if I start to think about you know a broad future in which the volatility and the in you know the imbalances that I highlighted in the trade could be mitigated significantly I think it very much would involve some sort of infrastructure along the lines of this digital currency world that Bitcoin is introduced to us well this is just such an interesting vision that you're painting here so if we were to kind of follow your line of thinking what do you think will eventually happen or or could eventually happen in terms of crypto currencies being used to solve some of these issues well one thing I've learned from being at MIT Media Lab is that you know the way to view the world is to recognize the complexity and uncertainties and unpredictability to a degree of how this incredibly diverse interconnected concept of what you know our global economy actually is functions and so on that basis it's hard to predict and I don't think a little dangerous to be to be predictive and so I like to kind of talk a little bit about what ifs and you know scenarios that might play out rather than then prediction and I think there's some value in that and so I I think that I is on the countries that have the most important status and the most to lose or gain in changing policies and changing the kind of structure of the global economic system and what they might do so inevitably you've got to look at China and you have to think about what China's interest is geopolitical economically and where it might think differently about a world that that would have a different base for its financial system so China's not very open about what it does or does want to do with policy going forward and so there's a lot of you know Tea Leaf reading that needs to go on but I do think that they do want a world in which the dollar is not the world's reserve currency and they'd love it if they're exporters could clear directly with whoever they are whoever they're importers are whoever their customers are in other parts of the world without having to triangulate their trade through through New York or through you know JP Morgan for some some US bank and so I that the development for example of something like you know real-time trade settlement between the Chinese renminbi and the Russian ruble or something like that that's done in across a decentralized bloc tang like structure the way where you know money is transferred immediately and there's an automatic clearance because of you know whether it's a supply chain management system of a trade finance model that's built around this very robust trusted system with with you know all the transparency that comes with a blockchain environment then you end up with trade dollars is removed from the trade equation and and then that starts to beg the question about whether the dollar should be part of the reserve currency equation why would you you know you we whole it's it's it's capital markets that matter most in terms of absolute volume for currencies and so that's why that that we can say that's why the dollar is the dollar because people use it to move capital back and forth but at the end of the day that is a function of the reality that the dollar is central to world trade so if you remove that smaller piece from the puzzle why do we need to start thinking about the dollar as the base currency for all capital movements and therefore why would government's need to hold reserves in dollars to protect their capital markets right so I I think that the idea that China might lead the way in creating a kind of a crypto currency or a blockchain based real-time trade settlement system is one of the ways to think about how the whole dollar global economy muff economy might unravel and that sounds pretty scary I think to a lot of people who've built their in careers and this in their systems whether it's as politicians or as businessman around the center of the dollar but at the end of the day it will be a much better world because the forces of creativity and innovation and this year you know complexity of opportunities that will come into the global economy with a world that's not beholden to this you know restrictive centralized system is is going to bring so many more benefits than the losses in aggregate way for everybody else so it's a kind of a very scary but very exciting proposition all at the same time yeah I agree this is definitely a kind of more visionary thinking than then I've heard even in the course of my reporting but speaking of reporting there is something that I've been very curious about which is as a journalist covering an area you know there's a fine line that you need to walk where obviously you want to be involved enough that you understand the beat thoroughly and develop connections but then you also need to stand back and you know be impartial but what made you decide to cross that line and actually go work in the space join the dark side because I don't think in this case it is the Ducks you know it was a tough decision I was a journalist for many many many years I you know 18 years at Dow Jones in the Wall Street Journal and total of about 21 something more than that makes showing my age here so it was tough but you know I could never have gone off and worked as a flag for a bank I don't begrudge those who do but it just was never going to be satisfying for me so I had to do something that I felt was I had a purpose and I and so it was to me it wasn't that hard because I really really really do believe that whether it's Bitcoin the blockchain or some other decentralized trust solution is the next wave for the global economy and the internet that this is this this kind of idea and I'm being very broad way I describe it here but this kind of idea is the framework on which our future will be built so to me to get involved in that on the ground for it's just going to be exciting no matter what right so that's that's the first thing second was you know I'm moving to an institution like MIT so you know it you can't get a better place to to be involved in cutting-edge research and be surrounded by very smart and very very well-intended people it's an absolutely inspiring environment to be in and then the third is that you know the day I kind of feel like I'm still doing what I did you know I was a columnist for quite some time to stomach so I was always trying to push an idea or pushes probably destroyed Elizabeth but like I had an angle too much of what I was writing about in any case so I'm still writing I'm still doing a lot of public speaking and and I do these sorts of things you know podcasts the interviews in the life and I think it's it's a it's it's part of what I saw as my role anyway which is to build public awareness and and really hopefully inspire debate I don't I don't want to be a pitchman I'm not out there saying that that you know bitcoin is everything I'm not a maximalist of any idea right that I but I do think that I want to illuminate the possibilities and describe the potentialities and in the context therefore spur debate and spur discussion and and help to really build out this technology in a constructive way so it's it's it's kind of a form of journalism or at least the form of journalism were doing so it wasn't that that bigger leap at the end of the day albeit you know a very different experience and one that I you know had to take some getting used to so I'm also very curious as you mentioned at MIT you are privy to some of the more cutting-edge thinking around blockchain and cryptocurrency what has you most excited now oh we're really pushing it from certain reading angles that I to be honest it's hard to pick and and it's interesting I think that that one thing that's becoming clear is that there's sort of different different layers of resources that's going on right so I think within the computer science community there's a lot of work being done around call questions of identity and anonymity how we protect privacy summit some of these you know big big questions for cryptocurrencies going forward and so the enigma project that came out of the Media Lab is I think going to be very important you know people in my team also had some role in the Z cash project and then well that's you know that the cryptographers and the coders who I don't have as much connection to but I but I know and and and Congrats that being part of that process is going to be very very important as we move forward and Michael for our listeners who don't know what the ending of my project is or as e-cash can you explain those okay so in and and I'm not again an expert but I can I can just speak to the problem that certainly enigma is trying to tackle and that is you know how might you a proof of some fact and and feel absolutely confident in that without without knowing the pieces of it this is and then and that matters for identity so it uses something called homomorphic encryption which is basically to say you know I can get the totality of all this data but I don't if I don't know all the elements of it then there's a certain privacy that is afforded to to each of those elements and you know I can still gain proof by doing the computation on that total amount that you know such-and-such a state has changed or such-and-such a an assertion of a fact is true right so that that then becomes valuable for identity because and and layering that into a blockchain environment becomes important because this idea is that you know the blockchain is actually certainly the big top Bitcoin blockchain not necessarily as an Internet anonymous as people think it is there's all sorts of ways to develop understandings of identity around a lot of the metadata that gets developed there so maybe they're away and this is important for financial institutions right this is not just a we're not talking about aiding illicit drug traders and the like it's it's really about how might we go about the business of conducting commerce without showing our hands to everybody all the time whose economy needs a certain degree of anonymity and privacy to be able to function so these are these are systems that might allow us then to have you know a set of participants on a ledger share information to that ledger about their activity without actually exposing themselves and yet the yet the the constant validation and verification of the information is able to continue as it goes on and then things like you know Z cash using news things like zero knowledge proof switch I don't know the details in case that world but I do know that it's a it's an alternative cryptocurrency to Bitcoin that that really does does mean that there's not as much information on the blockchain as currently exist in the Bitcoin environment and there's a lot of reasons why that's that's that's a valuable thing it raises interesting social questions as well but that these are all I think going to be very very important as we move to the idea that we truly can replicate the notion of cash which is an anonymous bearer instrument into a digital environment and these are really important questions going forward specifically I think also especially for things like Financial Inclusion so that's that on the on the other side I I'm a you know I'm much more involved in business applications and the like and I'm really interested in securitization and specifically how they might deal with solar energy I think there's some very very exciting things happening around the use of the blockchain in decentralized distributed lectures fee grids and and how the blockchain comes in as a kind of an administrator in a localized grid setting but then on top of that how we might build abstracted claims on the generation capacity and the kind of relationships that emerge so you could actually securitize them and build them into financing vehicles and I think with smart contracts and lots of really powerful you know transparency and visibility that comes in that environment we could we could actually create some some real interesting securities that that function just as well or perhaps even better as much more high-level securities that the function in the capital markets that we could you know literally have the ability to enforce my claim even on a small little investment somewhere and that that starts to open up really interesting possibilities for how we would finance something as seemingly difficult to bring financing to from the front from a foreign setting is a distributed grid and a remote part of Cameroon right so these are those are the kind of really interesting questions to me in terms of the application side of it how do i you know how might we build securitisation structures on top of this and where it's certainly exploring some of those ideas well this has been a fascinating discussion and where can our listeners find more of your work or contact you in the future great so I have a website of my own so it's it's Michael J kc.com so that's one place you can find my stuff and the moment haven't been doing a lot of of publishing as much as I'd like there will be some things coming up pretty soon I've got a piece coming up on Oh Riley radar very soon about the Internet of Things and decentralized trust systems for that that'll also find its way onto my blog which is connected to my website and then MIT Media Lab we will very very soon be launching the long-awaited digital currency initiative website and people will finally get to see a long list of all that the proposals were doing so that's also one for people to check out so keep your eye out for that but in my dot media dot mit.edu is where you'll find Media Lab and from there you will never get that piece of digital points initiatives website great well thanks so
