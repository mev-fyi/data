I think it goes back again to the point at the beginning like can it be used maliciously and it definitely can so if the team decides to abuse their power for any reason whether it's they just want to go away with the funds or they don't like where people are moving their money uh they can't abuse that power and the only way to mitigate that really is again to have like these third-party arbitrators or like these services that uh basically intervene in that or have like a more extensive governance process but this is not a problem that is unique to Circle Breakers any project that has uh centralized keys can have this at any time and a surprising amount of protocols like if you go on etherscan anybody you can check this for yourself as an indication of whether your protocol centralizes you go to the address that holds the assets for the D5 protocol and just check is etherscan telling you that this is a proxy and if this is a proxy this usually means that there's somebody behind the contract that can upgrade it and change it to whatever logic they want which includes moving the funds to their own wallet and this is present in a lot of protocols so what the circuit breaker does here is that it doesn't add to what they can do maliciously but it does add to what good teams can do to save
