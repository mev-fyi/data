hi everyone for those of you who don't listen to my other show unchained I've been running a series of essays there by people in the industry as I near my book deadline Emilie Parker of long hash agreed to do one whose length is better suited to unconfirmed although this was mostly written before the market crash up last week it's quite timely given that crypto acids didn't exactly behave the way many thought they would during times of financial crisis with the soul-searching that's taking place in crypto right now Emily's thoughtful essay titled blockchain Tech's story problem and how to solve it looks at what crypto is about how we communicate that to outsiders plus offer some critiques and suggestions to the industry it's a great jumping-off point for conversation so I'd love to hear your thoughts about it tweet at me or email hello and Unchained podcast calm my Twitter handle is at Laura Shin and now enjoy Emilie Parker of long hash reading blocking text story problem and

resolution and anti money laundering email them at info at Kelman law at cocktail parties people always ask me what does your daughter do my father recently told me when I tell them you work in the blockchain industry they go blank or they associate Bitcoin with the dark web I try to explain but it's no use I have had countless versions of the same interaction step outside of the crypto bubble and say the word blockchain and you will often hear smart and sophisticated people say things like I try to understand it but then I gave up this mental block so to speak has real implications for an industry whose success largely depends on network effects and public participation the corona virus has only made the problem worse some of us were drawn to block chain because of Bitcoin the digital currency that made the technology famous Bitcoin appealed as a money that existed outside of traditional markets and could act as a safe haven from financial turmoil and irresponsible governments but recent events have put that narrative to the test to put it mildly the coronavirus crisis led Bitcoin to crash right alongside the stock market if Bitcoin can't act as a reliable safe haven then what is the purpose of block chains most visible ambassador the lack of a clear storyline may not have mattered during the 2017 crypto boom back then the market was so frothy that a company could raise money just by saying the word blockchain even if hardly anyone understood what it was but now that the market has cooled some may back away from a technology they view as opaque not long ago I heard of a multi-million dollar deal falling apart because one of the parties shut down upon hearing the word blockchain these observations aren't purely anecdotal a city gate do Roger survey on global professional investors asked about the level of understanding of blockchain technology by senior directors at large established businesses more than 50% of those surveyed said their understanding was poor or very poor with 0% describing their understanding of blockchain as excellent is blockchain 10th really that complicated sure if you are trying to master it at a technical level but the average person doesn't need to do that they just need to grasp the general concept Bitcoin is a good place to start for the purposes of this essay I will often use Bitcoin as an example because it is by far blockchains most famous use case I usually explain Bitcoin and blockchain like this Bitcoin is a digital currency and Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a blockchain which is a digital ledger that is not stored in one single location bitcoins blockchain is updated by people all over the world and can be viewed by anyone every block of data is linked to the one before it meaning that tampering with the data will compromise the chain blockchain technology allows huge sums of money to flow around the world without the intervention of a government or a central bank if my summary isn't the best there are plenty of other articles books and explainer videos out there but they just don't seem to be getting through to the general public the question is why here are a few reasons first blockchain doesn't have storyteller the blockchain industry has a storytelling problem because there is no one designated to tell its story the milk industry spends 46 million dollars a year to tell the story of milk milk the pistachio industry spends 55 million a year to tell the story of statius Tamika Tillman chairman of the board of the global blockchain business council told me Tilman added the blockchain industry has been trying to ram through adoption of what is arguably the most complex mass market technology in history with effectively zero investment in coordinated industry-wide storytelling when it comes to public understanding of new tech you get what you pay for tech products you could argue need even more of a marketing effort the tech industry has tended to spend more of its revenue on marketing than other industries and with good reason its products are often new and complex they require some explanation Marketing teaches people what the products do and tell stories about how products can fit into people's lives consider for example the ads for the original iPhone today Apple can do all sorts of things to appeal to emotion with its ads because most everyone knows what an iPhone is and what it does but the ads for the original iPhone were just quick product demos showing you what the phone actually does people needed that explanation because this was a new thing if the iPhone was a big leap from the flip phone it's certainly fair to say that bitcoin is quite a leap from a dollar bill and while it's possible to seek out an explanation of what bitcoin is you have to be inherently interested in bitcoin already to do that by contrast Apple marketing finds you those iPhone ads were everywhere there was a good chance you saw a few even if you weren't interested in the iPhone or had no idea what the iPhone was there's no coordinated marketing campaign to let people know what bitcoin is given that bitcoins value as a currency will be largely defined by the number of people who actually use it this is a pretty big problem the decentralization that makes block so revolutionary can be a liability when it comes to messaging second we don't know what story to tell even if the industry miraculously United around one story which story would it even be again take Bitcoin whose narrative is far from straightforward when we say Bitcoin what exactly are we referring to Bitcoin the currency or Bitcoin the network if it's the currency what exactly is its purpose is it a long-term investment or a get-rich-quick scheme is it a safe haven from traditional financial markets and if so then why did it recently crash with the stock market or should Bitcoin be used as an actual currency that can pay for actual things meanwhile apparent contradictions abound in countries like the United States Bitcoin may seem dangerously volatile and a way for an uninformed investor to part ways with a lifetime of savings but in places like Venezuela Bitcoin is a relative anchor of stability amidst political crisis and rampant hyperinflation the truth is that Bitcoin can be all of these things at once but that just doesn't make for the most coherent story it also doesn't help that bitcoins creator Satoshi Nakamoto has completely disappeared some people know Bitcoin as a private form of money that is good for making secret transactions the first problem with this narrative is that it's not even really true Bitcoin transactions are much more traceable than the average person might think but even so who exactly is benefiting from bitcoins relative privacy criminals who want to conceal their tracks or brave dissidents who are trying to protect themselves from authoritarian regimes the other problem is that privacy doesn't necessarily sell Mirage Agrawal the director of communications at coin Center put it this way the biggest storytelling problem seems pretty simple privacy is not a top-of-mind issue for most people and for those who think about it the convenience trade-off for privacy is too high Agarwal told me and yet Bitcoin for all its challenges still has the clearer story of any other blockchain base token aetherium the second most well known blockchain is even harder to explain to the general public Amanda Cassatt secretary of marketing dao an organization that is helping to grow the etherium brand told me that etherium technical people are not necessarily communicators they love talking to other technical people the kind of terminology they are creating is going to resonate with more technical people Cassatt said and the whole concept is just a little harder for people who aren't computer scientists crypto law is run by crypto OGIS in new york who understand crypto and FinTech they were already operating in the space back in 2013 in the accept crypto as payment one of the partners a Creek Hellman is known for drafting a bill submitted to the US Congress in 2014 aimed at exempting on chained Bitcoin

legitimately hard to solve but at the same time the cryptocurrency industry is not helping itself instead of trying to communicate a larger vision many are consumed by petty infighting about which tokens are best and even as much of the world has no idea what bitcoin is startups are spending their time writing nonsensical white papers and promoting products that even industry insiders can't understand blockchain conferences are flooded with jargon and empty terms like ecosystem which SEC Commissioner Hester purse aptly described as a word people use when they don't really know what they're trying to say Anthony pomp leon o founder of Morgan Creek digital said that the use of jargon can represent a deeper problem in a conversation on his podcast he told me when you get inside of crypto my best test for founders is tell me in two sentences or less what do you do and if you can't do it or there's any sort of technical jargon or whatever I'm not interested and some of it is because you can't articulate what you do and also the other piece of it is because you probably don't do anything finally does blockchain have a storytelling problem or just no story to tell blockchain technology has yet to touch most people's lives and even the best marketing campaign is not going to fix that marco centauri president and chief legal officer of blockchain a software platform for digital assets put it this way there's not a lot of ready-made end products for consumers today Santori told me that's changing rapidly and I think we're going to see a very different environment soon but today there's not a whole lot to sell just yet Santori said just look at the numbers for decentralized applications or dance which are basically apps or software built on a blockchain according to state of the dots data as of mid-march out of the more than 2,200 apps that attracts only one had over 10,000 users in the past 24 hours and only 5 deaths had a 7 day total volume of above 10 million dollars in late 2019 The Wall Street Journal reported that around 9 million bitcoins or slightly over 50% of those outstanding had it moved in at least six months use of Bitcoin by merchants went up in 2019 but remained a tiny fraction compared to credit cards blockchain technology is being used by major corporations the retail giant wal-mart is one pretty big example but these stories don't seem to be gaining much traction some crypto purists will say that these use cases are not real blockchain because they are not truly decentralized others will question if some of these companies need to use blockchain at all nathaniel popper who covers technology for the new york times told me it is so hard to tell whether anyone is axe using a blockchain for something that they couldn't have done with their existing systems people have an incentive to say that they are using blockchains because it seems innovative popper said if more people were using blockchain technology in a meaningful way they might not need to understand it hardly anyone can explain the technology behind the Internet but they don't need to because the Internet is an indispensable part of our daily lives block chains lack of real-life use cases help explain why some people have a negative impression of cryptocurrency in a recent New York Times article popper reported that even as bitcoins value was sagging the amount of cryptocurrency spent on so-called darknet markets rose 60% to reach a new high of 601 million dollars in the last three months of 2019 until more people experience the positive impact of blockchain technology negative crypto stories could dominate the attention of policymakers and the general public alike so what can we do cryptocurrency doesn't and shouldn't have a centralized marketing firm so it's up to the industry to tell its story here are a few suggestions for how we might do a better job 1 make products that people actually want some of the most important work may lie with entrepreneurs and developers for blockchain technology to truly touch ground it needs to be applied to products that people actually use if a start-up can't concisely describe its product and the problem that it is attempting to solve then does the world really need that product and does that product even require blockchain at all startups and investors should be constantly asking these questions a surplus of convoluted and esoteric products is not doing the industry any favors to lose the jargon if you have a product that does add value put some effort into telling its story some startups confuse storytelling with marketing or paying huge sums of money for self-promotion storytelling by contrast is explaining clearly what your product is and why the world needs it some good ideas may never get funding because investors have no clue what the founders are trying to say it's also startling how the creators of some consumer facing products don't see the need to explain their product to actual consumers don't pad your white paper with technical jargon and empty prose stop using industry cliches like ecosystem many technical people are not natural storytellers and that's fine if you're not a storyteller that hire someone who is three coordinate the message within reason the blockchain industry is decentralized there's no getting around that there are many blockchain based tokens and we can't expect them to unite around a common story but the different players can work on better coordinating the messaging of their specific communities let's also cut down on infighting and toxic maximalism it's good to name and shame scams and nefarious actors but it's not helpful to publicly trash tokens or key crypto figures just because you don't like them these divisions add to public confusion or cause people to tune out completely reasonably coordinated storytelling could have for everyone regardless of what project you are working on it will be difficult to get people to use blockchain technology if they don't understand what it is or why it should even exist don't forget next up is the news recap stick around for this week in crypto after this short break why should you get an MC o visa card from crypto comm first it's a beautiful metal card you can top up the card with crypto and spend anywhere visa is

you thank you so much for working hard to help us fight this virus and I'm glad to see that many government leaders are also stepping up to the plate thank you as well now let's turn to the crypto news of the past week first headline coin metrics short term holders drove Black Thursday volatility as I'm sure many of you know last Thursday was a crazy day in the crypto markets when Bitcoin plunged to as low as 3600 on bit max and could have possibly gone even lower if it hadn't been for bit max going offline for maintenance coin metrics had a good analysis of the types of sellers who were driving Black Thursday using on Shane data the analytics firms showed that the vast majority of activity in Bitcoin on March 11th and 12th involved Bitcoin that had been held for less than a year with about 280 1000 Bitcoin that had been untouched for a 30-day going back in a circulation versus only 4,300 Bitcoin that had been untouched for at least a year being revived among the other metrics they evaluated one was the market value to realized value which compares the crypto assets market cap to its realized cap the realized cap is an estimate of the assets aggregate cost basis coin metrics says quote BTC s MVR V fell by 0.5 on the 12th which is the largest one-day drop since December 2013 in hindsight the past periods where MV r v drops below 1 have been the best times to accumulate BTC at a relatively discounted price next headline santim n't etherium hold ler is hurting sentiment a crypto currency behavior analytics platform did a similar analysis to the coin metrics 1 this time on the etherium blockchain santa mint found that all MV r v cohorts short mid and long term holders are down on their initial investment in eath they also looked at whale behavior in aetherium and found that many at first dumped into the rally but then bought back in at the bottom and then dumped again however retail investors have been accumulating at between is 0.1 and 108th and developer activity on aetherium has been unaffected by Black Thursday and is even up slightly next headline maker Dow is crazy weak and controversial solution on Black Thursday maker Dow underwent a massive stress test only it was the very real plunge of ease by 50% in a few minutes because many of the maker vaults are collateralized by eath this sent users scrambling to avoid having their maker vaults liquidated unfortunately the etherium blockchain was congested at this time so a lot of liquidations weren't even getting included in blocks some very clever and opportunistic traders took the opportunity to liquidate vault with bids of zero eath but they paid higher gas prices to be sure that those trades would be executed so they made off with what one research firm white rabbit says was eight million dollars one of the emergency measures MKR holders adopted was to usher in USD see a stable coin that's backed by actual dollars in reserve as a collateral type among a few other solutions but not everyone welcomed us DC as a new collateral type Kane Warrick of synthetics tweeted when I will go this morning atheria had to permissionless staple coins now we have one an IVA Balin tweeted died has died she spelled it D a ie D which yeah maybe because I can explain it in audio form it's not as funny but anyway alright next headline backed raises three hundred million dollars Series B funding round back to announce that it had raised three hundred million dollars in Series B capital from IntercontinentalExchange Microsoft's m12 pay you Boston Consulting Group Goldfinch partners CMT digital and pintura capital the company also updated its website to give a sneak preview of the app that it plans to launch this summer that hopes to give new life to loyalty and reward rewards points in game assets and cryptocurrencies Frank Shapiro of the block says in an analysis that the regional app couldn't come in a better time given the drop in airline stocks due to the coronavirus he notes that the app will enable people to convert their airline miles into cash and writes quote airline points remain a big liability in the balance sheet of banks the ability to convert points in a cache reduces airline's liability next headline whither Bitcoin mining mining post having coin disk reports that the Black Thursday Bitcoin price crash is casting a pall over the upcoming having calling in a question whether mining firms will continue to be profitable the article says quote according to data from mining pool Poulin even the most efficient equipment on the market such as micro BTS what's miner m 20s and bit mains ant miner s 17 Pro is generating daily profits at a gross margin below 50 percent the co-founder of Poulin said that prior to the price crash he expected bitcoins hash rate would gradually rise but now he expects computing power on the network to decline by up to 30% fun bits steam it to execute hard fork to excise Justin's sons steam it if
