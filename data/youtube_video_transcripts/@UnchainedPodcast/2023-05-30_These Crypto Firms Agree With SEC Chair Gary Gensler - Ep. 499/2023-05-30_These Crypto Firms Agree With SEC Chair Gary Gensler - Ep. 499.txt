promethium and Rosario and gargiola founder and cossonic to discuss the recent developments in finra approved broker dealers in the crypto space welcome Erin and Rosario hey Laura nice thanks for having us thank you for having me Laura so as far as I understand and this is an area I'm not super familiar with so you're gonna have to help me out both of you have been approved by finra to operate as broker dealers for digital asset securities and there might be some technical differences between your offerings which we can dive into later but why don't we have each of you begin by describing what it is that your company does and we'll start with you Rosario what does bosonic do yeah well basonik um as the the main company independent of the broker dealer ATS uh subsidiary is basically in the business of eliminating counterparty credit and settlement risk so we've built a what is effectively a multi-custodial blockchain network that allows clients that are holding assets at custodians to be able to transact risklessly with an atomic swap at the custodial level and we're currently live and in production doing that with digital assets that are not Securities and we expect to be doing it shortly underneath our new broker-dealer ATS with digital assets that are securities and what about promethium promethium as a parent is building the technology that is used by its subsidiaries Promethean ATS and promethium Capital promethium ATS was one of the first if not the first ATS approved to publicly trade digital asset Securities and promethium Capital was just recently approved as the first special purpose broker dealer the idea is to create a thriving Public Market which requires both having a trading and custodial infrastructure and the idea is that the assets that are traded on the ATS will clear and settle at the custodian at the special purpose broker dealer okay great yeah we'll dive into more details on all of that but I also wanted to ask you about your backgrounds so Rosario how did you even come to work in the crypto space uh I've actually been in the crypto space since about mid-2015 so my background has basically been building institutional electronic trading platform companies as a Founder for pretty much my whole career so I had two companies prior to basonik the first one that I started with the computer science professor at University of California where we took a number of years of research we did applying machine learning and AI to algorithmic trading and basically spun all that out of the university and built a large-scale multi-asset I'll go trading platform for that we licensed to guys like bny melon and Millennium partners and folks like that and then the last company was in the FX space which is very close to sort of the crypto space in a lot of different ways we built the whole front to back stack that guys like Tanner Fitzgerald and EDF man and folks like that used to run their electronic FX trading businesses and the Genesis of bisonic was um basically coming into the space and look realizing that it looks very much like the FX space in terms of being in big OTC fragmented market and wanting to basically do the same thing aggregate all the global liquidity produce an Institutional offering and then basically figured out you couldn't do it because there was no way to clear and settle the transactions across all of the exchanges market makers and counterparties and so that was the Genesis of basonik it was really born out of sort of necessity to solve that problem and Aaron what about you I initially got into the space in 2013 uh and it was always our belief that at our law my Law Firm at the time uh the law firm I was working at that the federal Securities laws were the best way to regulate digital assets or at the time Bitcoin uh we initially wrote a no action letter to the SEC in April 2014 uh asking them to not take action against us should we trade Bitcoin through an ATS and a brokerage account uh and at this at the time we got bed bug but I continued to operate in the space and myself and our CTO were involved in one of the first legal token Frameworks coming out of an academic conference out of Harvard and MIT in 2015 and then when the Dow report came out in July 2017 it was the confirmation of our belief the belief that the federal Securities laws applied and that intermediaries in the space had to be regulated under the federal Securities laws uh so shortly thereafter we started Promethean with the intention of creating that compliant ecosystem for trading and custody of digital assets under the Securities laws oh wow you started that back in 2017. uh yeah I believe September 2017. the Dow report comes out in July 2017 and it's the first time that the SEC basically says that digital assets are at the time crypto or you know the general category implicated the federal Securities laws and those operating in the space meeting the financial intermediaries uh would likely fall under the Securities laws so cutting through the lines they were basically saying the federal Securities laws applied and that's the first time that the industry gets the indication of that fact and anyone who argues to contrary to that effect has to start back since then and then follow the sec's actions the enforcement actions the releases uh to see that there's been a clear linear path of Regulation that's been in course or you know being applied since that time forward yeah and I guess like the other thing though that I thought was um it seems like it's taken almost six years to get this approval then is that the conclusion or or no so we were initially approved as an ATS for digital Assets in 2021 uh and then we just recently were approved uh Promethean Capital was recently approved as a special purpose broker dealer uh which is super important because it's the first federally licensed custodian uh to custody digital assets under the Securities laws and the reason that's relevant is because there's a proposed change to the custody Rule and what that with that proposed change crypto assets held by investment advisors basically any institution that's held in holding their clients assets have to custody their crypto at a qualified custodian now what's a qualified custodian uh well the list is enumerated it's a bank a broker dealer meaning apes and in this case a special purpose broker dealer because that's the only broker dealer that could custody digital assets under the federal Securities laws and Beyond the other two categories once there's a Futures category and then there's a foreign entity category but those are the two main categories and the reason that's also relevant is because what does that mean for the state license entities I believe that the federal licensure regime is being is replacing the state regime and if you've listened to a chairman sue the chief of the OCC he said that he wouldn't trust crypto companies until they're federally regulated well I would argue that we are federally regulated so uh we are worthy of trust okay so yeah this is getting into the weeds a bit faster but let's just discuss this because I did have questions about this so what you're referring to is that there are State chartered qualified custodians in the crypto space such as like I think bitco and coindesk and I forget some of the other companies but you're saying that you believe that even though they technically are qualified custodians that because of this update to this Raa rule for um how assets for Ras can be custody crypto assets for Ras can be custody that essentially those State chartered qualified custodians will not be able to do that is that what you're saying that's the gist of it but I would actually argue that the fact that their qualified custodian isn't established in the first place essentially they are custodian licensed under State regimes they know with the New York Department of Financial Services or any other state but uh if you follow the comments coming from the SEC there's a question of whether they meet these standards of a qualified custodian and from a compliance and Regulatory standpoint if you're an institution who's handling clients funds you want to eliminate any sort of risk attendance of the compliance or regulatory side and the best way to do that is to transition that business to a qualified custodian license under the federal Securities laws and wait and just so I understand you are saying what simply it's the fact that they receive their qualified custodian status by a particular state that would not qualify them because I talked to some lawyers um and they mentioned what they called fund uh the notion that these State chartered qualified custodians will not qualify they called that fund um and so it sort of seems like maybe some lawyers who've looked into it feel like there's this rumor flying around but it's it's probably not based in I think there's been some guidance I mean I know our lawyers for I don't have it off the the reference off the top of my head but I know they've been able to get some official guidance where they've established that state chartered trust companies uh can be a good control location and therefore qualify as a qualified custodian but I agree with Aaron I mean the direction a travel is towards federally regulated organizations and and so for you know nationally Chartered Bank you know would also fit into that category as well as uh the the special purpose broker dealer that I think for me the Promethean guys have gotten okay well we said we went way into the weeds like early on and I want to like be sure to give enough background for everybody but um you know I feel like this episode is super interesting because we keep hearing this um you know a mantra from the SEC come in and register and then from the crypto side we've heard you know there's no path for this and so here you guys I feel like represent almost some kind of new wave of how these things might be done so let's just make sure we explain everything to the listeners so finra approved both of your platforms why don't you unpack what it is that your platforms got approved for sure so promethium has two entities we've been approved as an ATS which was in 2021 I believe and that stands for yeah alternative alternative training system essentially it's the Forum where crypto trading activity is going to migrate under the Securities laws but with if you think about it if you have a trading venue what you also need is a custodial venue because there you need to be able to have uh retail and institutional costs and be able to clear and settle those transactions that occur on the ATS so Promethean was just recently uh this past week announced that it was approved as a special purpose broker dealer which is a major step forward for the industry because it's the first institution licensed under the federal Securities laws that can custody digital asset Securities which is a major step forward and will actually allow those ats's to be further empowered because then they can in theory really allow for trading to develop on those markets and I think um you know from our perspective we you know we were approved as a as a regular broker dealer um with an alternative trading system uh license as well for both equities and debt Securities both non-digital Securities as well as digital Securities which are defined as Securities that are managed on a blockchain whether that's a private permission system or a public uh Ledger system and I think we also actually got an ecn permission for listed equities uh as well what does that mean ecn is electronic communications Network so that's basically a step below sort of a National Stock Exchange and allowed to trade listed equities uh as opposed to um registered but unlisted equities or private placements and basically the OTC market which is which is generally what you're dealing with with digital asset Securities and I think there's differences some pretty interesting differences that we probably should talk about around those ATS licenses and even around the special purpose broker dealer you know and the ATS because I think there's you know some interesting kind of odd rulemaking by the SEC around being able to do the custody but then not being able to do clearing and settlement and so how do you bridge the gap between the ATS and the special purpose broker dealer that's doing custody the way our system is is set up and the way we're approved is under a three-step letter we're not allowed to custody digital asset Securities so all of our clients hold Fiat currencies and digital asset Securities in regular you know qualified custodians whether those are banks or trust companies or something like we could in fact partner with promethium and and actually use them as a custodian which is a super interesting possibility for a lot of different reasons but and I think the the big distinguishing thing around the ATS is there's two methods of doing the clearing and settlement or and and they they refer to them as SEC three-step letter and SEC four-step letter and the four-step letter is essentially just bilateral credit after the match happens on the ATS uh sorry not bilateral credit bilateral settlement which which implies bilateral credit actually also uh after the match happens on the ATS so in other words if you and I trade on the ATS and we have them trade match you and I have to I have to set wire you dollars and have you send me Securities in in some fashion and the the three-step letter is is much more relevant for scaling a business and digital asset security these because it it basically involves custodian driven settlements so the the people that match on the trade tell the custodian to settle the trade and so they have much lower counterparty credit and settlement risk and and so what's part of why I think we got approved quickly is because our whole system is designed around sort of custodian driven settlement and it kind of just mapped really nicely under the three-step letter so we had a really clear path to basically comply with all of those rules okay so um s here not from traditional Finance many with them or kind of tech or crypto people I thought it might be helpful if we first of all just look at how exchanges work in traditional Finance or or really just how the system overall Works in traditional Finance we can contrast that with how crypto exchanges have worked so far so please feel free to correct me if any of this is inaccurate in a traditional Securities Market The Exchange is not consumer facing if it's it facilitates trading for its members and the members are all broker dealers and the broker dealers are the ones who interface with the customers so the exchange then is limited to disseminating prices monitoring trading activity running the matching engine matching orders Etc and as we've been mentioning they do not take custody of the assets they themselves do not do the actual trading so then the broker dealer members of that exchange can hold the customer funds and they can accept the orders from their customers who can be both institutional and retail for the trades they can even provide credit to customers to support trading activities and then there's another entity which is the Clearinghouse that keeps track of who owns the shares it updates the accounts of the trading parties so for example um in tradfi that would be something like the national Securities Clearing Corporation or nscc then another institution involved is the dtcc the depository trust and Clearing Corporation that performs this settlement which is when the actual exchange of money happens for the securities so obviously in crypto this is at least so far super different the crypto exchange tends to do pretty much all those functions they will match the order orders the custody the assets the clear they settle the trade they're also consumer facing um and then if we get into D5 it's like really different we've got you know these decentralized actors they come together they use this protocol um it's basically like a type of software that's decentralized and through that software they can perform all these functions let's now talk about how how you know let's walk through one transaction use using your platforms which now appear to be sort of yet another way that all this would happen and either of you can start yeah and I guess just you know just for the listeners um sometimes people always wonder what what's the difference between clearing and settlement clearing is basically figuring out who owes who what and then settlement is the actual change of ownership on the ultimate book a record and so that's that's basically uh you know those those two things and everything you just described in terms of how it works in Trad fi is exactly correct that's how that's basically how it all works and and as you pointed out in in crypto um and I think this is a really really an important thing and I think it it also speaks to kind of maybe why what some of the motivations are and I hope we get to this later in the conversation around the reality that we both got approved means there is a path to do this and I think there's things to talk about like what does that mean for things that might be illegally issued Securities and and then there's there's other incentives that people have like on the way the exchanges are currently operating in crypto is they're relying on money transmitter licenses right so that means that they can hold client assets effectively on their balance sheet and that's why we see a lot of the problems that we have because when you sign that user agreement and you give you you send your money to The Exchange if they're operating under that money transmitter license sort of regime those assets are allowed to be on their balance sheet so in theory they could borrow those assets through another sub if they wanted to probably legally if if the agreement sort of discloses that and and that's therein lies the problem right that's why you have FTX thinking they can loan assets to Alameda and all of these sorts of these sorts of things going on and and I think FTX was not a us-based exchange but anyway yeah but it but well I mean FTX UF I mean obviously is operating in the same way I think that's you know that's a obviously there's going to be a change where exchanges are going to be non-custodial and if you think back to the FX markets crypto exchanges the way they operate where they basically hold client assets they do things like take the other side of the trade they're doing all sorts of things that read retail Brokers used to do in the FX space 15 years ago that all got regulated out of its distance all of those practices were regulated out of existence so the way it works in our model with a with three-step letter is basically clients hold their Assets in their own Accounts at their own custodian so Fiat currencies digital asset Securities that means the custodians have the role of safeguarding those assets our technology basically allows the custodian to create sub-ledgers that are blockchain based where those assets are reflected on those sub-ledgers and and essentially things like real-time pre-trade risk are reading client balances that are cryptographically provably on those custodial blockchain ledgers and effectively you then can put an order into the matching engine when you get a match it's it's executed effectively as an atomic swap or a change of ownership at the custodial level and Aaron um how about you how does it work on promethium so I think let's look at a very high level first what we're seeing is a shift in the uh crypto Financial Services ecosystem from one that's sort of uh regulated under State licensure and we met uh Rosario mentioned the the money transmitter license and basically uh State custodial licenses and we're seeing to a shift to entities regulated under on the federal Level under the federal Securities laws and that's part of this maturation of the industry towards actually providing the investor protections the segregation of customer funds and assets from that of the institution uh the fair and orderly markets and basically everything that's required for the industry to move forward and to actually be taken as seriously as any other asset class now on the Promethean level uh the way it works is that when everything's live the asset will list on the ATS excuse me not list and the difference is as you mentioned before within exchange this is an alternative trading system there's distinctions within exchange The Exchange has to work directly with the issuer to determine what assets they list with an ATS and alternative trading systems an ATS makes it an internal determination based on its customers needs whether it wants to support trading in that asset so that's a distinction there but if there's a determination basically that the asset is a security meaning the digital asset is a security then it will be supported on promethium ATS and that asset will actually also be custodied at promethium capital and when uh we when that happens and when we uh in the near future we'll also be able to clear and settle those transactions that occur at the ATS So in theory you have the full life cycle of a trade you have a trade that occurs on the ATS it's cleared and settled at the custodian and those assets are custody at that custodian so basically you provide the entire life cycle there of a trade and by doing it under the federal Securities laws as opposed to the way it's done in the entire crypto verse now you're basically integrating the investor protections that are required to move the industry forward now you mentioned before when we're talking about how it works uh in you know in the uh virtual currency Universe of virtual currency exchanges now one of the things that we all hear about and we know exists in some capacities is those exchanges in theory trading against their customers uh these are one of those things that that just cannot fly once you integrate the benefits of the federal Securities laws and one of these things that are really needed for the industry to move forward and be taken as seriously as they think they deserve yeah I don't know if I can't I don't I'm not sure if there's a particular or is there a particular case of that that you know of I would say that you know you there's been reports that at some point 60 to 80 of trading is wash trades it's basically Bots trading against each other uh and that leads to a manipulative Market because it does it's you don't have a fair and early market then go ahead Rosario 100 and and we've even seen I saw an article like I tried to find it but I couldn't find it again where Gensler actually mentioned uh or was quoted saying something like that that I think even and this maybe I shouldn't mention names but one of the major exchanges in the US has Market making subsidiaries that are pricing into the venue right those things are okay if you just if those are adequately disclosed to the clients right but there are other practices in that that originated in FX that they refer to as a booking and B booking and that's basically where you analyze all your client trading Flow by client literally by client and when when you have client the overwhelming majority of clients that are trading actively lose money right so taking the other side of the trade of the guys that always lose money and essentially being the one that makes the p l on their loss those are practices that were you know performed inside of retail FX Brokers that that basically were also sort of regulated out of existence in this country you know along with a lot of the high leverage and everything else that people were doing and a couple of questions so um when you talked about how six there's a step at 60 of trading on crypto exchanges is wash trading um it does that include is that solely limited to U.S exchanges are you talking about globally because I remember a long time ago bitwise came out with a report and it implied especially particularly on you know I think it was like Chinese exchanges at that time I don't know if uh now what what it would be um but at that time you know I think a lot of that was stemming from there it might have been globally but I'd have to check but it's it's known in the industry that there are these manipulative trading practices that occur again when you don't have proper oversight and proper regulation and proper enforcement by an agency that's capable uh you know when the cat's away the mice will play and then the other thing I wanted to ask was so when I described the Trad Phi way of processing a transaction they were kind of like four main entities involved um or maybe it was five actually um and then uh for you know obviously in the example of crypto exchanges it's all just one so it sounds like to me for both of your um new systems it will end up being two is that correct yeah you basically have the custodial entity and then you have the the ATS entity which is effectively where the matching engine technology is and the matching happens and and it's kind of um in our in our models a little bit different because what we're really really what is happening is you have sort of peer-to-peer trading that self-clears and settles where we're just programmatically having the the the clients notify the custodian to process the net settlement movements but we can make those settlements Atomic so that nobody has a go first situation right like the way everything works off exchange today in crimp though is through bilateral credit and bilateral settlement so after the trade at the end of the day you figure out what all your counterparties you wire money to those counterparties they send you you know what they owe you in terms of digital assets or digital asset Securities and you know that that obviously is also one of the if you look at the direction of travel from a regulatory perspective they're trying to clean all that stuff up right that that that's really not fit for purpose for institutional trading or fiduciaries right if you're a fiduciary meaning you're running you're not running it's not your own money it's client money and you're a regulated entity should you really be wiring money to some other entity and hoping that they send you an asset in return right those sorts of things are just not fit for purpose in in a proper Market okay and then Aaron I wanted to ask you about the special purpose broker dealer regime because I think you know that's the sort of new thing that we're talking about here um so can you describe first of all what it is what it does um also what are like the limits on its activities so the special purpose broker dealer is basically the federal custodian licensing under the Securities laws to custody digital asset Securities now what initially it was released in December 2020 I believe was called the Christmas release at the time and then it was adopted into law into the Federal Register in April 2021. so it provided a clear framework by which to actually custody digital assets under the Securities laws now previously people said well you know no one had been approved for that so even if there is a framework maybe there's no path forward but now that promethium Capital has been approved as a special purpose broker dealer that argument is moot you can't make that argument anymore there and it's Monumental in the sense that it shows that there's a pathway forward for crypto in the United States and and also you know as all of the in my opinion all the sort of trading and custodial activity migrates to venues that are licensed under the Securities laws you need to have the firm I think the most important part of that is the custodian side because there will be ats's but until you have custodians those ats's aren't empowered and as chairman Gensler has said the overwhelmed majority of digital assets are securities what that so let's analyze what that means that means that they have to be traded custodied handled Etc under the Securities laws now what does that mean for the existing crypto financial service providers one it means that they don't have the proper licenses and two it means that their Tech stack is arguably obsolete because it's not meant to handle uh digital assets the way that Securities are supposed to be uh handled process traded custody settled Etc so it requires a big rebuild there in my opinion as well so why do we see such intransigence from the virtual currency exchanges the established players because it it's it's a significant task to update your technology to go get the proper licenses it's a it's a big process and it would take them a significant amount of time so instead what we see is that they move to fight you know in the court of public opinion uh which I would argue is always a sign uh it's never a sign of something good I guess is the best way to say it and what's what's the real way you want to say it uh what's the real way I want to say it I don't know that that means you think you're winning the battle it might be more of a uh a you know a Hail Mary type effort as opposed to a calculated logical rational step and but I do have a question which is um you know when we originally laid out kind of like all the number of entities involved in the different processes um you know I think a lot of people in the crypto Community would say that um forcing there to be more intermediaries where they're where it's like not necessary doesn't really make sense and I was curious if you you know had a response to that so like the the the interesting concept of decentralization uh particularly on the exchange side I mean we see a lot of the the activity occur now in centralized entities entities that have intertwined business lines where they're providing essentially trading custody banking lending staking et cetera et cetera et cetera services and I would argue that's a centralized point of failure plus it's not actually integrating the investor protections required under the federal Securities laws so you're much more exposed as a customer there and furthermore when that institution goes belly up because it's not under the federal Securities laws in a lot of those cases you become a general creditor and that is not good because an investor should gain or lose money or make a profit or a loss based on their own investment decisions not based on the mismanagement of the entity where they choose to trade or custody their assets and then so basically under your setup if either one or both of your entities were to go to bank go bankrupt then you're saying that those clients would not be General insecured creditors what would they be there's a segregation of customer funds and assets from that of the institutions under 15 c33 the customer protection Rule and if you're in compliance with the customer protection rule their assets would be protected they would still be their own okay so what you're saying is like in the case of FTX where it even said in the terms of service you you retain title over your assets you're saying somehow that's like a granted I I as I said earlier they were not a us-based entity but um you're saying that's not sufficient that there's some extra step that happens when you have the two entities split that if there's no oversight and there's no enforcement and there's no reporting basically you're you're you're your own SRO you're going to make sure you when you force your own rules and as we know they had such high standards when it came to risk management and other sort of internal you know uh compliance considerations you need to have an entity that oversees the participants in order to make sure that they stay kosher yeah and and I think a lot to to to what Aaron was saying earlier I mean part of why they don't want to do it is because they're monetizing the current structure and you know I mean what basonik does with its own its enterprise software side of its business I can make any exchange non-custodial in a day like we that's that's what we do we invented off exchange settlement we use you know separate regulated segregated custodians to hold client assets exchange can still do what it does and match trades so there's another incentive that's driving those decisions and and I think um you know part of it might be the fact that they're like you know it seems like the path of least resistance to fight because not only do they need the licensing which we've already proven anybody can get we got them um but they also have the issue of what do you do with where most of the revenue is coming from on any of these exchanges it's coming from things that are illegally issued Securities from the sec's perspective so you know and that and that you know and how do you fix that problem right and that's and that and that doesn't bode well if that's where 60 of your revenue is coming from like a coinbase in that respect I think the issuance problem is its own thing you know the the registration component but it's more of a question of the trading and custodial venues being licensed under the laws and essentially um you know the anyone who is arguing that there's a lack of regulatory clarity is basically best served by the argument that there is a lack of regulatory Clarity think about it like you want you want Congress to create new new legislation and then what they could do they're going to create a new federal agency so basically we're half a decade to a decade out and in the meantime the investors who use these platforms occasionally have to deal with Black Swan events the trading is not fair and orderly and you know they're basically not protected by the investor protections uh they're the ones who lose in that case the best way forward for their actual customers is the application of the federal Securities laws and it's what chairman Gensler said when he testified he said his clients are the U.S investors that's who's looking to protect and it makes a lot of sense all right last quick question before we go to the outbreak I just was curious um you know as you mentioned the special purpose broker dealers were first proposed in 2021 so why has it taken it about two years for one to be approved so it was adopted in April 2021 into law right and it takes a long time because you have to build the systems to be compliant with the regulation you're trailblazing essentially it hasn't been done before you have to not just build the systems right that have to be compliant you also have to have the operational and compliance procedures and basically all the internal mechanisms to make sure that when you are approved you will be able to be compliant with everything that's required under the federal Securities laws in that release and there is a lot there I'm not going to say if it's not an easy process it just requires focused effort and an actual belief that digital assets are securities yeah so in a way I feel like it's almost like you guys are saying we're iTunes and Spotify and we're coming in now after like Napster and LimeWire have you know been the dominant programs for a while is that kind of a good summary I have not heard such a good analysis in a long time I think that's pretty good okay okay so we're gonna um talk in a

app and get 25 with the code Laura Link in the description back to my conversation with Aaron and Rosario so as we've kept seeing throughout the episode you guys are going to be trading digital asset Securities um so how are you guys defining that term I was curious because I'm sure you know there's this like strict definition that everyone agrees on which is clearly recognized Securities that just come in a blockchain wrapper but I wondered if you were also including this definition that's more contested which is the one you've referenced that chair again sir of the SEC has used which is all crypto assets except Bitcoin are securities so how are you defining it what are you gonna list promethium and the ATS and the custodian is able to support digital asset Securities that is not traditional equities in theory it is an equity issued on a blockchain but our goal is to be able to support the existing uh investment contract Universe of crypto and chairman Gensler has said that the overwhelmed majority of digital assets arguably everything except for Bitcoin is a security and promethium has uh that same belief so you think you can list everything but Bitcoin essential all crypto assets but Bitcoin again it's a determination made by the compliance teams and the operational teams at both the broker at both the ATS and the special purpose broker-dealer levels uh based on a you know a amount of nation of different factors you know the uh and and if a determination is made that an investment contract exists and therefore it's a security uh we would then intend to be able to support trading in that asset okay so it sounds like the Gensler guideline is sort of one that you will be using essentially yes okay and Rosario yeah I think for us I mean it's it's it's a little more complex than that so first of all we have we have slight differences between our approvals um we can't custody uh they have a special purpose Burger dealer which can custody they can't do non-block chain based Securities we can do non-blockchain based Securities and blockchain-based securities both public Ledger and private ledger so we have potentially a a bigger Universe of things that we can list and we're doing transactions or Partnerships Now with uh other companies that want to issue um uh either well it just support standards sort of private Equity kind of like a forge Global or what you see on like an angels list where you have buyers and sellers of of equity in in web 3 companies that's one of the Partnerships that we have uh that we're working on we have another one that's just standard commercial paper issuance by very large corporate treasuries um but they want to issue on a private permission ledger so we can support um the creation of those assets on our private permission custodial Ledger side of things and then list those assets and run a secondary Market in those assets to trade them obviously anything that has been properly registered that we think is clean and you know we can list and trade and would would love to do that um I think that it it's really important though that we don't ignore the fact that most of what all of the crypto other than Bitcoin that the SEC believes our Securities they also believe are illegally issued Securities and so in order to be compliant it does not mean I want to be really clear that it does not mean just because we have these approvals that we can take anything that's out there indiscriminately and just list it and and trade it and support trading in it that doesn't really work that way um so we've been focusing a lot of our effort around sort of how do you help the ish token issuers to remediate that situation so that they can become compliant at least in the United States uh with the secure if they are securities with the Securities that they've issued by bringing them under a proper registration is that through rescission or is that through a secondary registration such that eventually those liquid tokens then get liquidity into the public market that develops with the registration and wait and Define rescission it's what you pull the assets out of circulation and rescission is you offer the investor the right to get out of that investment because it was an illegal type offering it was an unregistered security and if the investor doesn't take that right then essentially they basically made the agreement and there's no longer a legal claim against you such in that event now the other other possibility I think that Rosario might be implicating is a subsequent registration of a new grouping of that same token which would then in theory be able to establish a public market a trading market for that asset and those other tokens that previously exist as long as they've been held for a year and a day could then be traded under rule 144 and that liquidity could be introduced into the public market yeah I mean let me let me describe sort of that I agree with everything that you you're you're saying but I think I think there's a think there is kind of a path forward right so here's here's the way we've been thinking about it if you're a token issuer right and this and this is you know I think this is very important because to understand the landscape as well because you have Venture Capital firms major Venture Capital firms that have finance companies that have issued these tokens that they themselves hold the tokens some of them have on sold the tokens to the general public and they might all be illegally issued security so I think there's very big incentives to figure out how to remediate this and and Aaron Reigns raises a great point one of the things that will not work is the typical way that these things get remediated is through rescission because that means everybody gives the money basically you have to offer to give everybody's money back nobody can do that because all of these projects have been spending the money so what we're trying to work on is a no action letter around a remediation plan where you get your amnesty in other words if you if you make the if you become compliant in the United States you don't have you don't get prosecuted effectively you don't have to do full rescission but the way we're thinking about it is that you could you could easily have a smart contract that takes in on an opt-in basis the old token and essentially Burns it and mints it again with some metadata tagging that links it to a proper registration statement and that you get some really unique benefits of that because that means that you could even have a DEX or a defy protocol that could be U.S capital markets compliant processing only those tokens and you can have a programmatic way of swapping them out if if the token issuer is willing to do an actual registration right but but Rosario in that event won't those tokens become a liquid unless they're registered in the subsequent registration well no I think they have to I think to to whatever they're issuing any new token that they're issuing they would have to issue under the new registration I think that's and then it's a burn one for one you're saying burn one for one and and essentially and I think and I think this is another thing Laura just to put I just want to put some scope around this people think this is this big huge threat thing to do a registration statement it is literally like a 50 to 100 000 legal exercise and if you look at some of the provisions under the jobs act if you have less than a billion dollars of Revenue you don't even have to do most of the reporting that everybody's so scared of so there is a I think there's a real opportunity to let U.S companies become compliant in a way where the token is not stays fungible right so you only have to you only become compliant if you want to if you're a holder in the United States doesn't affect how it's custody traded on exchanges doesn't affect anybody outside the country you can do this one for one swap out and have a compliant version of the token in the United States many questions so first of all because these token projects they're sort of global in nature how does that play in because you know we're just really talking about this U.S regime so what they need to do the rescission for you know like let's say they have like 100 million token Supply or something like that do they have to get everybody to do that in the U.S because like what I was imagining was do you remember when there was some kind of issue with the Chargers for iPhones and then they had to reissue a bunch of them with these like green stickers on the back to be like this is the new one that's okay and it's not you know it doesn't have this faulty design or whatever um I'm just imagining like the tokens being like that like you pull back the the Chargers without the green but green stickers and then you issue the ones with the green stickers but I'm just confused how this works for like a global situation everybody's doing programmatic compliance if they're doing anything with security tokens uh today right if they're doing it compliantly so no so being able to look at metadata on a token is not a big deal if you are a custodian or somebody else who's a regulated entity who's handling those things you know and so in other words if you're an institution with all your with all of those tokens at coinbase custody if people adopted some sort of a framework like this why wouldn't coinbase custody just do the swap out for you and therefore you're now holding the tokens that are under the registration statement but they would have to get to exchanges liquidity pools I think it's the only possible way it could work in my mind is it's strictly an opt-in only thing for people that are affected by U.S law and want to be compliant with U.S law there's also a couple things one I would in regards to the point you made about the reggae plus I would say that you probably need to be tier two which means to be means you need to be PCA or be audited in order to really allow for trading in explain that for people when Rosaria was mentioning before about the regulation and the issuance of yours Regis but how you're going to choose to properly register or have an exemption to issue that security right right there's a full registration with an S1 or you can do probably the a good alternative is a reggae plus which has lower sort of reporting requirements in theory now the issue is is when you go to do the reggae plus if you really want to do one that allows you to have the most trading in the future you want to do a tier 2 reggae plus which has the pcaob auditing requirement now why am I so it's which is a higher accounting standard it's basically don't forget when you do a registration statement what you're doing is you're making disclosures about your businesses listing all risk factors they're going over your auditing and your financials they're not actually approving your business like some people argue they're not approving your business lines you know they're basically just saying that this document is disclosing all the material facts and that the auditing is good and that the risk factors are there so that's just to contest that argument being made uh in general but the reason I asked that because when you come to the issuance it's it's a sometimes it's a little bit more complicated I would uh note that promethium in a different lifetime was one of the first companies to file a reggae Plus for a token so we have a lot of experience with this I would say we're likely the first company that did not work and that was very uh positive in its own weird way but essentially it's uh I understand what you're saying there I think there's an alternative and then when it comes to the when you asked a question before Laura about the United States for tokens in the United States versus outside the United States the SEC primarily cares about U.S investors So in theory as long as you're doing a proper registration and offering to the U.S investors what goes on outside the United States as long as it complies with AML kyc and you do an exempt offering outside the United States it doesn't touch the United States there's not necessarily as many regulatory implications for those holders outside the United States so that's why I think in theory uh there might be a pathway forward there but we've been focusing a lot got on this registration component and I I think it's sort of it's definitely important but it misses the forest of the trees in some sense because what is I think will happen before these registration issues are solved is a migration of the existing trading activity existing custody activity to entities that are licensed under the Securities laws now registration will be solved or the lack of registration what happens with certain tokens will play out over time but before that occurs I think you'll see a lot of the uh activity that's currently on Virtual currency exchanges migrate to these federally licensed entities for trading and custody of digital assets because again if all assets are securities they need to be treated and traded and handled as such under the Securities laws yeah I agree I agree with that but I mean are you gonna are you I mean are you guys going to list and trade something on the ATS or custody if it's an if it's if it's deemed to be an illegally issued security or you're going to go through you're going to go through a process to figure out which ones you're comfortable with that you think are there's internal compliance considerations there and determinations about what you're comfortable with I I agree with you that that's probably the area where it's the least clear but that will play out over time I I thought it was very telling you know when chairman against her testified in the house Financial Service committee and one of the first uh um committee members I believe it was the chairperson said is ethereum a security and then people got upset because chairman Gensler didn't answer but the reality is if he answers one way or another basically he either knocks off half the market cap of Ethan a day or he shoots it up the other way I thought it was actually probably responsible not to be all of a sudden make some sort of incredibly influential statement in a public hearing that will potentially affect a lot of the holders of ethereum I think it was actually admirable that he didn't do it so let's now just talk about specific assets because um you know I noticed both of you have screenshots of um the app on your home pages so like for instance Aaron the screenshot and the promethium home page shows um you know the app which shows fil which is file coin and already we know the SEC has given notice of beliefs that's a security so okay so you're trading digital asset security so it fits in that bucket but then there was also comp and flow and cello and GRT which is the graph um and I didn't know like you know does that hint that you guys are gonna have those available and if so like did you and the SEC already agree that those do fall in that bucket of digital asset Securities or like how did you know or or yeah I'm just curious how this process works I I believe what you're referring to is only an example at the time we're not announcing the assets we're going to support but again it's an internal determination whether an asset is a digital asset Security on the promethium ATS and the procap levels from the compliance and operations side uh and so basically uh based on that determination that will make that will that determination will determine the assets we support well I was going to say what I saw on your home page um which is um there was a longer list actually of tradable assets and a screenshot and actually it even had some BTC trading pairs um but I didn't know really what that meant um like is that saying BTC is in addition to the Securities or just tell me about your process for listing yeah so so we're um so today what we do uh well that's not it's not indicative and that's the parent company uh home page right so we're we're more of a infrastructure provider so we both operate infrastructure that people use today to trade Fiat currencies against digital assets that we believe are Commodities like Bitcoin and ethereum uh there's only very very small number of those and then we also license it to other people that might trade other assets using our technology or use our technology for clearing and settlement and elimination of counterparty risk trading other assets and so it's not indicative but I think we're we're of the opinion that we can only list and trade things that are um you know basically approved Securities that are not illegally issued it would be wonderful if we could just suddenly take everything that's out there in the market that kensler thinks is a security and trade it that would be that would actually be awesome from a business perspective but I don't think we're I don't think we're able to do that one other thing that I think is you know a lot of people wonder and if you look at some of the banking regs you know some banks are are you know not even able to do certain things with um digital assets Securities that are issued on an L1 on a on a public blockchain and and so when we work with a lot of the banks that are that are in our cross-custodian that settlement working group and these are major Banks like State Street and guys like that they're very focused on tokenization of existing non-natively digital Securities and not necessarily doing that on in layer one but doing it on a private permission system and those assets can also be listed and traded on an ATS through our approvals with the broker-dealer ATS license and so I think that's where there will be a very big push towards that over the next uh over the coming years I think most of the the assets that will be in play will ultimately be that unless we get more clarity from the SEC that we can just take all of of the other existing tokens that are out there that are securities and and list and trade those safely like I think we would want more guidance from the uh from the SEC on that I totally agree with that as a concept but if you think about it they'll chair them against like I said recently that virtual currency exchanges are trading Securities and time is running out for them to register under the Securities laws so what we've seen in enforcement as we've seen first it goes after lending then staking then stable coins then custody and then finally virtual currency exchanges that goes from the most risky to the least risky parts of the crypto ecosystem so where does that activity go I don't think that the goal is to harm investors such that they won't have a venue by which they can actually trade those assets if that occurs the price bottom in theory would drop out of a lot of those assets and that's not what's in the best interest of those investors so I agree with you that you know uh over time we will get more clarity I also think that um there has to be a place for that activity to occur in order for the you know the industry to move forward when you say time is running out for these exchanges to register is there some limitation there some kind of deadline no that's what chairman Gensler had said but there's no like regulation saying if you've launched in this way and you know then you have like X number of years to register no it's basically you are trading Securities you don't have the proper licenses you're not handling them properly you are running out of time to basically get the even the opportunity to register under the Securities laws before an enforcement action in theory and that's the implication and if you don't I believe those entities will perish I know wait but so I'm so confused like why did coinbase get approved to you know become a public so that's what I was referencing before when you do a registration statement right the SEC does not approve your business the SEC approved a lot of public companies that were marijuana companies those are federally illegal so the argument doesn't make sense because what they're doing is they go through your disclosures they go through your your accounting your auditing they go through your risk factors and they ultimately make sure you have all the material facts that you're disclosing anything that an investor might think relevant when making an investment decision that's the term that's the definition of a material fact or you're not leaving out any facts that are considered relevant and that's what they approve they approve the offering document they don't actually approve your business lines it's it's it's a it's basically taking a concept which is well known in the legal universe and distorting it in the realm of public affairs to basically serve your own interests but it's it's just a fallacy so basically any company that's doing something that's illegal can become a publicly listed company is that what you're saying I mean again I don't know if you would say I in theory I would hope not but at least for when it came to the marijuana companies the case it's case in point what they were doing was federally illegal on the state level they might have been allowed to do it but they were approved as well this is just sort of blowing my mind at this moment no Rosario you can confirm what I'm saying if I'm saying anything you're 100 you're 100 right I mean you can you can you can easily you can easily see that parallel there with those types of companies I mean and but you you said something really interesting earlier Aaron you made a reference to rule 144 is is there a and you're and I think the listeners should know that Aaron is a lawyer and I am not I'm curious about uh what you were referencing there like is there a is there something under the law there with 144 where if you were these these things that were legally issued can can ultimately get cleaned up by just through through a matter of time and how they're transacted the reference I was making there was if you were to do a subsequent registration of a certain number of tokens now what would that happen with those tokens that weren't registered in that offering in theory they would not be able to trade into the public market right because they're not registered so that's when you could in theory use 144. got it got it got it okay and wait what it so Define 144 for the audience it's it's a rule by which um a illiquid security is able to what's called remove the restrictive Legend meaning they move from being illiquid to being a liquid asset so meaning they could be traded into traded into public markets they could actually be traded versus they it an illiquid instrument cannot be traded on uh publicly and basically you'd have to do a private Securities transaction with another arguably accredited investor in order to be able to uh have that transaction where once an industryman's liquid you can trade it publicly on you know any sort of public market and okay and that's all qualified institutional buyers right for 144. isn't that all webs basically um I don't I think it's more expensive than that interesting okay we'll try to find that out and maybe insert something if we can before this goes out um so you guys you know we've been discussing like which assets you guys are going to be listing so I need to ask you are you going to be listing eth I believe that since the uh Ico in 2015 ethereum has been an investment contract and there is no legal precedent where a security meaning an investment contract that therefore is a security morphs into a non-security there's been sort of ideas of sufficiently decentralized posited out there but they're not really based in legal precedent so once a security oh is a security under the you know legal precedence that exists and as such while we're not announcing anything at this current time as chairman Gensler has noted and I'll sound like a broken record the overwhelmed majority of digital assets basically everything besides for Bitcoin is a investment contract and therefore security yeah and uh our answer is we we're we're currently supporting ethereum but not on the broker-dealer side of things because as you know the broker-dealer ATS can't deal with digital assets that are that are not Securities I think we've we've taken the position at least historically that thought eth was a commodity and I think the cftc sort of indicates that they agree with that but but it raises a really interesting point that you just you brought up Aaron and that is that one of the things that has been put forth by some of the lead thought leaders on the legal side of things um you know and I think you know some of these folks like Joshua Clayman and and others like there there's a concept that might make sense actually for uh something to be able to morph from what started out as a security for Capital raising purposes and ultimately you know becomes sufficiently decentralized and and becomes really a utility token and and not a security and is used in various other ways other than uh for purposes of raising capital and I think I think that's a super interesting concept there's no legal precedent for that whatsoever so I think it's a long way out to kind of get any kind of guidance or if that if that could even ever be a thing but it is a very interesting concept except that I've heard some folks talk about to paraphrase the previous chairman of the SEC chairman uh Clayton people don't speculate on laundromat tokens and that was that was the whole argument then people speculate on investments uh I don't I I don't know that one seems out there to me all right well I will say that another wrench um that might get thrown into this is that representative emmer and representative DeSoto um introduced a bill that would enable an asset that was sold as part of an investment contract to later become deemed a commodity so um who knows if that will get passed but um that's also potentially in the works so one other thing I was wondering is like so bosonic I guess has like kind of a bigger range of things that it can list but for the part that you know concerns digital asset Securities did you guys have to get a list of those approved by the SEC Aaron it seems like you are just sort of saying this is like an internal decision with your compliance team so I was curious like you know who's deciding and like how are you creating that decision process like is it in conjunction with the SEC or how does that whole thing work it's not something that you as part of your new member application where you actually talk specific typically about the assets you're going to list you're really just you're basically just saying that you know you're gonna you're gonna be dealing with Securities in our case digital asset Securities or non-digit not non-digital asset Securities and and it's all about compliance and sort of the mechanisms in place for how you do matching and essentially essentially protect the customers that's really what the whole thing is all about so I think the decision about what you list ultimately comes down to to the firm and their legal counsel and sort of their internal processes as Aaron pointed out you know I I think uh I'll be very interested to keep talking with you and see what you guys do because I think uh maybe we can take a page from that book because it would certainly be nice to be able to start transacting in some of these other assets again we've always worked very closely with regulators and compliance has been our first consideration uh we were incubated out of federal Securities Law Firm with molecular expertise in brokerage and you know Financial infrastructure related activities where obviously going to make sure to be as in tune with how compliance operates as possible and not take any sort of you know Grand risks or or any sort of major statements because I think that in general What's Happening Here is sort of a crawl walk front approach you will see this migration occur it'll just be with the system growing over time now when when you look at like the Chicago Board of options exchange when it launched it launched with two contracts that traded for four hours a day I believe right and then it builds out from there then it basically and I believe it was only long right so like you know or it was maybe maybe whatever it is but essentially like what you'll see is that once these this activity starts to migrate to these Securities compliant ecosystems first you'll see custody and trading evolve then you'll also see you know uh potentially margin and additional a sort of development as this sort of ecosystem develops out and overall what you'll see beyond that is the development of a National Market System for digital assets uh just not the exact same way that occurs with equities but it will occur to eventually look something similar to that now there won't be a DTC or nscc but like there will be a National Market System that will develop because as more people are approved and more people are compliant under the federal Securities laws I think the pie will continue to grow and it'll have a network effect as opposed to being a famine mentality and I was also curious because um as you guys know for Securities there are disclosure requirements so for the Securities that you guys do list will you or the SEC require those same kind of disclosures from those issuers um you know for instance similar to the ones that we see for Securities listed on National Securities exchanges you know we've seen the SEC talk about that uh but you know I didn't know how this was going to be implemented for your new entities well in respect to a national Securities Exchange versus an ATS alternative trading system the national Securities Exchange has to work with the issue that's the distinction here and basically they can't list an asset that they haven't worked with the issuer in that sense on an alternative trading system uh it's basically an determination based on your customer needs and it's basically matching buyers and sellers in that sense so there's a distinction there that I think gives you a little bit more flexibility as to what assets you support and I think that sort of that'll be a positive thing going forward for the industry there and so you won't require those kinds of disclosures because they're not actually required we will make sure that uh anything we do is compliant under the federal Securities laws yeah I agree with that and I think to say it another way what Aaron's saying is it's between the issuers and the buyers and so you know the the whatever the issuers are putting forth I mean obviously we want to make sure that they're not fraudulent you know uh companies and things like that and there's all sorts of you know bars to and things to boxes to check around being compliant but It ultimately is just a as you said a different a different animal right it's between uh it's between the issuers and the and the buyers we don't actually even have to uh list the or or provide all of those uh that information directly like they can get that information directly from the issuers or from the issuer's website uh in fact okay so this question is around the fact that actually Tara Gensler has kind of implied in the past that he would actually prefer a national Securities Exchange model for trading of crypto asset Securities not ats's and obviously that's not what's actually happening um because you guys have these ats's so I was curious from your interactions with SEC does it seem to you that the agency is now leaning more toward using this model of ats's for crypto exchanges rather than National Securities exchanges I just want to clarify to my understanding the reference to National Securities exchanges is when there was discussions between the SEC and the largest virtual currency exchange that basically said they would have to register as a national Securities Exchange based on the services they were providing I don't necessarily think that they were promoting a national security exchange versus an ATS I think that they were saying entity we're speaking to entity XYZ right you need to would have to register as a national Securities Exchange if you want to be compliant under the securities laws based on the activities and you know the business lines that you provide yeah I think I I think that's right and I think their intention I mean and and there's just lots of practical considerations I mean if you're a national Securities Exchange you have to publish all of your trades and do and do the Sip I mean those are those are things that don't even run 24 7 I mean there's a years and years of infrastructure changes that would have to happen to have a national Securities Exchange trading digital assets 24 7. and uh and it would involve collaboration and cooperation with the owners of that which are the other National stock exchanges Etc right so I think I think I think this is the this is the model forward and and Aaron's I think that is right about the reference to that it's just it's just the nature of what they're doing would put them into that category you know we have a subset of of permissions that are a slight a step below a National Stock Exchange but perfectly suitable for running a business like what a major centralized exchange is running uh if for trading digital asset Securities and then also like you have to follow like if you look at the history of Wall Street filing NASDAQ model I believe NASDAQ starts out as an ATS and then eventually becomes a national Securities Exchange it's sort of like a maturation process it would be such a you'd be going from like you know from kindergarten to like a PhD if all of a sudden you went from virtual currency exchange to ATS and it was skipped ATS it went directly to National Securities Exchange like they couldn't even regulate their own activities how are they supposed to regulate other people's so okay so then one other thing about this distinction between National Securities exchanges and alternative trading systems um so I believe if you are a national Securities Exchange you're exempt from this next thing I'm going to discuss but as an alternative trading system you would then also be subject to Blue Sky laws which are state level regulations for Securities offerings and those have similar requirements around registration and disclosing the security session or details that they're offering um sometimes they even have to get approval from the state Regulators so does this mean that you're also at the moment dealing with State Regulators for your listings so the Blue Sky laws you're referring to are on the registration side essentially to be able to offer that security in that state for an initial issuance on the broker-dealer side I believe and Rosario you could tell me if I'm a little off that there is a annual sort of I guess fee to do conduct business in that state and basically there's a process by which that broker dealer is licensed but approved to conduct business in that state that's a little bit different in just a small distinction there yeah and I think I think those are uh pretty simple check the box exercises I actually don't remember all the all the details on it and I'm not sure I don't think you're you're I don't think you're going to get regular the whole point of being a National Stock Exchange or or even you know a broker dealer is you're regulated at the federal level and you don't have to you know deal with the state level I think the issuers have to make certain filings around the blue blue sky laws in the states that they're selling in is I think what it's related to okay but it doesn't the ATS does not involved it or they're not included in that there's a state-by-state fee you have to pay to be doing a business in those States but it's not like a state-by-state registration of your ATS in that state [Music] well I want to step back I can do bigger picture which you know we've kind of been discussing sort of throughout but um you know we've discussed this um kind of uh he said she said that we've been hearing from Regulators in the industry the regulator's saying come in and register and the industry saying there's no real path for this so I was curious like now that you guys have um you know your different um approval from I mean they're slightly different approvals from from finra I was curious like what advice would you have for a coinbase or a kraken or like any of these other big crypto exchanges if he were them what would you do it's interesting because in the industry for a long time people say well we go speak to the SEC and we get a Wells notice but they're not mentioning how they were conducting all this business activity that was improperly licensed and uh not compliant with the federal Securities laws they are basically conflating two concepts one is how do we move forward right how are we going to become compliant not how we clean up the non-compliant activities that previously occurred there's really no way like there may be in theory there's ways through no actually letters and something and grandfathering but you can't exercise those skeletons out of your closet and I think that's one of the biggest issues when it comes to a lot of the Legacy crypto financial service providers and the virtual currency exchanges is that there are a lot of skeletons there and how then do you transition to an ecosystem where you're under a strict enforcement and Regulatory guidelines of reporting guidelines and have to uh and it's a it's a it's a significant task and I think that's why we see such intransigence from the virtual currency exchanges in in being aloof or obtuse to the writing on the wall that digital assets are securities you know they argue for a lack that there's a lack of regulatory Clarity because they're literally best served by the lack of regulatory Clarity yeah my advice would be let's not forget that the U.S uh is the biggest Capital Market in the world this is the most important Market in the world I don't think you want to go offshore I think that has all sorts of implications it's the wrong approach I think thumbing your nose at Regulators is not the way to do this I mean this is this is this is you know it's not easy but it's not hard we did it um you know and and went through the process and and got the right approvals to be able to to do this business in the right way and uh I think that you know people just need to be way more Cooperative with regulators and and and and really sort of just be committed to becoming compliant I mean I think I think if we were at a point where the big centralized exchanges instead of fighting were saying great we're we we've bought a broker-dealer ATS license we're ready to go what do we do with all these illegally issued Securities we've been trading we'd get the answer to that question and we'd get some clarity around that right but there but but nobody's doing it nobody's going through the process and it's it's kind of um it's it's disappointing I think it I think it hurts the whole crypto industry I would I would highly encourage everybody to just go through the process of getting compliant and let's do this the right way this is the biggest Market in the world and also the idea that regulation kills innovation is just it's it's nonsense let's think about it where is innovation in the space is innovation on the financial service provider side like that's really what's really taking the best advantages of distributed architectures using them in interesting projects no it's actually on the project side is the token issuers so regulating financial service providers does not kill Innovation allowed an unbridled quote-unquote Innovation from their standpoint led to FTX led to the events of 2022 that basically let that that harmed retail investors that really if you think about it like they democratized a scam they didn't democratize Finance they basically allowed the internet to be taken advantage under the guise of innovation to have the general public participate and also in third world countries not just in America but a lot of just normal Mom and Pops participate in their nefarious Ventures and as a result there has been a pendulum swing which makes a lot of sense so instead of basically spending your time and your effort fighting against your regulator arguing in the court of public opinion focus on innovating your systems such that they're compliant under the federal Securities laws and again Rosario is totally right when you generate the overall majority of your revenues from the United States I don't think you're going to leave the United States and how are you going to be competitive internationally with Finance who doesn't who has such a big market share that is just a different Beast internationally and you know that's a different question when it comes to compliance but that's a totally different conversation so I don't understand how and wait one more point there and also what we've seen is when all these entities start to go internationally they a lot of times they catch black eyes and they pull out uh you know if we've seen it happen in India we've seen it happen in Japan we've seen it happen in different countries now and it's much easier in my opinion it's a much more logical stance to figure out how to morph your business into one that's compliant under the Securities laws of the United States and understand this new paradigm so was a pretty new topic for me and since I'm not sure if I covered everything for my last question I just want to ask you if there's anything I didn't ask you about that you think my audience should know on this topic I think it's just a general observation one of the things that's sort of awkward phenomenon is I think that the general public is going to be much more knowledgeable when it comes to Securities regulation that at any other point in history like like there's an article I read the other day on one of the websites and it's it's like you know a two three thousand world word article on what wells notices mean and that's and it was a pretty good article so like you know this will educate people and people will understand that like financial instruments are regulated period you need to include the investor protections required in order to make sure that the public can properly participate with those financial instruments and discussion yeah I mean and the only thing I I agree with that and it's not that not that the general public wants to know about what a Well's notice is but um I think I think um you know I just want to be very clear that we're you know we're I'm 100 bullish on the crypto space on I think there is a place for commodity tokens I think there is a place for utility tokens and things that might not be Securities but I I just think that we've you know we've gotta figure this out quickly or it's going to harm a lot of people you know we've people people like coinbase the leaders in this space really need to sort of do the right thing I I think and and uh you know and I think that they want to do the right thing uh maybe they're just taking taking the you know going to different they're down the wrong path you know I think if nothing else at least we've shown that you you can go get regulated to do something with digital assets and digital asset Securities in the current regime I mean in the midst of literally what's going on with Wells notices and all of the sanctions and everything else that's going on we we were able to go and get these approvals and ats's are are those those are you know SEC registered I mean this is them literally looking at this application and saying yeah we're approving these guys to do trading in digital asset Securities so I think the argument that you can't do that is just not is just not valid let's let's find out let's let's find a way to get compliant and like you know get back to work which means overall that there is a path forward for crypto in the United States 100 okay you guys this has been such a fascinating episode um where can people learn more about each of you and your work uh you
