cipher trace is securing the group dough economy this is the 100th episode of Unchained I can't believe it this started out as a side project back in 2016 when almost no one cared about crypto the show came out only every other week and Forbes stopped supporting it after the first 12 episodes and when I try to find a sponsor for it I had a hard time and finally finally on-ramp which I think had done a few websites for blockchain startups and realized that there was this whole new industry they could tap they agreed to sponsor and they became the exclusive sponsor for 2017 I will be forever grateful to them for keeping the show alive at a time when no one cared about it I've enjoyed doing the podcast for a whole host of reasons but the biggest one is that it has enabled me to pursue my lifelong dream of writing a book once Unchained became successful enough that I could leave Forbes I had time to write up a book proposal which I sold earlier this year I'm now working on that book and I'm immensely enjoying myself in recent years people started coming up to me to talk about my podcast rather than my articles but I still think of myself as a writer first and foremost and so I will always be grateful to this podcast for making my dream of writing a book possible reaching this milestone with a podcast and having it be so successful are also meaningful to me because I've had a lot of ups and downs in my career I started things off pretty well at prestigious publications but I quit all of those jobs pretty quickly I had done well in school so it's not like I have a problem with authority per se but I really don't like doing anything where I'm bored or where I don't find it to be a challenge or don't find it interesting and especially when you're younger you often have to do non intellectually stimulating crap work so that was a problem for me on top of that if you listen to my TEDx talk I I mentioned this there a little bit but I grew up in a household with no rules my parents are very chill people and they never imposed any rules on me or my sister so I think another reason I don't like for working other people is that I am not used to people telling me what to do so when you combine crap work with the fact that when you're more junior you also get told what to do I really did not handle all that well so I quit and I started freelancing at a pretty young age and while that went okay in some respects it went really poorly from a financial perspective and though as I mentioned my parents are pretty relaxed people they definitely drew the line at me getting into debt so after that mostly failed period of freelancing for a little while I worked outside of journalism and I was doing grant writing but I realized pretty quickly that that was also not a good fit for me and I want I wanted to go back to journalism so I went back to journalism school and then I graduated in 2008 and that was a time when the journalism industry was laying off one in every five employees so suffice it to say I did not get a job in journalism coming out of journalism school and instead I ended up in grant writing again and the main thing I remember about this time is basically just this crazy feeling of desperation on my first day at that job I saw for the first time in months the first good journalism job at a credible publication and I remember I was sitting in this cubicle at this you know first first day on my job at this brand new grant writing position and I just put my head in my hands looking at that job posting and I think I applied anyway but I didn't get any response and looking back I just remember thinking so hard and so desperately that if I were given a chance to get back into journalism again I knew that I would do well but I had no idea how or if I would ever get such an opportunity so finally three years out of grad school I did get a journalism job again but a couple years into that job I felt my talents weren't being appreciated and I wanted to try freelancing again and that was six years ago so six years ago I was in that job and I was months away from trying to freelance again for a second time but this time I was so anxious about telling my parents that it was convinced that I would tell my mom I was quitting my job and she would have a heart attack and die and I literally would start sobbing talking about it with my sister and brother-in-law I did end up quitting my mom was okay and when I started freelancing again I picked up Forbes as one of my regular gigs and amazingly the first story I ever wrote for them became the most popular article for the day on the Forbes site and so when I started freelancing I had decided to leave New York and move to rural Italy for the first six months of freelancing partly to save on cost but also partly because I just spent six years right in the heart of downtown Manhattan and I just needed a break so I actually wrote that first Forbes article on the plane and then I hit published while I was at the Frankfurt Airport on a layover and then when I arrived in Rome that night I saw the article was number one on the most popular charts of Forbes my mom was like you'll never top that one but amazingly I actually had even more popular posts within a few months and soon I was actually doing pretty well in the Forbes platform and the editors were giving me more duties and it was all working out super well because I was still my own boss and I didn't have to take orders from them and I could kind of do whatever I wanted but at the same time I could get guidance from them and also write for the magazine and I kind of had colleagues but I was also an appendant so all those all those things were working out super well and I ended up spending more than four years freelancing for Forbes and it was during that time that I started the podcast and actually since we launched it while I was still a freelancer I actually owned the podcast from the start the original contract is the one that gave me the copyright which has turned out to quite possibly be the luckiest stroke of my career eventually in the summer of 2017 I did go full-time with Forbes of course when I told my mom the very first thing she said to me was don't quit and yes so seven months later I actually did quit that conversation did not go well for about one minute but then everything was okay after that and the reason was that because at that point I had realized that the podcast had become popular enough that it just made more sense for me to do that full-time rather than stay working full-time at Forbes and crazily enough that all happened less than a year ago which I can barely believe because my life has changed so much since then I no longer feel like I have to work all the time I can work in a more leisurely pace and more importantly I of course still have the weekly weekly deadlines with my podcast but my writing deadline for my book is much farther out so I can give a lot of time and care into that reporting and writing which frankly feels like a luxury when I look back at how far I've come and when I think back to my darkest moments in my career when I was so desperate to get back into journalism but it took years or the time when I was almost fired from a grant writing job which I did not go into detail in before or the time when I had this other job where I thought maybe they might fire me I just wish I could go back and just tell myself that everything would work out and be okay but since time travel doesn't exist I'm telling you the listeners of Unchained to let you know what this means what this show means to me personally and why I'm really grateful to all of you for singing it means a lot to me because for a long time I really was uncertain about whether or not I'd ever make it as a journalist and yet at the same time I really knew because I had tried out there careers that I did not want to do anything else so thank you to all of you for listening and for finding value in these interviews and I hope someday you will also enjoy reading my book before I let you guys and pass guests take over the show I want to thank all my past and current staff my sound engineer Chris Curran at fractal recording aleene's lb and Rayleigh and Gullah poly who have managed sponsorships for me Korn Fife and we're Holsinger Reddy who have helped me with research and editorial duties Jenny Joseph Sinha has helped me with all sorts of podcasting types of questions and Daniel knows who has helped me with my websites I also want to thank every single sponsor of the Unchained and unconfirmed podcasts on-ramp appreciates start engine Quan stamp bitwise consensus shape-shift token agency element group watching warehouse clear dpr transform group dACC alt lending block demon Abra We Trust cipher trace Microsoft and token soft and most of all I want to thank the guests and listeners the guests for gracing the show with their insights and for the most part answering tough questions with honesty and sincerity and to the listeners for making Unchained a success now I will let you guys take over the show hilariously the recordings you submitted did not get off to a good start this was the very first one I received I'm not sure what's funnier the fact that he started it with a cough or the fact that I don't do videos the second recording definitely wins most creative Ben from Los Angeles I am a devout fan of the great Laura Shin amid the hype of Wall Street chills and the flooding officials of Capitol Hill you've kept your listeners abundantly thrilled pedaling through toxic masculine ego sludge you helped educate us all to be our own judge of all the characters and clowns whose pissing contests make the charts go up and down you're sober an unwavering commitment to the TIC provides a calm and meditative effect it's like a yoga class for my ears hearing you describe the sprockets and gears decoding the elaborate mysteries of the crypto space enlightening us to every legitimate use case never too timid to stick it to the man always open-minded to the crypto anarchist revolution critiques rooted in deep financial wisdom embodying the truth and fairness of the Divine Feminine I'm code illiterate and only a wannabe geek but your podcasts are still the highlights of my week hash tag not investment advice but I tell friends and acquaintances alike if you want the best scoop on what's what and who's who invest your time getting schooled with unconfirmed and Unchained I promise you won't be fooled as for what I expect in 2019 I'll bet a lot of bad actors will be forced to come clean weak hands and bleak scams will be shaken out in bankruptcy courts many a start-up CEO will pout side-chains state channels and lightning networks will flow security tokens in game assets and virtual worlds will grow heroic dark web warriors will dissolve digital borders privacy coins will protect journalists and dissidents from the tyranny of corporate fascist iron fists retail investors will once again stampede frenzied by the fear of missing out and greed institutional money will buy bigger slices of the pie a new 1% will bribe regulators to comply maximalist will bet on which chains might fall traitors will get rekt in short squeezes and margin calls math are kissed uprisings will bring corrupt nation states to their knees rioting protesters will post QR code selfies if you ask me what really matters most is honoring what may be our dear beloved Satoshi's ghost I'll keep fighting to make her proud by sending peer-to-peer transactions through the unsensible cloud using electronic cash that will always be trustworthy and sound I absolutely love this submission if anyone knows Vikram Seth's writing I immediately thought of how he wrote the Golden Gate the Golden Gate inverse and I think it takes a special talent to do that so thank you Ben nice recording is one of my favorites similar to how my interview with this guest for the podcast is quite possibly my favorite hi this is cz from Finance I want to say congratulations to the 100th episode of orange and is one of the toughest interviews I've ever been to I have no idea how the other 100 people made through it but congratulations is one of the most interesting podcasts 2018 was well was equally tough but I think the builders have been building in 2018 but for 2019 I think we will see a lot of real products and real applications coming onto the market before I fully turn the reins over to you all I'll end this bit with my predictions for 2019 I'm feeling right now like a lot of ideas I've heard from my smartest sources about where the space would go could be upended one area in which the conventional wisdom might be turned on its head at least temporarily could be decentralisation I'm starting to wonder if we will see centralized companies and projects do well now in this early wave of crypto adoption and then it remains to be seen whether or not decentralized projects really will went out in the end or whether the centralized projects will just dominate and these aren't predictions necessarily but I am also keeping in my eye on stable coins and gaming projects stable coins simply because a digital version of a dollar is something people can easily grasp and I feel like that's an important way to achieve actual utility particularly in payments and I think a lot of people could also end up just using a stable coin without even knowing anything about blockchains or caring about crypto or anything like that and I did notice right before recording this that I did see bloomberg reported that Facebook is working on such a thing for use in whatsapp so who knows stable coins could end up being one of the first so-called killer apps I'm also keeping my eye on gaming because as I've said before in previous podcasts the gaming community is one that already understands virtual goods in a conte digital economies so I think that industry is right for crypto but I am fully prepared to be completely surprised in everyone by how the crypto space develops this year the only prediction I can make confidently is that develops and developments in crypto will not be boring with that I'll hand it over to you all with your submissions I have mixed in recordings from past guests alongside the listener recordings I enjoyed listening to all of your thoughts who thinks again for sending them in without further ado I'll now let you take over the show hey this is Joey from Pantera capital an augur I think it's really cool that you decided to let people just kind of take over unconfirmed from this podcast episode and the 2019 I'm looking forward to launch of me two of augur which has support for die which still is that a dollar which is a pretty cool to see had successful scalable coin on the theory M in spite the fact that if ethers down roughly 90 percent cents a time they launched that's a it's hugely commendable and also looking forward to some scalability stuff start to launch the beginning of next year you know looking at things like armitron under also something kind of plasma stuff like what a gluon plasmas doing and it also blog throughout kind of on the networking layer it's not very many people focused on that but I think it's super important so we can actually hit some high throughput and guess what else the only other thing in 2019 that I'm excited for is both backed and wire or launching so back is a great you know institutional platform for people to get on board into crypto and then if you looked at wire they're making it so you can buy straight from your bank account for you know 10 to 20 basis points and on board on adaps almost like stripe but for decentralized apps so that will lower the onboarding friction for everybody you know over at EDX so I'm super excited for most things in 2019 it's going to be a great year of you know actually building and more importantly shipping cool tag hey Laura this is Karl Byers I'm a partner at f-prime Capital Partners I was an early and often crypto enthusiast and I love your show I would say that one thing your show is led me to realize is the importance understanding better privacy I used to be Cavalier and unconcerned and when you go down the crypto rabbit hole I think it now has the effect of making you think harder about the technology and the data and the companies you're interacting with and and generating and in a funny way I think it then turns us all into cyber punks or cyber punks as the case may be and so I think your conversations and your focus has actually changed the way I think about data which is really important given the euro we are just now entering so thank you for that my prediction would be that point solutions that people don't even know are related to crypto will be the first viral products and you will link more to this area of privacy around payments and messaging than currency have a great day hi this is Jill Carlson very excited to be participating in this hundredth episode my crypto prediction for 2019 is that this might be the year that we finally start to see some correlations with other asset classes we've already seen it coming into the close of 2018 as stock prices have taken a hit and crypto is followed and I think that we might start to see these inflows and outflows continue in this same vein but time will tell no price predictions for me here all right thank you hi Laura my name is Mina Claudius I'm from the New York City area and I've been listening to the show with great interest for a while now and as an attorney I really geek out when you delve into the complex regulatory and leave questions with your guests my prediction for 2019 is that regulated stable coins will continue to grow not just in market cap but I think in actual use in my mind stable coins offer the fast borderless payments that Bitcoin invented but without the volatility and uncertainty of Bitcoin I think there's a real opportunity to disrupt traditional money transmitters especially those that charge high fees to send money across borders and because the regulated stable coins are at the monster plea backed by actual US dollars I think people will have an easier time in adapting this technology especially if the wallets become easier to use Bitcoin will continue to hold its position I think as a sound money alternative but stable claims will be a gateway into full acceptance of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies looking forward to 2019 thanks hey Laura it's Karla Bernard C co-founder of Bank or protocol I hope that 2019 is the year that we stop looking at crypto currencies like assets and prices and we start looking at money as real utility for people there's got to be more ways to organize as a society than just governments and banks issuing currency as debt and renting it to people there are other ways that we can collaborate that we can coexist that really reflect our values and our potential and our purpose on this planet yeah I hope that we can build an economy that looks less like a casino and more like a house that's my hope for 2019 and my prediction is that user generated currencies will start to pave the way hey Laura this is William from Memphis Tennessee first happy 100th episode I discovered cryptocurrency and your podcast long law school my initial thoughts on cryptocurrency or that it was a digital money that was used for legal illegal and illicit activities your Unchained episode on the Road prosecutions of the DEA and Secret Service agent the feature Kathryn Hahn showed me that not only was crypto not primarily used for illegal activities was actually a bad choice for use in illegal activities my 20:19 prediction is that Bitcoin will move more toward being a species of something such as inequity or bonds and be farther away from being perceived as money I expect to see more leverage trading in the future with more institutional players coming into 2019 and with a more debt enhanced crypto market I believe crypto currencies such as Bitcoin may become interest rate-sensitive thank you for providing such great podcast and again happy 100th episode hi Laura my name is Katya I'm a partner at the private crypt investment firm b2b capital based in the US California first of all congratulations with hundred podcasts it's amazing I cannot believe that I've listened to that many podcasts because I have listened to pretty much every episode of unchanged since I started working in crypto and I love your word because first of all it's like objective professional journalism which is really lacking in this industry as we all know and also it's entertaining and fun because you know how technical it can get pretty quickly if you dive into crypto so it's it's very cool that you keep it fun and human and very informative so yeah congratulations and talking about my predictions for 2019 well first of all it's hard to make predictions and I don't like that really because it's like you cannot get it right you are either wrong or lucky in that space but if if I have to talk about 2019 I would say it's probably going to be a slow building year and kind of boring and what I mean by that is that I think that technology is entered in the face where the market is not probably going to be impressed with the technological claims with the new consensus algorithms that's gonna provide new transactions per second and etc all theoretical all Android papers actually know it's I think it's gonna be time for building and to prove the technology so although like those unicorn projects like divinity like cosmos like polka-dots and cerium roller rolling out of proof of stake and all they're scaling initiate if they're all going to be rolled out in 2019 and they're gonna be battle tested may be attacked so we're gonna see this technology being rolled out testing and seeing if it's actually gonna work and if it's actually going to deliver to the use cases that it promised so that it will pass the way for 2024 the real-world use cases so I think like for the outsiders and for the non crypto people 2019 is probably gonna be boring we're probably not gonna see like here about sensational multi-billion dollar fundraisers or crazy market bubbles again but for the insiders I think it's gonna be exciting time so we're actually gonna see all this technology being played out in the real world and it's also the same for Bitcoin like I'm very excited about lightning Network too so we're gonna see all the things we're talking about we're gonna see them actually being used being tested and being implemented so I'm excited about the thousand 19 I hope you are too and I'm very curious to hear what your listeners have to say about this Cheers bye hey Laura Spencer ProGuard from blockchain capital here congratulations on the hundredth episodes a phenomenal milestone most of my contribution won't be too surprising to you or your listeners as I've been pretty consistent over the past few years but when I reflect on the past year and think about what's in store for the next few years a couple of things seem pretty obvious to me there's both the negative and the positive so let's start with the negative of what's in store for 2019 I guess the first thing would be that the so-called 3.0 smart contract platforms are going to launch in 2019 and I think they're essentially going to faceplant the supply of DAP developers is extremely limited especially relative to what's going to become an even more oversaturated market of smart contract platforms I mean there's already dozens of these platforms and dozens more of them are going to launch to lackluster demand in 2019 and ultimately I think there's neither the developer nor the user appetite to support this plethora of platforms and so almost all of them will fail to generate organic traction okay now to the positive side of things the first is that bitcoin is king and likely to remain so Bitcoin is digital financial infrastructure for a digital age and it's unlocking the multi trillion-dollar opportunity of programmable money and if we zoom out and we take a look at the macro level of what's going on here I think it will become increasingly clear over the next decade that the Bitcoin network is a supra sovereign institution for digital property rights it is a rules-based self arbitrating Court in fact it's likely the fairest most transparent and most predictable court in the world and in general I guess if I think about listeners considering how best to allocate time and capital within the industry I think time and capital spent on trying to recreate web apps on top of a blockchain like uber but decentralized or Spotify but on the blockchain that that time in capital will be poorly spent in contrast I think the highest return on time and capital spent within the industry will be on the development of crypto native financial applications built atop public block chains like Bitcoin in aetherium I think that's the massive opportunity that we have to look forward to I'll go ahead and leave it at that but Laura thanks again in congratulations on the hundredth episode hello my name is Preston Bowers I'm from Dayton Ohio I've been listening to unshaped since you were last on the daily tech news show and I've learned quite a bit not just about crypto but also about what makes a good interview you have on guests with varying degrees of experience being interviewed and that really showed me how an interview can shape my opinion of a company I have not become an expert in crypto in the past year but I appreciate unchanged for all that it has taught me and I want to share an observation I made the other day an article gathered opinions about what we are in for in 2019 and there was a pattern people talking about crypto as the technology had positive things to say although who referred to the value of crypto use negative language these two groups didn't seem to be opposing each other but they don't want the same thing out crypto currency with that in mind my prediction for 2019 are that a large majority of Finance and traders will continue to be wrong about the price while their focus from that hopefully we can get some innovative technology and improvements that will actually solve some of the problems were facing today hello Unchained congratulations on reaching the important milestone of a hundred episodes I'm Ren Kristensen co-founder and CEO of the mega foundation and I'm very excited that we actually also have our own anniversary coming up here at maker which is on December 18th the beta version of the dice table coin will have existed for exactly one year under live etherium maintenance and also really look forward to the launch of the full version of the system of the dice table horn coming in 2019 but so my prediction for the for the year of 2019 is that the general trend in the crypto space will start tipping towards products and services that focus on the intersection between traditional finance and their additional legal system bridging that together with the blockchain space so I think products and solutions like security tokens will be the stuff that drives the space forward much in the same way that the IC o---- did in the past couple of years hey Laura it's Taylor Monahan here from my crypto it's been almost a year since I was on your show and a lot has changed since then besides the price or because of the price it's been much much calmer and it's given us the opportunity to build for the future instead of putting out fires left and right I think that 2019 will be much of the same the builders will be heads down building the people in Twitter will be creating crazy crypto drama and Bitcoin will probably die a few more times but most importantly I think people will start delivering products that start to make the blockchain both usable and useful I know that's what we're working hard every single day and I'm so excited to see how the space continues to transform and to evolve we all have the opportunity to have a meaningful impact on the world around us and I'm so inspired by what people are building and what has yet to come so with that I hope you have a fantastic holiday and an even better 2019 video from Geneva Switzerland what was my favorite moment in your previous podcast well it was when Lauren was moderating a panel of singularity University and Bill bar height gave her the best advertisement anybody could ask for he said this was the best podcast in the space and was disappointed he hadn't been invited yet to speak what a great way to ask for an invitation I've learned a lot in the various podcasts I listen to them mostly when I commute I appreciate the Laura health and as guests who have major positions in the major firms in the space and so I learn a lot directly from the people at the top my predictions for 2019 well let's be optimistic and say 2019 is the year of the second killer app after Bitcoin to have a killer app we need something that is new I mean by that that doesn't shake the tree of an established market some sort of service or asset that is purely digital and doesn't have a problem of the real world enforcement's loyalty points are gaming or obvious targets but it could be something else also in terms of prices to me it really looks like we've seen compute the capitulation which is in the end of the Bitcoin cash ABC and Bitcoin cash as V war we see consensus this and steam it massively laying off it looks like the bottom is here happy 2019 you know this is Benny here from crypto kiddies hi everyone from the Unchained and unconfirmed community we've been a big fan of Lauren's podcast since day one we've been listening to it religiously to get the latest updates on what's happening in the crypto market or in the blockchain space always a big fan when Laura asks difficult questions to the projects it's one of those moments that we always share around the company into our network as well for us cryptic beauties or dapper labs we're looking to expand the team into we're really taking on the the approach of consumer adoption via NFC's and crypto kitties will be expanding into different areas and of course a lot more gameplay is to come we are working on a couple of new games and some new technology that is set to launch in March will speak probably more about it in February so we're really excited to introduce these to the community and for 2019 I think that there will be a ton of new projects both coming in from the gaming companies from messaging technology companies in Asia taking a stance on non-refundable tokens or blocking games so we're really excited to be part of this wave and to kick-start it and we hope that a lot more content creator it's a lot more artists a lot more people cv the value of using the blockchain for creativity and for fun ultimately thanks so much and I hope you guys have a Happy New Year and a happy holiday Cheers this is Melton Damaris and I'm really excited to be celebrating a 100th episode or unchanged first of all thanks to Laura Shen such an amazing podcast I've really enjoyed listening to it and you asked from the hardest-hitting question that I've heard so thank you for all that you do as we go into 2019 after a wild rollercoaster ride that has been 2018 in crypto I'm really excited to see 2019 and what it brings for me it's really about why we're doing this why are we all working on this why are we all time on this and for me in the world we live in now as I look at the news as I talk to friends as I had people our fear feeling and for me that Y has never been clearer I don't leave people deserve choice choices platform choice of money choice of story value choice have privacy choice of where and how to engage a choice of ideology people deserve to have choice and to me Bitcoin represents choice I hope 20:19 for industry with a changing culture for an industry really one where we can educate and bring more people into the ecosystem and help them understand why they do have choice and to help them actually make that choice thanks Laura hey Laura this is Chris Walker here or token Ranger from sunny San Francisco I really like listening to your show and hearing your friendly but pointed questions that make the people talking to you squirm a little bit and I also like getting real-time updates from senators like Nidal Hollander with Dharma just to see what people are working on as they're discovering it something I think really is going to come out in 2019 is real on chained debt or credit and I think that because we have two things now that make it possible one stable coins they let us shift value backward or forward in time and two we've got some precedent for putting assets like equities on the blockchain so I think together those are going to mean 2019 shapes up to be an exciting year and either way hopefully the bear market ends so keep up the good work and things hi Laura it's Angela world's calling I am excited to get to comment once again so I feed 2019 being a big year for cryptocurrencies and blockchain generally I think that ethical issues are really going to come to the fore I think they will for lots of different parties in the space for academics regulators lawyers coders miners will be asking questions like who should actually hold crypto currencies to show their academics be able to hold them while they're doing research is disclosure enough to mitigate any conflicts that come from that relatedly I think we're going to see a focus on accountability and continued to figuring out when coders potentially should be liable for harms that are caused by their actions or inactions and maybe even miners so I I'm thinking accountability is going to be a big issue in 2019 in the larger sense I think we're going to see continued research and push to understand and you know maybe even City introduction of a central bank the digital currency from perhaps not one of the big central banks but maybe a more minor one and certainly I think businesses will probably continue to tamp down their expectations regarding private blockchains and I'm hoping that governments will as well I'm hoping that governments will Ashleigh catch up just business world in the hype cycle and take a more measured view of what blockchain can achieve for the world thanks very much happy holidays hi my name is Kyle Somani co-founder and managing partner at multi coin capital I've had the chance to get to know Laura over the last year and change and it's been amazing to watch her journey from Forbes and now spinning off and starting Unchained and unconfirmed those two are some of my favorite podcast and crypto it's been an honor to be a guest a couple of times on the show and I'm very excited to see what Laura's gonna do in 2019 speaking of 2019 I probably would predict that we are going to start to see some pockets of meaningful activity and usage of different blockchains things like ticketing and decentralized finance and gaming and a few other niches and verticals are gonna take off in a meaningful way and so when people say what if script I use for I think we're gonna have some good answers thanks so much and super excited for 2019 hi Laura this is one Cisco sorry CEO of SAP oh I really really enjoy your show and I'm very grateful for the service that you provide to the entire Pitkin community by having the show I can't believe it's been already a hundred episodes I don't have any interesting prediction for 2009 I think you will remain probably as part of this Bitcoin winter in which we work off the excess of 2017 until we wait for the next rally keep

social ecosystem for blockchain ecosystems our mission is to drive mass adoption of blockchain and cryptocurrencies across Africa by simplifying the whole process and creating real use cases it's a really exciting project and we'd love to share more details with you and hopefully pick your brain some time are usually essential unchained when I'm stuck in Lagos traffic which is if you don't know is the absolute worst traffic in the world it's so slow you're so aggressive and so annoying my favorite episode hmm that's a hard one every episode is filled with loads of nuggets and useful knowledge and insights however the fluffy Pony episode was really interesting as well as really funny my 2009 prediction is for the bear market to continue around the 3,500 mark until the end of the second quarter by q4 I expect the price to be around the 10 to 12 thousand dollar mark as the big institutions get involved on the market matures a little as a builder I'm more concerned about the social economic potential of blockchain I would love to hear more episode centered around Africa as well as how we go from 40 million users to global mass adoption overall keep up the great work and I hope you have a Merry Christmas and a fabulous new year bye hi Laura congratulations on a hundred episodes my name is alia I live in London where I work at enigma securities where cryptocurrency OTC brokerage firm thank you so much for the great show I like to listen when I'm on my way to work in the morning you help me do my job better by staying on top of the latest debates in the space in 2019 I think we will see crypto start to gradually recover from levels as more and more institutional asset managers start to allocate some of their resources towards crypto while I do think some of the headlines out there saying that though it's going to be a sudden rush of institutional money because of backed or fidelity or in exaggeration I do think that those solutions will start to boost adoption and will have a gradual increase that has a steady effect over time many asset managers see crypto as yet another way to diversify in an increasingly volatile and difficult market while I'm doubtful that we'll get one any ETF approval by the SEC would be icing on the cake I also think we're going to see increasing consolidation in the space with respect to tokens and the quiddity providers this has been a tough year and now I'm just excited to see what next year brings if you want to find out more about my company you can find us at enigma securities i oh that's Eni GMA - Security's got iya thank you so much and congratulations Laura hi this is andy grammer - coinless I'm always excited when Jane comes out we're in such a young industry and that means that brilliant new ideas are constantly being generated but there just isn't enough discussion about them laura has managed to keep a constant cadence of dialogue and debate about these topics so I can always stay up-to-date with latest so for that we owe her a big thank you for 2019 prediction I think that everyone is going to calm down a lot crypto goes through a cyclical high pattern and I'm expecting 2019 to be characterized by the smart participants in the space going head Zemin building well the bad participants flounder and likely fail we'll see increasing professionalization of the industry as well as better consumer engagement but it'll happen in a calm and reasonable environment that said as if anything in crypto it's impossible to truly know with future holds thanks again tomorrow hello my name is Mark finesse and I'm a partner at block you capital we are a crypto asset investment firm based in Chicago I want to say congrats to Laura on a hundred episodes spanning over two and a half years that's quite an accomplishment and I can still remember when Unchained was the only crypto podcast that I was subscribed to my favorite episode of Unchained has to be the episode Chris Byrne in ski and Adam white from July 2016 I think that this episode has laid some of the groundwork for the institutionalization of this s class that we've seen transpire in the last two years my prediction for 2018 is simple Bitcoin a crypto will receive a lot less mainstream attention but that we will continue to see on tree an adoption metrics increase regardless of this Thanks hello this is my and a walker from New York City I love unfeigned and recommend it to all my crypto and wannabe crypto friends my favorite shows by far episode 58 Ripple's XR Pui its chances of success are low simply so informative with hard-hitting facts Thank You Laura always um my prediction for 2019 may be a bit obvious but I believe 2019 will be the year of institutional investment in crypto the recent news of fidelity and Goldman Sachs confirmed that trend and I'm hoping to see the birth of a regulated crypto ETF thanks very much Lauren hey Laura this is Joe Waltman from give crypto wishing you a very happy holiday and new year my prediction revolves around crypto utility activity I think it's gonna happen in earnest in 2019 but it's not gonna happen where most people think ie North America or Western Europe stay tuned I'm Alison McCauley and I'm the author of unblocked how blockchains will change your business which is coming out in January one of my favorite episodes is episode 70 you were joined by Chris Dixon and I love some of his words so much that I actually quoted him in the book from the show he said we need to grow the army we need 10 million people programmers and researchers and entrepreneurs and product designers and creative people I was reminded of this while reading Kevin Kelley's book the inevitable Kevin Kelly's a founder of Wired and he says all of us every one of us will be endless newbies in the future simply trying to keep up he talked about how we're morphing so fast and our ability to invent new things out pieces the rate that we can civilize them and how it takes us a decade to develop a social consensus on what these new technologies mean and what etiquette we need to tame it and I think that's especially true of that this space and we need more people and different kinds of people thinking about how to do that well I really do think that Unchained helps listeners tap into this world as it morphs I wrote unblocked because of the huge gap in what the crypto and blockchain community saw in our future and what people outside of the community understand for a decentralized future to become reality more people need to get this vision more people need to understand and some my prediction for 2019 is that this is the turning point where we need to extend the community in order to effectively weather this this winter that we're in so keep telling stories of progress and keep being open about the challenges and bringing in more minds to help solve them whether these new minds are joining the army or they're simply demanding a better digital future for them and for their children we need to build this literacy when I talked to people who are new to the space which I do quite a bit I tell people to start with your blockchain 101 episode in which Elaine's lb turns the tables on you and interviews you I think it's a great place to start but I encourage people to really work their way through all of the episodes thanks Laura hi my name is Dylan I currently help out with our University's cryptocurrency Club at Carleton University in Ottawa Canada and I'm a longtime listener of your show I usually put on your podcast when busing to college every morning as blockchain begins to reach a more mainstream audience it becomes all that more important that journalists cover these projects and stories in an ethical and accessible manner I became a dedicated listener after two specific episodes the gender imbalance in crypto back in march and all things crypto economics in early April so my prediction for 2019 a big story next year will be about the development of more interoperable block chains and moving towards a more decentralized internet or web 3.0 Congrats again on your 100th episode and make sure to stop by Ottawa the next time you're up in Canada hi my name is Jim from Seattle my favorite parts of unchained happen almost always about 3/4 of the way through the episode when Laura switches from throwing softballs to asking the hard questions it almost inevitably occurs and the guests who usually aren't press trained start to squirm and get uncomfortable and often the most interesting aspects of the show happened then so keep up the journalism Laura and I don't have a prediction for crypto in 2019 but I'm sure it will continue to be a great ride hey Laura congratulations on your 100th episode this is Connie at bit give and it's been a pleasure talking with you over the years about our work at McGill and most recently the launch of our give track platform and I'd love for your listeners to check it out at give track org and see the four awesome NGOs we have on the platform fundraising in Bitcoin and using the Bitcoin network leveraging all the awesome benefits of the technology we have been really excited to demonstrate a real use case of Bitcoin and the Bitcoin blockchain through work with nonprofits and we're very proud to have our new platform live and to have four or more we have more coming soon NGOs and projects up on the site in time for the holiday season and also for your listeners who might be looking for not only a way to give back this season but also a way to offset their gains or have a tax deduction it's also that time year so we a bit give or wishing everyone a very happy holiday season and a happy new year and we'll see you all soon hi Laura this is Hugo Nodin CEO and co-founder at lgo markets I'm calling you from lgo markets New York office and the whole team and I wanted to thank you for these hundred podcasts my favorite part of your show is learning behind the scene details about the different companies that you invite such as fidelity staff trading bitcoins against bagel in their own cafeteria our vision for 2019 we think that there will be a bit much needed clean to the market and rationalization of the of the understanding of what blushin can bring to the financial services looking forward to 2019 and discussing with you Thank You Laura this is Jimmy song and I wanted to give a little bit of a shout out to Laura Shen she's a fellow Korean American and I appreciate what she's been able to do with you know getting crypto out there and sort of explaining things in a way that the common person can understand so really appreciate you Laura as far as my prediction for 2019 I predict that Joe Lubin will still not have completed his bet with me and that he will continue to avoid any mention of the bet or deflect or say say sorry excuses even though he's promised to he's the one that initiated the bet and so on so that's my comment hopefully you guys remember what that was all about right hello Laura this is Mike McClung I'm with Bloomberg intelligence and I'm the commodity and crypto strategist here and I'm probably one of your biggest fans I'd like to debate that with some of your other fans I listen to every word almost every word that you every podcast that you broadcast and I very much like them both Unchained and confirmed I especially like the most delays with Mike Novick rats partly because I'm at Bloomberg and we did launch an index with him the Bloomberg Galaxy crypto index I love your podcasts I find them very helpful in forming our viewers and we just launched our kryptos outlook for 2019 and the headline is Bitcoin and crypto she bounces along the road to lower base so we're looking for lower prices in the markets more gleaning of some of the Kryptos mm tradable seems quite extreme kind of looking for a range a maximum range in Bitcoin around 1565 minor I think it's very unlikely to get AB up there but I like to separate Bitcoin from the others I really view Bitcoin as digital gold in my and introduction to the space really came from comparing Bitcoin to gold and it has those qualities that most of the other Kryptos don't have but overall we view the speculative excesses as still need to be cleaned out volatilities way too high and most our indicators show that prices continue lower but next year we should see a decent base forming but don't expect the kind of one that 10x 100x as we've had in the past so thank you very much I really appreciate everything you do and thank you for helping us to contribute goodbye hey Laura my name is Paula Paul from New Jersey and I love listening to your podcast on my commute to my internship almost every morning and my 2013 crypto spaced prediction would be that people will start focusing more on the blockchain technology itself rather than the actual cryptocurrency and the prices and whatnot and I think this will definitely be a positive in the space thank you hi I'm what will be Craig budget 2015 we saw the ICM model die in theory and play around the absent organs go to zero and yeah see 20 projects can you even see in the creative business models just to avoid regulation integrates plays and grab the cash delivering news there is reinforced I believe that the blockchain to have on future isn't a quick fix it's going to take decades patience and longevity to build and in adoption absolutely similar to the internet which was founded work in 1969 but didn't see method option until decades later even though many of the people who worked on the Internet's have saw the applications that we use today took years for the technology to support funding for consumers to adopt it the takeaway here is that only blockchain projects a strong governance systems of the long run on them will survive 2019 and beyond contrary to popular opinion 2019 is not going to be about exciting new ways to use blockchains it's going to be about which cryptocurrencies that are fundamentals right organize their collective intelligence and can enjoy the generations and used by ignorant prospecting just like during the dot-com bubble endurance matters those who survived the dot-com crash stepped all of those who ran out of gas it's going to be those projects that came to dominate the space thanks hey Laura this is Jana fanucci first-time caller longtime listener and previous guests you're doing a great job love the show been listening since episode one and my prediction for 2019 is crypto currencies will get an even bigger focus by the public because Iran is going to release its national crypto currency and everyone's going to try to figure out what that means for sanctions Alaura it's not from Perth Western Australia I'm a huge fan of both your podcast and listen to them as soon as they come out I really like that you're intelligent your questions are really intelligent and pointed you're not afraid to challenge people but you do it in a way which is polite and a little bit self-depreciating and and not threatening so it's a yeah I really like the way you present your questions and content and I've learned a lot here Australia I run what I think is Australia's first good asset fund and I'm always sharing your podcast out to my clients I listen to them when I'm on my bike when I'm in the garden walking around the house or whenever I've got a spare moment and it's it's always them for to them I think the other thing too is you a great example and I shared this also with friends and colleagues of what new media is going to look like you're pretty much independent and it seems to be working out for you economically and I think you're enjoying it sounds like you're enjoying what you're doing and I think that's what's going to happen with media across the board that people are going to be deep subject matter experts in Pacific areas and even within crypto you could be a bottle you could be there's many many different areas of deep subject matter expertise in just in blockchain as a general topic and that's what's going to happen I think and you're really pioneering in that as well so congratulations arty on that in terms of 2019 predictions I'll stay away from price but I think institutional adoption what prediction is that it's going to be a little bit slower than people are hoping I think private blockchains are probably going to get a bit of a boost in 2019 and towards the end of 2019 and 2020 I think public bot trends will start to emerge a bit stronger and price will start to improve also towards 20 at the end of 2019 2020 but during 2019 our tech side I think it's just going to be slow steady solid growth which is really what we want we're still we're going to remind ourselves in a number of your guests always do this in fact you I think you will say this as well well you know we're really in the first first few minutes of the first quarter of the game for the whole season so it's still very early anyway congratulations on all you've done so far looking forward to continuing to to hear from you and I'm great all that I season all the best bye hey Laura this is Prateek from Pune India congratulations only 100th episode I'm sorry it has been a great journey for you as much as it has been for us listeners I think I have recommended Unchained and unconfirmed to everyone who has asked me about blockchain and cryptocurrencies I don't know if you remember we briefly met at he'll summit and consensus in New York City earlier this year and you were great at both the events I do not have a like one favorite episode because I've enjoyed listening to almost all of them but I can definitely point out the interviews with Navarre ravikant Orlov Carson from poly chain capital and cz from finance it'd be great to have them again I believe Krypto is here to stay and in 2019 we will see amazing gaps coming up in the range of three to five at least in terms of learning I don't know any other platform blog or You Tube channel giving me so much knowledge that you haven't compassed in this podcast the kind of questions that you come up with are really enticing so keep doing what you're doing and wish you all the best hi it's kathleen brakeman I just wanna say congratulations to Laura on all 100 of her shows or episodes I like all of them except for the one that I'm on because I hate the sound of my voice in 2019 I'd like to see well I think we're going to see a lot of innovation across the cryptocurrency space specifically in new mechanisms for consensus and for that I could not be more excited so happy New Year to everyone and keeps the episodes going more thanks Laura this is Alan Cohn and on behalf of Jason Weinstein and I Steptoe and Johnson the blockchain Alliance and the Steptoe cyber law podcast we want to wish you a warm and great congratulations on your 100th episode terms of a cryptocurrency projection for 2019 we see this as the year of the regulator continued actions by regulators in the US and elsewhere to clarify how their regulations do or don't apply to crypto assets and blockchain technology more generally admittedly that's going to be tough for some but the industry will come out on the other side stronger than ever before so again on behalf of all of us here congratulations Laura on your 100th episode hi Lara is Josh from origin protocol here and we're big fans of your show here origin and want to say thanks for all you do to educate and entertain us each week and congrats on your 100th show what an amazing milestone it's hard to choose a favorite moment from this year but we've enjoyed hearing from so many of our friends people in the industry like Chris Dixon Joey Krug and other founders we know personally when guys from Darla and Danny from trust token and and so many more and apologies in advance for shameless plug but my prediction for 2019 is really around what we're building at origin after all we saved the best way to predict the future is to create it so 2019 will be the year but we start to see initial adoption of truly peer-to-peer marketplaces on the blockchain these blockchain powered marketplaces will have lower fees will be censorship resistant so it can't be shut down by overzealous regulators and they're going to be available to billions of people on this planet who can't use existing centralized marketplaces for lack of a bank account or a credit card at origin we've been asking ourselves this question all year what if what if we could replace multi-million dollar companies like uber and everyby with open-source protocols that aren't owned or controlled by anyone what if we could create marketplaces that are governed by a set of fair and open and transparent rules instead of ease corporate rulers now we're not going to replace those companies in 2019 but I believe we're gonna start seeing the first glimmers of what's possible we're shooting to see 1000 finalized transactions on the origin platform in just the first quarter of 2019 and I hope that many of your listeners will come and participate and buy and sell something using our marketplace tap and experience a future for themselves happy holidays Laura and 12 listeners and congrats again on achieving such a huge milestone we'll see you in 2019 hello Lauren my name is Edward Johnson and I come from Toronto I really like the way you use charm grit and precision to interview your guests because you get down to those core issues in a future episode I'd like to actually hear an interview with the creators of SIA or Storch you know those file hosting technologies Thanks what up on Shan podcast my name is Philip I'm from Sweden but I'm currently in the snowy and pretty cold Bucharest Romania I would like to give a thank you for all the good quality and all the good content of 20000 and 18 they are thanks unchained my favorite episode was the one with the by Nance when you interviewed him it was real really good my predictions for 20,000 and 19 for next year is that this really startup can a new startup in the space called Crete crypto coin that is to create crypto see you dot I am will be really big and I think everyone should go and get the wrong currency because the guys behind a great crypto coin is amazing so thank you Laura for an amazing year and I'm looking forward to the next one shares hi Laura this is Paul Walsh from metasearch I'd like to say thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to sit down and talk to you about cybersecurity in the crypto world 90% of all data breaches worldwide start with phishing and so it was a great opportunity for me to talk about how people can avoid phishing scams because a lot of people actually end up getting in touch with me via Twitter and our telegram group and by email to say thank you because they enjoyed the interview I did with you and as a result of that they install our software so they're less likely to fall for phishing scams which means fewer couples breaking up over financial issues and more kids going to college next year so thank you so much I love this show I loved in particular your interview with cz from finance love lives listening to your show on drives and a prediction for 2019 I predict crypto currencies as in I cos will continue to find life difficult we'll see some really great projects coming out and I also predict that fishing will continue to be a challenge because it's actually the biggest cybersecurity problem outside of crypto so it's not going to change for crypto people any time soon so thank you very much much love from the medicine and our community thank you and hope you have a great holiday and a fantastic 2019 hi Laura Veda I am from Chicago and I've been listening to your podcast Unchained and unconfirmed for the past six months it's very educational and you have got some bright and the best people into your interviews in the cryptocurrency space I especially enjoyed the once a Charlie retelling veterans and others thank you for a very enlightening and educational podcast you know system evals anyway I am interested in the blockchain healthcare use cases because I'm a practicing physician and I would envision more and more use cases of blockchain in health care including portable electronic medical records interoperability counteracting the opioid epidemic and the caramel problem of drug shortages in the healthcare industry for 2019 predictions I think these security token offerings will be a big boost to the crypto space tokenizing the Securities stars dividend work back and if that becomes successful I am also thinking the security based derivatives like that ETS or index funds would be popular and the rating agencies just like a morning star or securities or a stretched sheet like what Ian Berliner does hello Laura my name is Carey Helen I hail from Poughkeepsie New York and I would like to congratulate you on your 100th podcast I'm relatively new in the blockchain arena and your podcast I look forward to hearing them every week I'm really fascinated by your your guests and the conversation being from the creative field I'm a photographer my interest in the blockchain is is copyright management I would like to get photographers and artists involved again their work on the blockchain again congratulations and more success in the coming year thank you hey Laura this is Steve from NYC Steve on the school flash at Twitter I have two reasons why I love the Unchained podcast number one the most interesting and permanent guests for the blockchain a crypto space too you always ask the best questions to keep people honest crypto prediction for 2019 more regulation and volatility until q4 where we'll see Bitcoin and ether lead the charge into 2020 to the promised land thanks so much lemme show looking forward to 2019 hello Laura this is Vladimir yellow Sobchak calling from New York City just wanted to weigh in 2019 love your show I think my favorite episode is Jeremy lair Shawn Neville why crooks it will be bigger than the web you know at 71 my prediction for 2019 is that first half 2019 will be very difficult and still will be painful for a lot of people in the market and it's just going to be I think pretty tough first half second half we'll see what happens next by Laura this is Brian from Smith and Krantz on behalf of myself and the team here we wanted to say congratulations on a hundred episodes and wishing you the best of luck on whatever comes next as far as 2019 goes we see this as an era of infrastructure and information systems for the industry it couldn't be more excited about what comes next best of luck and use the 2019 Emily Coleman CMO of shapeshift congratulations to Laura in the unseen team for the hundredth episode looking forward to the year ahead learning more about all the things that the crypto Universe has to teach us coming out of really great minds over there at Unchained hey Laura this is Adam Hurwitz from San Francisco California first Congrats on the hundred episodes I recently started listening to the Unchained podcast as I'm building a discovery up for cryptocurrency news called coin verse and Unchained is one of the great sources I found my predictions for 2019 are that to the first few killer apps will finally emerge a few potential projects could be Braves web browser which I'm currently using and is faster than the competitors in that space I think 0x is decent does exchange has potential to win in that sector and be widely adopted and I also think V chain is well-positioned with their consulting partnerships to deliver solutions in the supply chain and logistics space that being said there's still a good chance that 80% of projects not delivering a usable solution in the short term will drop off but the overall growth in the area will grow at a more sustainable and set your pace than in 2017 hi Lawrence Angelo trainee in San Jose California keep up with your interviews the more diverse your guests are the best perspective we have and more educated our investment will be once Jess and I have is that to have your guests disclose some of the coins that they're holding so Majoris have learned from them most likely they do have a better perspective on which coins will do well that's where next year I don't have a prediction I just hope that the coins will go up as long as it goes up I'm happy thank you hey this is cryptography tea Laura Congrats on a hundred episodes seems like only yesterday you were forgetting to take yourself off mute putting the headphones on backwards it all seriousness thanks for the great content love listening to you when I'm working in the studio yeah here's to the next hundred hey this is Dan from LA I don't know if this is the Laura chant at large in 100 bucks but I like
