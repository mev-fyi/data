and insolvency and Thomas Brazil founder and CEO of 507 Capital welcome wasi and Thomas hi Laura I honestly I'm glad to be back but not really thanks for having me on totally get it to catch listeners up since Friday's episode we'll just start with a very basic development that prompted this episode which is that FTX FTX us and Alameda as well as other entities totaling about 130 altogether are all filing for bankruptcy there are more than 100 000 creditors and according to the block there's 8.7 billion dollars in assets however it looks like also a good chunk of it is missing why don't we start with just what the basic bankruptcy process will look like um sure I guess I'm like the American bankruptcy person here less crypto more bankruptcy uh so they filed in Delaware not that surprising I guess people were maybe thinking since they were Bohemian or predominantly Bohemian that they would file in the Bahamas the Bahamian cases I've been involved in were not pretty for a number of reasons I think the the laws are a bit restrictive and and I actually I'm glad they filed in Delaware or at least in the states the chapter 11 process is very used to dealing with complex sophisticated cases you have Voyager in Celsius already going on in southern district of New York this is Delaware there won't be many differences there are some uh differences in how things are interpreted from like federal district to Federal District but for the most part it's you know federal bankruptcy law I don't know if we want to go into this but the the petitions were basically empty which is uh pretty shocking you don't always see that it shows you the speed with which the whole thing unraveled or at least the maybe the unorganized nature with which the FDX was even run you know with like not real proper governance structure boards things like that in place so the there's a lot of information that hasn't come out I'll just talk about the bankruptcy side the petitions are generally filed with petitions board resolutions you have your top 20 or 30 creditors depending upon the district you're in so it's all top 20 creditors unscreen creditors and then you normally have a whole slew of what are called first day motions as well as a first day declaration from the CFO or CEO or founder of majority shareholders or something like that some executive officer of the company none of that stuff was there they're all blank just we're gonna file here's our emergency petition we've got no information you know to file here this morning and you know we just need protection now I assume it was because of the back door of the Bahamas people basically taking money off uh through the Bahama either accounts or I guess or some nft swapping that allowed people to take money off as well uh through the Bahamas so people were there was a real little subunit of people that were doing this and maybe a lot of you maybe have some more color than I do on that but those are things they're missing and we could talk more about the bankruptcy but yeah I think we'll probably expect to see some of the documents sort of emerge over the course of this week which would actually be very very helpful for sort of understanding what state they're in right now because everyone just has like speculation to this point as to you know what happened people probably have a reasonably good idea at least uh you know the structure shots have come out the balance sheets have come out you've got a reasonably good idea but there's still some questions sort of floating around as to exactly how big the hole is so to speak where where the whole list is very important as well what assets and what liabilities are in there where where they sit at 8 FTX us it takes International Alameda these are all very important points which I think will start seeing as these filings come out over the course of hopefully this week but I completely agree with Thomas I think they pretty much said whether binance deal fell through I think Sam was sort of running around trying to find emergency liquidity you know bits and blobs um trying to keep things running a little bit that's why it was a very strange traum facility maybe we can discuss the later Thomas I'm not sure how what you make of that it just look like you know adding even more an even Messier structure construct into a very very messy structure and then as you say the Bahamian loophole was probably the one where you know it we need protection now freeze everything let's go from there but but obviously they froze everything and then they got hacked for 450 million so Jesus yeah yeah I mean the Tron thing I wasn't totally following the new slow on that it seemed to me that it I don't know if Capital actually left the entity it's clearly within What's called the preference period clearly like either a preference or fraudulent transfer so anything that left will be clawed back the same probably with these Bahamian uh offshoots we can unpack that at some point we'll Define what is that preference period so in in the Bahamas it's actually a six-month look back but I have a feeling that we'll be going by the 90-day preference period under the bank U.S bankruptcy code which is like if you want to Google it it's 546. no excuse me 547 of the bankruptcy code the bankruptcy States generally when when you file this thing called the estate is created and that state has you know many powers or two large avoidance Powers as they call them or preferences and fraudulent transfers a preference is a preferential payment made within 90 days of the petition and a fraudulent transfer is basically a transfer uh within two years that was for their other prongs to this but let's just keep it simple for not like non-equivalent in value like you know I gave you a hundred dollars you only gave me 50 back in value or donations to democratic parties there's one right there so very likely to be a preference marginal transfer I I would love to discuss the um sort of preference and clawback issues in a lot more detail I mean I get a lot of DMS about it a lot of very sort of sensible intelligent people are asking those questions right now it is complicated because of the way FTX structured the terms there is a world where it's not a sort of preferential payment or creditor because you're never credited in the first place um I think we can unpack all of that but I don't know Laura do you want to start start us off with how we got here and maybe we start talking about you know what what is happening within the three entities or three groups if you will and how we even ended up in this state so we did a big show on Friday about everything that happened which is why I I started with the bankruptcy but yeah I'll give a little bit of the background um essentially Sam finkman freed has two or had two companies one was the trading firm Alameda research and then the other was the exchange FTX and for the longest time you know the last time he was on my show I did ask him about you know this kind of apparent conflict of interest and he said you know they're two separate entities yes I own both but you know um just they don't there's like a wall between them and actually other people that I've interviewed um who interacted with them like third parties said that their interactions were that FTX and Alameda were very different in their minds so that was really interesting essentially a few weeks ago coindesk reported on the financials of Alameda and it showed that alameda's balance sheet was heavily reliant on ftt tokens which were tokens created by the FTX exchange they offered kind of like discounts and stuff uh for activities you would do on the exchange and it was you know to the point where it showed like basically this is a very illiquid balance sheet um you know if they were to actually try to recoup um what they're showing here uh value-wise on their balance sheet it you know it wouldn't work and CZ uh the CEO of Finance happened to have 580 million dollars of ftt tokens on finances balance sheet because years ago he had invested in FTX and once they became competitors Sam bought him out of his stake and part of the payment was an ftt token so CZ tweeted that he was going to be selling his stake and Caroline the Caroline Ellison the CEO of Alameda research tweeted I will buy your ftt from you at 22. and so of course because it's crypto Twitter everyone was like what's the importance of twenty two dollars yeah so essentially um Susie said no we're not going to do this in a closed doorway I'm going to sell all the tokens um on the open market and the FDT price kind of held up for a short while but then it began to collapse and people became concerned about their funds on FTX so there was a bank run and later Sam said that it was five billion dollars of Ft of sorry of customer deposits that were being withdrawn on the Sunday alone which was Sunday I guess November 6th and he during that time was you know saying things like assets on FTX are fine The Exchange is fine we're just processing withdrawals blah blah blah and then we all woke up last Tuesday morning to the news that things were not fine and they actually needed potentially binance to buy them to you know resolve their what did that time maybe people might have thought were liquidity issues then ultimately um after binance backed out um it became very clear that this was much more than than something like that and not only that it was insolvency but it was likely fraud there's a lot more details around how I so this this has been reported by other outlets um I don't remember which but the I think the three that to my mind have been have had the most Scoops are like Reuters and the Wall Street Journal so uh Bloomberg as well so um you know I'd remember which Outlet reported which scoop but you know some of them were saying things like that Sam had this little back door that enabled him to co-mingle the FTX and Alameda research funds and that at some point Alameda suffered from the contagion from last spring and because they were in the whole FTX lent them um I think it was like eight billion or 10 billion dollars of customer funds I don't remember the exact number and what Alameda did was put up collateral and ftt so um I think that you know is is at least part of the issue you know I read other things saying that actually this you know co-mingling of of customer funds with alameda's trading activities happen even before um you know not I'm not clear on that I didn't report on that in particular what ended up happening was that people that still had their money on the exchange were freaking out and that's when we had the shenanigans around people trying to um get kyc'd I guess and so once they could kind of you know once they had the paperwork showing that they were Bohemian or or some you know through some other way they could do that then they were able to withdraw funds May maybe illegally you saw this all go down on Twitter with people tweeting at them literally things like you know don't do this here what you're doing is illegal but anyway yeah then ultimately Friday morning is when we woke up to hear the the news that FTX FTX us and Alameda amongst the other 130 entities were going to file curiosity why do you guys think that you were able to get out the back door with uh the Bahamas I mean my seat would be suspicion when I was reading the Bahamian and solvency code is that any customer that has their account sort of Frozen could could have involuntarily filed FDX down in the Bahamas that was my only suspicion of why they would allow people in the Bahamas to continue to withdraw yeah the Securities Commission released a statement on Saturday saying that actually is wait sorry so so I guess on Friday FTX had said something like they were being ordered by the Bahamian commission to enable Bahamas customer switzerall and then the Bahamian commission the Securities Commission on Saturday released a statement saying that they had never ordered that thing in that FTX it is just on these involuntaries they can they could really create jurisdictional issues and I've seen you know like big debtors uh getting a little little fights over you know if there was a an involuntarily filed in a foreign jurisdiction or even in the States but in the wrong District that you didn't want to be in uh across it creates a real havoc and then you can end up like splitting up the estate in this instance we were talking about it earlier with all the co-mingling of assets because there really was this back door and the balance sheets were all kind of slushing around together to either fill each other's holes or or even in a real way or in a fake way I mean the states really need to be substantially Consolidated or anyway they probably will be but we can talk about that well let's just talk about it right now so given all the facts that we know at the moment which obviously things are still coming out I mean this just looks so messy right there's the one to two billion dollars in assets that are missing there's you know the 130 entities there's the sheer number of kind of weird assets that they're listing here um which I can you know give some detail on that but I was just curious for your overall take like at the moment you know what do you think are kind of the main Flags what do you think you know given what we know now like uh will happen in this process okay um so my take in it is I've seen that structure chart of 130 entities on it and I mean the First Reactions is not that bad like I've seen frauds and restructurings and bankruptcies with like 900 a thousand over Anthony's on it so I must say I was able to make some sense of it and sort of be able to sort of carve that up into sort of broad groups so I think broadly what you have here is you have your um under the the bit that says West realm shy is that's your us FTX U.S arm and then you've got your Alameda stuff and all the Alameda Ventures which is another sort of group in itself and then you have the FTX International Group which has all of the weird you know companies in Germany Nigeria Singapore Switzerland Etc under it when you look at the sort of the back door as you call it well Sam was right in the sense that they are separate entities legally that's right he wasn't lying right FTX trading Limited in Antigua is a different entity from Alameda research but there is a there are a lot of agreements between Elemental media research and FTX limited if you look at the structure charters on the ft and the the big one there is the intercompany loan agreement and I suspect and I'm very sure that it is this intercomplete loan agreement that's created this massive hole in the FTX balance sheet because look if we think about it and if Alameda and FTX will actually separate a bank run on FTX would not I mean sorry uh Alameda going in insolvency wouldn't have affected FTX correct the fact that um the background happened and FTX went under mandate Something Fishy was going on and what what was going on was that FTX was very very likely the Lander under this intercompany loan agreement to Alameda which is the borrower and as you say likely to bail at the meter of positions likely to finance Alameda bailing out Voyager and all these all these other guys that's it's very likely uh what has happened in and so when when customers now are trying to get their money or the creditors or whatever uh during what sounds like it's going to be a multi-year process um I'm curious like what is that loan agreement mean for them like are those funds considered alamitas because of the agreement or oh no no so essentially let's say let's just assume there's five billion dollars that's owing from Alameda to FTX right and what what needs to happen is that that position needs to be Unwound and the Alameda needs to pay five billion dollars back to FDX now the question is whether Alameda has five billion dollars paid back to FTX if it did we wouldn't be in the spot of Border because Alameda will just hand over five million dollars of cash and FTX would hand it back to you know its customers the thing is Alameda is stuck in some very questionable and very illiquid assets which is making it very difficult you know to to to to to pay back on that loan I mean I mean personally my thinking as I've sort of shared a couple of times is that at some point a voyager like deal sort of makes sense uh makes makes sense um for someone to come and take out FTX and then sort of seek to liquidate Alameda because I think Alameda is dead it's gone it's not coming back and but do you think that will happen at some point I mean according to you so when when if you recall when Voyager went under FTX off it uh 72 cents on the dollar effectively the customers who that who could then sort of move over to the FTX platform um when they meet the bid recall initially there was a little bit of um it wasn't really done properly in that uh Voyager when it complained to the court that FTX had submitted a term sheet outside of the bidding process and so on so forth and in that letter which they filed to the court they said look we have over 80 interested parties so there needs to be a competitive process so it could well be the case that I mean if if there's 80 interest the bodies in Voyager presumably FTX which was you know if we take the Alameda out of it it was an exchange that apparently was operating at 250 million operating profit a year and had investors like you know soft bang Sakura BlackRock these are all big names in there so it was a very very functional business on its own and God knows why Sam decided he had to bend the bank and use customer funds to essentially fuel Alameda you should have just wound down Alameda at the moment everything you know in the fan so it's a touch on the Voyager process I think it was robust but just from people I've talked to probably a lot of people looking but very few people actually having the capital and the ability to transact so that's what I would worry about here and we can unpack this but you know 363 sales or auctions you know bankruptcy auctions it would be very tough from in my opinion given what I know of the other auctions uh to see a bidder actually show up so I'd love to see wazzy this was your idea I mean you know I think a tokenization an actual debt for Equity swap like the good old days and bankruptcy when says actually occurred that would be so interesting I really want to see that happen wait okay you you need to explain this to people like you guys are talking to each other but you need to talk to the audience so what's a 363 thing so it's it's I'm sorry it's the section of the bankruptcy code but uh the the Lays out what you do to run basically an auction for the assets so if you were going to sell your asses to the highest bidder I mean I'm not like a scholar on bankruptcy but the move in the last probably 20 plus years is don't bother doing that for Equity swap just do a 363 sale so just do an auction there's there's no evaluation fights we're just going to do an auction sell the assets the highest bidder wins and then we're going to liquidate out the estate they're called it's called I would call it the rise of liquidating 11. so in a chapter 11 which which these are you can get releases for third parties which everybody loves a release who doesn't want to you know release meaning you can't be sued uh and meanwhile the assets are still to the highest bidder that's what people pushing back with and Voyager with the gentleman Steve who is the founder and I'm sure Mission ski would love a release but I don't see that happening and and now that I would say the the premium buyer for these Assets in this restructuring cycle because let's let's go with the assumption that crypto's here to stay this isn't just like the end of crypto is because I it's I don't want to see people like that I don't want to go there just just turn on a different Channel um this restructuring cycle the large fire is gone I think the only real choice is the tokenization we're done has to be a tokenization but a debt for Equity swap so creditors become the owners of your business and there's some sort of tokenization feature which you know I think could be very very interesting and Ozzy and I were you go on going on Twitter back and forth I mean you know you do have codes in the bankruptcy uh section of the bankruptcy code that allows you to exempt security offerings uh to creditors okay yeah that is really interesting um let's talk about that later there's a few like really basic things I want to be sure we cover um so you know earlier when you talked about how it's being filed in Delaware not the Bahamas I was curious because you know much has been made about how FTX was not you know a U.S it was an offshore exchange um what does that mean for customers since you know we could presume that the majority I guess of FTX customers are not Americans does that mean anything for them or no yeah oh I mean I can probably try and take this one because I've had a lot of questions on this one when I when I said look FDA is going to go in chapter 11 and a lot of lawyers said they're going to go to chapter 11 and people started saying it's a Bahamian Anthony how can it go into chapter 11 etc etc all right so here's the ridiculous thing about chapter 11. basically every company in the world could probably go into chapter 11 if they wanted to because it's fairly it's very sort of well-established case law then apparently what you need to get into chapter 11. I don't know the exact uh of the statute um Thomas maybe knows what what the wording is but essentially you need to have property you need to have property in the U.S and apparently the definition of property in the U.S is so wide that if I had a company uh you know let's say in the UK or at a company in Argentina with no business in the U.S nothing in the U.S and I decide hey I want a chapter 11. I could just open a bank account in the U.S hire a U.S lawyer and now I've dropped in the US and that allows me to file for chapter 11. and why do I want the chapter 11 because the U.S courts the jurisdiction of the U.S courts um and that sort of the moratorium you get is a worldwide one you basically get a stay on all your liabilities across the world so you've got customers and you know um Hong Kong Singapore not Australia we can talk about it later um Europe so and so forth will become a claims to you anymore trade creditors guys who sponsor stadiums for everything stopped now you have time to sit down for I think it was a period of 120 days if if you want to take the 120 day exclusive period to figure out a plan so it gives you sort of space to think figure out what's going on get the Professionals in and and that is sort of why chapter 11 you know is is sort of so widely used it's incredibly expensive lawyers and the financial advisors is going to make killing out of this but it's probably a good thing given the circumstances and so talk about the answer really a bit what's happening there right I looked into this earlier and again this is not legal advice it's pure speculation etc etc but what's happened in the announcement is to say look we are putting everything in chapter 11 we're putting FTX Us in chapter 11 we can talk about FTX us later but we're carving out FTX Australia and that was very interesting to me because I got a lot of DMS from Australian guys going what's happening to me what's going on you can explain why are we screwed right and well the understand is I don't know what my feeling is it's probably a reasonably good thing I look back at a structure shot I look back at the terms of service which the Australian customers sort of entered into when transactive FDX and they haven't transacted the FTX trading limited they're the big FTS international company so as you will if it's all transacted the FTX Australian guy Australian entity which is a sort of a subsidiary so my hope at least with Australian guys best case scenario is that all the d-gen stuff that was happening with Alameda FTX International so and so forth didn't affect the Australian side of things and so when everything went down they went all right this is fine we can just put this into Administration wind it down potentially refer to the funds to use this potentially sell it to another Australian compliant exchange and the reason for that ironically is probably because of regulations because the Australian Regulators were could have could have been sort of stricter maybe that's why but this is potentially I don't know potentially good news potentially we'll see because I think the Australian administrators are moving quite quickly on it and according to some sort of tweets have been going around I think they're going to hear in like two days or something so but then what that means is the Australian customers um their funds will just be treated as their funds because you know we want like I don't know how this the missing assets plays into this like does everybody get kind of an even haircut or how does that work and then also it's not even just the missing assets but then as I kind of alluded to earlier you know for I don't know if people saw the the spreadsheet of taxes assets but I mean this this was kind of bananas to me um first of all we'll talk about the liabilities so the oh five billion dollars in USD they owe 1.4 billion dollars worth of bitcoin they owe 672 million dollars worth of ease there's like a whole bunch of other assets also in the liabilities I'm just calling out the big ones then um their liquid assets were 472 million dollars worth of hood Equity 200 million dollars of US dollars in Ledger Prime some other Staples in Fiat currencies um then it went into what they called less liquid tokens which was 550 more million 551 million dollars of ftt which probably needs to be zero um two billion dollars of serum again uh you know it's undergoing its own issues right now 982 million dollars of soul and then totally random coins that nobody ever heard of until this whole disaster happened and then hilariously under illiquid so they had Twitter Equity at 43 million dollars they had some coin called Trump lose that wasn't even on coin Cutco and it was listed for 7.4 million dollars and I was just like like I I was just like okay did a child make this up I don't know so if FTX creditors we're all hoping that Trump loses 2024 now so Sam can double up on the bed and add a seven million dollars to the uh bankruptcy estate yes uh you're you're probably correct about that but but so for the US so like given you know not only the whole but then what I just explained about the assets clearly people are gonna get back some fractions so for the Australian people especially if that moves more quickly like how do they know what fraction it will be unless they're the yeah how does that part all work so so so so so so what I think there's some questions but what is this balance sheet right like what are we looking at just are we looking at FTX International's balance sheet are we looking at alameda's balance sheet are we looking at some you know merged balance sheet which is weird to consolidate the balance sheets of two allegedly independent companies with massive Chinese walls between them is FTX U.S liabilities in this as well like this this there's a lot of questions here as to what this balance sheet actually is because when I looked at it those walls trying to understand as well like are all the liabilities customer deposits do we know this or do are there sort of you know loans with with other people are there sponsorship deal I mean there's a sponsorship deal for an arena like where where is everything right but what I can say is that this balance sheet I'm assuming it excludes the Australian entities because otherwise it would be part of the same process but but maybe I'm wrong like end of the day we didn't know what this Battleship you didn't style it off in large restructuring just from my experience you will see side load of affinities you're supposed to kind of respect the legal structure unless there's like hopelessly interconnected and the way YG is describing is like you have separate illegal entries but you might have intercompany loans going back and forth and so it's not like you don't have claims on anything it's just you know sometimes you'll have something siled off because regulatory reasons like I don't know like you'll have a group of entities in Australia that for whatever regulatory reason never touched anything and it's a small piece of the pie until FTX us right yeah FTX us that's siled off and when when when Sam first came on and said um FTX U.S uses a fine everything is back one to one that was somewhat believable right because he's going to DC his law being he's going to make sure at least his U.S side of things is completely clean before attempting something like that right and presumably it probably was a lot cleaner because if you look at again if you look at the structure shot you don't see the same amount of you know strange intercompany loans into company agreements between the US side of things and the um that the US other things and the sort of international side of things so it does make me wonder what you know the reasoning for putting the FTX us into the 11 is like you know is it to sort of realize some value out of that so he can pay off International creditors because what I did here um sort of in the rumor was that he was trying to sell FTX us and then use the proceeds of that to sort of fill the hole at the FTX International site maybe it's the case that FTX us had entered into loans you know like um was it the thing is block five enter into loans um and perhaps those credit support and therefore sort of you know it sort of poisoned everything and there was to some extent a little bit of um inter-company exposures in my abilities that not very sure but presumably the FTX U.S side is cleaner than the FTX International side and I was actually going to ask Thomas this like if it goes to an 11 do you think the FTX U.S customers are in a different class from the FTX International customers hey I'm sure they'll try to stay separate just like the Australian guys I mean you know I don't actually know because I haven't seen anything literally there's been nothing part of the mega View Court so it's pure speculation I worry that uh you're gonna see so much intertwined balance sheet hold plugging stuff that uh it's going to be impossible to to unwind yeah we really don't know I I mean what was in what was in FTX us honestly I don't know all right so in a moment we're we're gonna talk about some of the other messiness um well it's really all messy um but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible join over 10 million people using

crazy we you know kind of just went over that but I think what really stuck out at me was the fact that the day before they filed for the bankruptcy Sam tweeted that FTX us was fine um which maybe now it shouldn't have surprised me because obviously a lot of things he said during that period were um false but anyway um I do want to talk about one other thing that kind of happened in that period after binance pulled out of the deal which is that Justin Sons struck some deal for um holders of various different Tron tokens and I wondered maybe this goes into kind of the clawback issue but I wondered what would happen to that are those users good they they got their money and they're out or um you know is this gonna end up being dragged into the bankruptcy too oh boy I I don't even know where to start with the Tron facility I mean obviously I think Justin um wants to protect his own users and wanted to come in you know and and and provide that sort of confidence that the industry would sort of at least help its own ecosystems which is great but when this deal was basically announced in what a two to three hours spent I was I I told myself look there's no lawyers to look at this right clearly it was kind of a handshake deal probably over the phone and nobody's really thought through the repercussions of this nobody's really thought through um how this is going to play out and presumably Sam was very desperate at the point of time presumably he was just picking up the phone calling people give me some emergency liquidity you know maybe if I can get Justin's son to you know uh backstop all the Tron stuff you know give me a one for one for the Tron stuff and then I can maybe call CZ and be like all right um help me out here on on whatever binance tokens might be on there I can start calling all these random people to start bailing out uh you know provide me emergency liquidity that's probably why is that at the point of time right like imagine your entire you're like the Golden Boy of crypto and your entire world's just collapsing around you he's probably not in a very good state of mind and yeah um this Tron facility no idea what it is no idea how it's structured no idea how it's worth it and I I think I get tweeted is it would have been really nice if Justin's son tried to put a something like this in after it went to chapter 11 so that you'll make more sense and be more structured it would you know it wouldn't just add more complication to the whole thing I think that's my take on it I I don't know what it means for clawbacks uh Thomas I mean if you think about it more but my initial reaction is it's clearly like too close to the filing and if there if someone got a better Shake then they would get through the bankruptcy or there was value that was pulled from the bankruptcy or the estate I should say uh it's clearly going to be reversed I mean the whole thing is ridiculous I mean all the stuff leading up to the bankruptcy mean you have to really paper it well and there has to be you know contemporaneous exchange of value and like all papered correctly by real lawyers to be able to to to have it defend even defensible in court to prevent quote-unquote clawbacks I hate this whole clawbacks but I'm now I'm using it Jesus but avoidance you know for the transactions to be avoided all right well a similar incident that happened around the same time was what we were talking about the Bahamian loophole however um I did I was curious because you know a lot of people called out algon trading as one of the accounts that um very explicitly kind of stated what they were doing and how they were going to pay a hundred thousand dollars to anybody who could help them get kyc so they could remove their funds and um you know I didn't get to watch this in real time I kind of pieced it together using screenshots afterwards so hopefully I got the story right but I was wondering what you thought would happen to people like Al got trading and then also anybody who helped people like that you know as wasi mentioned for instance if they were minting nfts that were worth exactly the user balance of you know whatever user they were helping Etc I mean it's I I don't know if it's illegal to to pay someone a large fee to help them do something I won't comment on that but clearly again some like transactions that'll be scrutinized to be Unwound um Wazi brought up a good point which is like when you have customer deposits these are demand deposits look at the terms and conditions and if you look at the very simple defenses to preferences you you you know you have ordinary course of business and also from the 2005 updated the bank U.S bankruptcy code and babsy which is the update you also have uh ordinary business terms you have like two two good decent arguments against preferences for retail clients but this might rise to the level that is a little different it's not in the ordinary course you'd be bribing someone to like help you like nft your way off of The Exchange before you get nfi'd or whatever I'm trying to go with something there but you know what I mean it's a it rises to a new level I don't think I don't think it would rely on the same as you refer to them as affirmative defenses uh for preference there hard to say that's in the ordinary course I think when I saw it I was like look we're just living in the simulation is absolutely ridiculous that someone's buying kyc information and then bribing someone publicly to register that kyc information so we could cash out money and then allegedly went about trying to buy people's deposits on 10 cents on a dollar so you could use the same loophole to cash out money I mean look I mean maybe that's just the best distressed that trade ever right but there's so many things wrong after he after they got Kmart they try to help other quote-unquote help I shouldn't use that word wow yeah anyway and I think yeah the other part that said but but the point but but there is this point has made me very very uncomfortable with the whole clawbacks thing because and I'd like to think back because we're not familiar right with like Voyager and Celsius with voltage in Celsius the terms and conditions sort of state that if you deposit and and we had this discussion last time Laura I think with Adam right about custody and who owns what with uh Voyager and Celsius for the most part for the most part and if you unless you opt into the custody product if you deposit it a Bitcoin into Voyager Celsius you gave them the right to on lend that Bitcoin to generate yield on it to hypothecate it to do stuff with it right because that Bitcoin is no longer yours what you have is a claim against them for one Bitcoin on demand when you want it back what we have according to ftx's terms is something incredibly different which is it specifically states that title doesn't leave the customer which is which sort of implies sort of you know we have the same relationship as if there was a sort of custody arrangement in place where I've given FTX my Bitcoin by not given it giving it they're just scoring it for me and what's happened is when I asked for it back at that point am I just taking back what's mine legally physically possessing it or am I claiming it back as a creditor and they have paid it out to me now if I'm claiming it back as a credit to have to pay it out to me it's a very very clear and fair preference to me very clear but is it like am I playing there's a credit is it maybe not because title never left me but this creates a terrible sort of a sort of moral quandary right because if you call it fallbacks that means that FTX who had breached their own terms and conditions by effectively stealing um converting user funds funds illegally belong to the users to plug their own holes on their own sort of trading firm then do they then get big winners and losers it just doesn't sit right with me no no it's a very good question and you know in Celsius and Voyager everybody was looking at the terms and conditions and how they all changed and changed and changed and in in a weird way like the custody product in in Celsius the custody product itself is likely a preference because it was created 89 days before the petition but let's let's go back to FDX so on FTX I haven't read the terms and conditions uh and what's interesting about bankruptcy law this is like I can actually add some of this conversation is you know it's kind of a conduit for all sorts of different laws all the state laws and so if these contracts are Bahamian uh it's believe it or not the U.S Bank this is why they actually love the U.S Bank for code because it'll actually look through to like okay this was a contractor under Bahamian law I mean maybe it said New York but I don't know because I haven't seen termination but it said Bohemian then they're going to look at whether there's a custodial relationship as you're framing it uh under Bahamian law and it'll be super interesting to see what the court says it kind of throws a wrench into the entire bankruptcy process though because if everybody has quote-unquote title they never gave title to the estate then what assets are in the estate well technically nothing because everybody is not a state property they just said we never gave title we'd like our property back and if that were the case it's kind of weird issues around Equity here because then it doesn't make any sense you can't even be in bankruptcy there's no assets to even administer so I'm not saying that's the wrong determination if the tocs or the terms and conditions say that you've got you never gave title but it would I've seen cases where that is an issue where almost all the stuff is not a state property and the judges have a very sneaky way of saying like uh maybe it is maybe it's not but I'm not going to rule in it right now because if I do basically there's no case for me to hear you know I've got to throw a spanner in the works here it's an English law governed terms and conditions and I discussed this with you know an online space uh gone be good on Twitter um incredible incredible lawyer that abounds ideas off it's more senior than I am and he had some thoughts on this and he said according to the the dogs and these are English law dogs the assets are probably held on trust and therefore legal title may have passed to FTX but the beneficial title in it may not have which means now you're in the Realms of talking about trust law and FTX working on FDX sort of dealing with those assets sort of lending them on to Alameda was a breach of trust potentially fraudulent and what's interesting there is some case law in the UK on on on this very issue from many years ago I'd have to go back and find it but from like 2014 or 15 there was an exchange that went under and there was an issue around like what the terms of conditions who had title was it a custodial relationship or there were these held in trust and actually there was there were two other decisions or I guess one decision they just both look at the same same position in uh cryptopia which was in New Zealand which are very interesting they they in both cases they said that they were held in trust but at the same time I believe they allowed the kind of a state to be administered but I think it does lead to more litigation around the people that were in breach of trust you know the sbfs of the world that yeah were are not following the terms and conditions okay you guys we need we need to we need to just back it up and just make sure because I could I could barely follow I was trying to follow but let me try I mean oh actually what's interesting Laura is what that really technically means is any other creditors are absolutely screwed because all the properties in the estate belongs like held in trust and for the benefit of the customers so the customers are going to come way before any other creditor sorry go ahead mozzie oh sorry Laura I'll try and make it I'll try and sort of explain it like non-lawyer terms with with voyager and and and and Celsius right we had this a lot of arguments around custody because there was this it was sort of PVP between the people who had funds and custody and the people who had funds in the earn and yield products right who will credit this because the guys who had funds in custody on trust will be arguing that this part of the assets need to be ring fans out of the estate okay I remember that right so I'm taking let's say 300 million out and I'm getting one for one dollar because this was always my property it never passed through Voyager and therefore I'm just taking back what's always been mine it's just been in a vault now with um what's happened uh um on FTX imagine if everything was in a vault so everyone's saying my stuff's in a vault but there isn't enough in that Vault because someone's been taking this stuff from The Vault and doing weird stuff with it so like what Thomas was saying what Tom was saying was all right well if everyone says they have their stuff in a vault then there's no estate left like the zero because you've just taken the whole save away there's nothing to fight over anymore and all you're doing is you're then going off the SBF you're saying hey you there's a fraudulent breach of trust or something like that trying to claim that stuff from him so that's sort of the point we're trying to make here around title and around you know custody around Trust but when you said that there were cases like that in the past how did they get resolved like is there there must be some kind of precedent around how to deal with situations like this not in crypto context and in the non-crypto context for instance we were involved in that I think it was a I think it was a catfish uh Co-op and everybody had a pack of claim I'm pretty sure that's that's those effect pattern or maybe it was a uh some sort of processor of something where their Packer claims don't worry about it but basically if you make fresh uh like uh vegetables and things you're supposed to have like a this this pack of claim that stands for something someone can Google it and basically your goods are held in trust so the problem is the processor ran out of money filed for bankruptcy and now you've got all these guys who say oh everything's held in trust or honor and he's like well yeah but then like there's 10 million of you guys saying you're all held in trust there's no estate property how am I going to even sell off the assets to give you anything for health and trust but the one nice thing about it is for instance Voyager is going to have a huge claim against the against the um FDX estate and that'll be subordinated if it's held in trust that's a good way to think about it there's a good example of actual concrete which is if they have a 300 million or even a billion dollar claim against the estate it's going to be subordinated if these if if uh customer deposits are considered held in trust then if they're under English law which is what happened I'm going to get the case and send it to you but I can't remember the UK one but the one in New Zealand was cryptopia and I went over the Supreme Court and wait so when you guys are citing these cases from other countries like what bearing does that have here well the English one and you're saying English law I mean we're probably looking at English trust law yeah so if the documents are saying English law we're looking at English trust and then wait I'm sorry the FTX documents say that English law applies correct English law advice so you've got a company that's Incorporated and operating out the Bahamas with thoughtful chapter 11 in the U.S with terms and conditions that potentially create a trust over customer funds being uh under English law so yes we are looking at Future restrictions here and sort of Australian New Zealand Singaporean I think the Singaporean case uh Kion and b2c2 but let's not go into too much detail here but so all these sort of commonwealth countries and their own rulings on trust would be very very relevant because all of it stamps out of the English law of trust okay okay so now I think we I mean there are like five million different rabbit holes we could go down but let's make sure we hit at least the big ones because another wrench uh to throw in here was of course the hack on Friday night where 600 million dollars worth of tokens were drained out of the exchange you know you know I I happen to be asleep like I don't know why I miss all the fun stuff but during that period telegram posted a message saying FTX has been hacked FTX apps are malware deleted them delete them don't go on the FTX site as it might download Trojans so I was curious like first of all by the way people think it's an inside job which that's also interesting so let's keep it keeping aside who did the hack let's just look at like what happened and how that affects the proceeding well you now have less liquid assets in the estate to distribute right you could try and recover them I'm not sure how successful you're going to be um look I mean when I saw it I'm like this Burning dumpster fire just managed to explode like it it was it was it was absolutely unbelievable like when they filed chapter 11 I genuinely Heath desire relief going finally there's going to be some sanity to this nope suddenly FTX is draining you know has his wallets drained it's ABS become malware that's that's just insane like I genuinely was wondering what I was just asleep and dreaming and some sort of nightmare at that point um but from a legal perspective I don't know I don't know what what can we do it's like all right we just lost the money right we just lost 450 million can we claimed yeah hopefully I know nothing has been proven in this regard but just because this was the profailing theory I do want to ask this question so if it turns out that it was an inside job meaning one of the quote-unquote inner circle that has been reported to have known about the loan from FTX to Alameda um which is SPF himself but also Gary Wang and then um nishad Singh and um Caroline Ellison obviously the CEO of alamedia Alameda so if it was someone you know kind of that already has that love of perhaps level of probability alleged level of culpability then does that affect anything at all or no I mean yeah it's definitely criminal and and I mean but and we would like to say that someone's going to go to jail but I mean I'm a masonic at this point and I'm assuming that they're just gonna disappear for three months go on a holiday to Thailand or Vietnam or somewhere in China or maybe in the Middle East and then when the next big crypto implosion happens they're gonna come back I mean I thought we can trace it just makes it that much harder and it just adds to the expense you know lawyers to help retrieve it even if you bring you know like a multi-jurisdictional you know litigation potentially to recover it and even if you get it back like you know you just have maybe if it gets part of a forfeiture then you'll have to hire lawyers to go up to the forfeiture Thomas makes a very very good point by the way in that you've got to do this sort of risk reward on Equity recovering the assets right like if you have no idea who's going to who what what has happened and then you go and spend five mil on a sort of on a firm to help you investigations firm to help figure out what happened they find out they bill you five mil you're paying the five out of the bankruptcy estate and then you have to go find lawyers in the specific jurisdictions try and freeze those assets debt money is coming out the bankruptcy estate you know you could basically go on this this this sort of wild goose chase and all the way at the end oh tough luck he's just run off with a with a wallet Hardware wallet we can't do anything anymore and you just thrown 20 million dollars trying to track down assets so there is a sort of risk reward calculation there whether you even I would like to pick that one's big enough to try to go after but yeah I hear you no no it's a real thing I mean even when you talk about preferences let's talk about the back door like risk reward on Bahamian I mean even if someone pulls off a few million dollars like you're gonna have to prove it with facts I mean these are facts intensive questions as my attorney would tell me when he doesn't want to answer one of my questions but he's not he's not he's not wrong uh Ozzy knows what I mean uh but he's not wrong it's sort of yeah I know exactly what do you mean so you have to like pick and choose your battles on some of the stuff because it is a dollar against this game you're trying to get the best recovery for creditors you're not like there's no vendettas and hopefully uh that's how the state will be pursued I'm sure it will be but um it's just something to keep in mind people like oh why aren't they doing this why are they doing that they're like but what's the point like that guy doesn't have anything to go after anyway and you know it's anyway and the jurisdiction isn't great and it's a small amount of money so there will be people that hey they got money off the back door and they'll be like oh my gosh it's amazing I got 200 off and I got made 100 recovery and it's like is it really worth the estate's time to like go after that person probably not exactly exactly exactly yeah if you're withdrawn five thousand dollars and someone sends you a letter saying hey our records are that you have clawed back some money oh sorry you've taken some money out we want to call it back and assuming obviously it's not legal advice you maybe should comply if you want to be completely you know on the up and up but if you didn't comply what what are you gonna do it's gonna cost them a lot more money to come in and try and get that rested five thousand dollars from you but it's just like my my take on it it's a completely risk reward thing because the the whole point is to maximize recoverability right right I just think 600 million dollars is a very different situation that's a very different situation yes absolutely we're hoping we're absolutely hoping that we'll be able to recover the 600 million dollars yes that would be ideal and it would be negligence I feel to not try and figure out if you could try and get the 600 billion dollars back right okay yeah because when you made that example I was like wait I I think this is a different situation um okay but speaking again of oh my God there's so much craziness so the deployer contract on for Ft ftt tokens created 192 million new tokens on Saturday that was worth 380 million dollars and a binance had to call that out and say it was halting deposits of ftt to the platform how does that affect things I mean they're me are they just worthless or I don't even know how they had that value but anyway what is your take on how this affects things with the token stuff I don't even know anymore like honestly like the token stuff just adds a whole new level of complication um into everything first of all like you said how much is ftt even worth now right because the fundamental value of ftt when you think about it is that well the exchange is going to operate and they're gonna buy it back from you um therefore increasing its price but it's not operating anymore so what's the value of ftt probably Market down to zero right so I I'm not sure how that plays out the serum stuff is a lot more interesting though this depends on ftt there's a really open question around when you strike the claim does It Strike to the petition date or not and so like people with do they get that even though the assets not there do they get the liability as a claim but anyway but it's an open question we don't honestly don't know Celsius is going to have the same issue wait and I'm sorry what is that to strike uh something daily okay so like if let's if I have a hundred thousand dollars of ftt do I have a claim for 100 000 fpt or do I have a uh y'all talk y'all spoke about last time we were talking about Celsius or do I have a hundred thousand dollar claim because at the time of the petition like when they first filed the bankruptcy petition uh the claim is struck and that matters because if I own ftt I'm like I'd really like the petition they value and if I'm a creditor I'm like no no you are in you know uh you know a poo poo coin I won't use the S word and so you you know you got nothing or you know we're gonna treat it differently so there are some issues around that I definitely think it's probably going to be struck at the petition date but it is a little a little hairy for the people that own ftt and the same thing with Celsius but but go on to I like I wanted to talk about the subject of the moving of the manager or moving up the chain and uh with serum so yeah but but wait it's just one thing that I wanted to say about the petition date issue is that it strikes me that so with Mount gox it's it's you know to tell me if I'm wrong but it seems that the petition date is what was used to determine what creditors would receive and so it's sort of one of those things where in different cases people might want the petition date and for others they might not which is just funny because it really just depends on you know which coin they had but frankly I personally think it's better if you just get your asset back well if it's all in Trust it depends I mean if your assets woof hey if it's held in trust you don't get a choice I can return you your property I never had title uh but if it but if it's not held in trust in your journaling to your credit or something I'm just saying you know the legal arguments cut both ways so you know the guys that have FTP if it's all held in treasurements law and Trust law then they're they're yeah oh oh well let me just give you your property back now you're made whole see you later they're like yeah I made hope but now it's a zero you're like I gave you a property and gave your phone back what you wanted yeah I think in terms of sort of legal ambiguity and questions this this FTX elementa sort of bankruptcy is a lot more complex than three AC and Voyager and Celsius put together you've got the same very you've got very similar questions but you also have some a very very different factual Matrix that that complicate things even more like I mean the only thing that even comes close is to be honest is Tara like you know I think Terror creates a lot of problems as well from a legal perspective but we're not talking about it now okay well we'll move on to serum because yeah this was yet another I mean just this this is just quite the Saga I mean it just kept going um I I just feel like I've barely slept for over a week so okay the serum project uh I believe it was Saturday um they Forks because apparently someone at FTX had some admin key that enabled updates but obviously there was nobody there or maybe whoever we had that might have you know deployed malicious code or something on the project so they forked it I don't know what that means for the people who held serum on the exchange uh what do you think I'm gonna go on the offensive and ask Thomas first views because I have no freaking clue I mean I have my thoughts but it's almost you could go first so there have been cases where the GP has filed for insolvency and the lp had the LPS have decided to move the the manager and and that's been decently allowed sometimes the states have tried to fight it so that's what I would I would characterize it the question in that way Ozzy any thoughts here I mean is that I mean it's different it's crypto right but wait so so did so talk a little bit more about what that means when you say that so then what does that mean so then the creditors what they can put a claim on those forked serum tokens where they can't or what what just plain explain it in non-lawyer terms so like okay if you have a non-debtter would as a management agreement with a debtor but as part of the non-deter they're allowed under their contract to change who the manager is that's kind of allowed you know I mean we were like paraphrasing things that are very can get quite technical because it really depends on what the agreements say but if they're allowed in their contract to do that and so in this instance if the governance token I don't know exactly how certain works but if the governance token or someone who controls the governance function is a kind of allowed to do it and it doesn't affect it's going to be a question of whether it's a breach of the automatic stay or not for someone to Fork I guess the kind of the the chain but Wazi do you have another way of describing this yeah yeah I've thought about this this a lot actually so I thought about this in life after Terra Luna when they fought in the chain to basically in my head right as a restructuring lawyer to basically fault the chain to as as what looked like Equity holders to sort of Shed off the debt and start all over again and I I asked this question I went you know is how does this even work but obviously that wasn't like properly challenged and then when three AC went down I actually thought about this again going wait a minute three AC had a ton of lunar tokens as a thought experiment is it possible for Luna to Fork again and just take out three AC tokens just be like all right we just deleted all the tokens on the new chain right and and now we see now now stop became stops becoming a thought experiment because it's actually happening with with theorem where there's sort of flocking and potentially taking value away from the tokens on the old chain so with the way out the way I'm thinking about it is that let's say you've got a company let's say you've got like a fast food joint that sort of caught into insolvency but the very next day your employees or part of the management team Rock up next door open up exactly the same fast food joint call it fast food joint 2.0 and start running it the same way how does that play out I'm not sure because they're taking value out of the estate right because they're taking because what's valuable about those tokens is that there's an ecosystem around it that's a use case for it there are developers sporting it there are users on the network if you simply just clone it move all the users away move all the developers away and drain that token of value as you say is it is it is it a breach of your I don't know that it is wait and wait I I just I just need to clarify a fact here so are you saying that when they forked it that they removed all of like whatever serum was held on FTX or just whatever amount FTX owned as like part of its I guess maybe like a venture investment or something because they're so so presumably FTX had two types of serum right the the whatever it received from being involved with the project and then whatever like customers held on it so there's kind of two different types of serum that could potentially be affected here so let's let's talk about the two if you're a customer that with serum tokens on FTX how will this affect you does this mean like like you still can claim a value on those uh serum tokens or or not let's just start with the customers well Ozzy do you know how you interpret the customers are affected ah a I'm gonna just think about it um photo like I honestly can't have a good day you would get the fork too if you're if you own the original no I'm I'm not the whole you would you get the foxing but you're not getting it but in this it's hacked right it's a hacked serum so defaulted oh wait I'm sorry I thought in that tweet thread that it was a a developer absolutely I have to look at the Tweets in a little bit more detail I thought the news was that they were basically kind of like forking it to deal with the fact that like FDX wasn't gonna be able to perform and they were just gonna like kind of move the community over that's happened some and and there are some bankruptcy cases I mean at least the ones that I've been involved with that's happened there's an asset management firm where all the guys basically left and set up shops across the street like in like a lot of these examples I mean they were asset management firm and there was nothing to preclude them there were no non-competes and they just got up and set up shop next door and it wasn't a breach of the automatic stay the same thing when we had there was a Ponzi scheme case we were involved in that had Real Estate Investors and the LPS were allowed it should be limited partners in the real estate deal were allowed to change the the manager the general partner manager and that wasn't a breach even though I think the trustee did try to fight it because of course it severely you know caught the value stream because they were going to lose the like two percent management fee or whatever they were going to get plus uh I mean they were still entitled some other things but I thought that was the news I I didn't maybe I misunderstood um what they were trying to do with the fork yeah and by the way yeah it was a Community member so which is totally fine it's you know they're it's a it was saying it's a Dao or something so okay but then so this actually maybe is a good segue to the other thing I wanted to ask about which was obviously there's 250 startups or you know different token projects that received funds from FTX Ventures so what happens to the equity or tokens that FTX Ventures owns I did see so Chris McCoy some of you might know on Twitter um I think he does something called store coin or something like that uh he's been suggesting that these projects buy back their Equity or token so customers can get their money back and then the practice get to remove FTX from their cap table miles Jennings of a16c basically thought this just did not make sense because it contradicts everything about uh existing law but what do you guys think of that suggestion I I agree that you can't just unilaterally delete tokens or unilaterally delete the equity you have given out presumably a lot of these are done by safes or safs so you can't do it that's a clear breach of the automatic State that's an easy answer no no but he's saying that they um buy back not delete he's saying like that's fine but these things property and so the estate has rights and if you want to buy it back you can engage the estate to buy it back so like one of the I was hoping we would end on a nice point which is like what are the recovery like Pathways for creditors and one of the biggest ones this big portfolio Venture deals and look some of them could end up over a very long period of time leading to decent recoveries and I was giving the com disco one we were talking offline and there's uh cmgi or whatever these were two like.com bus that is part of their business they had a big Venture arm and a venture arm over like a very long period 10-year period ended up making the Estates entirely solvent of course it took 10 plus years for that to happen but that's another here or there uh well no I mean it could be very relevant here it could be very relevant no no this is a silver lining yeah because this this could take 10 years am I wrong or how long do you think it could take it could take yeah it could take 10 years it could take six months depends on what deal you end up with right yeah I mean I guess you could you could you could have someone come in and like come up with some restructuring plan but even if you you do that unless you sell the Venture portfolio in one fast swoop which I don't think is likely I think the unwinding of that will take many many years but if someone wanted to buy back their the tokens or the equity they gave they'd have to buy it back at whatever the market price was you know and then the estate would have to engage with them say like we want to sell it versus holding on to it I'm actually just flipping over it's a destructive chart looking at it right now the FTX Venture arm is actually validity ring fenced away from FTX trading limited it's owned by this company called paper bird Incorporated and the way it's linked to Alameda is there is an intercompany loan agreement between paper bird and Alameda research so that's sort of how as The fda's Ventures is sort of linked to this entire show so what does that mean since Alameda clearly is probably I don't know if like more insolvent is even a phrase but um yeah it's basically just a battle it's just basically just a matter of unwinding all of these transactions to sort of see where we end up the the money is going to have to flow through to the intercompany loan I mean it's an inner company loan an intercompany loan yeah yeah the intercompany loans out of pipes yeah so so these intercomplete loans are basically the pipes by which Sam and and well FTX Alameda was sort of funneling funds around so when when we now now that we've sort of Frozen everything we're gonna start well if we're in the liquidation scenario we're going to start unwinding everything and sort of see where we end up right because let's say um this paper bird Incorporated olds Alameda money um assuming is the case right let's say um they've borrowed money from Alameda to make their Venture Investments then Alameda calls back this loan from paper bird to do that paper bird has to go through subsidiaries to liquidate its Venture Holdings in order to Upstream proceeds into paper bird to then pay down Alameda Alameda then also come in the company loan to FTX Trading it will then sort of take the proceeds it's recovered from paper bird and sort of pay down its loan to FDX trading it's basically we're basically just unwinding all these transactions at this point okay so another solution which actually was seeing you tweeted um it was you and I saw Zane Tackett the head of institutional institutional sales maybe at FTX he used to work at bitfinex at the time that it was hacked and they ended up issuing a token that actually worked it did eventually you know make customers whole there and you tweeted a similar suggestion and I was curious first of all actually why don't you describe how this would work and then talk about like how this is similar to the bitfinex situation where where it's different like yeah just give the odds of You Know How likely this is to pan out or to happen and pan out okay I mean to some extent it's basically a sort of a modified debt to equity swap which sort of practitioners in the space would be quite familiar with except we've sort of adapted it but it took for the crypto space so it's not a debt to token swap so what we're basically looking at uh sorry the chapter 11 you've got all your assets Frozen right and now you're looking at a plan to potentially maximize Revenue potentially maximize recovery to creditors so what we have here are broadly um but you know I said there are three groups it's the FTX U.S group there's FTX International Group and this is the Alameda group The Alameda group is the sort of the sort of trading arm which has lost a crap ton of money which is why it had to borrow money from FTX International and that's why it tipped FTX International into insolvency as well when you couldn't make money to to pay it on the bank run so that the thinking is this right you've got a bunch of customers who have money stuck in FDX International and FTX International cannot pay back these customers right now so what you could do is you plug that you plug that hole in the after-backs international balance sheet and issue customers recovery tokens which will over time depending on how you structure it what you do this next style you make it look a little bit more like equity it basically turns FTX International sort of to solvent again balance sheet solvent again because you've got all those liabilities these are now sort of assets on uh um yeah you've got rid of those libraries or you've deferred them even depending on how you've done it and it's it it came to me sort of in the middle of the night because I thought wouldn't it be an incredible comeback story if you know one of the best exchanges in the world was run so fraudulently and run in such a horrible Manner and then at the end of the day you have that to actually stop and you turn into essentially a decentralized uh ownership but centralized exchange that's run by the community for the community which is by trade for you know buy Traders for Traders which was the FTX slogan so I thought that was that was quite that was quite an interesting idea just to kind of distinguish it from the ftt token which many people you know are aware was part of the demise or you know was part of the cause of the demise of FTX the difference here would be that it wouldn't be something kind of like more centralized but basically a community-owned token like like hopefully more properly decentralized is that kind of what the difference would be what's ironic is that that was part of the reason that FTX went under but now you're saying a solution would be for FTX to have a token so I'm trying to explain what why this would be better and not okay so so let me sort of let me sort of is that sort of um explained from a study or take maybe uh three to five minutes I'll go into it in some some not too much detail some level of detail and I've sort of gone through this in my tread a little bit but I'm assuming not all of your viewers have sort of read it so I'll sort of just you know run through it quite quickly so according to to Zayn as you say we have about you know eight billion of liabilities uh 900 million of liquid assets you mentioned this earlier you have got uh you know the semi-liquid assets and the illiquid assets that you were talking about earlier including you know Trump Toulouse 2024. what we what we're looking at here is that there is a hole in the balance sheet by a hole in the balance sheet means that there are more liabilities than our assets right now therefore rendering this company in solvent and incapable of operating let's let's just assume okay we've also lost 450 million dollars right to the to the hack so let's just assume Sammy worst case there I'm hoping it's more than three billion dollars but let's say there is a three billion dollar hole in the balance sheet that needs to be fixed some way or other right now we're in the chapter 11 now and the good thing about chapter 11 is you can sort of pick and choose out assets and liabilities which you otherwise would not be able to do outside of chapter 11 because you've got all the it's what you call a clean buy you're able to sort of have a court sanctioned you know transaction that sort of releases you from any potential liabilities um sort of a quick exact way this is why we we really didn't think a binance deal outside of the chapter 11 is going to work because if CZ bought FTX crazy was the deal with the burning dumps the fire while it's still on fire whereas in this chapter 11 you you can sort of put out the fire and sort of pick through the ashes and see like what pieces of it is still savable what's not savable what you leave and then what you don't live in there so the chapter 11 is actually a really good thing because now you can start uh in this case at least chapter 11 is a good thing because you can go in there and sort of pick pick up bits and pieces that you want so this proposal assumes that CZ isn't going to save us Justin sun isn't going to save us we're gonna have to do it all on our own there's no money there's no money coming in right so what is valuable in FTX right now in the FDX group what's valuable is you have quote-unquote customer Goodwill the users user days and crypto well at least a few months ago was very very valuable so you've got your user base which means you have to assume the liabilities right because you can't come over and exchange by the way you're worth zero so you have to assume the liabilities but what else do you have you have got potentially good assets in there you know potentially there's some assets that are liquid or assets that you consider the cash potentially good assets and that you could take with you um this potentially uh the the trading engine the FTX engine the FTX I mean the brand is worthless now but everything that made it work the structures the know-how so and so forth there's something that's valuable you can take it with you assuming that you're allowed to take the licenses you could take the licenses with you and uh the licenses sort of make your life a lot easier because otherwise if you rent your own exchange you're gonna have to apply for licenses all over the world FTX already has some of those especially those in the US which I assume are going to be quite valuable now now you've taken all of that out and now now you've got all of those good assets and you've got those customer liabilities you take it all out you put it in a new company right so now what you have is you've got you could you have the capacity to run FTX 2.0 you could run an exchange that has really good UI ux really good trading engines stuff that people like with the licenses potentially with the sort of I'm not sure if you can still get the banking facilities of it you get all that good stuff but you also have a ton of customer liabilities which you cannot currently meet you know because you just you just love the liquidity what you do now is you basically try and you offer the um customers a swap on their debt right instead of um the so so so the the sort of scenario I I used was let's say uh you have taken all the liabilities and libraries this is eight billion dollars right and let's say you've only got four billion dollars for assets Left Right four billion dollars of assets some of it is Trump to lose 2024 so it's not like you can immediately turn that into cash to meet withdrawals um forever so what so so what so what so what are you gonna do so what you could do is say all right I'm I've got eight billion in liabilities I've got four billion in assets including some very illiquid assets that's fine I'm gonna swap 50 of my liabilities into targets right so if if you had a hundred thousand dollars on FTX you now have fifty thousand dollars which you can use you can you can withdraw you can do whatever the hell you want with it especially that you can trade with it fifty thousand dollars the other fifty thousand dollars gets converted into a token and and I've sort of called them FTX recovery tokens FTR if you will now what FTR is meant to give you and at least in the the this sort of initial pitch I had this there's probably other ways of structuring but to keep it quite simple what FTR could do is it gives you a it gives you a percentage of the trading revenues of the new exchange now we're assuming this new exchange works right the Assumption here is that a new exchange is born we use you know employees that are competent we have a competent management team people still want to train on it because it's a decentralized old ship owned by the community but centralized exchange with transparency and people still want to use it right if people still use it it's going to generate fees it's going to generate cash flows and you can over time use the cash flows from running this exchange to pay back your users the people who hold ft recovery tokens yeah this is super similar to the bfx Token back in the day yeah so the exactly and no and because there are tokens you can you would then sort of have a market for them either officially or unofficially right where you know if I I don't price this I I want to get out of this at you know 20 cents a dollar fine you can get out all I want to hold on to it maybe over time the value of an FTR token will be a lot higher as the exchange sort of ramps up in value so that creates a sort of liquidity as well for someone who's holding 50 grand in cash on the exchange and 50 Grand in FDR tokens you could be I don't want this giving you 20 grand and I'll give you my FDR tokens so that sort of takes you to a point where your balance is solvent because now you're forbidden assets forbidden liabilities right I go into a bit more detail in in my uh tweet uh maybe you can sort of maybe you can share it or something but yeah we'll put it initial notes yeah so essentially to sort of make those eLiquid assets a bit more liquid and sort of talking about how you could do governance structures around it but I don't want to take up the rest of this this the show well one thing that I did want to add was that I don't know how closely you looked at the structure of the bfx token but if I remember correctly so because there was a market you could like you said just be like I'm just going to take my 20 cents on the dollar like I'm happy with that but the other thing is that you could actually cash it in for equity in the company yes um yeah and then um the last bit was yeah you could just hold on to it and wait um to see if the value of it would rise so it would be like one to one but yeah that you know these are all kind of really interesting things that happen back then and you're right I mean it worked for bitfinex so no just to add from the US Bank through perspective many times you'll have either a company sold or restructured but then you have two other pockets of recovery ones maybe like a liquidation trust with some special assets in it and sometimes also in addition or as part of of a litigation trust and so sometimes you'll get units in these things and so what's nice about tokenization this is right for disruption from crypto is uh you know these probably things probably should be tokenized and so you could swap up whatever you want so you want to keep the litigation trust but you want to sell the Venture portfolio but you want to keep the equity in the new Co so if you have probably three tokens I thought that was the way that wozzi was kind of pitching it or I don't know if you were but I'll add to it that if you you know people can pick and choose their poison I think that's I think that's brilliant poison you want it you want to own the Venture but you don't want to own the equity or you don't really want to own litigation because that's not really your thing but you want to be longitude crypto thing so the Venture portfolio plus the equity the new Co so that's the fun part about crypto I mean and there's exceptions for security offerings under 11 45 of the bankruptcy code I mean there are some limitations to it but for the most part you should be able to issue Equity um again that's good flexibility of the US bankruptcy code I'm just going to keep saying good things about you thank you good I I really I really I really like the thought actually Thomas actually really wasn't thinking about literally carving up to that level but that would be very interesting if we did end up carving in adventure portfolio of 1.5 billion dollars put in it I mean you could talk a night yeah you could tokenize the vegetative portfolio the Alameda bet that you know yeah bits and pieces of it there's a lot of ways to cover it it's interesting actually I'll be really really Keen to actually see this play out I mean I think it may be unlikely because what um I mean presumably someone's gonna have to like step up and try and bleed or run this whole thing yeah well that's what I was going to say so like these ideas are floating out there but for any of them to actually be implemented then how would that happen like what is the process to try to make that happen if for any listeners who are so inclined you need credit to support essentially you need uh support from the from the customers because that's kind of what this kind of how a chapter 11 plan works right you need I think it's a two-third majority in in at least one class of creditors in order to approve a plan so you definitely need credit to customer support for it I mean I sort of thought that plan up you know in the span of like two hours but I and there's a lot of better things you could do with it like you know as Thomas and stuff just improved the plan sort of on the show right here yeah you need customer support and I've got I've really got DMS of people going this is great you know I've got eight figures I've got I've got eight figures I know people with nine figures and FTX how do we do it etc etc maybe maybe it happens I don't know but we kind of have to wait I think we have to wait a bit for the uh for more documents and more information to come out on FTX on on the status of all the entities and what's possible totally and then to add to that it's yeah clearly it's about creditor support um the other thing is and you mentioned it way way earlier in the show Ozzy is you have the exclusivity period for the debtor that means if it's a debtor in possession assuming there's no I mean usually it's in the case of whether there's there's no there's no fraud like actual fraud traditionally and there'd still be breaches of trust you know you were moving around money you shouldn't have but you didn't just like scond with money then you'll be a debtor in possession case and therefore the debtor generally gets 120 days exclusive period after the petition date to file their own plan and so my point of sharing that is they sort of Drive the Bus he saw this with voyager and Celsius so in Voyager the Steve gentleman sort of quickly stepped to the side and was like let's just either do a uh debt for Equity swap or and they have like toggle plans so you have two two plans going at once but he said let's do a plan where everyone gets the equity of the company and we'll also Market the company to see if someone will buy us but in Celsius you saw a lot more pushback basically because a guy driving the bus there probably other people in addition to machine ski but Alex machinski was hey I want to try to hold on My Equity let's do like a new token we're gonna call it Phoenix or whatever the hell we're going to call it and you know there was a bit more back and forth because he was trying to remain in control and he thought hey maybe the mining assets is worth a lot and I can give that to creditors and the mining is going to save us all so so you see different things um being proposed because the debtor has so much control in this case I don't know how SPF maybe he's I guess he's he's left now but who actually drives the bus and what their agenda is and how they view uh these things because they do drive it all yes creditors have a lot of input at the end of the day creditors vote on it um but it's kind of like you know you vote but you know the guy given the sermon is the priest and so a lot of people listen to him you know so it's like the guys are driving the bus the chief restructuring officer or the executive decisions um are going to make a difference in the way these cases go it'll be super interesting watch how Critters come out and I would love to see a tokenization whether there's a new car you just liquidate and everybody I would love to see that I think it's the right thing to do I think it's it's also kind of like a crypto solution for a crypto problem which is we we got into these C5 problems you know I'm gonna sort of dig ourselves out and I I love the idea yeah I think it's sort of us clean your own house right well there's no Central Bank coming you know yeah so it's good that you brought up Voyager because they did want to ask about how this affects some of the other bankruptcies since Voyager obviously was had this deal with um FTX and I think they were buying the debt or I forget what the phrasing is but so describe what their relationship was um up until this week and then how all these events will affect that so there was a plan in place for FTX to acquire the liabilities of Voyager customers and Voyager customers would get about 72 cents on a dollar I think ftas are sort of paying another 100 million dollars on top of that or something that that plan was sort of approved to go to the credit to vote sort of creditors were going to vote on it I believe the latest news is that obviously the deal is no longer on the table and Voyager is now considering other plans I'm not sure if you've heard otherwise but it's an interesting thoughts here so if you all remember SPF had lent some money to them and then he subordinated as part of the plan but that's clearly off so the creditors are going to not want to subordinate so that sucks for Voyager but at the same time Voyage is going to have a pretty substantial cause of action to offset that probably that debt probably against the uh uh the state of FTX right because he doesn't breach of contract I mean he was supposed to close he was supposed to wasn't that wasn't there some sort of loans flowing from Voyager to to alamitas I'm sure there was I recall there were some loans flowing between them as well so presumably are wondering whether you could even yeah I don't know I'm not sure you can net it if it's not the netting is going to be interesting I'm not sure if you're going to be able to do counter claims or you can net but then the other thing is Wazi if you're right and that just means that the two cancel each other out yes correct that's right yeah it'd be like uh you know I owe you a hundred dollars but you know you'd I paid you 50 some other time and so we net that or something I don't know so so you net the counter your claims against each other but the Wazi if they're all held in trust and you've got to claim exactly what I was going to say I know I know I still almost do your thunder say it wait explain explain it explain it people like me don't know what you're talking about all right all right all right so so think of it this way right nothing is me it means like let's say I owe you a hundred dollars and and you owe me a hundred dollars so you know we're just gonna call it zero right we just set off against each other the thing is if you the thing is if all my all the assets are held on trust which means that my estate is of zero and you can't net you can't net I'm claiming 100 from you anyway so tough luck did I did I explain that wrongly well like because the the um customers on FTX might actually just own might might just be able to get their assets back quote unquote one to one or whatever the ratio will be I'll tell them trust you can't sort of like go into the trust yeah because you'd have a claim but your claim would be an unsecured claim you know it's an unsecured General and secured creditor claim you wouldn't be honestly property via this trust uh English law Trust um distinction yeah the Voyager customers are non-secured creditors but then the FTX people um their customers there potentially on potentially interest yes you know what I'm saying is that their their lawsuit against the FTX estate and Sam would be a general unsecured claim and now when you go into that docket the FDX docket what do we say we said that well all properties actually held in trust so you've got to claim the problem is you're behind all this trust property that can't be paid back so all that trust property bucket can't be filled so you're definitely not getting anything on your general unsecute claim against the estate yep right right so then they wouldn't cancel each other out yeah they would not cancel each other out so then basically FTX customers are going to be in a better position than the Voyager customers I mean y'all these are all very fact intensive questions yeah this is all very fact sensitive questions but that that that potentially is a world where you know Voyager the Voyager estate pays out money to the STX estate without getting anything back thus making it worse for the Voyager customers but theoretically better it could very well be because of course remember he subordinated that debt and he didn't have to do that that was I mean you know that I'm not sure what the debt was wasn't like 75 million dollars or something something like that yeah something like that I think their claim against the estate is going to be more than you're talking about Stephen Aaron like this the foreigntyx whichever India was they subordinated their claim to customer account claims I don't remember he was like all high and mighty oh you know we want customers first and we're going to subordinate the 75 million dollar check we wrote uh so that's off I mean the creditors don't didn't agree to that and I'm not sure that it'll be bound to the the plan's not gonna be approved so then that's now back to being explained yeah um so sort of to to yeah to sort of explain that um all together again I think I think what Tom saying to sort of to sort of remind everybody um when Voyager went down Alameda landed 75 million to Voyager and then Sam was all high and mighty going oh you know all this don't worry about the 75 billion dollars you'll pay all the customers back first so forget about the Alameda 75 million dollars all right it's cool don't worry about it right and the thing is now that the plan is gone and Sam is out of the picture and the role of the sort of the the guy is running FTX now is to maximize the size of the bankruptcy estate you may not be you're probably not bound to agree to subordinate your 75 million dollar claim to the Voyager customers so now you're putting a claim in there as well for the 75 million dollars back well the subordination was part of a plan that's not going to be approved now the bankruptcy plan is off correct right right the one with voyager between Alameda and Voyager right okay last bit now to talk about is block fi it was a similar situation with lock Phi where they struck some deal with FTX can you explain what their relationship was before all the events of last week I I don't I I he bought it I don't know was he what did it what was the relationship I believe that the relationship was that um block fight was running to some liquidity issues and then FTX or other media FTX us apparently provided a 400 million dollar revolving credit facility correctly the numbers are wrong but it sounds about right which would allow a block file to continue its operations um when the news came out everyone was very worried about block five because hey you guys borrowed money from FTX and they may start recalling their loans and if they pull their loans how are you going to service your own customers block fire you uh Sam came all the time saying FTX us is fine everything is backed one to one blah blah blah and then block five came out saying don't worry our counterparty was FTX U.S it wasn't the Alameda FTX International  show so we're good a day later this is withdrawals saying well so um I'm not 100 obviously we haven't seen the loan documentation it could well be the case that that they genuinely were Contracting with FTX us but maybe there's a guarantee coming in from somewhere else maybe the yeah maybe there was sort of other borrowers in the structure we don't know but it looks like contagion is already happening it's already starting and I'll be very interested to see um how this plays out over time I think block file is more certainly in a whole world of trouble um there will be other guys because they have to file a meeting yeah really well Thomas is very direct about it but yeah well I mean FTX us since FTX he was filed for bankruptcy that would make sense because you know block five is 400 million probably in a bit of trouble we'll be I'm very very interested to see the documents that Alameda FTX file because you recall a call it's also ironic now right that's samples going around saying oh there's a lot of exchanges and platforms just secretly insolvent and you record a period where he was walking around saying that he wanted to be the JP Morgan of the crypto World bailing people out left and right Etc well if you got a bailout from Sam or Alameda you're probably yourself right now because like because you've just delayed it inevitable right let's say you've taken money let's say you've taken money from FTX International Alameda ftcs whatever you have taken money from them they have gone up to chapter 11 which means that they are going to be pulling all of those loans all that financing they're giving to you which were there because you needed to pluck a gap in the first place which means you just ripped off the Band-Aid and the wound is still gushing so we know some people right we so block five is obviously one of those um we don't know who else has been affected we don't know who Sam has been handing out loans to um that I mean some I mean people are saying that's very credible Theory going around that Sam did some of these bailouts because he needed to stop them from liquidating the FTP collateral I think there could be some licks to that uh to to that theory um but but we don't know the things we don't know what Sam has been doing behind the scenes and if you look at the Fallout from Terra you look at the Fallout from 3ac people tend to keep very very very quiet about their finances saying everything is fine if you tell us that we are in solvent we're going to sue you for defamation blah blah blah until they actually file for insolvency so it'd be interesting to see what happens what comes out all right you guys this has been a mammoth episode um is there anything that we didn't cover that you think listeners should know about I really think that the over a very long period of time it's possible The Venture portfolio leads to okay recoveries I got us in in the causes of action here are going to be absolutely astonishingly amazing they're gone for a decade but we covered that yeah I think I could go on for a very very long time um like Thomas's Venture portfolio could well bail everyone out who knows right everything goes to the moon in the next three Cycles um before this is all over and and suddenly um FTX is incredibly solvent and everyone gets made all the time which is why it also quite makes sense if you then tokenize bits and pieces of it it'll be very very uh I'm really hoping we end up with some sort of crypto native solution to uh yeah to this problem because the problem if you ask me has never been it's it's not really about a centralized Exchange it's simply the fact that Central's exchange was being run in this irresponsible and honestly rather fraudulent manner we still need centralized exchanges if you ask me I mean maybe I'm a bit more of a you know part five Boomer lawyer web 2 lawyer whatever but I mean at the end of the day if you want if you want sort of mainstream adoption it's it's a lot easier for someone to say hey this is the point where I go in connect my bank account buy some crypto and so on right not everyone's going to self-custody they should and over time as they I mean that was almost my own journey into it right when a lot of people you come to crypto the first thing you do you go and buy crypto on an exchange like binance like FTX over time you get involved in the more you know d-gen stuff and you go all right you know what I need my own uh meta muscle I can go on uni Swap and swap out and buy some coins and so on so forth right um but it's it's still helpful to centralize exchanges if you ask me they need to be run in a manner that's a lot more transparent or more compliant I think CZ is sort of really starting to lead the way in that um it'll be I I think for all the good is doing I still think you don't think it's a good thing to have like one exchange dominating literally all of the market share um so yeah it would be really cool to see a centralized exchange that's being run in a decentralized manner yeah and and so but the last kind of like um takeaway for anybody who has funds on FTX would be or FTX U.S or really any um entity involence would be that if the community somehow manages to go this token route or Community Dow based route then they could presumably kind of resolve it much more quickly and get access to at least some of their funds much more quickly is that the upshot yes that yeah that is the option but the community you probably need to organize I don't know maybe if you have eight nine figures you want to do this uh DM me or Thomas or Laura we'll put something together yeah um but for everyone else because I know everyone else is very very worried about this like what do I do do I have to sue someone or should I lawyer up can you be my lawyer I've had a lot of these DMS if you've got a look it's very it's terrible and I know it's like life-changing money to a lot of people it's an absolute complete tragedy um in the space but they're really I would say don't waste your money lawyering up unless you have like you know eight nine tickets on there because at this point there really isn't much you can do just kind of like wait for the process to play out when if for instance the community does rally and there is uh that there is a push to to run this sort of restructuring plan you will have a chance to sort of come on board if there isn't and you know it goes straight to liquidation you will have a chance to vote you will have a chance to prove for your debt and so on so forth but like I mean it sucks but right now you kind of have to wait for the process to play out a bit if you're a bit bigger obviously you can you know see you can do something else okay all right well you guys this has been uh a jam-packed episode um there was just so much to go through all right well thank you both so much where can people learn more about each of you and your work oh well you can follow me on Twitter at Rossi lawyer I tweet the most when  really hits the fan and things start going bankrupt when that isn't the case I tweet random stuff about a hentai anime penguin project which most people probably don't care about Thomas I'm on Twitter you can just look up Thomas Brazil Perfect all right well it's been a pleasure having you both on
